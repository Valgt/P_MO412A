                  Achieving sustainable development goals demands an unprecedented change in the global economic structure and a transformation of the traditional energy system. Based on the sustainability agenda, the current study's main aim is to investigate the trends in sustainability, measured through ecological footprints as determined by the energy transition, energy patents, natural resources, and non-renewable energy in the European Union members during 1998–2019. Cross-sectional-autoregressive-distributed lag approach has been applied to investigate both long-run and short-run relationships between the variables. The initial findings confirm the presence of cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity in the slope coefficients, stationarity properties, and panel cointegration, respectively. The empirical results further ensure that energy transition and patents work for environmental sustainability in reducing ecological footprints in the long run. Contrarily, non-renewable energy and natural resources adversely impact the sustainability agenda while increasing the ecological footprints both in the long and short run. Moreover, the results are consistent with the robustness check through the Augmented Mean Group and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimators. The study suggests that the European Union members continue to promote the transition from non-renewable energy to clean energy sources to empower the sustainability plans determined by United Nations.

Achieving sustainable development goals demands an unprecedented change in the global economic structure and a transformation of the traditional energy system. Based on the sustainability agenda, the current study's main aim is to investigate the trends in sustainability, measured through ecological footprints as determined by the energy transition, energy patents, natural resources, and non-renewable energy in the European Union members during 1998–2019. Cross-sectional-autoregressive-distributed lag approach has been applied to investigate both long-run and short-run relationships between the variables. The initial findings confirm the presence of cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity in the slope coefficients, stationarity properties, and panel cointegration, respectively. The empirical results further ensure that energy transition and patents work for environmental sustainability in reducing ecological footprints in the long run. Contrarily, non-renewable energy and natural resources adversely impact the sustainability agenda while increasing the ecological footprints both in the long and short run. Moreover, the results are consistent with the robustness check through the Augmented Mean Group and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimators. The study suggests that the European Union members continue to promote the transition from non-renewable energy to clean energy sources to empower the sustainability plans determined by United Nations.

However, such advancements have created a human distance from nature with a considerable climate crisis (Elavarasan et al., 2022 ). Considering the increasing ecological catastrophe, various economies aim to work for sustainable development objectives where the clamor for carbon neutrality is a global concern. More specifically, United Nations General Assembly has provided a framework for 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to promote energy efficiency, human welfare, sustainable production and consumption, environmental sustainability, innovation, poverty reduction, and many others (UN General Assembly, 2015 ). Both theoretical and empirical investigations provide enough evidence for the recent climate crisis because of industrial pollution and dependency on traditional energy sources. However, to achieve SDG7 (i.e., affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030), the energy transition from non-renewable to renewable sources is a significant path (Shyu, 2021 ). The reason is that SDG7 is directly linked with SDG13, which covers climate action (Elavarasan et al., 2021 ). Like other regional economies, the European Union (EU)1  1 List of selected EU economies have been provided under Appendix: A1.   has prescribed an energy transition vision that puts energy efficiency while switching to an immaculate energy system (Climate Action Network, 2021 ). Moreover, the EU has developed its own Paris Agreement Compatible (PAC) energy scenario for emission reduction, energy saving, and renewables. Additionally, PAC illustrates the design for the transition of the energy system in the overall EU while cutting down the carbon emission by 65% till 2030, comparatively to the 1990s level of 40%. At the same time, focusing on the climate emergency, the EU aims to work towards net zero emissions by 2040 instead of 2050 and to convert 100% energy supply into renewables till 2040. In addition, the need for the low carbon transition is now a hotly debated phenomenon where different economies show their significant interest. In energy production, eliminating fossil fuels is one of the best ways to minimize environmental footprints and global emissions. Although the term global transition of energy is in the emerging phase; however, renewable energy sources can help accomplish 90% of the carbon diminution (Khan and Hou, 2021 ). Simultaneously, the intensity and environmental impacts of energy depend upon the specific use of technology, geographical locations, and many other factors. The need for energy, water, and infrastructure advancement instigates stress on the ecological system with the significant depletion of natural resources (Wang and Dong, 2019 ). The term natural resources (NRRs) and their depletion has been considered in the literature with broad economic implications. For this purpose, Ecological Footprint (EFP) is one of the most reliable indicators to measure the environmental pressure crafted by human's extensive utilization of the NRRs. The initial concept of EFP, as justified by Wackernagel and Rees (1996) , focuses on measuring the bio-productive region required to help the specific population. Considering the demand side, EFP measures the ecological assets that a given product or a population requires to produce the environmental resources it consumes and to absorb the waste in the form of carbon dioxide emission. Fig. 1   shows the EU's EFP, constant per capita over the past 2.5 decades. It indicates that EFP for Finland was highest in 1995 and 2016, followed by the rest of the Economies. Focusing on the EU to examine ecological sustainability through EFP highlights several reasons. For instance, claims the total EFP for EU-27 members is high and is now more than double the available biocapacity in the region. It shows the capacity of the ecosystem to produce helpful material in biological form and to play its role as a sink of carbon emissions. Additionally, the stated region has higher EFP, which indicates that the demand for eco-goods and services surpasses the supply side, resulting in a significant ecological deficit, hence negative consequences both inside and outside the European environment. Moreover, selecting the EU as a sample of interest to examine the trends in EFP justify that these economies have adopted some of the highest ecological standards and common environmental policies (Ulucak and Apergis, 2018 ). These standards highlight that observing current and future environmental conditions in this region through a comprehensive proxy (i.e., EFP) to track their efforts towards ecological threats might be helpful in policy suggestions and formulation (Bilgili and Ulucak, 2018 ). Considering the progress made by technological innovations toward environmental sustainability, a few research gaps have been observed. Firstly, research and development (R&D) can be adopted elsewhere as a popular proxy for technological progress; however, some of it may not be linked with energy saving and, for this reason, have an insignificant impact on carbon emissions (CEM). Moreover, technological innovations are regarded as a complex and high-risk process that not only depends upon R&D but various other factors like the experience of technological researchers. Hence, it is not logical to achieve environmental sustainability via new energy conservation technology by enhancing the R&D investment as such inputs are only rough and general (Pfeiffer and Mulder, 2013 ). Moreover, no official data is linked with the R&D in the energy field. Nevertheless, energy patents (EPTs) are output for energy-saving R&D and are more linked with ecological performance than total R&D investment (Huang et al., 2021 ; Li and Lin, 2016 ). Secondly, different types of EPTs have a differential impact on ecological sustainability. In this way, there are three major sources of EPTs: scientific institutions, enterprises, and higher educational institutions (Huang et al., 2021 ). For example, the technological innovations linked with the enterprise are more concerned with maximizing the earnings where they are at the forefront of the production and can easily understand the practical issues. Therefore, the EPTs of enterprises may be endowed with a higher level of application value in dealing with environmental concerns (Huang et al., 2021 ). On the other side, scientific and higher educational institutions are not on the fronts of production as they face difficulty comprehending the practical issues in the production process. As most scientific institutions depend upon funds from enterprises and the government, they still have a strong impetus for pursuing earning and proficiency in dealing with and solving practical issues. For this reason, EPTs of such institutions have less practical value than scientific institutions and business enterprises in terms of solving practical ecological problems. Moreover, the existing literature has shown more interest in investigating the role of renewable energy and technological innovations in environmental concerns like CEM (Huang et al., 2021 ; Iqbal et al., 2021 ; Su and Fan, 2022 ). However, the consideration given to a comprehensive proxy of environmental sustainability like EFP has been observed with very little note. Economic development mainly links with industrialization, ultimately promoting the extraction of NRRs. A large amount of consumption of NRRs through deforestation, mining, industrialization, and agriculture eventually destroys environmental sustainability (Danish et al., 2019 ). One historical view regarding the linkage between NTR and EFP is shared by Panayotou (1993) , who states that extraction of NRRs decreases biocapacity with more footprints on nature. However, integrating sustainable management practices during the extraction and utilization of the NRRs would be regarded as a panacea for ecological damages. It is argued that EFP is viewed as a comprehensive measure of sustainability assessment and resource utilization compared to carbon emission, haze pollution like PM2.5, and other greenhouse gas emissions (Miao et al., 2022 ; Sun et al., 2022 ). For this reason, pollution is linked to air, soil, and water. Therefore, instead of using CEM as a measure of environmental pollution, this research has examined the trends in EFP as also determined by the NRRs from the context of EU economies over the past few decades. Motivated by the above discussion and critical gaps in the literature, this study contributes to the existing literature from several perspectives for the entire readership, environmental activists, and the research community. This study's first and foremost contribution is the investigation of environmental sustainability practices through EFP as a primary dependent variable among the EU economies. A massive amount of the literature reveals that testing for the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) is based on carbon emissions to demonstrate the trends in environmental degradation, which is a paramount shortage to test such a hypothesis (Destek et al., 2018 ). Using the EFP serves various advantages, specifically as an environmental factor (Ulucak and Bilgili, 2018 ) For instance, the EFP takes into account both direct and indirect impacts of production and consumption-based activities on nature. At the same time, it is a comprehensive indicator for considering the total consumption and international distribution of resources (Borucke et al., 2013 ). However, one of the most potent insights to consider EFP is that it captures a wide range of ecological data into a single proxy. For this reason, ignoring the EFP and focusing on other measures for environmental pollution may lead to misleading findings for the policy suggestions and implications (Yilanci et al., 2022 ). Secondly, our study has added the role of energy transition and patents as core explanatory variables along with natural resources and non-renewable energy. As the literature has merely observed the trends in environmental sustainability through EPTs and energy transition for the EU economies, this research has filled the gap on solid grounds. As per the earlier discussion under the study background, it is revealed that the EU economies have taken several novel steps to make remarkable progress toward energy transition and energy patents. However, the literature is yet to answer regarding the role of EPTs and energy transition in controlling ecological damages like EFP. Considering this loophole in the current literature, this research contributes well to the existing studies. Thirdly, the association between the variables of interest has been investigated by applying a range of advanced panel estimations along with slope heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, stationarity properties, and panel cointegration. The findings confirm that energy transition and patents tend to decrease ecological damages as they reduce the EFP burden in the EU. However, NRR and Non-RE indicate an upward shift in EFP both in the long and short run. Based on the above arguments, research questions and objectives have been proposed.• Are the energy transition and patents helpful in reducing/controlling the ecological footprints among the EU economies through advanced panel estimations?  • Do the Non-RE and natural resources cause more EFP in the EU economies through advanced panel estimations?    The research objectives for the current research are as follows:• To investigate the role and mechanism behind the energy transition and patents in controlling ecological damages like EFP among the EU economies based on advanced econometric techniques.  • To examine the role and mechanism of Non-RE and natural resources in causing more EFP among the EU economies based on the advanced panel models.    The rest of the paper is organized in the following ways: The literature review and research methods have been presented in Sections 2 and 3 . Section 4  deals with the empirical findings and discussion, whereas Section 5  highlights the conclusion, policy implications, and future directions.  2 Literature review 2.1 Energy transition and sustainability Energy transition refers to the movement from traditional energy sources (i.e., fossil fuels) to the renewable-based system. Such shifting helps to reduce the dependency on conventional energy sources; therefore, it is a critical factor for climate resilience and long-term prosperity (Harichandan et al., 2022 ). In this regard, Bogdanov et al. (2021)  discuss the significance of low-cost renewable energy as a global energy transition driver to address sustainability. Authors claim that electrification and defossilization have increased the energy system's overall efficiency, which is also compatible with the 1.5 °C targets. Pondering energy sustainability in South Asia, Murshed (2021)  investigates regional trade integration in facilitating the energy transition. Data was collected between 1992 and 2015, where the initial tests helped control the slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The empirical outcomes confirm the significance of inter-regional trade among the South Asian economies to boost the share and output of clean energy consumption, confirming a sustainable ecological solution. Afshan et al. (2022)  examine the OECD economies for the role of the energy transition, ecological innovations, and environmental policy toward EFP. The results show that eco-innovation and energy transition promotes ecological sustainability while decreasing the EFP. Khan et al. (2022a)  investigate the impact of the energy transition on EFP and economic growth for the OECD economies during 1990–2015. Their long-run findings reflect that energy transition and energy consumption are negatively linked with environmental quality, clarifying that they tend to reduce the EFP. Khan et al. (2022b)  investigate the trilemma association between energy balance, clean energy transition, and economic expansion from environmental sustainability. Generalized least square (GLS) and generalized least square mixed effect models reflect that clean energy transition helps to control the deterioration in the natural environment. More specifically, a 1% increase in the clean energy transition tends to reduce the environmental footprint by 0.027%. Tzeremes et al. (2023)  claim that under the agenda of SDGs and the COP26 summit, the terms energy transition, technology and low carbon emissions have become significantly interested topics among the governments and policymakers. Considering the sample from BRICS, their study investigates the nexus between energy transition, economic growth, carbon emissions, and information and communication technologies (ICTs) through the GMM-PVAR model. Based on the annual data from 2000 to 2017, the results confirm that a significant and positive relationship exists between energy transition and carbon emissions, where ICTs are a considerable choice in developing energy transition and solving ecological challenges. Besides, Panarello and Gatto (2023)  focus on green resilience as an effective recovery strategy towards a multidimensional crisis where the role of energy transition in the EU is saluted as a new package for policy interventions. Based on the findings, the authors suggest a range of evidence for the issues related to the clean energy transition, like resilience, security, safety, vulnerability, competition, and climate change.H1 energy transition is significantly linked with the sustainability measures like ecological footprints among the EU economies.    2.2 Energy patents and sustainability Recently, the patenting in green and clean energy technologies has been growing remarkably. Therefore, researchers, policymakers, and environmental activists have shown keen interest in investigating the relationship between EPT and environmental sustainability. For example, Iqbal et al. (2021)  claim that environmental and socioeconomic consideration of energy production has become a critical agenda discussion because of its relationship with the climate. Moreover, renewable EPTs possibly mediated the association between energy policy and the environment. Through non-radial data envelopment analysis from 2010 to 2017 for 30 provinces in China, the empirical findings confirm overall progress in the environmental performance index. However, the average level of the energy patent index is relatively weak, covering a range of 0.44–0.52, which is far below the optimal point of 1. Besides, both emission reduction policies and clean energy positively help in increasing the environmental performance index. Huang et al. (2021)  discuss the effect of EPTs on CEM in China using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model. Authors claim that technological advancement is the most influential factor in dealing with environmental degradation, like CEM. However, there is significant heterogeneity among different EPTs based on their purpose and performance dynamics. Considering the conventional and different Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimators, the empirical findings show that EPTs are not powerful instruments to control CEM. However, EPTs originated from scientific institutions and enterprises exert a positive outcome in controlling CEM. Besides, the utility type of the EPTs significantly reduces CEM. Kim and Lee (2021)  infer that innovation of alternative energy technologies have now become an essential tool for managing the changing climate. The South Korean economy has been investigated to analyze the effect of financial support from domestic research and development projects along with the patent performance for the collaboration between the universities, government, and industries. Based on the data from 2010 to 2017, the study findings stated that financial support from national R&D is not sufficient. However, the collaboration between the stated stakeholders helps improve alternative EPTs' performance. Apart from this, Panarello and Gatto (2023)  focus on the Turkish economy to explore energy production and investment methods. Authors observe that Turkey has put a considerable challenge to reduce its dominant use of fossil fuel, reducing its energy dependence, sustaining green growth, and mitigating its footprints on nature. Moreover, a notable transition of solar, nuclear, and wind energy has also been observed based on the energy policy and sustainability agenda.H2 energy patents are significantly linked with the sustainability measures like ecological footprints among the EU economies.    2.3 Non-RE and sustainability The nexus between non-renewable energy (Non-RE) and EFP have also achieved enormous attention in the current literature based on samples from different economies. For example, Destek and Sinha (2020)  consider 24 OECD economies to investigate the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for the relationship between renewable and non-renewable energy, trade openness, and EFP during 1998–2014. Through second-generation panel methodologies, the findings reflect that increasing the share of non-RE boosts the damages like EFP. Usman and Makhdum (2021)  investigated the influence of energy consumption, financial development, agriculture, and forest area on the EFP in the BRICT region during 1990–2018. Their study confirms the existence of cross-sectional dependence for which the second-generation panel unit root, cointegration, causality tests, and long-run elasticity have been applied. The results show that Non-RE sources tend to produce the EFP by 0.5507%, whereas a reduction of 0.2248% in EFP has been experienced through the renewable energy source. Moreover, a growth phenomenon exists from using renewable and traditional sources, forest areas and EFP. Usman et al. (2021)  seek to investigate the determinants of EFP and economic growth for the top 15 highest emitting economies of th world. The augmented mean group (AMG) estimation results confirm that Non-RE consumption is significantly responsible for more ecological pollution in the selected economies. Sharif et al. (2020)  take a sample of the Turkish economy to re-investigate the impact of both renewable and Non-RE on the EFP from 1965Q1 to 2017-Q4. The findings through the QARDL approach infer the presence of EKC in the Turkish economy, where both economic growth and Non-RE contribute positively to EFP. Alola et al. (2019)  investigate those drivers essential to achieve SDGs through a reduction of environmental pollution in EU members through the Panel Pool Mean Group Autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL) model. The findings indicate that Non-RE depletes the ecological quality, whereas energy from renewable sources improves it. The authors suggest diversifying the existing energy portfolio by adding RE technologies would be a sustainable solution. Moreover, EU members are also advised to strengthen their commitments to hunt the emission targets while decarbonizing the growth trajectory. Besides, Ansari (2022)  has filled the literature gap while taking the two environmental proxies; EFP and carbon dioxide emissions among ASEAN economies. The results show that Non-RE has a significant and destructive impact on ecological proxies, whereas renewable energy is a panacea for environmental degradation. Adekoya et al. (2022)  aim to fill the literature gap for oil-exporting and importing economies by exploring energy consumption's role in environmental pollution. By applying the AMG approach, which is robust to slope heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, structural breaks, and stationarity properties, they found that Non-RE in both sample economies significantly contributes to higher ecological degradation. However, the impact of Non-RE is greater for the net oil exporting economies because of their major dependence on such natural resources. Besides, Dogan et al. (2022)  also explore the nexus between EFP, Non-RE, clean energy, and unemployment in the South Asian economies. The results confirm the presence of unidirectional causality as running from Non-RE, renewable energy, and income to EFP, where the increase in Non-RE tends to increase the damages for ecological sustainability.H3 non-renewable energy is significantly linked with the sustainability measures like ecological footprints among the EU economies.    2.4 Natural resources and sustainability The efficient extraction and utilization of NRR is a sustainable solution for ecological well-being. In this regard, a growing trend has been observed in investigating the role of NRR in determining the EFP. For instance, Danish et al. (2020)  focus on the determinants of EFP in BRICS, for which the role of clean energy, natural resources, and urbanization has been investigated. Modern panel data estimation methods like FMOLS and DOLS have been employed to investigate the long-run relationship between the variables during 1992–2016. The findings document that clean energy and NRR decrease the EFP, contributing to ecological quality. Moreover, the presence of EKC has been confirmed in the BRICS economies. Zafar et al. (2019)  explore the US economy over the last five decades to check whether the NRR improves or destroys ecological health. Their findings infer that human capital and NRR help curtail environmental damages while reducing the EFP. Ahmed et al. (2020)  infer that the literature shows mixed findings concerning the nexus between NRR and EFP. Moreover, China's economy has been facing a dramatic change in the industrialization, consumption, and extraction of NRR. Considering the long-term equilibrium relationship between the NRR and EFP, their findings confirm that an upward shift in EFP is linked with the NRR, where the role of economic growth and urbanization is not productive in controlling environmental degradation. Alvarado et al. (2021)  have investigated environmental pollution as linked with the EFP in Latin America which is observed with less industrialization and higher biodiversity. Per Capita EFP has been considered as a comprehensive environmental proxy for which the role of natural resource rent has been examined. The findings show that throughout the distribution of EFP, the impact of NRR and economic complexity is heterogenous in nature. Besides, Liu et al. (2023)  focus on the G7 region to explore the role of NRR, human capital, and financial inclusion in dealing with the sustainability concerns like EFP from 1992 to 2018. Considering the advanced panel methods entitled Cup-FM and Cup-BC, the findings show that NRR and human capital tend to reduce the EFP among G7 economies. Moreover, financial inclusion reflects ecological pollution, so it is suggested that existing financial facilities and products should be aligned with the sustainability agenda.H4 natural resources are significantly linked with the sustainability measures like ecological footprints among the EU economies.   Table 1   reports the summary of the literature review based on the earlier studies, methods, regional context, and key findings. Given the above literature discussion, it is inferred that current literature is lacking in investigating the role of energy transition and energy patents in controlling ecological damages like higher EFP. Moreover, in contrast with the earlier studies, this study covers the research gap from the context of EU economies which is widely neglected in exploring the nexus between energy transition, EPTs, and EFP based on the advanced panel models. While lacking such investigation, current literature could not provide relevant suggestions related to the development and progression of energy patents and energy transitions towards achieving SDG7 and environmental sustainability in the form of low EFP.   3 Research methods 3.1 Testing for cross-sectional dependence (CSD) Under standard panel estimation models, it is assumed that there exists non-dependency between the cross-section units. However, if the panel data estimators ignore the CSD, the subsequent findings may cause false inferences and policy formulations (Chudik and Pesaran, 2015 ). Moreover, the estimated coefficients may differ across cross-sectional units of observations. Therefore, the investigation of CSD under panel data estimation is significantly logical. For this reason, the current research investigates CSD. More specifically, examining the CSD before assessing the unit root is significantly beneficial (Suki et al., 2021 ). Whenever a study has been conducted on the data having cross-sectional units, certain factors influence the stated region or group of economies (Suki et al., 2021 ). These factors include financial crisis, oil price changes, regional political situation, inter-regional policies, etc. Sometimes, the variations determined by these factors are well explained; however, they may also remain unexplained. For this reason, it is imperative to focus on CSD, as ignoring such an issue may lead to inaccurate empirical estimations (Salim et al., 2017 ). As the stated arguments, Pesaran's (2015)  test has been employed to examine the CSD of the data.  3.2 Testing for the stationarity properties Followed by evaluating the data's unit root or stationarity properties. Several studies have assessed the stationarity of the data (Breitung and Pesaran, 2008 ; Moon and Perron, 2012 ) with their merits and demerits. These tests can be divided into three major categories: first, second, and third generation, respectively. However, the third-generation test of checking the stationarity properties is regarded as more advanced while incorporating structural breaks, slope homogeneity, and CSD (Suki et al., 2021 ). Based on the above discussion, current research applies Pesaran's (2007) , and Bai and Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009)  tests to focus on the nonstationary issue and CSD.  3.3 Checking the slope heterogeneity Once the investigation for the CSD and stationarity properties of the data has been conducted, the next step is to analyze the heterogeneity of the slope coefficients through a test suggested by Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) , a modified version of Swamy's (1970)  test. The null for this test assumes the existence of homogeneity in the slope coefficients, whereas the alternative rejects it. As the conventional tests have been observed with unpredictable outcomes because of CSD, our study has applied the cointegration test proposed by Westerlund and Edgerton (2008) . For testing the slope heterogeneity based on the improved version of the test suggested by Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) , two delta statistics, entitled Δ tilde and Δ tilde Adjusted, have been tested for which the following equations have been focused.(1) Δ ˜  = N   ( N − 1   S ‾  − k  2 k    )  ∼ X k 2      (2) Δ ˜   a d j = N   ( N − 1   S ‾  − k  v ( T , K  )    )  ∼ N ( 0,1 )       In the above Equations, the term N shows the number of cross-sectional units, which are EU economies; S means Swamy's test statistics, and K indicates the key explanatory variables of the model. If the P value is insignificant at 5%, then the H0 will be accepted to claim that slope homogeneity exists.  3.4 CS-ARDL test Subsequently, taking into account the existence of the CSD in the data, this study has applied the CS-ARDL, which is significantly preferable over other techniques as it helps in dealing with the interdependency of the regional units being considered, and heterogeneity of the slope coefficients (Suki et al., 2021 ). The estimations for the CS-ARDL are based on the dynamic common correlated effects. The key endogenous variable in this study is ecological footprints, referred to as EFP; the key independent variables are ETI, EPT, Non-RE, and NRR. Besides, the variables GFC and GDP have been observed as control variables. The study's cross-sectional units and time duration, the notion i and t have been used in equation (3) . Besides, the term f indicates the functional relationships between the variables.(3) E F P  , i , t   = f  ( E T I  i , t   , E P T  i , t   , N o n − R E  i , t   , N R R  i , t +   G F C  i , t   + G D P  i , t    )       More specifically, Equation (3)  covers the regression format for this relationship.(4) E F P  i t   = β 1 i t   + β 2 i t   E T I  i t   + β 3 i t   E P T  i t   + β 4 i t   N o n − R E  i t   + β 5 i t   N R R  i t   + β 6 i t   G F C α i  + β 7 i t   G D P  i t   + δ i t       (5) W i , t   = ∑ i = 0  p w   φ  i , t   W i , t − 1   + ∑ i = 0  p z   γ  i , t   Z i , t − 1   + ε i , t        In Equation (4) , the terms β 1    , β 2    , up to β 7     reflect the beta coefficients for the relatively independent and control variables. Where the term i and t are used for the cross-sectional units (the EU economies as selected) and time duration. The earlier literature discussion reveals that EFP is negatively linked with energy innovations and transition, whereas non-renewable and natural resources have a positive linkage to it. Moreover, the term W in equation (3)  above indicates the main dependent variables entitled EFP. In Equation (5) , the ARDL model is defined. However, the stated Equation (3)  has been extended into Equation (6) , covering the cross-sectional average for each repressor. Moreover, the cross-section averages reduce the cross-sectional dependence effects.(6) W i t   = ∑ i = 0  p w   φ  i , t   W i , t − 1   + ∑ i = 0  p z   γ  i , t   Z i , t − 1   + ∑ i = 0  p x   α  i  X ‾  t − 1   + ε i , t       Where the following equation shows the averages of all the variables which are dependent, independent and control in nature.X ‾  t − 1   = ( W ‾  i , t − 1   , Z ‾  i , t − 1    )      Where in equation (4)  above, the term W i t      EFP per capita is a main endogenous variable of interest. Additionally, Z i , t − 1      shows the explanatory and control variables covering the titles like energy transition, energy patents, natural resources, non-renewable energy, gross fixed capital, and economic growth. Meanwhile, X ‾  t − 1      reflects the average for the study variables to mitigate the problem of CSD because of the spillover effect. However, the term P w     , P z     , and P x     have been used to reflect the variable lags. Moreover, the long-run coefficient values are estimated through the short-run in the CS-ARDL, where the mean group estimator and long-run coefficients are reflected below:(7) π ˆ  C S − A R D L , i   = ∑ I = 0  p z   γ ˆ   I i   1 = Σ I = 0     φ ˆ  I , t        The estimated short-run coefficients are as under:(8) Δ W  i t   = ϑ i  [ W i , t − 1   − π i  Z i , t − 1    ]  − ∑ i = 0  p w − 1   φ   i , t   Δ i  W  i , t − 1   + ∑ i = 0  p z   γ  i , t   Δ i  Z i , t − 1   + ∑ i = 0  p x   α  i  X ‾  t  + ε i , t       WhereΔ i  = t − ( t − 1  )      (9) τ ˆ  i  = − (  1 − ∑ i = 0  p w   φ ˆ    i , t   )      (10) π ˆ  i  = ∑ i = 0  p z   γ ˆ   i , t   τ ˆ  i       (11) π ‾  ˆ  M G   = 1 N   ∑ i = 1  N  π ˆ  i        In the final step, the current study covers the robustness check with CSD, slope heterogeneity, panel cointegration, and stationarity properties. Considering the need for the robustness check, this study has applied the augmented mean group (AMG) and common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) as suggested by Eberhardt and Teal (2010)  and Pesaran (2006) . These estimators provide reliable output with the nonstationary common and unnoticed common factors. However, one of the key benefits of applying the CCEMG is that it mitigates the identification issue and considers the time-variant unobservable with the non-homogenous slope parameters. Table 2   deals with the description and measurement of the variables. It is important to note that the measurement of the energy transition is reflected through an index based on the principal component analysis while taking into account the key guidelines of Khan et al. (2022). Factors like clean energy investment, CEM, energy intensity, and carbon intensity can be considered key indicators for measuring the energy transition index (IEA, 2019a , 2019b ). By measuring all these indicators under PCA, an index has been considered and subsequently utilized to measure the ETI. The data for the EFP has been collected from Global Footprint Network (GFN). In contrast, for the EPT, the relevant data has been collected annually from the International renewable energy agency (IRENA). Besides, the data for the rest of the variables entitled non-renewable energy, natural resources, gross fixed capital formation, and GDP has been collected from the world development indicator (WDI) database. Fig. 2   covers the methodological sequence as linked with the present study.   4 Results and discussion Table 3   reports the descriptive results for the study variables. It shows that the EPTs' highest mean score is recorded, followed by Non-RE considered as a % of total energy consumption from fossil fuel. Additionally, the trends in EFP for the selected economies are recorded as 2.01 in terms of the mean score, with a maximum value of 7.61 over the past couple of decades. Moreover, the average score for the GFC as % of GDP is recorded as 22.36, with the highest value of 53.591 for the EU states. Likewise, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance level for the study variables have been presented in Table 4  . The results show that the individual VIF and mean VIF for the stated variables are lower than 05. Similarly, the tolerance score (1/VIF) also confirms that values are above 0.10. This verifies that there is no higher collinearity between the selected variables. As discussed previously under research methods, investigating CSD is essential to generate reliable findings. However, if the CSD is not assessed, the upcoming tests will develop inappropriate results, leading to a misleading inference and biased generalization for the policy implications. The null hypothesis under the CSD test states the absence of cross-sectional dependence in the study data. In contrast, the alternative rejects it and assumes CSD exists. The results under Table 5   show that t-statistics for ecological footprints, energy transition index, energy patents, non-renewable energy, natural resources, gross fixed capital, and economic growth are significant at 1%. Therefore, H1  is supported to claim that CSD exists in the dataset. After analyzing CSD in the study variables, the upcoming step considers the properties of stationarity per the suggestions by Bai and Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009)  and Pesaran (2015) . The unit root test with and without structural breaks is preferred over traditional tests because of the existence of cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity in the slope coefficients. The findings for both tests, as recommended by Pesaran (2007)  and Bai and Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009) , are presented in Table 6  . The null hypothesis under both tests failed to reject and was accordingly accepted. Furthermore, the findings accepted the H0 for Bai and Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009)  test. Meanwhile, the data has become stationarity as per Pesaran (2007) , and therefore, the first-order difference was considered, and Bai and Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009)  test was applied. The findings under Table 6  report the acceptance of H1 , concluding the absence of unit root or existence of stationarity along with cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity in the slope coefficients, respectively. Consequently, the study variables entitled ecological footprints, energy transition index, energy patents, non-renewable energy, natural resources, gross fixed capital formation, and economic growth are stationarity and/or integrated, as shown in Table 5 . In the subsequent step, heterogeneity in the slope coefficients was assessed through a modified version of Swamy (1970)  ‘s test. The stated test was revised by Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) , where the cross-sectional units of observation (N) could be larger than the time series (T). Various studies confirm that testing the slope heterogeneity is essential so that the subsequent results may provide reliable outcomes (Adebayo et al., 2021 ; Chien et al., 2022 ; Suki et al., 2021 ). The null hypothesis reflects the presence of homogeneity in the slope coefficients, whereas the alternative rejects it. Table 7   reports that both Δ tilde and Δ tilde Adjusted have their significant p-values at 1%. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is supported by claiming heterogeneity in the slope coefficients. The mechanism behind heterogeneity in the slope coefficient asserts that EU economies have varying levels of development, ecological innovations, and technological progress; hence data is not homogenous. In addition, Westerlund and Edgerton (2008)  suggest a panel cointegration test for examining the cointegration. For this purpose, H0 claims that there is no cointegration with the presence of cross-sectional dependence. However, H1  indicates that there exists cointegration with the CSD. The results in Table 8   report cointegration in all three stages entitled no break, mean shift, and regime shift, respectively. For estimating both long-run and short-run relationships, the CS-ARDL approach has been adopted, where Table 9   reports the long-run estimations. The results reflect a significantly negative relationship between the ETI and EFP (i.e., coefficient = −0.627, p-value = 0.000). The negative coefficient of ETI reflects that more energy transition, as measured through a set of indicators, leads to fewer EFP. The ongoing phenomenon of energy transition among EU member states it reflects its constructive role in easing environmental hardship like EFP. This result signifies that ETI helps control the environmental deterioration among EU member states. As stated earlier in the study introduction, the ETI reflects the shifting of the energy sector from fossil-fuel-base to renewable sources, which provides a remedy for protecting the natural environment in the form of a lower ecological burden, hence, creating a sense of environmental sustainability. Therefore, a productive nexus between ETI-EFP exists. The historical review of the EU region clears that various invaluable strategies have been proposed and adopted to support the energy transition. For instance, the European investment bank, the emission trading system, pushing carbon prices to over 20 EUR/tons since 2018, and infrastructure and innovation fund programs like Horizon 2020 are a few steps taken by the EU (Eyl-Mazzega and Mathieu, 2020 ). At the same time, various EU states have their major plans to phase out coal from power generation, and the European Energy Union (EEU) was also developed to foster the energy markets (Eyl-Mazzega and Mathieu, 2020 ). Moreover, the dynamic relationship between ETI and EFP was provided by Khan et al. (2022) for OECD economies. Through advanced panel estimations, findings confirm that ETI negatively links with the EFP. The results of Murshed et al. (2022)  are also consistent with our study. They infer that phasing out the dependency on fossil fuels to adopt clean energy is pertinent for ensuring and safeguarding environmental well-being and energy security. Besides, authors like Su and Tan (2023)  also highlight the need for the energy transition in creating a sustainable path for green growth and environmental sustainability. At the same time, Bashir et al. (2023)  further assert that there is an urgent need to reduce the negative externailities upon the environment's welfare. For such concerns, a prospective solution is to focus on the energy transition which is critical indicator in reshaping the energy utilization towards net-zero-carbon targets for the environmental sustainability (Bashir et al., 2023 ). Moreover, the long-run relationship between EPT and EPF reflects a significant negative linkage. This means that more recognition of clean and green energy and related patents among EU members provides sustainable results as it helps reduce natural footprints. More specifically, the relative change in EFP through EPT is −0.317 with a t-score of −6.518, justifying significant outcomes at 1%. The mechanism behind the constructive role of EPT in dealing with environmental sustainability is that technological progress is a powerful instrument that controls ecological degradation and works for economic development on sustainable grounds (Fisher-Vanden and Sue Wing, 2008 ). Moreover, EPTs help save energy usage and reduce CEM when producing one unit of the product (Huang et al., 2021 ). Huang et al. (2021)  focus on the Chinese economy to investigate whether EPTs are among the dominant factors in controlling ecological damage. Based on the theoretical foundation of the STIRPAT model, the results, contrary to our findings, state that energy patents do not control environmental pollution on solid grounds in general. However, the patents from scientific institutions and enterprises show their positive role in controlling environmental damage. Moreover, the EPT from higher education enhances such a positive effect. Fernández et al. (2022)  further express that technological innovations are widely recognized in tackling climate change while fulfilling energy objectives. Contrary to energy transition and energy patents, Non-RE and natural resources' role in dealing with the EFP is destructive and significant. More specifically, the results show that keeping all factors constant, a 1% change in the Non-RE and NRR is causing a change of 0.181% and 0.159% in the EFP among EU states. As the dependency on more traditional energy sources like fossil fuels and natural resources, upward pressure on the ecological environment is quite apparent. In this regard, the existing literature validates the mixed findings. For example, Danish et al. (2020)  focus on the BRICS economies through a panel estimation approach. They confirm and validate the existence of EKC in BRICS while demonstrating that NRR helps lower the EFP. Zafar et al. (2019)  also confirm the productive role of natural resources in reducing environmental degradation, like EFP, from the context of the United States. However, consistent with our results, Ahmad et al. (2020)  demonstrate that NRR and economic growth lead to more EFP. Jahanger et al. (2022)  claim that consideration of ecological well-being should be of core interest to governments worldwide. For such objectives, significant attention is required to utilize natural resources efficiently. Their study takes the sample from 73 developing economies from 1990 to 2016 and claims that NRR increases environmental damages in the form of EFP. However, with the integration of sustainable management practices with production and consumption, the natural resource depletion rate will be declined, hence low pressure on the existing resources and subsequently low environmental footprints (Danish et al., 2020 ). A similar argument has been shared by Danish et al. (2019) , who state that large amount of NRR consumption through industrialization, agriculture, mining, and deforestation has an adverse influence on the environment, which further decreases the biocapacity and, finally, an upward shift in the EFP (Panayotou, 1993 ). Based on the above arguments, it is inferred that NRR and Non-Re in EU economies cause more EFP for which sustainable solution is substantially required. Moreover, the long-run estimations show that GFC is positively and significantly associated with the EFP. It shows that a higher GFC tends to increase the EFP by 0.193% among the EU economies. Considering the GFC as a control variable in the model, it is argued that capital formation promotes economic growth and utilization of more energy, consequently damaging environmental quality (Rahman and Ahmad, 2019 ). However, Södersten et al. (2018)  infer that the total share of capital formation varies across different economies as a component of overall carbon footprints. More specifically, in the initial development phase, developing nations are more intensive in utilizing resource-related assets in the form of machinery and infrastructure than less resource-intensive assets like software, technology, and services. Therefore, the nexus between the environment and GCF is not uniform across different economies based on their development level and process. However, contrary to our results, Mujtaba et al. (2022)  confirm that economic growth and capital formation dampen the environmental quality in the OECD economies. On the other side, Nathaniel and Adeleye (2021)  establish a negatively insignificant linkage between GFC and EFP. Awosusi et al. (2022)  view that various emerging economies like BRICS are struggling to address SDGs objectives. Considering the GMM estimation approach, their study infers that GFC increases environmental damage in the form of higher EFP. The mechanism behind GFC to create more ecological degradation infer that capital intensity may make some manufacturers dependent upon machinery, which further promote production, hence creating more burden on the nature in the form of higher emission and environmental pollution (Acar et al., 2023 ). Finally, the long-run results under Table 9  shows that economic growth (GDP) causes more EFP as the coefficient is significantly positive at 1%. Specifically, with an upward shift of 1% in the economic growth of EU states, a 0.459% increase in EFP is observed. The relationship between the traditional growth model and environmental proxies like EFP has also been justified in the existing studies. For instance, Mujtaba et al. (2022)  investigate the nexus between GDP and EFP for the OECD economies. The results through ARDL estimation show that a 1% increase in economic growth causes a rise of 0.53% in the EFP. For such environmental issues, the authors recommend a paradigm shift toward clean energy consumption in the OECD economies for better economic growth trajectory and productive capital stock. Okumus and Erdogan (2021)  focused on the sustainable development horizon and tested the EKC model. The results show that EKC exists in the sample economies where more GDP means more EFP. However, after a threshold level, sustainable economic growth would be achieved through which a reduction in EFP is found. Similarly, Ahmad et al. (2021)  confirm that GDP causes environmental damage like EFP in G7 economies from 1980 to 2016. However, for such damaging results, ecological innovations may have a favorable indirect impact on the environment through urbanization. Besides, G7 economies need to transform their current growth model into a more sustainable outlook both in production and consumption. Observing the short-run association between EFP and its key determinants, the results under Table 10   confirm that ETI causes to decrease in the footprints in nature. In contrast, NRR and GDP promote more such footprints. At the same time, GFC, as a second control variable, tends to increase the EFP. Except for the impact of EPTs and Non-RE, these findings are significantly consistent with the long-run results; however, the magnitude of the coefficient varies. In the final stage, the robustness check was applied through AMG and CCEMG estimations, for which results are covered in Table 11  . It shows that ETI and EPT are good sources to reduce the environmental burden, like EFP, for which both of the stated models have confirmed highly significant findings. Like the above discussion, these results justify that EU members can control the environmental imbalance (i.e., higher EFP) through energy transition and more focus on energy-efficient technologies. Contrarily, Non-RE and NRR significantly increased the EFP under AMG and CCEMG, respectively. Finally, the results confirm that GFC and economic growth have been the direct sources of environmental pollution in the EU region over the past few decades, consistent with the CS-ARDL findings.  5 Conclusion and policy implications The core focus of current research is to examine the sustainability agenda of the EU members in the form of EPP as determined by energy transitions and energy patents. Moreover, it also explores the role of Non-RE, natural resources, gross fixed capital, and economic growth in justifying the trends in EFP. The study investigates the existence of cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity in the slope coefficients, and stationarity dimensions of the selected variables. It is confirmed that selected EU states are interdependent where slope coefficients are heterogeneous. Additionally, the variables become stationarity which further leads to panel cointegration. Afterward, the results were justified through CS-ARDL both in the long-run and short run. To summarize the findings, it is confirmed that energy transition and patents are helpful indicators in reducing the ecological footprints of the EU. In contrast, Non-RE, natural resources, and economic growth are causing environmental impairments, hence a need to reshape growth and resource utilization into more sustainable management practices. Contrary to a variety of earlier findings, the gross fixed capital formation also creates natural instability in the form of more EFP. Similar arguments have been cross-verified via AMG and CCEMG estimations; however, the magnitude of the coefficients is diversified with identical directions. The empirical results of this study infer a few practical policy implications, specifically from the context of the EU. Details are as follows:1). To promote the clean energy transition, it is suggested that EU economies, administration, and related departments must address the influential and dominant hinders having their adverse role in continuing such practices. Moreover, at the same time, EU states are suggested to work to promote cooperation on the transfer of those technologies having their energy-efficient outcomes and, finally, towards a low-carbon economy. Another possible solution is to encourage the energy transition by stimulating social needs and community awareness toward green energy solutions while leaving behind fossil fuel consumption.  2). Energy patents being technological advancement, are also observed as an excellent source to reduce the pressure on nature like more EFP. For such reason, strategic investment in research and development on green patents is highly recommended to the EU. Such efforts would simultaneously provide multiple benefits, like reducing the dependency on non-renewable sources. Additionally, based on the technology acceptance model, it is further suggested that the EU region should recognize, assimilate and apply the knowledge for continuous energy conservation R&D activities.  3) As the effect of natural resources on EFP is significantly positive, which implies environmental degradation; therefore, one possible solution is to enhance the management the natural resources through efficient human capital and technology, which may generate sustainable outcomes. Meanwhile, reducing the dependency on the earnings from natural resources while promoting other industries under the shadow of sustainable growth would be another fruitful conduct.  4). As economic growth is causing more EFP; therefore, the EU states must shift their contemporary growth models into green and sustainable dimensions. Additionally, the gradual shifting of different industries having their major share in the production and consumption cycle of various products/services into green energy sources would help to secure them from environmental contamination.    A few limitations and future directions are highlighted in the final stage. For example, this study is limited to EU economies which specifies limited regional implications for the strategic policies related to SDGs. Moreover, it ignores the role of financial inclusion, financial development, green investment, individual energy transition indicators, and human capital in determining the sustainability agenda under EU economies. Future studies must focus on these limitations to generate novel empirical findings and policy guidelines. Moreover, the distribution of EU states into highly polluted and less polluted based on the EFP or carbon emission will also help generate cross-sectional comparisons and better policy recommendations in the coming time.
