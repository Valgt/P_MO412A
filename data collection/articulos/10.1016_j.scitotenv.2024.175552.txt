                  In order to assess the risk of pesticides to aquatic ecosystems, five single-dose pesticides including chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, azoxystrobin, and acetochlor that are frequently used in developing countries, were selected. Based on the principle of conservative risk assessment, application amounts for different dosage forms were recommended, the Top-Rice model and risk quotient method were used to evaluate the aquatic ecological risk of the aforementioned single-dose pesticide products. The results showed that predicted peak environmental concentration ranges after application on rice were 110.52–564.25 μg/L for chlorpyrifos, 20.79–114.6 μg/L for pymetrozine, 21.81–114.02 μg/L for dinotefuran, 16.52–56.94 μg/L for azoxystrobin, and 167.22–2184.01 μg/L for acetochlor in different seasons of Changsha, Hangzhou, Nanning in China, and Lahore and Faisalabad in Pakistan. Under the current conditions of registered administration, the acute and chronic risks posed by chlorpyrifos to fish and invertebrates were deemed alarming, and those by pymetrozine and dinotefuran were considered acceptable. The acute risk of exposure of azoxystrobin to vertebrates such as fish, and invertebrates such as daphnia and shrimp is alarming, whereas the chronic risk to vertebrates, invertebrates, and algae was acceptable. The acute exposure risk posed by acetochlor was deemed worrying, and in the case of chronic exposure, only 36 % of the simulation group exhibited a risk quotient below 1, indicating no risk. These findings imply that the ecological risks of using registered chlorpyrifos and acetochlor products on rice cannot be ignored. It should be noted that the analysis method and model employed in this study were intentionally conservative to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks associated with the use of registered pesticide products. However, the model failed to consider influential factors like photolysis of pesticides on the soil surface, thereby introducing a certain degree of conservativeness in the evaluation results.

Editor: Damià Barceló In order to assess the risk of pesticides to aquatic ecosystems, five single-dose pesticides including chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, azoxystrobin, and acetochlor that are frequently used in developing countries, were selected. Based on the principle of conservative risk assessment, application amounts for different dosage forms were recommended, the Top-Rice model and risk quotient method were used to evaluate the aquatic ecological risk of the aforementioned single-dose pesticide products. The results showed that predicted peak environmental concentration ranges after application on rice were 110.52–564.25 μg/L for chlorpyrifos, 20.79–114.6 μg/L for pymetrozine, 21.81–114.02 μg/L for dinotefuran, 16.52–56.94 μg/L for azoxystrobin, and 167.22–2184.01 μg/L for acetochlor in different seasons of Changsha, Hangzhou, Nanning in China, and Lahore and Faisalabad in Pakistan. Under the current conditions of registered administration, the acute and chronic risks posed by chlorpyrifos to fish and invertebrates were deemed alarming, and those by pymetrozine and dinotefuran were considered acceptable. The acute risk of exposure of azoxystrobin to vertebrates such as fish, and invertebrates such as daphnia and shrimp is alarming, whereas the chronic risk to vertebrates, invertebrates, and algae was acceptable. The acute exposure risk posed by acetochlor was deemed worrying, and in the case of chronic exposure, only 36 % of the simulation group exhibited a risk quotient below 1, indicating no risk. These findings imply that the ecological risks of using registered chlorpyrifos and acetochlor products on rice cannot be ignored. It should be noted that the analysis method and model employed in this study were intentionally conservative to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks associated with the use of registered pesticide products. However, the model failed to consider influential factors like photolysis of pesticides on the soil surface, thereby introducing a certain degree of conservativeness in the evaluation results.

While crucial for ensuring food security, rice production faces a significant challenge, balancing high yields with environmental protection. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 14 (Life Below Water), highlight this crucial balance (UN, 2015 ). While massive amounts of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides have increased rice yields in the past (Aldas-Vargas et al., 2022 ), unfortunately, <15 % reaches the target organisms (Zhao and Zhang, 2021 ). The remaining pesticides contaminate rice paddy environments, impacting surface water, soil, and groundwater, posing potential risks to ecosystems and human health (Singh et al., 2023 ; van de Merwe et al., 2018 ; Verasoundarapandian et al., 2022 ). Many of the pesticides and herbicides such as bentazone, imidacloprid, MCPA, carbendazim and chlorpyrifos among others applied to rice have been observed in drainage water, nearby soil and water ecosystems, and rivers in the vicinity emerging (Matamoros et al., 2020 ; Calvo et al., 2021 ; Syafrudin et al., 2021 ; Tan et al., 2021 ). Rice paddies, typically distributed around water sources, require flooded conditions during growth but are drained before harvest (Inubushi, 2021 ). This unique environment influences the transport and transformation of substances, including pesticides. Several commonly used pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, azoxystrobin, and acetochlor, have been detected in rice paddy air, soil, and water (Li et al., 2014, 2011 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ). The agricultural management and the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are major contributors to soil erosion, land degradation, and declining soil health (Thakur et al., 2022 ). The increasing demand for agricultural products and changing regional climates further exacerbate this issue, leading to increased pesticide consumption. Asia, the world leader in rice production, epitomizes this challenge. Of which, China, Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan and India, etc.) have highly productive rice multi-cropping systems contribute to their densely populated regions (Jiang et al., 2019a ). Southern China, a world leader in rice production, exemplifies this challenge. Its highly productive rice multi-cropping systems contribute to its densely populated regions (Jiang et al., 2019a ). In Chinese Yangtze River basin, a crucial agricultural area, over 80 % of China's rice is produced (NBSPRC, 2015 ; Wang et al., 2019b ). Rice consumption is also concentrated in Southern China, with per capita consumption exceeding northern regions by ninefold (Jiang et al., 2019b ). Furthermore, this region accounts for over 60 % of China's total rice cultivation area, contributing to more than half the nation's rice production (NBSPRC, 1989–2018 ). To meet the growing food demands with limited arable land, Zhang et al. estimate that China needs a 40 % increase in grain production by 2030 (Zhang et al., 2011 ). As the market economy booms, South China, as the primary rice-growing region, shoulders a significant burden. Similar situation could be found in other countries, for instance, in Pakistan, which stands 11th largest producer of rice worldwide (Shahzadi et al., 2018 ). With the rising population, decreasing land area circumstances, and changing climate, more yield per unit area is required. The rice crop is an important source of foreign exchange earnings for Pakistan, where Punjab is the leading agricultural province in Pakistan. Rice contributes more than half of the agricultural GDP, occupying half of its cultivable land, and producing over 70 % of the country's total grain crop output (GoP, 2019 ). Regardless of the significance of rice for Asia and the countries in discussion, rice production faces multiple challenges such as changing climatic patterns, pesticide residues, concerns regarding rising greenhouse gas emissions, contamination of soil, air, and water resources, biodiversity loss, human health risks, air pollution, and economic impacts (Habib-ur-Rahman et al., 2022 ; Nawaz et al., 2022 ). The responsible use of agrochemicals aligns with SDG 2, which emphasizes sustainable agricultural practices for achieving Zero Hunger. The presence of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, even at low concentrations, has been documented to have potential acute and chronic toxicities in aquatic environments (Rajapaksha et al., 2018 ). These pesticide residues can significantly impact the growth and productivity of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and aquatic plants (Pérez et al., 2019 ; Solomon et al., 2008 ). While fertilizers have historically played a vital role in increasing rice yields, excessive pesticide application has led to issues like rice quality deterioration, unstable yields, and environmental degradation (Gang-hua, 2021 ). China, a global hotspot for agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution, heavily relies on pesticides. Insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides account for 95 % of the total pesticide application in the country (Ouyang et al., 2017 ). Statistical surveys reveal that the most commonly used fertilizers in southern China are nitrogen-based, while recent pesticide trends favor carbamates and pyrethroids with lower human toxicity, along with modern herbicides and fungicides. However, concerns remain regarding neonicotinoids, which are chemically similar to nicotine and pose potential risks to beneficial insects (Pretty and Bharucha, 2015 ; Tudi et al., 2021 ), and non-target organisms (Carisio et al., 2024 ). Particularly, there is already a ban on the outdoor use of the neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam in the EU due to their potential risks; these pesticides are still widely used around the world. To effectively control and minimize pesticide risks, conducting risk assessments for rice cultivation practices is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems and ensuring sustainable rice production. Determining the occurrence, frequency, and concentration of each pesticide in rice paddies is vital for this purpose. However, traditional monitoring methods, although highly recommended, are time-consuming and require specialized equipment, posing challenges for resource-constrained countries and regions. Simulation models offer a valuable alternative for estimating pesticide concentrations and conducting risk assessments. These models integrate factors like the physical and chemical properties of pesticides, application information, and environmental behavior parameters with local meteorological, hydrological, soil, and crop cultivation data for a specific area, essentially creating a virtual exposure scenario (Inao et al., 2016 ). Researchers in the US and Europe have developed various models such as RICEWQ (RICE Water Quality), PFAM (Pesticides in Flooded Applications Model), and MED-RICE (Daam et al., 2013 ; Jin et al., 2016 ; Ritter and Williams, 2018 ). RICEWQ simulates pesticide movement and migration in field water and crop root zones, while PFAM focuses on how pesticides enter surface water after application. MED-RICE, with its fewer input parameters, is suitable for initial screening evaluations. In Japan, models like Aquatic Predicted Environmental Concentration (Aquatic PEC), Pesticide Paddy Field Model Series (PADDY), and Pesticide Concentrations in Paddy Fields have been developed to predict pesticide concentrations in paddy water and surface soil, although groundwater predictions are less common (Boulange et al., 2017 ; Inao and Kitamura, 1999 ). However, these models have been limited; as RICEWQ has a focus towards pesticide movement in field water and crop root zone, PFAM is especially designed for contamination of surface waters, and MED-RICE covers initial screening with only a few input parameters. China has also contributed models like TOP-RICE and the Pesticide Risk Assessment Exposure Simulation Shell (PRAESS). TOP-RICE, a joint effort by the Ministry of Agriculture's Institute of Pesticide Inspection and Certification and the Netherlands' Altera Research Institute, specifically targets southern China's rice-growing regions. TOP-RICE predicts pesticide concentrations in both surface and groundwater, considering leaching from paddies and diffusion into nearby natural ponds. This capability enhances risk assessment and allows for improved management of pesticide application. However, wider application of these models has been limited due to insufficient verification across diverse global regions. The TOP-RICE model is a comprehensive tool that simulates the multi-media transport of pesticides within paddy ecosystems, including dynamic interactions between soil, water, and crops. It accounts for various processes such as pesticide adsorption, degradation, runoff, and leakage, which may not be addressed by other generic models. Furthermore, the model is tailored to simulate the subtropical monsoon climate scenario, making it particularly relevant to the region selected for this study. Moreover, its use is recommended by governments and regulators for assessing the environmental impact of pesticides, facilitating the acceptance of research findings by policymakers. Consequently, this study aims to utilize the TOP-RICE model to examine the dynamics of five commonly used pesticides (chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, azoxystrobin, and acetochlor) applied in rice paddies across countries with distinct climates and temperature conditions, including China and Pakistan with the objectives of assessing environmental risk in rice across different climate and conditions of both the countries. The potential ecological risks in the rice paddy ecosystem, encompassing surface water, soil, and groundwater, will be assessed by analyzing the risk quotient for algae, Lemna minor , daphnia, and fish. This research is expected to provide valuable information for guiding rice cultivation practices that ensure food security while minimizing environmental impact. This approach is essential for achieving the SDGs and promoting sustainable agricultural practices that safeguard the delicate balance between food production and a healthy ecosystem.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The study areas for this research are located in Southern China and the Punjab province of Pakistan, all with a long history of rice cultivation. The rice-growing area in Southern China accounts for over 60 % of the total rice cultivation area in China, contributing to over half of the national rice production (NBSPRC, 1989–2018 ). The rice production in Punjab province constitutes >60 % of the total rice production in Pakistan (Khan et al., 2021 ). Specific locations are shown in Fig. 1  , including Changsha (CS), Hangzhou (HZ), and Nanning (NN) in southern China, and Lahore (LH) and Faisalabad (FL) in Punjab province of Pakistan. The physicochemical properties of the studied paddy soil in China and Pakistani were obtained from references shown in Table 1  . The climate in the Chinese study sites (Changsha, Hangzhou, Nanning) is characterized by abundant rainfall (>1300 mm annually) and four distinct seasons, with an average annual temperature exceeding 16 °C, typical of a subtropical monsoon climate. In contrast, Lahore and Faisalabad in Pakistan experience a dry subtropical continental climate with little rainfall (125–500 mm annually).  2.2 Pesticides registered on rice We analyzed registration data for single-dose pesticide products specifically designed for rice cultivation in China until July 2023, querying the Chinese Pesticide Information Network (http://www.chinapesticide.org.cn/ ). This analysis revealed a high prevalence of single-dose products, with 520 registered for Chlorpyrifos, 281 for pymetrozine, 146 for dinotefuran, 180 for azoxystrobin, and 30 for acetochlor. Due to the complexity of combined effects in multi-component formulations and the lack of established evaluation criteria for compound preparations, this study focused solely on single-dose products. To understand the potential environmental impact, we analyzed the application methods, rates, and timing for these five commonly used rice pesticides (chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, azoxystrobin, and acetochlor).  2.3 Top-Rice model The TOP-RICE model (ICAMA, 2014 ) was employed to predict the concentration of pesticides infiltrating groundwater at a depth of 1 m and the exposure concentration in pond water flowing into natural ponds through surface runoff. This model integrates three sub-models:SWAP: Simulates soil, water flow, and heat transfer within the rice paddy's water-soil-groundwater system.  Paddy-PEARL: Focuses on simulating pesticide adsorption, migration, and transformation within this system.  TOXSWA: Simulates water migration and pesticide behavior in natural ponds.    By utilizing the TOP-RICE model and the risk quotient (RQ) recommended in the Guidelines for Environmental Risk Assessment of Pesticide Registration (PCR, 2016 ), we simulated the impacts of the five selected pesticides individually on aquatic ecosystems in the chosen regions. This analysis allowed us to calculate the predicted exposure concentrations of pesticides in both groundwater within rice paddies and nearby natural ponds. The exposure analysis using the model required the collection of data that includes the physical and chemical properties of the pesticide, the method of use, and the environmental fate (Table 2  ).  2.4 Model input parameters Analysis of five single-dose pesticide products registered for rice cultivation in China, obtained from the Chinese Pesticide Information Network (http://www.chinapesticide.org.cn/ ), revealed that the optimal application period coincides with the peak hatching period of rice planthopper eggs or the blooming period of young nymphs. As the pest stage typically occurs at the end of rice tillering, the simulation was conducted during this growth stage (BBCH code BBCH20–29 according to the Julius Kühn-Institut – Bundesforschungsinstitut für Kulturpflanzen (JKI) // German Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants, Federal Plant Variety Office (Bundessortenamt and Chemical industry system). Four applications were simulated with a 7-day interval (Table 3  ). This table also presents the simulated groups for different pesticides, with Group I representing the highest application amount and Group II representing the lowest. Environmental risk assessment of pesticides relies on data encompassing physicochemical properties, environmental behavior, and ecotoxicity. Data collection involved literature searches conducted in the five study regions. Missing data were obtained from various sources, including the Pesticide Action Network (PAN) (https://www.panna.org/ ), the Pesticide Properties Database (PPDB) (https://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/iupac/search.htm ), the ECOTOX Knowledgebase (https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/search.cfm ), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports (https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/publications ), among others.  2.5 Prediction and risk assessment of exposure concentrations Following the “Guidelines for Environmental Risk Assessment for Pesticide Registration Part 2: Aquatic Ecosystems” (PRC, 2016 ), primary ecological effects assessments were conducted for the five pesticides across the studied rice paddies. When an organism had multiple toxicity endpoints, the highest value was chosen. The predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) (μg/L) was derived from the ecotoxicity endpoint data (EnP) of the pesticide obtained from the aforementioned databases, along with the corresponding uncertainty factor (UF). The calculation formula is presented in Eq. (1) .(1) PNEC = EnP UF      The environmental concentrations predicted by the model are used for the primary risk assessment of pesticide exposure to surface water aquatic ecosystems through the risk quotient (RQ), i.e. the ratio of the measured or model-predicted environmental exposure concentration (PEC) with the PNEC value of the substance as a characterization of risk. The calculation formula is shown in Eq. (2) .(2) RQ = PEC PNEC     RQ: Risk Quotient  PEC: Predicted Environmental Concentration (μg/L)  PNEC: Predicted No-Effect Concentration (μg/L)    A RQ >1 (RQ > 1) suggests an unacceptable environmental risk associated with the compound. Conversely, an RQ <1 (RQ < 1) indicates an acceptable level of environmental risk. The environmental concentrations predicted by the TOP-RICE model (PEC, μg/L) were used to assess the primary risk of pesticide exposure to surface water aquatic ecosystems by calculating RQ. Our primary goal for environmental risk control aligns with the regulations promoting the sustainability of freshwater resources and aquatic ecosystems. Specifically, pesticide use should not cause short- or long-term adverse effects on aquatic spinal animals, nor long-term effects on primary producers and invertebrate populations. To evaluate these potential effects, we selected fish, daphnia, Lemna minor  and algae as representatives of these ecological groups. Fish represent spinal animals, daphnia represent invertebrates, and algae represent primary producers, all commonly found in freshwater ecosystems. For each organism, we considered two toxicity endpoints:Chronic Toxicity Endpoint: The maximum concentration at which no adverse effects were observed (NOEC).  Acute Toxicity Endpoint: The lethal concentration (LC50 ) or the concentration affecting growth (EC50 ) to 50 % of the test population.    The peak environmental concentration (PECmax) predicted by the TOP-RICE model was used as the environmental predicted concentration for acute toxicity assessment. The time-weighted average concentration (TWAEC) of the 28-day concentrations predicted by the model was used for chronic toxicity assessment. Since the number of species evaluated was less than eight, safety factors (AF) of 100 and 10 were applied for chronic and acute toxicity (PCR, 2016 ), respectively. These safety factors account for potential variations in sensitivity among different species within an ecological group.  2.6 Statistical analysis ArcMap 10.7 (ESRI, USA) was used for spatial visualization of all data. Data were processed using Microsoft Excel 2019 and statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to identify significant differences between groups. Two significance levels were used to define statistical significance: p  < 0.05 (*) and p  < 0.01 (**).   3 Results 3.1 Simulation on pesticide exposure The TOXSWA model calculated the predicted peak environmental concentration (PECmax) of pesticides applied during the tilling stage of rice cultivation in various locations (Fig. 2  ). Notably, the PECmax were consistently higher for early rice compared to late rice, suggesting a greater acute risk associated with pesticide use during the early season. Across all five pesticides studied (acetochlor, chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, and azoxystrobin), the city of Faisalabad exhibited the highest PECmax when applying the same dosage. The exception was acetochlor, which reached its peak concentration in Nanning. Specific concentration ranges are listed as follows. For acetochlor, the PECmax ranged from 167.22 to 1556.89 μg/L in Changsha, 228.52 to 1756.60 μg/L in Hangzhou, and reached its maximum (361.99–2184.01 μg/L) in Nanning. For chlorpyrifos, Changsha had a range of 111.72 to 487.17 μg/L, Hangzhou of 146.81 to 539.75 μg/L, Nanning 110.52 to 301.11 μg/L, while Lahore and Faisalabad showed similar ranges of 167.04–561.19 μg/L and 169.02–564.25 μg/L, respectively. For pymetrozine; the PECmax in Changsha ranged from 20.79 to 94.40 μg/L, 30.82–109.90 μg/L in Hangzhou, and 24.14–64.24 μg/L in Nanning. Similar to chlorpyrifos, Lahore and Faisalabad exhibited comparable ranges for pymetrozines of 34.97–111.80 μg/L and 35.66–111.60 μg/L, respectively. In the case of dinotefuran, Changsha had a range of 21.81–96.42 μg/L, Hangzhou of 27.41–106.73 μg/L, and Nanning of 26.99–70.59 μg/L. Once again, Lahore and Faisalabad showed similar ranges of 34.44–113.49 μg/L and 34.99–114.02 μg/L, respectively. Lastly, for azoxystrobin, the PECmax ranged from 16.52 to 56.63 μg/L in Changsha, 16.91 to 56.94 μg/L in Hangzhou, and 18.75 to 54.78 μg/L in Nanning. Similar to the other pesticides, Lahore and Faisalabad had comparable ranges of 16.99–56.54 μg/L and 17.20–55.46 μg/L, respectively. The concentrations of five pesticides (acetochlor, chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, and azoxystrobin) in the natural pond water of paddy fields were simulated for 90 days following application at different doses during the tillering stage of both early and late rice (Fig. 3  ). The time-weighted average exposure concentration (TWA) for the water layer throughout the year was selected and simulated. The data comprised 23 entries, covering four pesticides (chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, and azoxystrobin) at five sites (Changsha [CS], Hangzhou [HZ], Nanning [NN], Lahore [LH], and Faisalabad [FL]) and one pesticide (acetochlor) at three sites (CS, HZ, and NN). Due to degradation and sorption, the overall concentration of pesticide residues decreased over time. The initial concentrations of the pesticides in the highest application group (Group I) decreased as follows after 90 days: chlorpyrifos from 220.72 to 564.18 μg/L to 4.1–35.01 μg/L, pymetrozine from 41.58 to 114.60 μg/L to 0.96–8.35 μg/L, dinotefuran from 43.61 to 114.01 μg/L to 1.09–7.64 μg/L, azoxystrobin from 29.57 to 55.71 μg/L to 1.45–4.22 μg/L, and acetochlor from 668.93 to 2184.01 μg/L to 15.95–356.70 μg/L. Similarly, in the lowest application group (Group II), the decreases over 90 days were: chlorpyrifos from 110.36 to 282.15 μg/L to 2.05–18.29 μg/L, pymetrozine from 20.79 to 57.30 μg/L to 0.48–4.18 μg/L, dinotefuran from 21.81 to 56.75 μg/L to 0.55–3.98 μg/L, azoxystrobin from 16.52 to 28.46 μg/L to 0.72–1.98 μg/L, and acetochlor from 167.22 to 545.99 μg/L to 3.99–89.16 μg/L. Among the simulated pesticides, acetochlor displayed the highest initial concentration in natural ponds, ranging from 167.22 to 2184.01 μg/L. After 90 days, these concentrations declined to a range of 3.99 to 356.70 μg/L. Chlorpyrifos followed with degraded concentrations ranging from 2.05 to 35.01 μg/L. Except for acetochlor in Nanning, all pesticide concentrations dropped by >90 % after 90 days.  3.2 Potential toxicity and risk characterization Effective toxicity endpoint values (EnPs) from standardized ecotoxicological studies were used to calculate the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values, considering the corresponding uncertainty factor (UF). The toxicity endpoints and uncertainty factors were evaluated according to the guidelines (PCR, 2016 ). The PNEC values for various pesticides on different types of aquatic organisms are presented in Tables 4–8      . The model-predicted environmental concentrations were employed to assess the primary risk of surface water aquatic ecosystems in different sites using the risk quotient (RQ). Each figure presents the RQ values for vertebrates and invertebrates exposed to high and low doses of pesticides, for a total of 8 data points (Fig. 4  ). This study assessed the environmental risk of five pesticides applied at different rates and times in five locations using the TOP-RICE model and risk quotients (RQ). The RQ compares predicted environmental pesticide concentrations (Fig. 5  ) with established thresholds for acute and chronic toxicity to fish, invertebrates, Lemna minor  and algae. As shown in Fig. 5 , the RQs for acute toxicity to fish and invertebrates ranged from 0.018 to 188.92 and 0.02 to 5.6 × 105 , respectively. Chronic toxicity RQs for fish, invertebrates, Lemna minor  and algae ranged from 2 × 10−4  to 2.29 × 103 , 3 × 10−4  to 0.77, 1 × 10−4  to 2.5 × 10−3  and 2 × 10−4  to 5 × 10−3 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 6  , chlorpyrifos and acetochlor posed the greatest risk of chronic toxicity, with RQs ranging from 0.14 to 2.29 × 103  and 0.04 to 51.52, respectively. Notably, the risk from chlorpyrifos was lower in Nanning due to its faster degradation rate compared to Lahore and Faisalabad. Conversely, the longer degradation half-life of acetochlor in Nanning led to higher residual concentrations and a higher risk quotient compared to Hunan and Hangzhou. The risk quotients of other pesticides did not show significant differences across the five locations, likely due to minimal variations in soil properties. Interestingly, for the same application dose, Faisalabad exhibited the highest acute RQs for chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, and azoxystrobin, while Nanning had the highest RQ for acetochlor. Similarly, except for acetochlor, chronic RQs were highest in Faisalabad. Similar to fish and invertebrates, chlorpyrifos and acetochlor posed the main chronic toxicity threat to algae, with RQs ranging from 0.14 to 2.48 and 0.04 to 3.41, respectively. All other calculated RQs for algae were <1, indicating minimal risk. In summary, this study identified chlorpyrifos and acetochlor as potential chronic toxicity risks, particularly in locations where pesticides are slower degraded. Further investigation into mitigating these risks is warranted.   4 Discussion Our study employed the Top-Rice model to simulate pesticide fate. However, this model has limitations that could affect the accuracy of our results compared to real-world scenarios: (1) the model does not account for pesticide degradation by sunlight on the soil surface, which underestimates degradation rates; (2) the model utilizes conservative values for some physical and chemical properties of pesticides, which might lead to underestimation of degradation or overestimation of persistence; (3) the model assumes standardized application times, amounts, and drift rates, which may differ from actual field practices and (4) risks were assessed for individual pesticides, not taking into account cumulative risks from exposures to multiple pesticides within formulations or due to co-application of multiple formulations. 4.1 Fate of pesticides in rice paddies and the corresponding environments Following application, the pesticides enter the atmosphere, soil, and water. Soil adsorption and degradation of the selected pesticides were prominent, with a rapid decline (70–90 %) observed within the first 20 days. Chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, and dinotefuran exhibited the highest Potential Exposure Concentrations (PECs) in Faisalabad due to their longer hydrolysis half-lives, which is 1–3 times higher than in other regions. In Nanning, acetochlor had the highest PEC due to its slower degradation in that region. After 90 days, the degradation rate of acetochlor in Nanning remained at about 74 %–84 %, which was 12 % lower than that in other areas. Higher application rates translated to higher concentrations in paddy water. This explains the dominance of acetochlor and chlorpyrifos, with application rates 10–100 times and 10 times higher, respectively, compared to other pesticides. Chlorpyrifos, due to its lipophilicity primarily adsorbs to soil particles following application, which limits its presence in the water. Azoxystrobin's degradation rate was lower due to its initially lower concentration (16.52–56.94 μg/L) across locations. Additionally, its concentration in water environments further decreased due to degradation and sorption to sediment. Pyraphidone displayed similar loss rates in Hunan and Guangxi, likely due to comparable temperatures and environmental conditions. Tudi et al. (2022)  suggest variations in soil types and organic matter content as potential reasons for differing degradation rates in other regions. Only dinotefuran was predicted to reach groundwater (1 m depth) by the TOXSWA model, as expected due to its high water solubility and low soil adsorption. Its concentration (0.00–1.58 μg/L) was significantly lower than in natural ponds, with the highest levels observed in early rice grown in Hangzhou (0.61–1.58 μg/L). Chlorpyrifos and acetochlor, despite potential risks to surface water, were not detected or showed minimal presence in groundwater. This emphasizes the effectiveness of soil adsorption and filtration in preventing deeper contamination. Fu et al. (2015)  reported rapid degradation rates (>95 %) for chlorpyrifos in paddy soil within 10 days, exceeding our simulated values. This difference likely stems from our model not accounting for photodegradation, a significant factor in real-world scenarios. Our simulated dinotefuran concentrations (22.8 mg/L in group I and 12.6 mg/L in group II) were comparable to field measurements (Qin and Hu, 2023 ) with concentrations of 18 mg/L and 9 mg/L after 7 days. This suggests the model accurately predicts short-term behavior for this pesticide. Wei et al. (2022)  observed pymetrozine residues (4–8 mg/L) in rice straw and brown rice, which were lower than, but aligned with, our simulated values (6–12 mg/L). This indicates the model provides a conservative estimate of long-term pymetrozine persistence. These comparisons demonstrate the model's ability to reasonably predict pesticide behavior, particularly for short-term dynamics.  4.2 Potential risk to organisms and ecosystems Among the five pesticides, the main factors contributing to high potential ecological risk were residue levels, inherent toxicity, and persistence in the environment. High application rates, as with acetochlor, resulted in substantial amounts of residues, increasing the risk of exposure for aquatic organisms. Chlorpyrifos, despite lower residual levels, exhibited inherently high toxicity to aquatic life, explaining its comparable risk to acetochlor. Additionally, locations like Faisalabad, where chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, and dinotefuran had longer half-lives, resulted in higher predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and consequently, greater ecological risk. The study also highlights the influence of regional factors on the risk of pesticides. Variations in soil organic matter content and pH determine how strongly pesticides adsorb to soil particles. This, in turn, impacts their persistence and potential mobility into water bodies, influencing ecological risk. Similarly, differences in precipitation and temperature can influence the degradation rate of pesticides in soil, affecting their environmental persistence and overall risk. These factors all contribute to the observed variations in potential ecological risk across the studied pesticides and locations. This study revealed that the risk posed by the pesticides varied significantly depending on the type of organism. Lemna minor  and algae, categorized as primary producers, faced lower risks compared to fish and other vertebrates, as well as invertebrates. This difference likely arises because pesticides accumulate in the food chain, posing a greater threat to organisms higher in the chain like fish, which consume contaminated prey. Among vertebrates (fish), chlorpyrifos posed the greatest risk, followed by acetochlor and azoxystrobin. Interestingly, acute toxicity risks were generally higher than chronic risks for fish. A similar pattern emerged for invertebrates, with chlorpyrifos displaying the highest risk (both acute and chronic). Notably, chlorpyrifos posed a greater risk to invertebrates than to fish and algae. Conversely, for fish, chronic risk from chlorpyrifos exceeded the acute risk. Pymetrozine and dinotefuran offered a different picture. Due to their low residual concentrations, they posed minimal risk to fish. However, dinotefuran presented an acute risk to invertebrates, while azoxystrobin posed a mild acute risk to both fish and invertebrates. Following established risk assessment guidelines (PRC, 2016 ), scenarios with 60 % of time points having risk quotients (RQ) below 1 and the remaining 40 % below 10 are considered low risk. Based on these criteria, pymetrozine and dinotefuran pose acceptable risks. Overall, the study identified chlorpyrifos and acetochlor as the main contributors to ecological risk due to their persistence and inherent toxicity to aquatic life. Existing research corroborates the findings of this study regarding the ecological risks posed by chlorpyrifos and acetochlor. Wang et al. (2019a)  demonstrated the acute toxicity of acetochlor to zebrafish, causing developmental abnormalities and behavioral changes. Similarly, numerous studies (Giddings et al., 2014 ; Huang et al., 2020 ; Wee and Aris, 2017 ) conducted a survey of chlorpyrifos exposure in the Langat River Basin, and their results showed that chlorpyrifos has caused negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystem. Wu et al. (2011)  suggested that after chlorpyrifos is used in paddy fields, residual chlorpyrifos in nearby water can be detected posing ecological risks to aquatic ecosystems. Our study arrived at a similar conclusion, highlighting that the risk to aquatic ecosystems from chlorpyrifos is unacceptable.  4.3 Environmental management on rice paddy area This research provides scientific data to support safe environmental practices for pesticide use and technical guidance for registration and risk mitigation. It is vital for protecting freshwater resources beyond farmlands. However, pesticide risk assessment has limitations. Uncertainties arise from unpredictable factors like weather and variations in soil composition that models can't fully capture. Additionally, choosing input parameters for the model can be subjective, potentially affecting accuracy. To address this, models should be designed to prioritize underestimating risk, providing a safety buffer. Additionally, continuous refinement is needed to minimize uncertainties and improve evaluation accuracy. Fortunately, China has made significant progress in pesticide exposure models and risk assessment. Standardized practices have been developed based on China's specific agricultural needs, drawing on best practices from other nations for more effective risk management around the world. The current TOP-RICE model is user-friendly, runs smoothly, and its predictions for paddy fields closely match real-world measurements. Looking ahead, further improvements are needed. The model can be improved to account for the cumulative risks of co-occurring and co-applied formulations, thereby making the simulation results more realistic and reliable. Moreover, integrating models for dryland crops and water bodies would allow for more comprehensive simulations across entire basins. Additionally, developing a comprehensive model that considers the whole watershed would provide a more realistic tool for pesticide management decisions. By addressing these limitations and pursuing further development, China's pesticide risk assessment system can be significantly enhanced.   5 Conclusions This study investigated the PECmax of five commonly used rice pad herbicides: chlorpyrifos, pymetrozine, dinotefuran, azoxystrobin, and acetochlor. The analysis showed that the peak concentration ranges of chlorpyrifos and acetochlor were 220.72–561.18 mg/L and 668.93–2184.00 mg/L, respectively, which were 5 and 20 times higher than the peak concentration ranges of pymetrozine, dinotefuran, and azoxystrobin. Notably, the RQs of all studied pesticide applications on early rice were twice as high as those in late rice. The ecological risk assessment revealed varying levels of risk across the pesticides. Pymetrozine and dinotefuran posed minimal acute risks to vertebrates (RQs < 0.12) and acceptable chronic risks to invertebrates and primary producers (RQs < 0.77). Azoxystrobin displayed acceptable chronic risk (RQs < 0.92), but some acute risk to fish (RQs > 2.30). Conversely, both chlorpyrifos and acetochlor posed significant acute and chronic risks to aquatic organisms, with RQs exceeding 6.76 for acute and 3.64 for chronic effects. Stronger regulation of 3 more of these pesticides has already begun, especially in Europe countries due to their environmental risks. While developing countries such as China, Pakistan, and Vietnam, etc. have not yet implemented a complete ban, a more in-depth investigation into their use is recommended. This investigation should include a comprehensive risk reevaluation across various aspects. Additionally, implementing risk reduction measures, such as reducing application rates, adjusting application timing and safety intervals, or extending post-application land closure periods, should be considered. The effectiveness of these measures should be evaluated to ensure a significant reduction in risk to aquatic ecosystems. The study also highlights that certain azoxystrobin products pose varying degrees of risk to aquatic ecosystems (with RQs ranging from 2.30 to 13.48), particularly to aquatic communities in agricultural areas. This finding emphasizes the importance of careful consideration during pesticide registration and reevaluation processes in the future.
