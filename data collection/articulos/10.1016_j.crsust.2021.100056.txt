                  Sustainable development ('SD') is a longstanding internationally accepted and adopted policy concept, but little is known about how well it is understood and applied by public decision-makers. This article enhances that understanding by empirically examining public servant experiences within the State of Victoria, Australia.
                  Thematic and statistical analyses of 35 semi-structured interviews and 97 online survey responses yield seven key insights: (1) SD is more widely understood than the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), although variable understandings exist for both, and participants indicate neither are being widely or consistently implemented; (2) Definitions of SD are inconsistent, and a holistic understanding of the concept is absent within some decision-makers' intuitive thinking, but potential for consensus exists; (3) Applications and interpretations of the polluter pays and precautionary principles of sustainable development are similarly varied; (4) Legislative and institutional structures are likely contributing to the latter findings; (5) Implementation is considerably impacted upon by heuristics and framing; (6) Leadership is recognised as a necessary catalyst for the achievement of the SDGs within Victoria; and, encouragingly, (7) public decision-makers possess many ideas for enhancing intergenerational equity, and overall decision-making effectiveness.
                  These novel insights illustrate sustainable development is not being consistently considered or achieved by public decision-makers in Victoria, and that solutions can and must be identified and implemented to achieve the 'future we want'.

Sustainable development ('SD') is a longstanding internationally accepted and adopted policy concept, but little is known about how well it is understood and applied by public decision-makers. This article enhances that understanding by empirically examining public servant experiences within the State of Victoria, Australia. Thematic and statistical analyses of 35 semi-structured interviews and 97 online survey responses yield seven key insights: (1) SD is more widely understood than the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), although variable understandings exist for both, and participants indicate neither are being widely or consistently implemented; (2) Definitions of SD are inconsistent, and a holistic understanding of the concept is absent within some decision-makers' intuitive thinking, but potential for consensus exists; (3) Applications and interpretations of the polluter pays and precautionary principles of sustainable development are similarly varied; (4) Legislative and institutional structures are likely contributing to the latter findings; (5) Implementation is considerably impacted upon by heuristics and framing; (6) Leadership is recognised as a necessary catalyst for the achievement of the SDGs within Victoria; and, encouragingly, (7) public decision-makers possess many ideas for enhancing intergenerational equity, and overall decision-making effectiveness. These novel insights illustrate sustainable development is not being consistently considered or achieved by public decision-makers in Victoria, and that solutions can and must be identified and implemented to achieve the 'future we want '.   Keywords Sustainable development  Sustainable Development Goals  Public policy  Leadership  Public administration    1 Introduction While some may argue sustainable development ('SD') is embedded or 'aligned' within public decisions, what causes it to be considered directly in public decision-making and how is often unclear. Despite international, national and subnational legislation and agreements designed to increase consideration of sustainable development (Parliament of Victoria, 1970 ; Australian Government, 1992 ; CoAG, 1992 ; UN, 1992 ; Parliament of Victoria, 1997 ; Parliament of Australia, 1999 ; Parliament of Victoria, 2003 ; UNFCCC, 2015 ; UNGA, 2012 ; UNGA, 2015a, 2015b ), repeated examples of unsustainable public outcomes, irrespective of the governing party, suggest barriers to advancing sustainable development within public decisions exist. Outcomes indicating underachievement across local, national, and international domains include: growing inequalities within nations impacting upon social cohesion and wellbeing (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009 ); 90% of those living in cities breathing polluted air (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2018 ); rises in non-communicable disease (Kyu et al., 2018 ); increased risk and impact from zoonotic diseases (De Sadeleer and Godfroid, 2020 ); increased land degradation and associated trillion-dollar losses of ecosystem services (Sutton et al., 2016 ); recurring bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef (ARC Coral Coe, 2020 ); unprecedented bushfires (Davey and Sarre, 2020 ; Binskin et al., 2020 ); muted action on climate change (Ripple et al., 2020 ; BoM, 2020 ); and, the globe having entered a new geological age, the ‘Anthropocene’, as a consequence of people failing to adequately recognise physical planetary limits (Crutzen, 2002 ; Rockström et al., 2009 ; Steffen et al., 2015 ). Many other examples and references exist. Since 2015, the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals ('SDGs' or 'the Goals') have embodied international efforts to achieve SD (UNGA, 2015b ). Adopted by all 193 UN member states, the 17 Goals contain specific and general targets enabling monitoring of their progress. Recent reports indicate that based on those targets and levels of awareness within the country, Australian governments have been comparatively slow to identify and implement mechanisms to achieve the SDGs - Australia ranks 37th  on global SDG progress indicators (National Sustainable Development Council, 2018 ; Allen et al., 2020 ; Sachs et al., 2020 ; Thwaites et al., 2020 ). Further, the Inquiry report of the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Senate Committee (Parliament of Australia, 2019 ), which yielded 164 written submissions and numerous public-hearings, made 18 recommendations, including that: federal and subnational implementation plans be created; the Australian government integrate the Goals into 'all internal and external websites, strategies and policies '; and public awareness of the Goals be improved. The report also noted that the Inquiry is 'the first time the parliament has engaged with the SDGs in a comprehensive manner '. It is thus disappointing that the final report was tabled quickly and without discussion on the final Senate sitting day of the 45th  Parliament, and has not been the subject of further parliamentary debate (based on a March 2021 search of Hansard) 1  1 It should be noted that Senator Claire Moore, a member of the Committee who undertook the Inquiry, referred to the report in her final parliamentary speech (February 14, 2019) and in Senate Estimates on April 8 and 9, 2019, prior to her retirement on April 11, 2019. None of these triggered further debate or discussion.  . The importance of such a report and its recommendations becomes clearer when one considers how Australia implements international agreements and conventions. Australia is a federated nation, with the ‘division of powers’ between the national and subnational governments expressed within s51 of the Australian Constitution : the national Parliament has legislated power to make laws regarding 39 specified matters; anything not specified typically falls to the subnational parliaments. However, the delineation of responsibility between the different tiers of government is not always clear, and multilevel governance of issues not uncommon (e.g. Tasmanian Dam Case, Yencken, 2002 ). For example, the Australian federal government joined other global leaders in adopting the SDGs under its constitutional external affairs power, but many of the targets and Goals ultimately rely on the efforts (and political preferences) of subnational governments, who are often responsible for more contemporary or localised matters (DFAT, 2018 ).This is also illustrated in the commitment of the various tiers of Australian government to the concept of SD within the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development  (1992) and Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment  (CoAG, 1992 ) - the history, detail and implementation of which are beyond the scope of this paper but discussed with care by others (Dovers, 2013 ; Hollander, 2015 ; MacIntosh, 2015 ; Pittock et al., 2015 ; Burnett, 2018 ; Coffey, 2019 ). Moreover, stemming from these national agreements, Australia's subnational states and territories have also embedded the commitment to sustainable development within their primary and subordinate legislation. Hence, while the SDGs have not explicitly been ratified as a subnational government responsibility, given the division of powers, pre-existing subnational commitments to the broader concept of sustainable development, and the customary role of subnational jurisdictions in altering and implementing local practices to enable the nation to deliver on its international commitments, it is reasonable to argue Australian subnational jurisdictions have a genuine role in implementing the Goals. This example of multilevel governance is a situation shared by many other federated nations. Located in Australia's southeast, the subnational State of Victoria is analogous in population size (~6.7 million) and governance style and structure (Westminster) to many other jurisdictions both within Australia and internationally. While theoretically only elected  government officials make public decisions, in practice the bureaucracy provides significant support and advice to the elected government, and it is often on this advice that government decisions are made. Therefore, bureaucrats' contributions can be seen to directly influence elected government decisions and the resulting outcomes (Hinchy, 2008 , p. 57, 265, Althaus et al., 2013 , p. 13–14, 24). Yet, despite it being these actors who develop, implement, evaluate and influence policy decisions, with some exceptions (e.g. Coffey, 2013, 2015 ; Rickards et al., 2014 ), the practices and experiences of Victoria's public decision-makers regarding sustainable development do not appear to have been widely sought or documented. Noting the importance of these actors, the somewhat limited understanding of how subnational decision-makers conceptualise and operate to achieve sustainable development, and, considering 'public decision-making' as the act of making any  decision on behalf of the public (akin to Dye (1975) ), this paper considers anyone employed within the public sector who develops, establishes, or implements public decisions to be a 'public decision-maker'. Such persons are not always public servants per se  and may also be contractors or consultants brought inhouse to augment public sector capacity for set periods, or others operating within government corporations who may not consider themselves public servants but nonetheless make decisions on behalf of the public. Greater consideration of the perspectives of those who make public decisions across all departments, levels, and areas of decision-making influence, may help to explain why outcomes in-line with sustainable development are inconsistently achieved. This study empirically builds on the state of knowledge through exploration of the experiences and practices of public decision-makers within or with ties to the Victorian Public Service ('VPS') - the core civil service of Victoria - reflecting the authoritative choice paradigm (Dye, 1975 ; Colebatch, 2020 ). In doing so, it addresses the issues of (1) how public decision-makers conceptualise SD and the SDGs, and (2) how these conceptualisations impact their public decision-making practice and associated public outcomes. For clarity and ease of reading by multiple audiences, the article follows a traditional structure except for the results and discussion. These are combined to cover i. the concept of sustainable development (Section 3 . Results & Discussion I: Understandings and Applications of Sustainable Development) and ii. the SDGs as a framework in service of that concept (Section 4 . Results & Discussion II: Understandings and Applications of SDGs). This approach allows both for the resulting participant voices to feature within  and add depth to the discussion, and for the distinct - but as found here often conflated - concept of sustainable development and framework of the SDGs to be discussed without confusion.  2 Methods To garner breadth and depth of input, and to address biases inherent in individual data collection methods, both semi-structured interviews and a predominantly Likert-scale survey were employed. 2.1 Interviews Thirty-five participants were recruited via formal invitations and asked a series of open questions on their decision-making practices, and considerations of sustainable development and the SDGs. Potential interviewees were identified based on role, portfolio and organisation, or as a result of snowball sampling – where early participants identify or suggest other potential participants (Bryman, 2016 ). Participants provided written consent indicating their attribution and identification preferences. Interviews were audio-recorded and verbatim transcribed prior to inductive thematic analysis within the NVivo  software platform (Frith and Gleeson, 2004 ; Braun and Clarke, 2006 ).  2.2 Survey An online survey was created and conducted within the Qualtrics  survey platform. Questions were adapted from those put to interviewees to allow for closed responses but were otherwise identical. Where multiple choice or Likert scale questions were posed, the options presented were typically summaries derived from the interviewees' responses. Thus, survey participants acted to validate or otherwise add quantitative understanding to the qualitative insights provided by interviewees. Repeated advertisement over six weeks, via social media platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) and direct emails to interviewees and contacts within the VPS, yielded 97 complete responses. Of these completed surveys, all participants indicated an awareness of sustainable development and were asked subsequent questions about it. However, only 69 indicated an awareness of the SDGs and 28 participants were, therefore, asked no detailed questions concerning their knowledge and application of the Goals.  2.3 Demographics Broadly, participants:(1) Represent all 2017–18 VPS departments – the majority from the Department of Environment Land Water and Planning or its portfolio agencies ('DELWP') (see Table 1  );  (2) Cover the spectrum of seniority levels within the VPS – interviewees are evenly spread across mid-senior official levels, and survey participants represent all levels;  (3) Have worked within the public sector (Victorian or otherwise) on average for 16.9 years (interviewees: 21 years, survey participants: 12.7 years);  (4) Represent a wide array of public decision-making areas (i.e., despite large representation from DELWP, participant experiences cover the spectrum of the public sector); and,  (5) Predominantly have experience in bureaucratic settings but also legislative settings and the private sector. One interviewee, who now works in the executive, had a judicial background, however, no other direct experience within the judiciary was recorded.      3 Results & discussion I: Understanding and applications of sustainable development I get quite sad about the fact that we're still arguing about climate change. And that's just a symbol, we're still arguing about the impacts that we're currently having… so, whether it's plastic in the oceans or whatever it is. And so, until we join up our thinking, and until we think about the joined-up consequences of what we're doing and then start planning for something different, then we're in trouble .   - Chairman, EPA Victoria  3.1 Awareness of sustainable development All participants were aware of SD but, their familiarity with it varied significantly (Fig. 1  ). As many public servants are provided with 'key messages' around their organisation's priorities and responses to issues throughout the year, so they can confidently and accurately talk to their work at informal gatherings such as family BBQs, the 'BBQ conversation' was used as a familiarity yardstick. The fact that 85% of survey participants indicated they could host at least this level of conversation on sustainable development suggests they are confident in their knowledge and awareness of the concept and its application.  3.2 Definitions of sustainable development While all participants were aware of sustainable development as a concept, their definitions varied and rarely did people talk to a single conceptualisation of what it meant. When asked 'How would you define sustainable development?' , interviewees advised it is about: resilience, and this generation 'not stealing from the next '; not having an impact, and using resources wisely; maintaining and improving things; continuing to do things ad infinitum ; societal development; incorporating externalities, and the triple bottom line; and, integrated decision-making more broadly. Moreover, some reasoned their way through the words to arrive at their given definition, then provided different responses when prompted to discuss SD in the context of their work. This may indicate that though they are capable of discerning SD when applying deliberative (or System 2) thinking, as a holistic concept it is absent from some participants' intuitive (or System 1) thinking (Kahneman, 2003 ). Several participants described SD as 'woolly'  and 'amorphous',  and in need of 'measurable elements'  and greater definition to be applied. One Secretary replied, 'This is like, " What's your definition of God?" really' . Others, including those with extensive environmental policy experience, stated SD is an unachievable utopia: 'It's not a real concept, it's just a nice to pretend we can achieve, but I actually don't think we can'  (Mid-Level Official, DELWP). A very senior bureaucrat at DELWP acknowledged much of the above, as well as other views reflecting dominant societal paradigms (e.g. neoliberal economics or economic rationalism2  2 n.b.  Neoliberalism is equated with economic rationalism by some in Australia, Barnes et al. (2018)  provide commentary on this reflecting on applications of neoliberalism and variations in interpretations.  , consumption habits, etc.), before concluding that intellectually sustainable development has to reflect the Limits to Growth  model of Meadows et al. (1972) :Because ultimately-- In 1972, there's this great photo from a spacecraft… the blue marble photo… for the very first time, we could see that in fact the Earth is a very frail thing. And that the atmosphere is only 15 kilometres thick… Everything that goes on in it is stuck in there and so we'd better do it properly .   These variations and difficulty in honing-in on a single definition are not altogether surprising when the Victorian legislation is looked to for definitional guidance. At the time of the interviews there were 69 operational Acts with the word 'sustainable' but, just one which defined it - the Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability Act 2003  (Vic) ('the CES Act') (Fig. 2  ) 3  3 The legal definition of sustainable development in Victoria’s primary legislation was sought by searching for the term ‘sustainable’ in current Acts in the ‘Victorian Law Today Library’ (http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au) on May 1, 2016. Each Act identified was reviewed and assigned to one of five categories: (1) Reference is to other Acts with ‘sustainable’ in their name; (2) Term is not used in a sustainable development context; (3) Term appears to be used in a SD context but no definition or principles are provided; (4) Principles provided; or, (5) Legal definition provided.  . The latter is not referred to by any other Victorian Acts and is essentially a document with the legislative function of setting out the duties of the Commissioner. Therefore, there is little reason for public decision-makers or others unaffiliated with the Commissioner to refer to the CES Act and have their definition of sustainable development guided by it. Further, while the CES Act has a similar definition to that provided within Our Common Future  (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ), it draws on the aforementioned National Strategy on Ecologically Sustainable Development and is arguably somewhat more ecologically focused: 'Ecologically sustainable development is development that improves the total quality of life, both now and in the future, in a way that maintains the ecological processes on which life depends ' (S(4(1) Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability Act  2003). This nuance may encourage a perception among those who do refer to the Commissioner's Act for guidance, that sustainable development only relates to the environment rather than the far broader suite of considerations provided for within Our Common Future’ s definition: 'Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' 4  4 Our Common Future  is a ‘global agenda for change’ written by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987 at the behest of the UN General Assembly. While not the first to use the concept or term of sustainable development, the text is recognised by many as having catalysed its consideration in global policy in the years hence. The Commission was chaired by Norway’s former Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, and the text is often colloquially referred to as the ‘Brundltand report’, and the definition of sustainable development within it as the ‘Brundtland definition’.  . Eight other Victorian Acts define or refer to some of the principles of SD, in some cases also appearing to define the concept but not including this within their legislative definition sections. These Acts are in some ways helpful in providing more detail but, in other ways, the variation between them adds to the inconsistency of how sustainable development is defined and applied within public decisions across the State of Victoria. The main definitions raised by interviewees were subsequently summarised and put to survey participants, who were asked how much they agreed with the different ideas (Table 2  ). The responses show as familiarity increases so too does the inclination to see SD as about integration of all that matters to society. Despite this, many respondents indicated sustainable development is about the triple bottom line and giving greater weight to the environment in public decision-making. These perceptions may be a consequence of prior efforts to embed sustainable development, such as Elkington’s (1999)  triple bottom line approach which for some has become synonymous with sustainable development, or a consequence of sustainable development governance largely being the responsibility of environmental agencies to date. Consider, for example, the location and role of the Victorian Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability within Victoria's Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) portfolio, and responsibility for the National Strategy on Ecologically Sustainable Development within Australia's federal Environment Department, compared to consideration of other unanimously supported international concepts such as the Human Rights Charter being within central agencies. Nonetheless, the Our Common Future  or ‘Brundtland’ definition (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ) remains valid for many people: 98.4% survey participants agreed with it as a definition of SD, and many interviewees spoke to it directly or elements thereof: 'I still feel old school in that sense of using the Brundtland definition, that's still the purest form of the definition, I think ' (Former Higher-Level Official, DELWP).  This finding suggests common ground exists on which to raise and discuss understandings and applications of SD. In sum, there are several characterisations of SD relied upon, with at least two SD implementation-impacting tension points within these: (1) Intellectual vs practical: Interviewees were deeply reflective and could rationalise what a more holistic definition and application of SD would mean, however, their formal and on the job training reinforced misconceptions of SD, leading them away from those broader definitions and applications in practice. This dichotomy between active reasoning and intuitive responses echoes the findings of Kahneman (2003)  and will likely be a critical hurdle to the achievement of sustainable development where decision-makers operate in time-poor environments and rely on their intuition; (2) Limits to Growth  vs neoliberalism or rationalist economics: Earth's finite carrying capacity is not a prominent feature of dominant economic paradigms. So, what achievement of SD might mean in terms of affluence, living standards, equity, and so forth can jar with reinforced measures of progress, and appear at odds with what society is willing to accept. This contradiction was famously raised within the Limits to Growth  (Meadows et al., 1972 ), a text summarising modelled futures for mankind. The models were based on five factors identified as determining or limiting growth on planet Earth, and several sets of assumptions about the choices or policies likely to be adopted by mankind. They found a business-as-usual approach would lead to planetary limits to growth being reached within a century, but also that this could be prevented if it were globally agreed to work toward a more stable future. The work was augmented by follow up reviews 20 and 30 years later (Meadows et al., 1992 ; Meadows et al., 2004 ). More recently Coscieme et al. (2020)  also explore this contradiction, making the case for a shift from current economic paradigms to a wellbeing economy. These tensions are both apparent when comparing cohort-wide definitions, and when comparing individuals' reasoned (System 2) responses with their intuitive or practice descriptive (System 1) responses. This highlights a need for greater deliberative discussion of SD, or as a former DELWP Senior Official asks, 'How do we as a society work out what prosperity means within what one planet can support? '  3.3 Principles of sustainable development There are many internationally recognised and debated principles of SD. The aforementioned Council of Australian Governments' (CoAG, 1992 , s3.5) Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment  identifies four principles which should inform public decision-making within all levels of government in Australia: (1) improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms - such as the polluter pays principle and including environmental factors in cost-benefit analyses; (2) the precautionary principle - not allowing a lack of scientific certainty to postpone decisions to prevent serious environmental degradation; (3) intergenerational equity - ensuring future generations have at least the same environmental and resource opportunities as today's do; and, (4) conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity. Understandings and applications of the first three of these principles were confirmed with participants. The fourth principle was considered too environmentally focused to enable participation of a broader cohort of public decision-makers and was not included in the scope of this research. When asked who typically bears the costs of public decisions, the response was largely, 'the taxpayer ', either directly or indirectly through the transfer of business costs. Aside from situations where the beneficiary was viewed to be society at large, i.e., the taxpayer was the utilitarian beneficiary, rarely was the beneficiary or polluter considered to pay. Where examples were given of a beneficiary paying, participants noted there was often an inbuilt lag between the initial implementation of decisions and payment requirements being introduced. This lag, or application of time-limited subsidies, is considered helpful in making payments more politically palatable, as beneficiaries have an opportunity to realise the benefits they obtain from a decision before incurring the associated costs. Survey responses on cost attribution supported these views. Thus, it would appear political appetites, which public decision-makers have rather limited influence on, determine the frequency and transparency of application of the polluter pay principle. To assess the application of the precautionary principle interviewees were asked to identify tools or frameworks they use when required to make a decision with either an incomplete evidence base or uncertainty about the likely outcomes or impacts. Here there was a clear disparity of views. Some argued if there is any  doubt when making public decisions one should hold off until certainty has been restored, perhaps through reviewing or collecting additional data. Others considered the most important thing to do amidst uncertainty and a difficult decision is to 'make a call ', regardless of what it is, to enable the issue to progress in a timely manner. For example, a DELWP Senior Official advised:So where I've seen things go wrong is where it's a really hard decision, so the decision-makers defer the decision and ask for more information. And you go through this intractable loop of, "We need more information. We'll go and to do an analysis of this. We'll do an assessment of that. We'll do another economic cost-benefit on that." The fact of it being that you're never going to remove the fact that this is a difficult decision. So there's this deferral mentality. It's like, "Well, we cannot make this decision because we don't think we got enough information. So, we'll go and do more work." Months go by, come back, you've actually ended up with the same decision. You just got a whole lot more information, you haven't made the decision any easier .   A similar dichotomy occurred amongst survey participants, though their responses may show context is important. For example, when considering general approaches to public decision-making, 38% of respondents often 'just do something ', a further 38% rarely approach decisions in this way, while the remainder does 'about half the time '. However, when asked explicitly about decisions with incomplete evidence or uncertainty, there was a greater propensity to ‘review the evidence’  (84% often do this) or gather more information (63% often gather additional qualitative evidence). While decision-makers do not necessarily share consistent understandings of sustainable development, they do share expertise in public decision-making and a robust appreciation of decisions that are holistic and address or act as a stepping stone to addressing future needs. Participants were therefore asked to identify one change they believed would improve the effectiveness or longevity of the public decisions they are involved with. This question acted as a proxy for how to enhance integrated thinking, overcome short-termism or increase intergenerational considerations, all goals of sustainable development, without constraining thinking to particular interpretations of the concept. Fig. 3   shows the level of broader support for these ideas, which were collated and presented in the survey. Additional and supporting thoughts raised by survey participants in free-text responses include calls to: increase transparency of decisions; engage with all  stakeholders; ensure sufficient time (not always more) to make decisions; increase reliance on and deference to evidence, data, and expertise; increase testing, monitoring and evaluation; create or maintain independent bodies to remove partisan interference; improve bipartisanship; and, require longer-term planning and vision setting, accompanied by implementation, for example, a Senior Official at DELWP wrote:I would have 20-30 year plans across each Department with its portfolio agencies with review at 10 year and then detailed planning at 5 years, feeding into the electoral cycle with red/blue book processes. We have 4 year fixed terms in Victoria so 16, 8 and 4 year reviews and refinements to the strategy should occur with the 4 year plans being put into business plans .   Despite them having been formally and repeatedly articulated as common aspirations by both national and subnational governments, these insights on the polluter pays, precautionary, and intergenerational equity principles of sustainable development suggest they are applied inconsistently. However, these insights also reflect clear recognition of the need and ability to enhance public outcomes and a desire to do so within the public sector, leaving the door open for practice improvements.  3.4 Embedding sustainable development While interview and survey participants alike are aware of sustainable development and have a personal definition of it, most survey participants do not consider SD to be 'very well' embedded in public decisions in the VPS, and on average consider it to be applied less than 50% of the time (Fig. 4  ). The responses of participants to the assertion that they, or people in roles like theirs, are the reason why SD is not integrated into more public decisions (Fig. 5  ) suggest the level of individual responsibility taken is another contributing factor in the application of sustainable development. Personal responsibility was greater amongst interviewees, however, this may be an artefact of the interview method enabling or requiring them to talk through their perspectives. For instance, the percentage of unclear views was substantially smaller for interviewees, with whom clarification could take place. Importantly, the number of people who indicated they are not to blame because they or others are  implementing SD is small, supporting the finding illustrated in Fig. 4  that most participants perceive SD as not regularly embedded in Victorian public decisions. In discussing reasons why sustainable development is not achieved participants broadly focused on things they perceived to be out of their control or that may damage their careers. For example, suggesting: the achievement of SD has got to be politically driven and is not in the hands of bureaucrats; it is not their agency's role; the scale and structure of the VPS inhibits integrated decision-making; the complexity of decision-making constrains lasting impact; the characteristics and values required to be hired into particular positions are not necessarily the same ones required to ‘fight for' sustainable development; speaking up too much could be career-limiting; the influence of any one person is limited; external understandings of how government actually works are poor; there is limited time to debate and address multiple competing priorities; more could be achieved from outside the VPS, particularly as the public service is driven by the societal views reflected into it; and, that the current dominant paradigm of economic growth conflicts with SD. Those who acknowledged they did play a role in achieving SD conversely tended to reflect a greater sense of self-efficacy and accountability. For example, indicating everyone  plays a role; people's actions impact outcomes; or, that their positions (not necessarily seniority) engendered a responsibility to act regardless of the above factors and constraints. These responses highlight inconsistency and ambiguity concerning who  is (or should be) acting to achieve SD - an issue flagged by Dorninger et al. (2020)  in their systematic review of sustainability transformation interventions-, and the likely reception that frank and fearless advice on sustainable development would receive amongst those higher up the chain. However, they also illustrate a recognition by some that, despite such ambiguity and fears of negative feedback, individuals can make the deliberate choice to act and influence decisions to enhance the likelihood of public outcomes being consistent with SD. The zeal with which such self-efficacious individuals talk about what they do to make a difference is reminiscent of others discussed in agent-based literatures such as Advocacy Coalition Framework participants, boundary spanners, or policy entrepreneurs (Sabatier and Weible, 2007 ; Williams, 2002 ; Kingdon, 1995 ).  3.5 Summing up responses on sustainable development These insights illustrate the appetite but also the constraints on public decision-makers within Victoria to apply SD. They show there is awareness of the concept of SD but inconsistent conceptualisation and implementation of it and its principles. These inconsistencies are possibly driven by previous and now dated introductions to the concept, or institutional structures which reinforce misperceptions that SD is predominantly of relevance to the environmental sector. Participant insights also show that with deliberative thinking these inconsistencies and misperceptions can be righted, but dominant societal and public decision-making paradigms constrain decision-makers' abilities to do this. Still, the Our Common Future  or 'Brundtland’ definition provides a common basis on which to hold discussions of what SD is and how it could be better applied to deliver public outcomes more consistent with it. In addition, public decision-makers are themselves full and often supportive of ideas which aid more holistic approaches and the achievement of intergenerational equity, one of the core principles of SD. Further, both formal and informal leaders recognised their actions can  impact attainment of SD and improved public outcomes – a critical finding given Bandura’s (1994, 2012)  work linking agency and self-efficacy. This identification of common ground, well of constructive ideas, and recognition of self-influence suggest, far from being an unachievable utopia, there remains hope for the application and achievement of sustainable development within Victoria.   4 Results & discussion II: Understanding and applications of the Sustainable Development Goals I was in Paris and we're talking about the Sustainable Development Goals and people are going, “Yes. It's, you know, it's all a happening thing”. You come back and you can't hear anybody even minutely concerned about it .   - Former Senior Official, DELWP  4.1 Awareness of the SDGs Where Our Common Future  provides a common definition or starting point from which public decision-makers might seek to conceptualise sustainable development, the Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’ or ‘the Goals’) provide a common framework of targets and indicators to deliver it. Given the value of this framework in supporting the world to track progress toward a more peaceful and prosperous future by 2030, participants were also asked about their awareness and experience of it. Unlike SD, awareness of the SDGs is low for those in or with ties to the VPS: Survey participants were far more likely to be able to have a BBQ conversation about SD than the Goals (Fig. 6  ); and, one-third of participants (both interviewees and survey cohorts) were wholly unaware of the SDGs. Additionally, as will be discussed further in Section 4.2.1 , some interviewees said they were aware of the SDGs but spoke to SD more generally or expressed a belief the SDGs will align  with existing work, rather than reflecting on the Goals and targets individually or even indicating such detail exists, suggesting some may be unconsciously overstating their familiarity. The latter findings are validated by views expressed on the likely implications of the SDGs on public decision-making within survey participants’ organisations (Fig. 7  ). This question was only asked of those who indicated an awareness of the SDGs yet, on average, 35.8% of respondents answered ‘neither agree nor disagree’ to each suggested implication. This reveals either: one in three survey respondents are unfamiliar with public decision-making approaches in the VPS (unlikely given their aforementioned average of 12.7 years of service); or, limited understanding of the Goals prevents those respondents from commenting on how public decision-making will be impacted. Unsurprisingly, the current and immediately past Victorian Sustainability Commissioners, and the representative from Sustainability Victoria, ably drew these connections between Goals and public decision-making processes, pointing to activities such as State of the Environment reporting or intentions to build the SDGs into business and reporting plans. Others in roles some might expect to be engaged with the Goals noted, despite their personal awareness, the research interview itself was highlighting gaps in departmental dialogues. For example, a DELWP Senior Official remarked, ‘What this discussion's leading me to, is a realisation that we, as an agency, as a department, we haven't really been fair dinkum and looked at those Goals directly. We haven't looked at them in any structured way’ . Similarly, the EPA Chair commented: ‘…it’s interesting, why am I aware of them? I'm aware of them because I sit on the Monash Sustainable Development Institute's Board. If I wasn't sitting there, I wouldn't even know about them. I would not even have any  idea’ .  4.2 Embedding the SDGs All interviewees indicated the Goals’ visibility and application across government were to date limited: ‘…they're just not part of the decision-making matrix… I can't in three years ever remember anyone talking about or citing one of those Goals …’, commented a Senior Official from DJR. Further, it was clear the SDGs were not being routinely embedded or applied in Victorian public decision-making practice and were unlikely to be anytime soon: ‘We are, sadly, if you go back 30 years, I believe we are nowhere near as prepared in, in a political frame, in a policy frame to embrace this, I don't think we're anywhere near it’  (Senior Official, DELWP).  Further, analysis of interviewee and survey free-text responses somewhat parallel the findings of Giannetti et al. (2020)  to suggest this limited current and future uptake of the SDGs is likely to be driven by four factors: alignment, complexity, perceived value and commitment, and responsibility. 4.2.1 Assumed alignment Perhaps because their position in government inherently involves regular cross-portfolio decision-making, Higher-Level Officials from Victoria’s central agencies (Department of Premier and Cabinet, ‘DPC’, Department of Treasury and Finance, ‘DTF’) questioned the need to deliberately link current public decision-making practice and priorities to the Goals:‘I think that the considerations that underpin the development of the SDGs are considerations that underpin development of public policy. And I don't think that that public policy is, -if it’s trying to get to the same intent or outcome-, is deficient because it hasn't considered being one of the 17 Goals that governments have signed up to’ . - Higher-Level Official, DPC  ‘I think you can put a label on it which is Sustainable Goals… [but], You're making the same decisions… I can't imagine that people in the past made decisions that they didn't think were sustainable, that wasn't for the best outcomes of future generations and things like that’ . - Higher-Level Official, DPC  ‘…in terms of the sort of the daily work that you do, [the Goals] probably don't resonate that much with a lot of people, unless they work in a particular policy area… so in a daily sense, I'm not sure that those things will resonate in terms of the transactional advice that people are providing’ . - Higher-Level Official, DTF   Interviewees in other parts of government agreed there is alignment but could also see value in considering the Goals more formally. One official (who preferred no attribution) noted: ‘I think so much of what [my current organisation] does, is quite aligned to [the Goals] anyway.… But that said, I think you can always get new insight out of going through a formal process of alignment’.  Assumptions about alignment may also exist because of the availability heuristic – a tendency to base judgements on things which are easily retrieved from our memories (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973 ; Taylor, 1982 ). For some, this heuristic is commonly resulting in the SDGs being seen as a simple extension of SD. For example, a Departmental Secretary advised: ‘I’d say that the Brundtland Commission… and everything I've been dealing with ever since has made me intrinsically think globally as part of my consideration of what to do here…. I reckon they’re the same principles. It's just that, I don't actually literally link back to the Goals ’. The presence of this heuristic is particularly concerning given the SDGs address criticisms about sustainable development’s lack of definitional and measurement clarity by providing a metric-rich ‘plan of action’ (UNGA, 2015b ). The nature of the SDGs is such that, if public decision-makers understood those metrics relevant to their work, alignments would be self-evident. There would be no need for assumptions. SD and the SDGs are not  the same: SD is a conceptualisation of where humanity wants to go and why, the SDGs are an embodiment of what needs to be done to get there. Linking the Goals to public practice is critical to their delivery. The issue of alignment, or belief public decision-makers are implicitly considering the SDGs because of their familiarity with SD, also indicates some people are less familiar with the Goals than suggested. Shifting from assumptions about the Goals to actively using them to find gaps in practice will help according to a Senior Official at Sustainability Victoria (a DELWP portfolio agency):I'm hopeful for, within three years, we’ll [be] flipping it on its head.… So you're shifting it from a reporting framework, “This is what we're doing, aren’t we brilliant”, to “Oooh, we've got real gaps in say, 13.10.4. What's government or private sector going to do to address those so we actually do meet the targets?” …instead of a PR exercise and another overload of reporting, in a few more years you should actually get to use it as a common language across government .   In the meantime, a more deliberate, if subterranean, alignment approach may help obtain some traction and encourage greater open-mindedness to the Goals in future. For example, one former DELWP Senior Official noted, while his current organisation publicly supports the Goals, he deliberately talks in concepts more traditionally accepted by business and central agencies:When you say ‘sustainable’, you marginalise your arguments. You need to marginalise old style thinking. So, if someone's proposing coal, I would say, that they've got an appalling understanding of how to build a successful economy. That they're economically illiterate. I wouldn't say they're environmentally illiterate… I don't talk about environmental sustainability, I just talk about being successful .    4.2.2 Complexity and understanding In a sentiment echoed by Miola and Schiltz (2019) , complexity was raised as an inhibitor to increased public and public decision-maker comprehension of the Goals:‘…if there’s 179 targets or whatever, I just look at that and go, “God, how am I gonna… I'm not gonna measure myself against each of those. I've got all these other corporate kind of targets I have to deliver on. I've got existing government policies I need to deliver on. How do I kind of bring all these 179 targets to kind of bear on my work?” … I kind of wouldn't know where to begin’ . - Higher-Level Official, DELWP   When asked why they believed Take2,  Victoria’s climate change targeting initiative, is regularly linked back to the 2015 Paris Agreement  but not the SDGs (DELWP, 2016 ), official’s responses further illustrated how complexity and understanding might negatively manifest themselves:‘My only thought and, literally it's thinking out loudly, is that it's to do with the prominence in the public mind. I think if you ask the same question that you asked about do you know what Sustainable Development Goals are? Do you know what Paris Agreement is? You'd get a much higher success rate. Everyone knows about [the] Paris Agreement. It's in the news all the time, so it's got a public profile. So if I'm trying to roll out a program and I want people to buy-in. I go with a thing that's sexy and well known’ . - Higher-Level Official, DELWP   In the absence of that attention, visibility, and knowledge, the situation has arisen where, ‘probably as a country, Australia doesn't really think the Sustainable Development Goals are as important as they ought to be for us. They're regarded as pitched to an international aid environment and to that extent, they're not necessarily relevant to us’  (Former Senior Official, DELWP). That is, cognitive biases concerning the social and economic relevance of the Goals to Australia, have led some to see the SDGs as an extension of the Millennium Development Goals (‘MDGs’) and only important locally from an environmental perspective. Such perceptions extend to the earlier argument that, due to a lack of communication on what the SDGs are , prior knowledge of SD and the MDGs inhibits action on the Goals. Combined with the earlier discussed variation in definitions of SD, these fallacies are likely to considerably challenge understandings of what the Goals represent. Using ‘the Global Goals’ as a preferred nomenclature may be a starting point to reframe them and encourage deeper consideration.  4.2.3 Perceived value and strength of commitment People were upbeat when discussing the Goals’ potential, particularly as a tool to quantify how to remain within planetary boundaries at country and regional levels, and subsequently apportion personal, business and government targets. One Senior Official noted the narrative could be reframed to show the benefit of the SDGs as a gap-analysis tool and improve public decision-making outcomes. Another interviewee reflected the SDGs could be used to improve future sustainable development-focused programs: By providing ‘a science-based or a global referencing in design’ , the SDGs provide the ability to say, ‘This is what the planet actually needs  you to do, [rather than]  …just keep consuming, regardless of what the planetary boundary is, but sort of be more efficient at it. ’ (Former Higher-Level Official, DELWP).  Several sustainability-focused leaders talked to how this understanding is being reflected in the primary functions, reporting processes, public documents, and broader operations of their organisations. For example, after having found when she talked ‘to people about the practical application [of the SDGs], they have trouble working that out’,  the Victorian Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability decided to, ‘develop a methodology to apply the SDGs to State of the Environment reporting’ , to provide, ‘a prototype that will become a methodology for jurisdictions to pick up and apply SDGs at a state or national level’.  Notwithstanding the policy value of the SDGs and efforts to increase their ease of application, however, there was a common thread around commitment to the Goals by politicians and senior leaders being a determinant of success. While the presence of international agreements was seen as a constructive antidote to competing local interests, some signalled signing up to the agreements is easy and should not necessarily be taken as a meaningful commitment to them:‘…If you’ve signed up to sort of a treaty or a convention or whatever, internationally, that  I think is very  good, and it's very comforting, for politicians, in a way, “Oh it’s not me, it’s these international- they’ve sort of mandated it”, “The UN has said…”. They can be invoked  in a circumstance where, you know, there's a lot of other pressure to do otherwise’ . - Former Victorian Chief Scientist  ‘The frameworks, by nature, like UNGC [United Nations Global Compact], tend to be front end, and commitment based and it's easy to say, “Yes”…. It's much  harder to put your hand up and say, “Well, I'm accountable, I'm responsible… And here's what I'm going to do”’ . - Former Higher-Level Official, DELWP  ‘And so, the thing I'm challenging is, just because we've signed a piece of paper and made some public statements… why  does that actually represent the fact that that is true and correct? Like, that is not an accepted goal. That is just a point in time. People doing what they think they have to do… There is never  actually an accepted position because it's always evolving, day in day out things change and politicians hate to be locked into anything’ . - Mid-Level Official (Dept. withheld)    4.2.4 Clarity of responsibility for implementation Building on discussions of commitment, a lack of clear local responsibility for the Goals was also raised as a concern and potential stumbling block to their achievement, consistent with the arguments on SDG governance and accountability of Bowen et al. (2017)  and Glass and Newig (2019) . A DELWP Mid-Level Official noted, where subnational jurisdictions are required to implement international agreements, standard practice is to, ‘…look to the Commonwealth first, and the Commonwealth will then tend to work with jurisdictions to determine what their roles will be’.  Other interviewees also made the point that, in the absence of Commonwealth action, subnational jurisdictions can choose to take the lead but had not yet done so on the SDGs and were unlikely to:‘If the Victorian government said, “We wanna make it a priority to [be] a kind of national leader in delivering on the UN Sustainable Development Goals”, then that could have an impact. But I'm not sure if the government's made any statements with regards to that.’  - Higher-Level Official, DELWP   This view is mirrored in public sector priorities. A Higher-Level Official at DPC remarked, even when Department Secretaries became aware of them, agencies were unlikely to actively facilitate the Goals: ‘Will we do anything with it? Maybe, maybe not. Like in all honesty. Because, yes we should, but there's no driver. There's no system, there's no reason… It'd have to be leadership telling us that it's important’.  Whether advice that the Goals are subnationally important is missing due to a lack of awareness, value-judgement, or a perception that the Commonwealth is actively pursuing them, is unclear. However, the findings of and muted official response to the Senate Committee Inquiry report (Parliament of Australia, 2019 ) suggest it may be some time before comprehensive Commonwealth direction on the Goals occurs (pers. comms.  Senator Claire Moore). This presents an opportunity for subnational jurisdictions like the State of Victoria, who are aware of and see value in the SDGs to take a more active leadership role in their achievement. To this end, the role of organisational and central agency leadership was raised numerous times, particularly against the backdrop of other state government priorities. Senior Officials at DELWP and the Department of Health and Human Services, in particular, flagged the significance a direction from the centre would have: Citing central agency action regarding the Human Rights Charter leading to VPS-wide practice improvements to educate staff and better embodiment of the Charter within public documents, as a comparable example of what can be achieved. Whereas, without Commonwealth or Victorian central agencies acting as implementation catalysts for the SDGs there was genuine concern that, ‘we've signed onto another external UN treaty, and it hasn't flowed through ’ (Senior Official, DELWP).   4.3 Summing up responses on the Sustainable Development Goals Findings here expose limited awareness of the SDGs, both in terms of self-reported familiarity and genuine understanding of what the Goals embody. This comparatively diminished understanding means the SDGs are themselves mired in uncertainty, conflicting positions, and assumptions on what is needed to deliver them. This manifests as a general acceptance of the promise of the SDGs intertwined with ambivalence or dulled hope that Victoria or Australia will actively work toward them. If Australia is genuinely committed to achieving the SDGs, changes are required. It is also evident that who ought to take up the mantle for the SDGs remains unclear for some (see also, Parliament of Australia, 2019 ). Nonetheless, as argued in the Introduction, the longstanding intergovernmental agreements on sustainable development and pivotal role of subnational governments in mobilising local action toward achievement of the concept and the SDGs, mean officials at all levels of seniority and tiers of government have authority to do this. To those reading this wondering where to begin, a simple exercise already trialled by the Victorian Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability (2019) , is to review the 169 targets of the SDGs5  5 A list of the targets is available here: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/    to identify those most relevant to your work, and synergies with other parts of government. You will almost certainly find targets of relevance which could be adopted as internal metrics or facilitate opportunities for interdepartmental policy development that is also consistent with organisational and ministerial objectives. Doing so will also help dispel myths of alignment, enhance understanding of their value, and identify where existing policy priorities are inconsistent with objectives of the Goals and sustainable development more broadly.   5 Conclusions More than thirty years after rising to global prominence, and despite consistent international, national and subnational reaffirmation to it, consideration of sustainable development within Victorian public decision-making remains inconsistent and its impact muted. While all of those interviewed and surveyed are aware of sustainable development, ambiguity around what the concept means, variable reference to its principles, decision-makers not recognising their role in its delivery, and misbeliefs that SD is predominantly an environmental issue, have constrained the concept’s application. This is troubling to say the least, if the goal of development (or public decisions) meeting the needs of current and future generations is to be realised. The state of knowledge regarding the Sustainable Development Goals is worse. The SDGs are poorly understood - even by those who indicate awareness of them-, their tangible benefits are largely unacknowledged, their breadth of applications unappreciated, and a widely evident misperception persists that alignment rather than direct consideration will suffice in achieving them. These subnational findings are consistent with submissions to and findings of the Australian Senate Committee Inquiry on the SDGs (Parliament of Australia, 2019 ), implying broader applicability. While some practitioners recognise their potential value and are acting to embody the Goals within their work, efforts and attitudes in the main suggest underappreciation of the opportunity to simultaneously drive society to a more prosperous future, achieve current policy objectives, and enhance integrated decision-making and all that comes with it across government. Key to seizing this latter opportunity will be individuals recognising the heuristics and biases driving existing behaviours, and deliberately thinking and acting to shift conceptualisations of SD, the SDGs, and the practices required to achieve them. When framed by its principles, particularly those of precaution and intergenerational equity, public decision-makers demonstrated their capacity to do this, proposing and supporting many tools to support achievement of sustainable development. Such tools include an increased emphasis on evaluation, data, outcomes, and a willingness to trial, as well as greater provision of frank and fearless advice, engagement, problem definition, and strategic or scenario planning. Many of these tools are already well-recognised and accessible to public decision-makers, but underutilised. Though it is concerning that the language of SD appears to constrain thinking and progress toward improved practice for some, the latter tools and support for them also illustrate an enthusiasm, determination, and practical ability for the public sector to deliver better public outcomes. Combined with the support of almost all survey participants for the Our Common Future  definition, and the ability of interviewees to describe the broader salience of SD and the SDGs to all portfolios of public decision-making, there remains opportunity to engage and mobilise public decision-makers to refocus their efforts to implement the SDGs and achieve sustainable development. Such refocussing necessitates leadership to drive committed practice, but leadership is also a conscious action anyone can exercise. This research finds pockets of public servants already exercising it on SD. Such pockets may be strengthened by others realising they are not alone in valuing sustainable development, its principles, or the SDGs, and recognising their agency to respectfully pursue and embed them. Decision-makers at any level can demonstrate individual leadership by raising the potential to reintegrate the latter tools into their processes, even on a trial basis, or by reviewing the targets of the SDGs against their current work to see where they overlap and discussing with colleagues. While their suggestions will not always be taken up, there is little to lose from respectfully voicing alternative approaches or looking to situate one’s work within an international framework which their country has adopted – some might even call this ‘initiative’. Most senior public officials are going to see such initiative in trying to find ways to more effectively advance multiple policy objectives as a good thing, even if operational reasons mean they cannot agree to that good thing right now. Australia, and indeed the world, may not yet be on track to achieve the sustainable development aspirations it has publicly set out, this work highlights some of the hurdles to doing so, but solutions and the will to implement them are also apparent. Recognising that others see sustainable development as a desirable outcome, and that all decision-makers hold a level of responsibility for achieving it may lead to the deliberate decision-making practices needed to deliver the ‘future we want ’.
