                  Pakistan predominately relies on fossil fuel consumption (almost 84%) to meet its energy demand, which has led to a significant rise in CO2 emissions (CO2Es) and poses an enormous threat to industrial growth. To reduce CO2Es and develop the economy simultaneously, it is necessary to study how to attain a strong decoupling association between impacting factors. Meantime, Pakistan is a transitional economy with significant industrial gaps. Against such backgrounds, this study provides detailed information regarding carbon intensity, energy structure, energy intensity, energy efficiency, worker's effect, economic activity, and industrial scale, which may be essential and beneficial for policymakers. Most existing studies ignored such factors' variations in Pakistan. To fill this gap, focusing on the industrial sector from 1990 onwards, this analysis aims to identify the major driving factors, mainly our focusing the productive sector. This is important because this sector has reached the country's target. The results show that (1) workers' effect, energy intensity, and energy structure factors played a bigger role in rising CO2Es by 133.40 Mt during 1990–2019. (2) The decoupling relationship is an alternating state between five couplings and decoupling. Wherein decoupling states of energy intensity (9.28%), industrial structure (0.39%), and employees' value-added (0.75%) had strong volatility, energy structure (0.22%), and carbon intensity (0.24%) effects were relatively gentle during the period. (3) The average value of employees' value-added remained positive which shows that economic growth negatively impacts the decoupling between CO2Es and the economy. (4) CO2 mitigation rate occurred during 1994, 1997, 2004–06, 2011, and 2013–14, which are inconsistent over the period. The study puts forward some policies to efficiently promote the decoupling between factors based on empirical results.

CO 2  IF i t     shows the excellence of energy use in the industrial sector and is equal to the ratio between CO2 Es to FFCI. Lower carbon intensity is effective in reducing CO2 Es.  FFCI Mtoe FFCI i t  TECI i t      ESF i  t     ESF shows the energy structure factor. ESF i  t     estimates the ratio of FFCI to the overall energy use of industrial sector. Higher the ESF increases the CO2 Es.  TECI Mtoe TECI i t  VAI t      EIF i t     EIF represents the energy intensity factor. EIF i t     presents the ratio of TECI to industrial value-added. The decrease in EIF i t     shows a rise in energy efficiency, which lessens the output of CO2 Es.  VAI % of GDP VAI t  EI t      VAE i t     VAE presents the employees' value-added. VAE t     shows the economic activity and is formulated as industrial output for each worker. If skilled labor is increased, the per worker's output increases.  EI Million EI t     ISF i t     ISF shows the industrial scale factor. ISF t     presents the outcomes assembled by an individual worker in the industry. If employees increase, the sector will expand.     Table 2 Estimates of Tapio's decoupling index [54 ].

School of Economics Shandong Technology and Business University Yantai Shandong 255000 China       Pakistan predominately relies on fossil fuel consumption (almost 84%) to meet its energy demand, which has led to a significant rise in CO2  emissions (CO2 Es) and poses an enormous threat to industrial growth. To reduce CO2 Es and develop the economy simultaneously, it is necessary to study how to attain a strong decoupling association between impacting factors. Meantime, Pakistan is a transitional economy with significant industrial gaps. Against such backgrounds, this study provides detailed information regarding carbon intensity, energy structure, energy intensity, energy efficiency, worker's effect, economic activity, and industrial scale, which may be essential and beneficial for policymakers. Most existing studies ignored such factors' variations in Pakistan. To fill this gap, focusing on the industrial sector from 1990 onwards, this analysis aims to identify the major driving factors, mainly our focusing the productive sector. This is important because this sector has reached the country's target. The results show that (1) workers' effect, energy intensity, and energy structure factors played a bigger role in rising CO2 Es by 133.40 Mt during 1990–2019. (2) The decoupling relationship is an alternating state between five couplings and decoupling. Wherein decoupling states of energy intensity (9.28%), industrial structure (0.39%), and employees' value-added (0.75%) had strong volatility, energy structure (0.22%), and carbon intensity (0.24%) effects were relatively gentle during the period. (3) The average value of employees' value-added remained positive which shows that economic growth negatively impacts the decoupling between CO2 Es and the economy. (4) CO2  mitigation rate occurred during 1994, 1997, 2004–06, 2011, and 2013–14, which are inconsistent over the period. The study puts forward some policies to efficiently promote the decoupling between factors based on empirical results.   Keywords Industrial sector  CO2  emissions  LMDI  Tapio's decoupling index  Pakistan    1 Introduction Energy has become a fundamental parameter used to regulate a country's economy [1 ]. Issues about climate change have caused global agreement on the necessity for mutual action to lessen carbon dioxide emissions (CO2 Es) [2 ]. The objective of the Paris agreement is to bound global temperature below 2 °C until the present century. Attaining this aim needs a 50% (%) decrease in global annual CO2 Es and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions by 2050, net-zero emissions by 2055–2080, and net-negative emissions, subsequently [3 ]. Because the industrial sector is liable for 30% of the worldwide GHG emissions, the decarbonization of the industry is estimated to play an essential role in meeting the Paris Agreement (International Energy Agency [4 ]. Pakistan is the most pollution-affected country in South Asia, contributing 0.87% of the global emissions in 2016 [5 ]. According to the Statistical Review of World Energy [6 ], Pakistan's CO2 Es was 198.3 million tons of CO2  in 2019. Based on oil, coal and gas, the industrial sector is the highest energy-consuming sector, which has consumed energy by 37.1% during 2019 [7 ]. The industrial sector is accountable for above 49% of Pakistan's CO2 Es. During the past two decades, coal has been the primary energy source in the industrial sector because no other energy source is low-cost and plentiful than coal [8 ]. Thus, CO2 Es from the industries rose from 17.21 Mt to 95.2 Mt during 1990–2019 [9 ]. Rising energy demand to endure economic development is the primary factor, raising CO2 Es [10 ]. With the rising domestic and foreign demands of industrial products (i.e., miscellaneous textile products, leather, copper, etc.), the CO2 Es from industries are expected to almost double by 2040 [1 ]. Moreover, enormous industrial growth and long-term, widespread economic progress lead to huge fuel consumption and CO2 Es. Regarding the data from different Pakistan sources, the industrial sector is the only source of generating GHG emissions because of huge fossil fuel consumption. With this unparalleled experience and heavy environmental change, Pakistan has lost US$9.6 billion since 2010 [12 ]. Being the twelfth Asian country out of 15, industrial contamination is reported at grave unacceptable levels, in which over 6.5 million people are hospitalized yearly due to industrial pollution illness [13 ]. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that skin cancer, asbestosis, and Peritoneal Mesothelioma are sicknesses. The WHO also states that 2.4 million people die each year in Pakistan, directly attributed to industrial pollution [14 ]. Therefore, the action is required to help Pakistan attain its global climate change promises while sustaining the global economic competitiveness of its trade-exposed industries. Moreover, Pakistan's industrial sector share in the gross domestic product (GDP) remained at 19.29% [15 ]. Pakistan's energy framework has been oil and gas-dominated for many years. The share in the current energy supply mix is more than 70% [7 ].1  1 The industrial sector energy use is based on Brick Kiln, Cement, Fertilizer, Pak-Steel Mills, and general industry. Major industries include textiles, fertilizer, sugar factories, cement, steel, and large petrochemical plants. These industries, amongst others, add approximately 6% to the overall CO2 Es of Pakistan NCCP [19 ].   Therefore, the government led a suite of measures to lessen CO2 Es at the country and industrial levels. To efficiently reduce CO2 Es, the government focuses on raising the renewable energy share by 20% of total electricity generation by 2025 through various energy projects under China Pakistan Economic Corridor and One Belt One Road [16 ,17 ]. Thus, it is essential to analyze sustainability to describe more valuable information for government and policy-makers seeking sustainable development. For future energy policies, sustainable development and CO2 Es reduction, it is necessary to compare industrial emissions and related factors with other countries. For example, Liu et al. [18 ] analyzed China's industrial sector, using the decomposition method from 1998 to 2005 and found that industrial activity and energy intensity factors were dominant contributors to the change in energy-related CO2 Es; Zhao et al. [20 ] employed decomposition analysis for industrial emissions in Shanghai city from 1996 to 2007 and found that energy intensity and industrial structure are key factors in reducing CO2 Es; Wen et al. [21 ] for 38 sub-industries in China from 2000 to 2017 and estimated that investment, output and energy scale were the major contributor in raising CO2 Es; Wang et al. [22 ] for the various sectors of the United States form 1997–2016. They investigated that income and population are the main factors in rising CO2 Es in the industrial sector. These studies suggest that final energy consumption in the production sectors becomes carbon-intensive; therefore, the further reduction of carbon intensity must concentrate on the material production sectors' energy consumption (i.e., brick kiln, cement, fertilizer, steel, and general industries). Although, the current decomposition of Pakistan's CO2 Es efforts on the change of the total industrial CO2 Es. The analysis related to emission factors, related factors and the analysis for a particular sector is relatively fewer. The main objective of the research is to estimate how various driving factors contributed to the variations in industrial CO2 Es and to assess the policy implications for climate change mitigation. (a) Analyze the major driving factors that rise CO2 Es, (b) Estimate the historical trends of fuel consumption, CO2 Es, and economic output from industrial sectors, (c) Identify the fundamental driving factors and compute their relative contributions to CO2 Es, (d) Identify the effect of the economic scale factor and how it is decoupled with CO2 Es, and (e) to provide related facts that improve the development and application of effective CO2 E lessening policies to target energy frameworks on renewable growth. A Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) technique was applied to decompose the CO2 Es and measure the significance of different factors during 1990–2019. Usually, two types of methods are employed to check factors' impact. (1) The econometric analysis, which is based on Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) (Ang [23 ]; Xu and Lin [24 ]), and (2) the technique uses the decomposition method as per the identical equation of CO2 Es [94 ]. The EKC method accepts that the environmental quality and income move along an inverted U-shaped curve, showing that it is inappropriate for an individual sector [25 ]. Moreover, endogenous issues can hardly be evaded when some variables are omitted in the model formulation [26 ]. Therefore, this paper uses a decomposition analysis to investigate the driving factors in the industrial sector. The advantages of the LMDI method are: effective adaptation, interpretation, theoretical foundations, deals ‘0’ value, and is usually applied in the analysis of CO2 Es. Thus, this study contributes to the scientific community and policy-makers at both indigenous and country levels by giving insights into the long-run association among industrial CO2 Es, key decomposition factors, and the energy intensity of industrial developments to economic structure factors. Overall, existing research is highlighted in the following areas. (1) This sector, the highest energy-consuming and carbon-emitting sector has become Pakistan's most important source of CO2 Es. To fill this gap, more particularly to support policy-makers, scholars and administrations in the Pakistani perspectives. Specifically, regarding economic sustainability and population growth, along with the rigid demand for energy use in the industrialization and urbanization process, the Pakistani government must attain the target for the lessening of CO2 Es intensity by 30% until 2025 [27 ]. In addition, CO2 Es promise affordability, acquisition of global climate funding, volume, and technology [28 ], because the natural endowment in Pakistan, where oil, coal and gas are the key resources, has caused the current situation. (2) By constructing the LMDI technique, the changes in CO2 E in the industrial sector are decomposed into six effects, divided into five years plan of the Ministry of Planning Pakistan for in-depth investigation. This will give valuable information on the appropriateness of individual factors for policy-makers. (3) To estimate the mitigation potential of CO2 Es, we have established a model based on decoupling analysis. This model will provide each year's periodic states and the mitigation rate of CO2 Es. This will help policy-makers comprehend the future condition of CO2 Es reduction in the industrial sector. Thus, considering the above questions and motivations, to fill those gaps, this research will take the whole industrial sector as the research object, in terms of energy efficiency enhancement, exploring the feasible paths to attain the goals in emissions reduction under the commitments of INDC, COP-21, and renewable energy Visions 2025–2035. This is the first kind of study related to Pakistan's industrial sector based on past information. Section 2  provides the research background, section 3  provides the Literature review, section 4  gives methodologies and data, and section 5  comprises empirical analysis. Conclusions and policy suggestions are given in section 6 .  2 Background of Pakistan's industrial sector The industrial sector is generally known to be an industry of enormous energy utilization and a high environmental pollution sector. For instance, in the overall world's energy consumption, the industrial sector consumes a high share of approximately 40% [29 ]. Moreover, in Pakistan, the energy consumption of the industrial sector uses a greater share, approximately 37.1%, excluding transport, domestic, commercial, agriculture, and other government [7 ]. This sector is an economic engine, providing local and foreign markets output. Being the highest energy-consuming sector, the industry will play an imperative role in the low-carbon transformation and the energy-saving realization. In 2015, Pakistan-INDC projected to mitigate emissions in almost all sectors up to 20% by 2030 [28 ]. Therefore, energy-saving and CO2 E reduction should be observed as a crucial breakthrough to enhance green development and expedite the structure of ecological civilization. For this, the government promises in Pak-INDC in reply to the Paris Agreement based on socio-economic truths, encouraging science and technology innovation, energy efficiency, economic growth, energy conservation, and mitigation of CO2 Es. First, the industrial economic growth has experienced rapid growth from 1990 to 2008 and then smoothly increasing/decreasing trend until 2018. The value-added share showed the highest growth rate of 22.09% in 2008, as indicated in Fig. 1  . It further enhances urbanization, economic culture, living standard, and industrial development. Second, the industrial sector is among the highest energy-concentrated sectors, which has increased the total energy consumption to 20.42 from 6.54 Mtoe, including a rise in fossil fuel use from 5.71 to 18.07 Mote over 1990–2019, as shown in Fig. 1 . The minimum contribution of electricity has contributed from 0.84 to 2.34 Mtoe. Third, CO2 Es grew from 17.21 to 95.15 Mt over 1990–2018. Finally, as per HDIP [7 ], renewable energy consumption in Pakistan started in 2015, which has contributed to a growth in renewable energy by 0.19–1.12 Mtoe over 2015–2019, as shown in Fig. 1 . Due to the huge pressure of the global CO2 Es reduction, Pakistan has established and planned suitable technical measures, i.e., INDC [28 ] for CO2 Es, Vision 2025 [16 ], Vision 2035 [17 ] for renewables, and NCCP [19 ] for industrial emission reduction policy measures.2  2 Emission reduction policies of Pakistan's industrial sector by NCCP [19 ]. www.gcisc.org.pk/National_Climate_Change_Policy_2012.pdf  (p.27).   Since 2009, industrial sectors have accounted for maximum output, energy consumption, and started growing CO2 Es. Thus, strengthening industrial energy output is vital in confirming energy security and helping low-carbon growth [30 ]. Though industrial energy output has been developed presently, there still has a significant gap linked with developed countries’ levels (i.e., China, Russia, Europe, and the United States). From the industrial background perspective, the energy intensity, impacting factors, energy-saving, and CO2 E reduction goals are the key to success/failure. Thus, it is compulsory to discover the corresponding theories and techniques in the features of industrial impacting factors.  3 Literature review Since the industrial revolution, coal, gas, and oil have been used as the primary energy source, which has caused severe air pollution, particularly CO2 Es and smog, thus causing profound health influences (i.e., skin cancer, asbestosis, and Peritoneal Mesothelioma are sicknesses). For this, Pakistan has committed to utilizing renewable energy and friendly environmental resources. The association between economic growth (EG) and CO2 E has been discussed in a large level of literature (i.e., Alvarado et al. [32 ]; Khan et al. [33 ]; and Zhang et al. [34 ]. Presently, EKC, decomposition and decoupling analysis are general methods [35 ]. EKC estimates the hypothesis among the dependent and independent variables, while the decomposition method checks the impacts of the driving and social factors. Decoupling is another technique that can examine the dilemma between CO2 E and EG. Compared with regression analysis, this technique is free from linear assumption and has no limitations in the form of the relationship. The Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) is another technique to ascertain the impacting factors [36 ]. Since the LMDI is the favored method and is used broadly [37 ], which has been extensively used in energy and environmental-related literature. For example, Li and Fan [38 ] decompose energy-related CO2 Es in petrochemical industries; Wang et al. [39 ] decompose CO2 Es from the transport sector; Lu et al. [40 ] analyzed CO2 Es from construction and building industries, Chen et al. [41 ] investigated the impacts under regional industrial transfer in Pearl River Delta; Liu et al. [42 ] analyzed industrial metabolism of the wine industry to check the environmental performance, and Lin and Wang [43 ] decompose China's CO2 Es from production activities. Although, many scholars have focused on decomposing CO2 Es at national and regional levels, little attention has been paid to decomposing at the industrial level. Moreover, few studies considered energy utilization and CO2 Es using LMDI decomposition approaches for various countries. For example, Kaivo-Oja and Luukkanen [44 ] for European Union found that the CO2  changes energy intensity, Kwon [45 ] for a change in CO2 Es from car travel in Great Britain and found that the technology effect, the carbon intensity of car driving kept lessening, and Lee and Oh [46 ] analyzed the CO2 Es in the APEC countries. They investigated that GDP per capita and population are the main factors of growing CO2 Es, while energy efficiency and fuel substitution are the best promising fields in cooperating with APEC. Lise [47 ] estimated Turkey's energy consumption and CO2 Es and found that economy, carbon intensity and economy's composition are the key factors increasing CO2 Es. Energy intensity is the only factor that is lessening CO2 Es. Liu et al. [18 ] estimated the CO2 Es from China's logistic industry. They confirmed that energy consumption, energy intensity and energy structure reduce CO2 E intensity. Oh et al. [48 ] analyzed the CO2 Es in South Korea and identified that GDP is the dominant factor in rising CO2 Es in all sectors. Moreover, energy intensity was an imperative factor of carbon reduction in maximum sectors. Kim and Jung [49 ] analyzed the GHG emanations of the Korean manufacturing industry with the same concern. Raza and Lin [50 ] investigated the natural gas use, energy intensity, energy efficiency, and low carbon transition in Pakistan by employing LMDI and intensity methods. They found that population and EG are the critical factors in rising energy consumption in Pakistan, while energy structure, fossil fuel energy structure, energy intensity gave a new way for policy-makers. Mohammadi et al. [51 ] employed the LMDI method for Iran energy intensity and investigated that structural change, EG and energy intensity contributes to rising energy consumption in various sectors. Most of the current studies above estimated variations in CO2 Es and energy utilization at national, regional, or sub-regional levels. Decoupling analysis (DA) is used to analyze the association between the industrial-scale output and CO2 Es. DA was the first time originated from physics and stated as breaking the association between EG and environmental degradation [52 ]. Since then, DA has been regularly considered an indicative criterion of economic-emission integration. Compared to regression and EKC, the DA is easier to comprehend and operate due to its less calculation [53 ]. Furthermore, the empirical outcomes of the economic-emission linkage from regression and EKC are mixed and arguable; therefore, the present research adopts the DA to analyze the association between economic scale and CO2 E. For this, Tapio established eight rational indicators, which present the idea of decoupling states [54 ]. Currently, many researchers applied this technique to check the association between factors, i.e., Engo [55 ,56 ] for Cameroon; Li et al. [57 ], Zhao et al. [58 ], Dong et al. [59 ], and Han et al. [60 ]; Xu et al. [61 ] for China; Loo and Banister [62 ] for 15 main developing nations; Karmellos et al. [63 ] for the European Union and the United Kingdom; Song et al. [64 ] for China and the United States, and Wu et al. [65 ] for typical industrialized and emerging nations. In all the above studies, the DA has been investigated based on CO2 Es and EG at the national, regional, developed, and emerging country levels. The objective was to achieve economic output without rising fossil fuel energy utilization. Also, there are few past studies regarding the decomposition and decoupling for Pakistan, for example, Lin and Raza [2 ,8 ] for power and coal. Thus, we found two main observations from the above literature. First, LMDI methodologies were applied in many past studies on CO2 Es from numerous sectors, particularly in the transport, power and chemical sectors, and they do not provide any precise indication of the decoupling of the industrial sector. Second, past studies above, emphasize decoupling of CO2 Es, GDP growth and energy consumption in the region, countries, and particular sectors growth. However, studies concerned with the decomposition and decoupling approach for the industrial sector are absent to the best of our understanding. This study contributes to the literature and fills the gap in the following ways. (a) Given that the industrial sector is the major contributor to total CO2 Es, an understanding of the driving technologies of this sector is vital in the construction of effective mitigation policies [66 ]. This study fills the knowledge gap regarding the primary impacting factors of CO2 Es in the industrial sector using the LMDI and Tapio's DA to the industrial sector. (b) This paper estimates the decomposition analysis of CO2 Es, the contribution of factors (i.e., carbon intensity, energy structure, energy intensity, employee's value-added, and intensity scale) during 1990–2019. (c) The DA method applies to analyze each factor's effects, decoupling states between CO2 E-EG and CO2  mitigation rate. Furthermore, the decoupling indicator contributes to the literature in understanding the driving mechanism of industrial CO2 Es is vital for preparing actual mitigation policies. Moreover, an imperative theoretical foundation and new ideas are provided, which identifies that it is a feasible and valuable method for investigating the decomposition and decoupling relationship among various factors. Therefore, this research is unique in decomposing the main driving factors of industrial CO2 Es.  4 Methods 4.1 Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) This research applied two methodologies to analyze the main driving factors' patterns and characteristics of industrial CO2 Es, identify their impacts, decoupling states, environmental policies, and sectorial regulations. This study reviewed many studies from high-quality databases to examine the carbon intensity, energy intensity, energy structure, value-added, and industrial scale. Two methods for decomposing indicator variations at the sector level are structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and IDA. Both methods check the impact of EG, sectorial shifts, and technical influence on different environmental and social indicators [67 ,68 ]. The key difference between these methods is that SDA employs the input-output framework while IDA employs only aggregate sector information. Changes in industrial emissions may be calculated by computing the impacts of variations in factors using Index Decomposition Analysis, as provided in IDA identity in Eq. (1) . Then, by using the LMDI, this paper tries to decompose the variations in the driving factors. The association between environmental pollution and economic growth has created significant research interests. Few researchers have presented interest in the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory and regression modeling [69 ,70 ]. For instance, Buehn and Farzanegan [71 ] and Fang and Yu [72 ] construct new indicators of air pollution and find there is an inverted U-shaped curve association between pollution and GDP. The LMDI technique is a well-established method [2 ,73–75 ]. Using the Kaya identity first introduced by Kaya [76 ] is often employed for decomposing CO2 Es. This method decomposes aggregates to check the main contributors to CO2 Es in the industrial sector. Moreover, the decoupling is another research strand on the dilemma between economic growth and CO2 Es. Thus, Pakistan's industrial energy-related CO2 Es are estimated based on ‘5’ decomposition factors (i.e., carbon intensity, energy structure, energy intensity, employee's value-added, and intensity scale), which have not been discussed in past studies. As per the Kaya [76 ] formulae, the driving factors of CO2 Es are identified by Eqs. (1)- (2)  below.(1) C O 2 t  = ∑  i  C O 2 i  t  = ∑  i  C O 2 i  t   F F C I i t    .

VAI shows the value-added and EI presents the industrial employees. i show the various industries and t describe the time. Further detail is presented in Table 1  . Eqs. (1) and (2) , Eq. (3)  estimates the accumulated variation in CO2 Es in time t is measured by deviating CO 2 i  t     in the ‘0’ year as follows.(3) Δ C O 2 t  = C O 2 t  ( 1 )  − C O 2 t  ( 0 )  = Δ C O 2 C O 2  I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 E S F i   t   t  + Δ C O 2 E I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 VAE t   t  + Δ C O 2 I S F i t   t  ,    C O 2 t  ( 1 )  = C O 2 t  ( 0 )  + Δ O 2 C O 2  I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 E S F i   t   t  + Δ O 2 E I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 VAE t   t  + Δ C O 2 I S F i t   t  ,  a n d     C O 2 t  ( 0 )  = C O 2 t  ( 1 )  − Δ C O 2 C O 2  I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 E S F i   t   t  + Δ C O 2 E I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 VAE t   t  + Δ C O 2 I S F i t   t           The respective effects of each factor are written in Eqs. (4)–(8) .(4) Δ C O 2 C O 2  I F i t   t  = C O 2 t   ( 1 )  −  C O 2 t   ( O )   l n (  C O 2 t   ( 1 )  − C O 2 t   ( O )   )    × l n (  C O 2  I F i t   ( 1 )   C O 2  I F i t   ( O )     )      (5) Δ C O 2 E S F i   t   t  = C O 2 t   ( 1 )  −  C O 2 t   ( O )   l n (  C O 2 t   ( 1 )  − C O 2 t   ( O )   )    × l n (  E S F i   t  ( 1 )   E S F i   t   ( O )     )      (6) Δ C O 2 E I F i t   t  = C O 2 t   ( 1 )  −  C O 2 t   ( O )   l n (  C O 2 t   ( 1 )  − C O 2 t   ( O )   )    × l n (  E I F i t   ( 1 )   E I F i t   ( O )     )      (7) Δ C O 2 V A E i t   t  = C O 2 t   ( 1 )  −  C O 2 t   ( O )   l n (  C O 2 t   ( 1 )  − C O 2 t   ( O )   )    × l n (  V A E i t  ( 1 )   V A E i t  ( O )     )      (8) Δ C O 2 I S F i t   t  = C O 2 t   ( 1 )  −  C O 2 t   ( O )   l n (  C O 2 t   ( 1 )  − C O 2 t   ( O )   )    × l n (  I S F i t  ( 1 )   I S F i t  ( O )     )      where ( C O 2 t   ( 1 )  −  C O 2 t   ( O )   l n (  C O 2 t   ( 1 )  − C O 2 t   ( O )   )    )    , and subscripts [0–1], respectively. In particular, the LMDI method does not depend on the factors being independent of each other [68 ,77 ]. Simply, the independencies among the factors may exist (see Eqs. (1) and (2) ), the LMDI method can perfectly decompose CO2 Es changes into different factors without leaving residuals, consistency in aggregation, and path independency [78 ,79 ]; also see Eqs. (4)–(8) .  4.2 Decoupling approach (DA) DA is based on the decoupling theory proposed by Tapio [54 ], which illustrates that there is a contemporaneous change between GDP and CO2 Es. Decoupling has been discussed in various ways; for example, Li et al. [80 ] described in the field of physics and found an association between ‘2’ or more physical quantities, Chen and Du [81 ] developed for the environmental field, and OECD [52 ] stated one kind of decoupling index out of ‘3’. Whereas Tapio [54 ] was the last one who relied on growth change in elasticity. The DA expresses that the rising share of the CO2 Es of the total factor is lesser than the GDP. For example, Zhang et al. [82 ] and Song et al. [83 ] analyzed the electricity consumption and transport CO2 Es in China; Raza and Lin [36 ] for Pakistan's transport CO2 Es. According to Tapio, the decoupling indicator between [0-t] is as follows in Eq. (9) .(9) D t  = % Δ CO 2   %GDP  = C O 2  t  − C O 2  0   C O 2  0    G D P t  − G D P 0   G D P 0     ,      Thus, the GDP from the base year to the target year based can be estimated asEqn 10 :(10) D t  = G D P ( 0 )   CO 2  ( 0 )    .  Δ C O 2 C O 2  I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 E S F i   t   t  + Δ C O 2 E I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 V A E i t   t  + Δ O 2 I S F i t   t   Δ G D P t    ,  a n d     (11) Δ F t  = Δ C O 2 C O 2  I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 E S F i   t   t  + Δ C O 2 E I F i t   t  + Δ C O 2 V A E i t  t   t  + Δ C O 2 I S F i t   t  ,  a n d     (12) D t  = D I F  t  + D E S F  t  + D E I F  t  + D V A E  t  + D I S F  t      where D t     is the decoupling indicator. D IF t    , D ESF t    , D EIF t    , D VAE t    , and D ISF t     are the individual decoupling of each factor. Δ F t     is the sum of all factors. Based on ‘8’ states of Tapio's decoupling criteria as below (see Table 2  ).  4.3 Carbon mitigation analysis To analyze the mitigation potential of CO2 Es, we have established a framework based on the given factors. Also, CO2 E via the industrial sector, which is ascertained by the influence of economic growth, is provided as the theoretical upsurge. So, the mitigation rate of CO2 Es from [0-t] is provided in Eq. (13) , which can be estimated based on the method presented by Song et al. [83 ] and Raza and Lin [36 ]. The method identifies the main contributors to the yearly CO2 Es mitigation rate, which will greatly help policy-makers.(13) M R I t  = − Δ F t   Δ C O 2 0  +  Δ C O 2 G D P  t    × 100     where MRI t     is the mitigation rate of the industrial sector in time t. Moreover, if the numerical value of Δ F t     <0, it means that the CO2Es mitigation rate is higher in t time.  4.4 Data Based on statistical reliability and data availability, existing research studies the time series data from 1990 to 2019 using the industrial sectors’ CO2 Es, fossil fuel, energy consumption, population, and economic values. The data sources are: industrial CO2 Es, measured by million tons (Mt) relying on fossil fuel energy consumption of industrial sector (FFCI) collected from EDGAR [9 ]. Total energy consumption of the industrial sector (TECI) and fossil fuel energy consumption (FFCI)3  3 Industrial energy is based on oil, coal and gas, while electricity is used as clean energy. Fossil fuel energy used in the industrial sector is higher than electricity, approximately 13%.   are calculated in Mtoe. All energy-related data are taken from HDIP [7 ]. The industrial population (million) is collected from the PES [15 ]. The industrial value-added is (% of GDP) collected from the PBS [31 ].   5 Empirical analysis 5.1 Contribution of individual factors’ changes Based on the LMDI model, we estimated the changes in CO2 Es in the industrial sector and reached the following consequence. As per Fig. 2  , EIF, CO2 IF, and ISF are rising in the last five years till 2018, while ISF is the factor that has an increasing trend during the period, which contributes to increasing pollution. ESF is about equivalent to ‘0’ until 2014, which proposes that it is constant and then fluctuated until 2019. The decrease in EIF gives an effective change in CO2 IF during 2019. VAE effects are under the x-axis line, which adds to lessen in CO2 Es. The CO2 IF impacted CO2 Es because the CO2 IF of fossil fuels has been growing, particularly in the last decade. ESF mitigates the CO2 Es until 2014 due to the share of fossil fuel in overall energy reduced from 74.42% in 2009–2019. Also, a slight increase of 45.89% of electricity was found during 2000–2019. Simply, the electricity was substituted for fossil fuel energy consumption to be cleaner. Thus, during 2014–2019, the ESF changes are favorable to fall in CO2 Es. EIF is an imperative factor in estimating energy efficiency and is the primary factor in reducing CO2 Es. Simply, CO2 Es per unit of industrial output would increase because of the low contribution of clean energy. Finally, EIF had an optimistic driving impact on CO2 Es, particularly in 2014–2018, which is consistent with Raza and Lin [36 ]. Moreover, the most imperative factor, which executed a decrease in CO2 Es, was the VAE. As Pakistan consumes maximum fossil fuel, which causes CO2 Es. Furthermore, Raza et al. [84 ] analyzed the substitution between energy and nonenergy factors for Pakistan's chemical sector. They concluded that renewable energy technologies, energy structure and energy substitution could reduce CO2 Es and improve the economy. Thus, more capital and substitutability between energy and nonenergy is required to increase the output. Finally, ISF was the second most imperative factor contributing to rising CO2 Es. The number of workers grew from 3.93 to 11.10 million in 1990–2019. The higher the industrial scale, the energy consumption would rise. Consequently, we divide the effects of overall factors into positive driving factors (i.e., COIF, ISF and EIF), VAE as a negative factor and ESF factor has been considered as constant (close to ‘0’) rising factor. EIF, ESF, and ISF are the main imperative factors leading to the changes in CO2 Es.  5.2 Decomposition analysis of driving factors’ CO2 Es The research is distributed to analyze the individual factor's effects from 1990-2019,4  4 5-years of interval data have been arranged because of Pakistan's national economic plan. https://sites.google.com/site/maeconomicsku/home/economic-planning-in-pakistan .   as shown in Table 3  . Energy structure, energy intensity, and industrial-scale factors are the key drivers in growing CO2 Es. The Δ CO 2 ISF t   t     is the key driving factor for rising CO2 Es by 275.01 million. However, Δ CO 2 VAE t   t     is the main factor for decreasing CO2 Es, followed by the Δ CO 2 CO 2  IF i t   t    , and Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t    . The Δ CO 2 VAE t   t     reduced by 230.71%GDP/Million during 1990–2019. The values of Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t     during 1990–1994, 2000–2004, and 2010–2014 are negative, indicating that it contributes to lessening CO2 Es. Though, 1995–1999, 2005–2009, and 2015–2019 values are optimistic because the growth rate of fossil fuel is greater than that of electricity. Overall, the energy structure shows a positive effect with the growth of 4.086 Mtoe. It can be adjusted by growing the share of clean energy, gas, and electricity in the industrial sector. Almost all the measures of Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t     are positive, which means that it adds to increasing the CO2 Es. During 2010–2014, the Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t     is counted by −21.67 Mtoe/%GDP, which estimates that it contributes to lessening CO2 Es. Overall, it can be seen that the Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t     has increased by 271.150 Mtoe/%GDP from 1990 to 2019. Similarly, Lin and Long [10 ] estimated the emission decrease in China's chemical industry and found that the energy intensity factor has positive and negative values. Thus, Pakistan could study developed nations' advanced energy management experience as an under-developing nation. The output of Δ CO 2 VAE t   t     is almost negative, excluding 1990–1994, which shows a positive result. The positive outcomes of ( Δ CO 2 VAE t   t    ) show that the worker's effect causes a rise in CO2 Es, while the negative outcomes show that per worker's emissions are reducing. Due to unskilled labor, Pakistan's industrial values decreased; they grew energy use and even raised CO2 Es. For example, in consonance with PES [85 ], huge energy demand, population, inadequate energy production, circular debt, technical losses, corruption, limited energy supply, high prices, and cyclical cuts in hydropower are the major influential factors to the current energy crisis and economic growth, which is also in line with the study of Lin and Raza [86 ] who analyzes energy substitution effect on Pakistan's transport sector and suggests that maximum output could be gained by raising capital and energy technologies. Finally, almost all the values of Δ CO 2 ISF t   t     are positive except the interval 1990–1994. Simply, it is another factor that directly influences the changes in CO2 Es. During 1990–1994, show negative values because of changes in industrial scale. As shown in Fig. 2 , the industrial structure effect showed a record declination during 1990–1994 and is also evidenced by the PBS [31 ]. Overall, the factors impacting CO2 Es may implement technical labor, capital and renewable energy technologies (RETs) to lessen the CO2 Es [21 ].  5.3 Decoupling analysis of energy consumption and industrial values Previously, the industrial-scale and industrial values were the major factors impacting CO2 Es; therefore, based on the current situation, we applied Tapio's decoupling analysis to inspect the decoupling states between CO2 Es and economic growth. For factor effects, the decoupling analysis is provided in Fig. 3  . The Dt(EIFt ), Dt(ISFt ), and Dt(VAEt ) had strong volatility, and fluctuations of Dt(ESFt ) and Dt(CO2 IFt ) factors' effects were relatively gentle. The Dt(VAEt ) and Dt(ESFt ) are positive during 2019 by 1.26 per million and 0.14 Mtoe. The Dt(EIFt ), (Dt(ISFt ) and Dt(CO2 IFt ) are the factors, which showed a decreasing value of −4.57 Mtoe/%GDP, −5.31 million, and −1.42 Mt. Overall, the mean value of Dt(VAEt ) remained positive (about 2.18 per million), which shows that the economic growth has a negative influence on the decoupling between factors. Or, it shows a strong correlation between economic development and energy utilization indeed [53 ]. The results in Table 4   show that only five states, i.e., END, EC, RC, SND, and RD, appeared during the period. The decoupling states (DS) of CO2 Es and economic progress during 1990–2019 show that END seemed in 1992–1995, 1999, 2001, 2003–2004, 2007, and 2014–2016, and decoupling indexes were 4.49, 17.28, 6.58, 3.55, 5.95, 0.65, 19.51, 2.75, 9.92, 49.10, 4.94, and 24.71, respectively. It attained an EC in 1990, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2010, and 2011 with the decoupling index of 1.97, 4.96, 0.84, 7.17, 10.04, and 2.18. The RD seemed in 2012 and 2013 with the decoupling index of 7.91 and 3.44, while RC was measured in 1997 with the decoupling index of 0.65. Finally, SND occurred maximum in the current economic plan during 1998, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2017–2019 with the decoupling indexes of 8.91, 11.63, 11.33, 8.23, 0.22, 119.26, 129.82, and 8.63. EC shows an association with GDP increase, which estimates that the economy grows as the energy increases. However, the rate of change of energy is lower than that of GDP of the industrial sector during 2000, which is consistent with the study of Zhang et al. [82 ], who estimated energy consumption in various sectors of China. Pakistan's industrial sector is the major driver of social, economic and environmental degradation. Therefore, it takes a long time to attain the decoupling of CO2 Es with economic progress. The progress in 1992–1995, 1999, 2001–2004, 2007, and 2014–2016 presents the END at a minimum level, while END seemed like an increasing trend of GDP in 2003–2004. This is because of a sudden increase in energy consumption by 19.17% during 2004 in the industries [7 ]. CO2 Es from the industrial division present EC with economic growth in sub-period 1990, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2010–11, and analyzed the highest economic value index with 0.06 during 1999–2000. It is noted that energy efficiency and economic values are the key concerns for the existence of EC [87 ,88 ] who analyzed China's transportation energy-related CO2 Es. Similarly, they estimated weak, negative and strong negative decouplings over the current period of 2016 and 2017. In 1997, an RC occurred due to a decline in energy by 1.18%, reducing the economic growth by 0.017%. By PBS [31 ], the annual growth of the industrial sector has risen by 19.74% in the share of GDP, which was decreased by 0.04% during 2019. For this, the government has made policies to control the inflation rate [85 ]. According to Tapio [54 ], RD is when energy and economic growth become negative, while the decoupling states are greater than 1.2 [89 ]. The RD was estimated during 2012 and 2013 with a decoupling index of 7.91 and 3.44. Compared with coupling or negative decoupling, RD is also considered acceptable, as the energy utilization cuts higher than the decrease of industrial output. Finally, the negative decoupling shows that the rise of energy use is far more considerable than the economic values. The most undesirable degree is SND, which shows a decoupling index of 8.91, 11.63, 11.33, 8.23, 0.22, 119.26, 129.82, and 8.63. This shows that energy consumption rises while the economic growth decreases because of positive energy intensity and old production machinery. It can be enhanced by employing fuel substitution and technological progress, for example, a current study of Dong et al. [90 ] investigated industrial states of Henan province of China and found that energy structure and energy intensity effects have made weak decoupling due to substitution. In 2035, four major industrial sectors will achieve carbon neutralization, and the CO2 Es decoupling effect will be clear.  5.4 Mitigation rate and CO2 Es The mitigation rate of CO2 Es is presented in Table 5  . Form equations (11)-(13)  various factor's mitigation rates can be measured from 1990 to 2019. The mitigation rate of industrial sector is followed using the study of Song et al. [83 ]. During 1994, 1997, 2004–06, 2011, and 2013–14, the mitigation rates are 1.31%, 0.09%, 3.73%, 0.72%, 1.25%, 0.22%, 11.3%, and 0.51%. The main contributor to carbon mitigation is Δ CO 2 CO 2  IF i t   t    , Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t    , and Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t    . The mitigation rate of CO2 Es during 1997, 2011, and 2014 was counted as the lowest mitigation rate, which was upgraded by improving carbon intensity, energy share and energy intensity factors. In addition, the improvement of Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t     and Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t    , the maximization of energy structure and the substitution of fossil fuels into clean energy are the crucial contributors to mitigating CO2 Es. During 1991–93, 1995–96, 1998–03, 2007–10, 2012, 2014, and 2016–19, the mitigation rate of CO2 Es was counted by 1.05%, 1.53%, 10.53%, 0.64%, 0.26%, 0.85%, 6.62%, 0.31%, 0.36%, 1.25%, 1.47%, 4.19%, 0.62%, 0.04%, 0.45%, 0.96%, 0.69%, 2.48%, 1.89%, 1.68%, and 1.85%, which can be attributed to the rise of energy use per unit of Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t    . Currently, during 2018–2019, the reduction rate of CO2 Es is counted by 1.85%, which estimates that Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t    , Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t     and Δ CO 2 ISF t   t     are the major factors, increasing CO2 Es.   6 Discussion Based on empirical results, the discussion of the current study is as follows: First, as indicated in Table 3 , we can see that industrial energy grew 452.93 Mt from 1990 to 2019. This is evident in the huge production and investment in this sector. The importance of industrial factors to CO2 Es was hugely determined by the expansion stage and changing levels of technology applied for further development in Pakistan. Being a huge energy-consuming sector, the consumption grew from 6.54 to 20.42Mtoe during 1990–2019. In this sector, energy consumption, energy structure, and worker's effect contribute to growing CO2 Es. These outcomes are consistent with the studies of Wang et al. [91 ]; Raza and Lin [36 ], who employed the decomposition analysis for the industrial and transportation sectors in China and Pakistan. However, the employees' value added is the factor that can be substituted with technology (skilled labor) to control CO2 Es. Also, the growth in energy intensity factor has raised emissions, which is similar to the study of Lin and Long [10 ]. Second, during 1990–2019, industrial economy and carbon emissions experienced ‘5’ decoupling and coupling states, including EC, RC, RD, END, and SND. This presents that END and SND are the major influences during the period. If the energy increases/decreases, the economy will be influenced, consistent with the study of Dong et al. [90 ]. Thus, these changes are due to the specific sector's energy framework and technical progress. Importantly, RC and RD occur when both energy and economy are lesser with limiting values of decouplings [89 ]. It occurred only during 1997 and 2012–13, which shows decreasing significant association with each other or both factors, showing an equal relationship. These studies are associated with Zhang et al. [82 ] and Lin and Raza [11 ], which can be enhanced by energy structure to improve economy and energy security. Finally, to reduce CO2 Es from Pakistan's industrial sector, more attention must be paid to the influencing factors with little impact, as shown in Table 5 . Tapio's decoupling describes the evolution of decoupling in the various sectors or regions and finds the relationship degrees of decouplings in regions or sectors. The MRI rate of CO2 Es from 1990 to 2019 shows mixed results. CO2 Es mitigation appeared in 1994, 1997, 2004–06, 2011, 2013, and 2015. The main contributor for mitigating CO2 Es is the Δ CO 2 ISF t   t     and Δ CO 2 CO 2  IF i t   t    . These mitigations are due to the energy transitions and economic revolution in Pakistan, which are in line with the study of Raza and Lin [36 ]. Consequently, Δ CO 2 ISF t   t    , Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t    , and Δ CO 2 ISF t   t     factors from the last two decades have shown CO2 E effects, which presents that the industrial sector attained little emissions reduction due to few developments under various projects, including renewable energy. Also, the CO2 Es reduction estimations in the industrial sector need to be further strengthened.  7 Conclusion and policy recommendations 7.1 Conclusion Being the highest energy-intensive and CO2  emitting sector, the current issue shows the influence of factors' rising CO2 Es. Thus, to understand the CO2 Es mitigation, existing research employed the LMDI method to estimate how variations exist in key industrial factors. Tapio's index applies to evaluate the decoupling states and mitigation potential of CO2 Es from the industrial sector. Empirical results show that:1. The annual analysis shows that the worker's effect, energy intensity and energy structure effect were the main driving factors impacting variations in carbon emissions. The change in energy intensity factor (Δ CO 2 EIF i  t   t    ) is the key cause of increasing carbon emissions and lessening energy efficiency, while the energy structure factor (Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t    ) plays an essential part in raising CO2 Es. Overall, it is estimated that Δ CO 2 EIF i t   t     and Δ CO 2 ESF i  t   t     can be enhanced to reduce the CO2 Es. Thus, due to higher worker's effect, if worker's effect and economic scale impacts are higher than energy intensity and energy structure, CO2 Es would increase and positively impact the other factors.  2. Only five decoupling states have been found during 1990–2019. The expansive negative decoupling with the economic output during the maximum period was found due to a sudden rise in energy utilization. Expansive coupling with the economic output was found seven times (see Table 4 ) during the period due to a little decline in fossil fuel consumption with effective values. Recessive coupling was found during 1997, and recessive decoupling with the decrease in economic values was estimated during 2011–13. This is because of the rise in economic values as per the government's objectives, i.e., production and lowering the inflation rate during the plan [85 ]. Nine times, a strong negative decoupling was found with economic inefficiency during the current period. This presents that the growth of CO2 Es from industrial is quicker than that of its value-added, reflecting high environmental and energy expenditures. Thus, Pakistan's energy structure is still not sustainable, which could be made strong or weak decoupling if the government should take hard steps on energy-related projects.  3. CO2  mitigation rate seemed during 1994, 1997, 2004–06, 2011, and 2013–14, while the mitigation rate during 1991–93, 1995–96, 1998–03, 2007–10, 2012, 2014, and 2016–19, as shown in Table 5 . This is accredited to the rise of energy use per unit of the energy structure factor. Furthermore, the expansive coupling and expansive negative decoupling can change the states into weak decoupling due to rising renewable energy sources (see Fig. 1 ).     7.2 Policy recommendations 1. From policy perspectives based on empirical findings: Pakistan should continue to promote energy structure, improve fuel quality, modern machinery, and decrease the quantity of fossil fuel consumption. Using domestic energy resources based on technical up-gradation, energy-saving could be gained (i.e., 185Bt coal reserves, 3000–3300 h/year sunshine, and 24,700,000mcft gas reserves). The clean energy resources and production controlled policies (i.e., Visions 2025–2035, CPEC, COP-21, and INDC) can reduce imported fuel and CO2 Es at a maximum level [5 ]. This is because Pakistan's coal and gas reserves lie in the world's 28th and 29th numbers, which could be more productive in energy production, import reduction, reduce energy cost, increase employment, and enhance the living standard of people. For example, Wang et al. [92 ] for China and Lin et al. [93 ] for Ghana used renewable energy policies to reduce carbon emissions, which will motivate Pakistan to control pollution and economic sustainability.  2. To enhance the industrial economy, energy output, rising price of fuel, and technical labor, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) should improve the industrial structure and encourage the development of various industries at micro and macro levels, which are similar to Lin and Raza [86 ]. With the rising global climate, CO2 Es will increasingly restraint economic development [10 ]. As per the findings and literature, economic development, population, and social revolution have gradually become the main cause of energy use [2 ]. Thus, the absenteeism of domestic resources and excessive use of imported fossil fuel causes CO2 Es.  3. As shown in Fig. 1 , industrial electricity consumption reached 2.34 Mtoe out of 8.91 Mtoe. The government should contribute a maximum share of electricity and renewable energy in the industrial sector because cleaner energy and imported electricity were added by 1.3% and 0.1% [7 ]. Currently, Pakistan's industrial sector is not using renewable energy; therefore, the share of renewable energy must be included to increase employment and control CO2 Es. Essentially, energy-saving technologies are an imperative factor in enhancing energy intensity. Therefore, the Pakistan government should compromise with long-term agreements, i.e., CPEC, Vision 2025 [16 ], and Vision 2035 [17 ], to grow clean energy and investment in energy-saving technologies.  4. Finally, improving the energy structure adds to reducing CO2 Es. For instance, the share of fossil fuel (i.e., coal, oil, and gas) declined by 0.98 Mtoe and the share of electricity increased by 0.11 Mtoe during 2019 than the previous year HDIP [7 ], which is evident in a reduction in CO2 Es. Thus, the government may place modern renewable resources and encourage industries to use clean energy by offering various motives, i.e., tax reduction, subsidies, and enhanced energy infrastructure to lessen CO2 Es. For example, Wang et al. [37 ] for China and Lin et al. [93 ] for Ghana used renewable energy policies to reduce CO2 Es. Moreover, as per the regional scale, Pakistan has certain limitations. As per the latest outcomes, industrial structure, energy intensity and energy structure are crucial factors in varying carbon emissions. For this, a productive system limits the range of contributing technologies that can fulfill production demand and growing projects. Future studies may seem at the provincial, rural or urban areas to analyze the relationship between related factors. It includes: (i) for better estimation, the data accessibility is compulsory, (ii) technical efficiency and clean energy had a significant influence on country's CO2 Es and (iii) energy structure in industrial areas, power plants, skilled labor, and financial support could be judged over the future. It can be noted that empirical proof from Pakistan may not apply to other regions or countries because of the level and economic growth paradigm, technological progress and factors.
