                  CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly being viewed as an important part of India's energy transitions by several practitioners. Ensemble modeling scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement indicate that investments by the end of this decade towards CO2 transport and geologic storage would need to be $1–8 billion/year in India. These large-scale investments are accompanied by multiple technical, environmental, financial and societal interlinkages that interface with sustainable development. This review begins by summarizing some of these considerations in context of geologic CO2 storage. It then devotes individual sections to discussing how sustainable development goals (SDGs) could align with these projects and play a synergistic role for decarbonization. Four SDGs are particularly of interest. SDG-17 on global partnerships would be instrumental in facilitating low-cost financing for CCS investments. At the same time, other SDGs could be strategically used as co-benefits to CCS projects. These include SDG-8 on decent work, SDG-6 on clean water and SDG-9 on industry. We posit that it is not possible to study these SDG interlinkages in the global hypothetical. As such, this review takes a view of Indian geologic formations for CCS but also offers generalizable insights across other developing economies.

This fund is replenished from Australia and the United Kingdom, and it seeks to accelerate CCS projects in Asia (Warren, 2019). India is one of the countries which is stated to be given initial priority for the projects. Past projects from this fund have been awarded to China, Indonesia and Pakistan where the budget for such projects has ranged from $0.35–5.50 million. In our view, this budget is consistent with pilot facilities for drilling exploration boreholes in some basins.Another funding source for pilot/demonstration projects is the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). India has had a successful partnership with GEF with co-financing of 103 projects to date (Joshi and Negi, 2023). The most relevant example in this case is the Moonidih coalbed methane (CBM) project which was funded by the GEF to the tune of $9.2 million with additional funding from the United Nations Development Program and Ministry of Coal (Singh and Hajra, 2018). This project was successfully implemented by a subsidiary of Coal India Limited and resulted in capacity-building at a research laboratory and a university. Thus, it provides an established example of academia-industry partnership.The biggest challenge in terms of just transitions is that of employment. CCS can aid in employment in multiple ways. First, as fossil fuels are retained in the energy mix, the jobs associated with their exploration, extraction and utilization are retained. This is particularly of interest to governments in the eastern part of India. Notably, the Government of Jharkhand has constituted a task force on this subject, while the Ministry of Coal has also established a just transitions wing with some financial support from the World Bank. We recommend that these institutions study the employment opportunities in scenarios with and without CCS. This can help in a detailed assessment of the economic and social costs in these regions. We also echo the views from the literature that just transitions must incorporate features around communication, regional-specificity, being inclusive of stakeholder concerns and highlighting the energy transition elements that have succeeded (Swennenhuis et al., 2020).The next key aspect of just transitions is skill development and education. Interviews with worker union representatives in India have highlighted that they are more amenable to the energy transitions if their children can be equipped with the transferable skills applicable to low-carbon industries. This is quite synchronous with the existing nature of companies in this area. For instance, Coal India Limited has provided free college tuition if the children of their workers below an income threshold are selected in engineering or medical colleges (Garg et al., 2021). This can be scaled-up by companies engaged in geologic sequestration, which directly ties in profitability with societal goals. Further, we also suggest developing a CCS-centric workforce. Excellent examples in this area include the IEAGHG Summer School and the USDOE sponsored Research Experience on Carbon Sequestration (Beck and Gale, 2009; Cao and Tomski, 2023). These workshops could entail field visits and also tutorials for specialized, open-source CCS-related software, e.g., SimCCS, En-ROADS, etc (Pamidighantam et al., 2020). Many of the skills, such as financing, life-cycle assessment and developing policy briefs may be directly transferable to other industries.There is a substantial potential to couple ECBMR and low-carbon steel development. Past research has explored how CO2 captured from point sources can enhance CBM recovery in Raniganj and Jharia coalfields (Vishal et al., 2018). At the same time, CBM finds an important market in existing and upcoming steel plants. While several second-generation technologies are focused on new and upcoming steel plants, older plants have chosen to use CBM to reduce the carbon intensity of their steel. This is feasible because a UNDP-funded study has categorized CBM as a low-end technology package for the Indian steel industry, where investment of Rs. 1.5–2 Crores (US$ 0.18–0.24 million) can result in fuel savings of 20–25% with a payback period of less than a year. Further, the installation/retrofitting time for such interventions is only 4–6 months, which avoids significant downtime for the plant (Van Der Akker and Das, 2016).Authors thank the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor, Government of India (PSA), and NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance (NETRA), India for sponsoring this study.

Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction CO2  capture and storage (CCS) has been widely projected to be a critical component of energy transitions compatible with net-zero targets. For instance, the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s sustainable development scenario projects global cumulative CO2  storage in geologic formations to the tune of 240 Gt-CO2  in this century (IEA, 2020 ). A key application area for geologic CO2  storage is in hard-to-abate sectors, which are not readily amenable to electrification. As such, sectors such as steel and cement are projected to see at least a quarter of their mitigation coming from CCS. Another key application area for CCS is in conjunction with biogenic CO2  or ambient air capture of CO2  to result in carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. In the context of this paper, we largely focus on the integration of CO2  storage with industrial sectors since the CDR requirement in developing economies such as India is limited (Fyson et al., 2020 ; Pozo et al., 2020 ). India is a critical economy in terms of meeting global climate targets. Economic growth has been around 6–7% in the recent few quarters (barring the economic slowdown during the pandemic). If such growth continues over the next two decades, the gross domestic product is expected to increase fourfold. India's current human development index is also in the medium range (i.e., 0.645). Increasing this to levels comparable to developed economies would require nearly 3-4 times rise in energy consumption (Bhattacharyya et al., 2022 ). The anticipated growth in economic and human development is likely to be accompanied by an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Currently, India's GHG mitigation plans rely primarily on renewables and increasing forest cover. CCS has been viewed with some degree of pessimism among stakeholders due to high costs (Viebahn et al., 2014 ). That said, India's recent long-term low-carbon development strategy mentions CCS while stating that its deployment is contingent on the availability of international finance (MOEFCC, 2022 ). If India's current nationally determined contributions (NDC) have to be strengthened to meet net-zero targets, CCS would likely be a part of the energy and industrial systems. Scenarios consistent with a 2 C   °     target, for example, show cumulative CO2  storage of 7–10 Gt-CO2  by 2050 in India; something absent in NDC targets (Shukla et al., 2015 ; Vishwanathan and Garg, 2020 ). Scaling up these CO2  storage targets are hindered not only by technological factors (Vishal et al., 2021a ) but also by the scale of required investments and high economic risks with large capital investments. India is currently at a state where the maximum ‘bang per buck’ in public investments may be achieved via sustainable development goals (SDGs) such as education, health and employment (Singh and Garg, 2022 ). The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (Clarke et al., 2022 ), a recent report by the IEA (IEAGHG, 2020 ) and sources in the peer-reviewed literature have also tried to draw out the possible linkages between CCS and SDGs (de Medeiros Costa et al., 2021 ; Mikunda et al., 2021 ). Most of these reports acknowledge that whether development of CCS aligns with SDGs may not be discussed in the global hypothetical but instead requires contextually-explicit understanding (Bennich et al., 2023 ). In this vein, this paper aims to draw a roadmap for CCS in India based on these considerations. This paper begins with a review of potential technical, financial and societal risks for geologic CO2  storage in India that interface with key SDGs (section 2 ). It then devotes individual sections to recommend synergistic deployment of CCS to promote SDGs. In the broader context of investments, section 3  discusses how international partnerships (SDG-17) could help navigate financial risks. For linking CCS with societal goals, sections 4 and 5  are then devoted to elucidating the potential role CCS could play in aiding employment and skills (SDG-8) and ecosystem services such as clean water (SDG-6). To visualize these aspects, the paper concludes with an example of an overlooked but important confluence of factors in eastern India where CCS could be deployed with higher readiness than most other industrial clusters in the country (section 6 ). Notably, synergistic development of CCS and the steel sector is suggested here towards realizing SDG-9 on ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’.  2 Key risks associated with CCS investments The following paragraphs aim to summarize the potential risks associated with CO2  storage and how SDG synergies could avert these risks. The list of risks here is not exhaustive as it does not discuss important issues such as storage liabilities and cost overruns. That said, this paper hinges primarily on the risks that have convergence with SDGs as noted in the IEA report (IEAGHG, 2020 ) and those that emerged from our stakeholder elicitations (Garg et al., 2021 ). 2.1 Financial risks A lack of consistent value for CO2  sequestration may deter large investments (Rassool and Havercroft, 2021 ). It is understood that enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced coalbed methane recovery (ECBMR) projects are primarily incentivized by the saleable value of oil/methane, while saline aquifer projects need government, market or multilateral support for operations in the initial stage. The economic value from these sources may be deemed as the tangible ‘value’ of CO2  storage, which facilitates investment decisions. Past experience has shown that there is considerable uncertainty regarding this ‘value’, which induces further pessimism towards investment decisions. A good example here is the Petra Nova project in Texas, United States. While operating in 2019, this was one of the largest CCS projects across the world, capturing and storing >1 million tonnes of CO2  annually and injecting it for EOR. During the COVID-19 pandemic peak in 2020, global crude prices fell (Ehlig-Economides, 2023 ) which resulted in a decline in the ‘value’ of CCS for this project. As such, the CCS operation was suspended until recently (Garg et al., 2023 ). As saline aquifer projects have to rely upon government or market support, this ‘value’ is even more uncertain in their context. In March 2023, the DRAX bioenergy with CCS facility under construction in the United Kingdom was paused as the operators cited a lack of clarity in the government support for the project (Buli and Twidale, 2023 ). The uncertainty in the ‘value’ of CO2  storage is likely to remain in a purely market-driven environment. Ensuring a diversified set of revenues can reduce the dependence on purely market-driven or purely incentive-driven operation (section 3 ).  2.2 Public perception risks Another mitigable risk is that of social acceptability or the social ‘license to operate’ (Gough et al., 2018 ). Globally, CCS is seen more negatively than other low-carbon technologies such as renewables (Clarke et al., 2022 ). This is presumably due to the large volumes of CO2  that need to be sequestered in areas that are near communities. Social acceptability risks may generally be reduced by providing palatable information to the public. It has been seen that the public is more accepting towards CCS projects if more information is provided to them. The Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships in the United States, for example, have communication with the public as an important project objective (Frank-Collins et al., 2022 ). We recommend similar initiatives as part of project pilots in India, which also highlight the just transition aspects of CCS in section 4 . If CCS projects can operate in a way that promotes employment and skill development, they could further aid in improving their perception.  2.3 Coordination or value chain risks Finally, another potential risk factor arises due to the complexity of the CO2  value chain. CO2  storage projects require a consistent throughput of CO2  as most market mechanisms or government support are incentivized per tonne of CO2  stored (Bistline et al., 2023 ). However, CCS is a complex value chain requiring extensive coordination, where the downstream operators may not find a consistent CO2  supply based on factors outside their control. These reasons include plant downtime, regulatory barriers, cheaper alternatives to CCS and breakdown/failure of transport pipelines. In terms of risks that may arise from a lack of CO2  supply as a result of value-chain disruption, it is imperative that long-term CO2  storage shift away from a one-to-one approach, i.e., one source delivers CO2  to one sink (Rassool and Havercroft, 2021 ). Instead, policymakers should prioritize development of hubs-and-clusters of CCS development (Vishal et al., 2023 ). Such systems minimize the dependence of the CO2  sink on a single source and provide the option to diversify the availability of CO2 . We suggest an example of creating a steel sector hub in eastern India in this context (section 6 ).   3 Promoting low-cost finance from international sources SDG-17 aims at strengthening the means of implementation for sustainable development via global partnerships. As such, financing is an integral part of this goal. Notably, some of the targets within this goal refer to developed countries meeting their official development assistance commitments and mobilizing additional financial resources to developing countries from multiple sources (Carlsen and Bruggemann, 2022 ). In the context of CCS deployment in India, diversifying revenue sources can help buffer some market-related shocks. The source of finance for developed countries may be in the form of tax credits or large grants instituted by the government itself. An example is the 45Q tax credits in the United States which offer $85/t-CO2  for point source CCS. However, developing countries can achieve their human development goals such as healthcare, education and food security at much lower costs (McCollum et al., 2018b ). As such, India has declared that it will conditionally uptake CCS subject to the availability of international low-cost finance, as declared in its Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC (MOEFCC, 2022 ). The sources of low-cost finance are described below (Garg et al., 2023 ). The initial projects on exploration of potential CO2  storage sites and potential pilots may request funds from the Asian Development Bank  (ADB ) CCS  Fund. This fund is replenished from Australia and the United Kingdom, and it seeks to accelerate CCS  projects in Asia (Warren, 2019 ). India is one of the countries which is stated to be given initial priority for the projects. Past projects from this fund have been awarded to China, Indonesia and Pakistan where the budget for such projects has ranged from $0.35–5.50 million. In our view, this budget is consistent with pilot facilities for drilling exploration boreholes in some basins. Another funding source for pilot/demonstration projects is the Global Environmental Facility (GEF ). India has had a successful partnership with GEF with co-financing of 103 projects to date (Joshi and Negi, 2023 ). The most relevant example in this case is the Moonidih coalbed methane (CBM ) project which was funded by the GEF  to the tune of $9.2 million with additional funding from the United Nations  Development Program and Ministry of Coal (Singh and Hajra, 2018 ). This project was successfully implemented by a subsidiary of Coal India Limited and resulted in capacity-building at a research laboratory and a university. Thus, it provides an established example of academia-industry partnership. While the ADB CCS Fund and GEF can help in financing of early projects, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) can help in later-stage development of commercial projects. The GCF is the financial arm of the Paris Agreement implementation under the UNFCCC. The GCF goal was $100 billion investment from developed countries by 2020, though actual and planned investments are substantially less (Kalinowski, 2023 ). Acceleration of investments by developed countries and apportionment towards CCS can help India in long-term planning. In general, multilateral development banks (MDBs) can prove to be an important source of finance both during the pilot and commercial CCS phases in India. That said, requisitioning of such funds requires adherence to clear life cycle guidance as per stakeholders in a recently concluded G20 Meeting (Vishal and Singh, 2023 ). Finally, sustainability-linked loans and green loans/bonds are likely to emerge as an important form of finance from commercial banks. Sustainability-linked loans may be awarded to companies with high environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) metrics. On the other hand, green loans are targeted towards specific low-carbon projects based on the bank's portfolios (Rassool and Havercroft, 2021 ). Thus, a particular financial institution (general or specialized) may incentivize a project geared towards reduction of GHG emissions. Again, this will likely be contingent on life-cycle scrutiny. As such, we recommend that the Government of India create robust guidance for accounting of GHG emissions for CCS projects. Transparent disclosure of ESG metrics by key companies operating in the subsurface would also be critical.  4 CCS and just transitions Decent work and economic growth are targeted in SDG-8. Specific targets here include diversification and technological upgrading in labor-intensive sectors, full and productive employment, and reduction in proportion of youth without education or training (Carlsen and Bruggemann, 2022 ). We foresee CCS as an important part of these goals via the concept of ‘just transitions’. This is a concept developed jointly at the intersection of climate action and labor movements, which emphasizes that carbon mitigation must take equity implications into account (Heffron and Heffron, 2021 ; Wang and Lo, 2021 ). In particular, it involves taking a closer lens at employment, health and skill development of the workforce involved in fossil fuel industries, and their families. Globally, fossil fuel phaseout/phasedown has come at a significant cost to the workers or the government exchequer. A good example is of Germany, where underground coal mining has steadily declined since the 1960s owing to economic considerations. The German and EU governments invested close to $100 billion to ensure pensions, education of the coal miners’ children, and low-cost healthcare (Jacobsson and Lauber, 2006 ). The first developing economy to seriously consider just transitions was South Africa, which accepted a $8.5 billion deal during the COP-26 meeting (von Lüpke et al., 2023 ). However, operationalizing the funds has been difficult amid a variety of uncertainties (Mohlakoana et al., 2023; Pilling, 2022 ). In light of such challenges, navigating the just transitions challenge in India is even more complicated by the fact that at least one million workers are employed in the coal mining industry and another million in industries that utilize coal (e.g., steel). Worker unions have strongly opposed the idea of moving away from coal specifically and fossil fuels in general (Chaturvedi, 2021 ). This is particularly relevant because both public and private sector enterprises in India have a longstanding tradition of corporate social responsibility via schools, hospitals and other social infrastructure (Singh and Singh, 2023 ). CCS can help navigate this challenge as it enables ensuring that fossil fuels can remain in the energy mix even as strong decarbonization targets are enforced (Garg et al., 2017 ; Garg and Shukla, 2009 ). At the same time, some environmentalists claim that CCS is a mechanism which perpetuates carbon lock-in and negative path dependence (Asayama, 2021 ). In this section, we evaluate how CCS could play a role in just transitions in India from the storage perspective. This sectoral perspective evolves broader roadmaps developed by the Ministry of Coal (CMPDI, 2023 ) and the NITI Aayog (NITI Aayog, 2022 ). Fig. 1   summarizes the key features for just transition in the context of geologic CO2  storage projects. The biggest challenge in terms of just transitions is that of employment. CCS can aid in employment in multiple ways. First, as fossil fuels are retained in the energy mix, the jobs associated with their exploration, extraction and utilization are retained. This is particularly of interest to governments in the eastern part of India. Notably, the Government of Jharkhand has constituted a task force on this subject, while the Ministry of Coal has also established a just transitions wing with some financial support from the World Bank . We recommend that these institutions study the employment opportunities in scenarios with and without CCS. This can help in a detailed assessment of the economic and social costs in these regions. We also echo the views from the literature that just transitions must incorporate features around communication, regional-specificity, being inclusive of stakeholder concerns and highlighting the energy transition elements that have succeeded (Swennenhuis et al., 2020 ). Another way CCS can help is creating new types of niche employment. From a sequestration perspective, this initially pertains to the exploration and characterization of reservoirs. For example, the Geological Survey of India performs coal exploration only up to a depth of 1200m. However, coal seams suitable for geologic sequestration may occur at a much greater depth. This would require new methods of geophysical exploration and create additional job opportunities. CO2  transport would, similarly, involve new employment for laying and maintaining pipelines. Finally, CO2  injection and monitoring processes would employ a number of engineers, geologists and environmental consultants. While the exact estimate for an Indian CO2  sequestration project is not known, a prospective cluster in the United States is anticipated to create several thousand jobs across capture, transport and storage components of the value chain (Rhodium Group, 2020 ). The advantage of such jobs is that they are perennial, as opposed to renewable jobs which are largely concentrated towards the commissioning phase of the project. The next key aspect of just transitions is skill development and education. Interviews with worker union representatives in India have highlighted that they are more amenable to the energy transitions if their children can be equipped with the transferable skills applicable to low-carbon industries. This is quite synchronous with the existing nature of companies in this area. For instance, Coal India Limited has provided free college tuition if the children of their workers below an income threshold are selected in engineering or medical colleges (Garg et al., 2021 ). This can be scaled-up by companies engaged in geologic sequestration, which directly ties in profitability with societal goals. Further, we also suggest developing a CCS-centric workforce. Excellent examples in this area include the IEAGHG Summer School and the USDOE  sponsored Research Experience on Carbon Sequestration (Beck and Gale, 2009 ; Cao and Tomski, 2023 ). These workshops could entail field visits and also tutorials for specialized, open-source CCS-related software, e.g., SimCCS, En-ROADS, etc (Pamidighantam et al., 2020 ). Many of the skills, such as financing, life-cycle assessment and developing policy briefs may be directly transferable to other industries. CO2  storage projects can also help facilitate ecosystem services. A good example is that of potable and agricultural water provision from the brackish or saline water produced from reservoirs. These opportunities are highlighted in detail in the next section. This is not without precedent. The Ministry of Coal is known to have treated mine water to potable levels and provided it to 1.8 million individuals in 800 villages (Singh and Singh, 2023 ). This provides a clear strategic plan to incorporate such projects within the ambit of CCS. An important feature regarding just transitions is also regional equity in India (Mitra and Chandra, 2023 ). Both the NITI Aayog report and the peer-reviewed literature point to the need for tailoring just transitions based on individual regions. Because CO2  sinks are interspersed throughout the country, incorporating CCS within just transition plans also aids in assuring regional equity are located throughout the country. Overall, we recommend that companies explicitly highlight the ways in which CO2  storage can help in meeting communities’ societal objectives. This will likely enhance the social license to operate for the CCS project as well as the underlying baseload plants. Developing clear communication plans for just transitions is likely easier with partnerships at a cluster level (Gough and Mander, 2022 ). A CCS cluster in India could sequester ∼100 Mt-CO2 /year based on current emission trajectories (Vishal et al., 2023 ). This builds in a greater opportunity for workforce development across sectors. Building partnerships accordingly requires a concerted effort between government agencies and MDBs (for financing), companies that operate in the region, academic institutions for training the workforce, and organization such as the Coal Miners’ Provident Fund Organization and worker unions for outreach efforts (Garg et al., 2021 ).  5 Environmental synergies with CCS The published literature (Singh and Rao, 2014 ) and ongoing research (Kvamsdal et al., 2022 ) on the environmental impacts of CCS projects in India largely focusses on upstream (CO2  capture) dimensions. Here, we summarize environmental issues pertaining to energy and water consumption that may arise with geologic storage projects and identify the research gaps. It is notable that the IEA report identifies that many environmental SDGs may have tradeoffs with CCS development (SDG 3, 6 and 15). However, we do note one particular case of SDG-6 which aims at 'clean drinking water for all', which could be synergistically developed with CCS. 5.1 Energy and GHG emissions As the main function of CCS systems is to sequester CO2 , quantifying net emissions is imperative. In other words, the energy consumed and associated GHG emissions should be appropriately accounted for, and managed, to ensure that the CCS projects achieve optimal sequestration. The primary driver of the CO2  emissions in the injection process itself is the diesel fuel consumption during drilling of wells. A higher depth entails greater diesel consumption and accordingly, greater CO2  emissions in the process. The minimum depth of injection in sedimentary basins is around 800m, at which stage the CO2  becomes supercritical. The diesel consumption for this depth is around 1000–2000 gal/well. While the exact depth characterization of Indian saline aquifers has not been done, U.S. experience shows that suitable reservoirs may occur up to 4000m (Singh et al., 2021a ). At such depths, the drilling fuel consumption can be 4000–12000 gal/well (Brandt et al., 2016 ). Clearly, quantifying reservoir parameters such as depth and porosity will govern the number of wells to be drilled, and accordingly the gross emissions associated with CO2  storage. As noted, EOR and ECBMR are anticipated to be the early-movers for geologic storage in India. The accounting of GHG emissions in these projects is more nuanced because they result in production of combustible fuels and associated CO2  emissions. The main parameter associated with this accounting is the productivity of the well, i.e., volume of oil/methane produced per tonne of CO2  sequestered (Melara et al., 2020 ; Singh and Dunn, 2022 ). For conventional reservoirs such as oil basins, volumetric approaches to estimating pore space depict reasonably accurate results for geologic storage with some modifications. However, unconventional reservoirs such as CBM and shale basins require detailed adsorption isotherm data for storage potential assessment (De Silva and Ranjith, 2014 ). The adsorption isotherm refers to the representation of the gas volume adsorbed to reach equilibrium stage as a function of reservoir pressure at a given temperature (Kinniburgh, 1986 ). These adsorption isotherms reveal important information regarding both the life-cycle efficacy and project economics for potential CCS projects. At lower pressures, adsorption is the only major storage mechanism in coal seams (De Silva et al., 2012 ). For instance, experimental data across several basins follows so-called Langmuir model at low pressures which is given by (De Silva and Ranjith, 2014 ):V C S   = V L  P 1 + P ∙ P L         Here, VCS  is the gas content at saturation, P  stands for the reservoir pressure, while P L   and V L   denote the Langmuir volume and pressure. Two major limitations of the Langmuir model are that it is only applicable at lower pressures and does not account for multi-layer adsorption. As the reservoir pressure increases above the critical pressure and assuming that the source temperature is itself higher than the critical temperature of 31.7 C   °     (Fig. 2  ), the supercritical state of CO2  is not accounted for by Langmuir model. In the supercritical state, the volume of CO2  declines rapidly and adopts midway properties between a gas and liquid. As such, several other methods such as Extended Langmuir, Toth, UNILAN, 2D EOS, Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) and Dubinin–Astakhov (D–A) give better results at high pressure and temperatures, as noted in this review (De Silva et al., 2012 ). Newer techniques such as representative kerogen models and molecular methane modeling have come up for studying multiscale pore systems (Alafnan et al., 2021 ; Chandra et al., 2022 ; Chandra and Vishal, 2021 ). Adsorption isotherm analyses have been carried out in this domain by a number of institutions (Asif et al., 2019 ; Panwar et al., 2017 ; Vishal et al., 2013 ), and can be used as a preliminary data for evaluating the life-cycle efficacy for potential projects. The adsorption isotherms can reveal the relative Langmuir coefficients of methane versus CO2  in unconventional formations. This could accordingly reveal the amount of hydrocarbon produced and subsequently the downstream CO2  emission. The literature on CO2 -EOR suggests that accounting approaches (e.g., allocation or system expansion) dramatically affect the net emissions associated with the life cycle (Cooney et al., 2015 ). Consider a network of steel plants injecting CO2  for EOR. There are two marketable products in this system – steel and crude oil. The guiding question here is, “how should emissions and sequestration be apportioned between these two products ”? We recommend discussion of this question by relevant stakeholders, particularly as the Indian Carbon Market is being developed (Vishal and Singh, 2023 ).  5.2 Water The literature indicates that the CO2  capture stage results in substantial water withdrawal. That said, the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (Clarke et al., 2022 ) has also indicated that the storage stage may result in co-production of large amounts of formation waters. This co-production is necessary to maintain optimal reservoir pressure. If appropriately treated, this water may offset the water consumption at the CO2  capture end (Clarke et al., 2022 ). It is recommended to establish clear regulatory regimes for governing the disposal and handling of produced waters from geologic sequestration (Schroeder et al., 2016 ). Past work has established a strong case for utilization of such waters for potable use in the Damodar Valley basin in eastern India (Singh and Colosi, 2019 ). To our knowledge, Coal India Limited already has multiple mine water treatment facilities and Essar Oil Limited also employs reverse osmosis on CBM produced water at its sites. The produced waters from CO2 -EOR are the most energy-intensive to treat as they occur at a high salinity and also have a high concentration of organic contaminants. These waters may be reinjected for water flooding. That said, surplus water may still be produced (Dastgheib et al., 2014 ). Indian researchers have developed indigenous techniques to treat these waters (Purnima et al., 2023 ). Appropriate water flow rate and geothermal gradient may also facilitate clean electricity generation at such sites (Vajpayee and Khambhayata, 2016 ). The produced waters from CBM sites have been extensively studied for Damodar Valley coalfields (Singh et al., 2018 ). They have concluded that the waters are at a salinity of 1000–3000 ppm. Further, these waters are of Na–HCO3  type, with acceptable pH and no discernible bacterial contamination (Singh et al., 2018 ). Based on their study, the estimated energy consumption for treatment is 0.45–1.40 kWh/m3 . Reverse osmosis technology is best suited to treat these waters and is being pursued actively at existing CBM sites. CO2 -ECBM projects are also associated with lower water production than CBM projects (Jackson, 2006 ; Jamshidi and Jessen, 2012 ). There is high variability in the salinity of produced waters from saline aquifers globally, with the values in the United States ranging from 50,000 to 300,000 ppm and desalination energy penalty corresponding to 4.4–35 kWh/t-CO2  (Arena et al., 2017 ; Bartholomew and Mauter, 2021 ). Because of the lack of exploration of these reservoirs in India, it is difficult to comment on the feasibility of treatment. Monitoring, reporting and verification is also essential for geologic storage projects to ensure that the CO2  does not interfere with potable water reservoirs. Thus far, the global experience for commercial have shown minimal risk of leakage of CO2  into groundwater or the atmosphere (Lackey et al., 2019 ; Onishi et al., 2019 ; Pashin et al., 2015 ).   6 CCS and industrial hubs As stated earlier, the case for developing CCS hubs has been widely discussed and helps in diversifying sources and sinks. This is in line with SDG-9 on ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’ which seeks to develop resilient infrastructure using environmentally-sound industrial processes (Carlsen and Bruggemann, 2022 ). Past work has discussed the potential to create clusters in eastern India adjoining the Damodar Valley basin which has a high density of point sources of CO2  (Garg et al., 2017 ). The Damodar Valley basin presents a unique advantage where multiple existing and upcoming steel plants are already present near the Raniganj and Jharia coalfields. These coalfields are also the most economically viable from the perspective of ECBMR projects (Vishal et al., 2021b ). We may also note here that the CO2  storage in these coalfields is likely underestimated because of two reasons. First, the coal inventory that was used in these exercises were conservative because they assumed a higher degree of coal use in the future. With the release of Coal India's underground vision plan, we may state that this increase will be moderate (Singh et al., 2021b , 2022 ). Second, many so-called ‘grey area’ and ‘concealed coalfields’ have been revealed over the course of oil and gas exploration. Some blocks of the Jharia and Raniganj coalfield have demonstrated very high gas adsorption capacity (Singh and Hajra, 2018 ). There is a substantial potential to couple ECBMR and low-carbon steel development. Past research has explored how CO2  captured from point sources can enhance CBM recovery in Raniganj and Jharia coalfields (Vishal et al., 2018 ). At the same time, CBM finds an important market in existing and upcoming steel plants. While several second-generation technologies are focused on new and upcoming steel plants, older plants have chosen to use CBM to reduce the carbon intensity of their steel. This is feasible because a UNDP-funded study has categorized CBM  as a low-end technology package for the Indian steel industry, where investment of Rs. 1.5–2 Crores (US$ 0.18–0.24 million) can result in fuel savings of 20–25% with a payback period of less than a year. Further, the installation/retrofitting time for such interventions is only 4–6 months, which avoids significant downtime for the plant (Van Der Akker and Das, 2016 ). Several developments have already taken place in this area. The report of the Standing Parliamentary Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas has indicated that a variety of steel plants constitute key markets for CBM, with pricing of $3.4–9.9/MMBTU (Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas, 2016 ), which has also been echoed by individual companies. For instance, Essar Oil has indicated that the steel companies are key buyers of methane gas for their facilities (Financial Express, 2021 ). Recently, Tata Steel has also initiated CBM injection at the rate of 10 kg/tonne of hot metal, which is anticipated to reduce their carbon intensity of steel by 33 kg-CO2 /t-steel (Tata Steel, 2022 ). Another company, Jai Balaji Industries, has indicated promising results with CBM combustion in their reheating furnace. Here, they have noted CO2  concentration of 4.2–4.8% (v/v), as compared to 11.4% (v/v) when combusting coal or blast furnace gas. Similar reductions are also noted in criteria air pollutants such as SO2  and particulate matter (Jai Balaji Industries Limited, 2022 ). These reductions are primarily driven by replacing coal with CBM, which has a major co-benefit of reducing import dependence of coking coal. CBM also has the advantage of being nearly pure methane with minimal sulphur impurities. North American steel producers have shown injection of 125 kg/thm, going beyond which can reduce flame temperatures (Jampani et al., 2019 ). Integrated development of CBM and the steel industry can facilitate more investments. An assured supply of CO2  from steel plants can reduce the cost of CO2  injection via economies-of-scale. At the same time, the steel industry can provide an assured market (Financial Express, 2021 ) for the incremental CBM produced from CO2  injection, thus de-risking such investments.  7 Conclusions and limitations This paper discusses some key risks associated with CCS development with a special focus on the downstream end of the CCS value chain, i.e., geologic storage. These risks can be financial, societal or co-ordinational. We provide recommendations on how aligning SDGs with geologic storage could have synergistic value for both energy transitions and societal goals. Notably, we recognized the linkages with SDGs 6, 8, 9 and 17, in context of these projects in Indian basins. We noted that we have not accounted for all major risks in a CCS project. For instance, we have not accounted for ‘wait and see’ or spillover risks talked about in the literature. From the downstream perspective, storage liability is also critical. In our view, this requires policy coordination at the governmental level. While these were outside the scope of this paper, future work suggesting a policy roadmap could look at some of these risks. We have also geared the SDGs from a developing country perspective. In a developed country perspective, CDR becomes more important. Particularly in the case of bioenergy with CCS, there may be synergies or tradeoffs with food security (McCollum et al., 2018a ), which has not been directly analyzed in this study.
