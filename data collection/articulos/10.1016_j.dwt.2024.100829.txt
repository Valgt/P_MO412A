                  This study explores the challenges and management strategies of water resources in 15 Middle Eastern countries, framed within the context of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6). This study used 123 water resource policies in Middle Eastern countries as data and employed a pre-trained large language model based on RoBERTa, trained on the SNLI and MNLI datasets, to perform text classification tasks. In combination with the TF-IDF algorithm for keyword extraction, this approach is used to systematically evaluate and compare the water resource policies of these countries. The results reveal that the region faces significant water stress, exacerbated by high population growth, climate variability, and political instability. While countries like Kuwait and the UAE utilize advanced desalination technologies to mitigate water scarcity, policy gaps in sanitation and transboundary cooperation persist. Jordan's innovative partnerships for water resource management highlight the potential of collaborative frameworks to enhance regional water security. The findings suggest that comprehensive water management strategies, including technological innovation and public-private partnerships, are essential for addressing the region's pressing water challenges. This research contributes to understanding the complexities of water governance in arid regions and offers practical implications for policymakers aiming to achieve sustainable water resource management.

This study explores the challenges and management strategies of water resources in 15 Middle Eastern countries, framed within the context of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6). This study used 123 water resource policies in Middle Eastern countries as data and employed a pre-trained large language model based on RoBERTa, trained on the SNLI and MNLI datasets, to perform text classification tasks. In combination with the TF-IDF algorithm for keyword extraction, this approach is used to systematically evaluate and compare the water resource policies of these countries. The results reveal that the region faces significant water stress, exacerbated by high population growth, climate variability, and political instability. While countries like Kuwait and the UAE utilize advanced desalination technologies to mitigate water scarcity, policy gaps in sanitation and transboundary cooperation persist. Jordan's innovative partnerships for water resource management highlight the potential of collaborative frameworks to enhance regional water security. The findings suggest that comprehensive water management strategies, including technological innovation and public-private partnerships, are essential for addressing the region's pressing water challenges. This research contributes to understanding the complexities of water governance in arid regions and offers practical implications for policymakers aiming to achieve sustainable water resource management.   Keywords Water resource management  Policy  Middle Eastern Countries  SDG 6   Data Availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction The Middle East, encompassing regions from the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean (such as Egypt) to the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, including countries like Israel, Turkey, Kuwait, Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, is one of the most arid and water-scarce regions globally. Most of these countries are situated in desert areas, severely lacking natural water resources, particularly freshwater [54] . As global warming intensifies, the Middle East's climate is projected to become increasingly dry and hot. Research indicates that reduced rainfall and more frequent extreme weather events due to climate change could significantly diminish the region's water supply, negatively affecting food production and the economy [47] . Many factors contribute to the water shortage problem, making water scarcity a major constraint on agricultural development. In addition to natural factors, social factors such as pollution and water wastage contribute to the Middle East's water scarcity. Industrial wastewater, agricultural fertilizers, and urban sewage discharge, coupled with inadequate sewage treatment facilities, result in severe water pollution [68,32] . Furthermore, the use and disposal of various biological and chemical pollutants threaten water safety, posing health risks to the population. According to United Nations projections, the Middle East's population will grow from the current 240 million to 630 million by 2050. This population surge increases water demand, exacerbating environmental pollution and degradation and leading to improper water resource management and allocation [37] . Politically, the Middle East experiences various forms and levels of political conflicts, with competition for these limited resources potentially becoming a national security issue, causing significant casualties and disrupting water infrastructure and resource balance [44] . Additionally, some religious and ideological beliefs in the region view water as an inexhaustible resource. Due to the worsening water scarcity in Middle Eastern countries, various measures have been implemented to address this issue, particularly the widespread adoption of desalination technology. Mahmoudi et al. [34]  suggest using wave energy, tidal energy, and other methods for seawater desalination to supplement freshwater resources. According to Sherif et al. [50] , The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates) have the highest global desalination capacity, with a net capacity of about 26.4 million cubic meters per day. Most desalination plants are installed in Saudi Arabia and the UAE [50] . Desalination has become a key strategy for alleviating water scarcity in the Middle East, with many countries highly dependent on desalination for domestic water supply. For instance, Oman, which faces prolonged droughts and significant flood natural disasters and overexploitation of groundwater aquifers, has adopted desalination technology to produce the additional water resources needed [2] . In Saudi Arabia, a royal decree in Jeddah established a policy focusing on desalination technology in 1928. Since the 1950s, the country has relied on desalinated water and has since become the world's leading producer of desalinated water, with a strategic plan to achieve 90 % seawater desalination for water production by 2030 [12] . In 2014, Iraq commissioned the Hatta desalination plant, which uses reverse osmosis (RO) membrane technology to process 200,000 square meters of water from the Arabian River daily, theoretically providing clean drinking water for up to 400,000 people [57] . In 2018, Israel's government approved a strategic plan to address drought from 2018 to 2030, with measures including increasing desalinated water supply, reducing demand, encouraging water reuse, and protecting Lake Kinneret. Israel's five desalination plants use advanced RO technology and improved process engineering, making them among the most efficient globally, supplying over 80 % of the country's urban water needs [38,53] . In addition to desalination technology, Middle Eastern countries are also promoting other water resource management plans, such as wastewater recycling, rainwater harvesting, and water reuse [14,25] . For example, Turkey proposed a "peace pipeline" to supply water to Eastern Mediterranean and Gulf countries [7] . According to Sherif et al. [50] , Kuwait was the first country in the Middle East to introduce sewage treatment plants in the 1950s. The quality has evolved from secondary to tertiary processes, and Kuwait uses advanced RO technology (Al-Sulaibiya plant) to treat water to drinking water quality. Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE have built numerous dams on major dry riverbeds to collect surface water, replenish groundwater, and protect against flash floods [11] . According to Sherif et al., [50] , Saudi Arabia has built 302 dams with a total storage capacity of 1.004 BCM, Oman has built 146 dams with a storage capacity of 0.088 BCM, and the UAE has 130 dams with a storage capacity of 0.06 BCM. Additionally, water recycling technology is being adopted by Middle Eastern countries. For example, Kuwait, a desert country heavily reliant on desalination for freshwater, is increasingly using recycled water to alleviate pressure on freshwater resources as its population grows. Wastewater reuse is becoming essential, with treated wastewater increasingly used for irrigation, landscaping, and industrial purposes [3] . In recent years, numerous researchers have focused on water resource management in Middle Eastern countries. For example, Saatsaz [42]  reviewed the history of Iran's water policies using bibliometric and policy research methods. Research on Bahrain's water resources management based on SDG6 and policy studies has found that economic dynamics significantly impact water resource management. Despite progress in enhancing water resource planning and management in Bahrain, implementing integrated water resources management remains challenging, in many countries of the Middle East, requiring further investment and sufficient financial resources [2] . For instance, Kuwait has a limited number of water management policies currently in place to deal with water problems [55] . Based on this, it is not difficult to see that different countries in the Middle East attach different importance to and implement water resources management policies. Additionally, Borgomeo et al. [9]  reviewed the status and prospects of sustainable water resource management in the Arab region in light of SDG6, indicating that the region has not achieved SDG6 as planned. Sustainable water management faces challenges requiring alignment with regional and international political and socio-economic trends. Apart from the common water management measures as before, nowadays, many studies which can try to solve the water problem in Middle Eastern countries have emerged on a chemical level. For example, [24]  developed a ligand-based composite adsorbent (ComA) for efficient Ytterbium (Yb(III)) adsorption and recovery from waste samples, [6]  had a ligand imprinted composite adsorbent has been developed for effective monitoring and removal of Ni(II) ions from contaminated water, the approach for monitoring and removing toxic cadmium from aqueous solvents by ligand-based surface composite adsorbents was explored by [48] , and [31]  displayed that the separation and recovery of the heavy lanthanide Thulium(III) is achieved using a specific ligand-based facial composite adsorbent. With the sharply changing global states, landscapes have been facing numerous challenges, such as poverty, hunger, education lack, gender equality, climate change and so on, which caused the rapid economic increase and societal revolutions [15,67] . Recognizing how these unfavorable issues affected human beings harmfully, in order to cope with these difficulties as soon as possible, the United Nations put forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 based on the comprehensive experience of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) [58] . The SDGs contain 17 main bodies, which can be generalized into 3 dimensions in society, economy and environment; they are aimed at solving the development challenges of these 3 dimensions thoroughly in a comprehensive approach and take the path of sustainable development from 2015 to 2030 [2] . The establishment of SDGs marks a new stage in the global sustainable development cause. Among the 17 core objectives of the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) paid great attention. The point of SDG6 is to ensure that clean drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are available and sustainably managed for all and comprises 8 targets to achieve by 2023 [9] . The specific objectives of SDG6 encompass ensuring universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for everyone (target 6.1), and providing adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all while eliminating open defecation, with special emphasis on the needs of women, girls, and vulnerable populations (target 6.2). Additionally, it aims to enhance water quality by reducing pollution (target 6.3), as well as to boost water-use efficiency across various sectors, and secure sustainable freshwater withdrawal and supply (target 6.4). It also promotes the implementation of integrated water resources management at all levels, including transboundary cooperation when necessary (target 6.5). Furthermore, SDG6 seeks to protect and restore water-related ecosystems (target 6.6), foster international cooperation, and build capacity in developing countries for water and sanitation programs. It also emphasizes supporting and strengthening local community participation in water and sanitation management (targets 6.6 a&b). Sadoff et al., [43,62] . The primary goal of SDG6 is to ensure universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for everyone by 2030 [58] . It requires all sectors to effectively improve water efficiency by 2030, ensure sustainable withdrawal and supply of fresh water, in order to cope with water shortages and significantly reduce the number of people suffering from water shortages [62] . So as to achieve these aims, the SDG6 calls for integrated water resources management at all levels, including appropriate cooperation across borders, supports ensuring the rational allocation and efficient use of water resources while promoting cooperation and exchanges among countries [58] . The SDG6 reflects the importance of clean water and sanitation. From the actual, clean water and sanitation are essential for human health, economic development and social progress definitely [2] . In the area of health, SDG6 can lead the global states to reduce water and sanitation-related diseases and improve children's health and quality of life. From an economic perspective, SDG6 can improve productivity, promote tourism and create jobs. Under the dual influence of health and economic development, society will inevitably progress accordingly. There is no doubt that the implementation of SDG6 is the foundation for human health, economic development and social progress. Until now, some experts and scholars have used the SDG6 to carry out research, such as the public water policy of Ukraine Municipal [37] , the comparison of water management between China and the United States [23] , the comparative analysis of the progress on water resources management in Mexico, Chile and Brazil [56] , and so on. By investigating and analyzing water resources policies and management in different regions through the lens of SDG6, these studies assessed the governance performance and challenges faced by various countries and explored multi-faceted approaches for the sustainable development of water resources [37] . Therefore, SDG6 has become the foundation and support of water resources research. It is particularly worth mentioning that, there are already many successful precedents of water management in line with SDG6. For instance, a hybrid image classification methodology was advanced to monitor agricultural expansion and identify its linkages to the SDG6, which was applied in the southwestern fringes of Wadi El-Natrun, Egypt [45] . Also, a study which aims at introducing a simulation-optimization (S-O) framework of the MODFLOW-USG model and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for groundwater sustainability in water-stressed regions was applied in the Wadi El-Natrun basin, Egypt [46] . In view of the impact of SDG6 on water resources and water management, SDG6 can provide effective value for the survey and improvement of water resources and policies in the Middle East. The insufficiency of water resources, whether caused by anthropogenic factors or natural occurrences, exacts a devastating toll on the health, dignity, and prosperity of billions of individuals across the landscapes [5] . As global efforts to achieve SDG6 targets intensify, the World Resources Institute (WRI) has listed 17 countries, home to one-quarter of the global population, facing an extremely high-water crisis. Out of these, 12 countries lie in the Middle East and North Africa regions (MENA) 18 [5] , which explicitly displays the challenges faced by the Middle East. Therefore, this study will analyze and compare the current water resources management policies in Middle Eastern countries, and figure out the best methods to ameliorate the challenges of water in various countries. Meanwhile, this study will focus on SDG6, combined with the current situation and problems of water resources in the Middle East, to evaluate the status quo of the water management policies in this region. Furthermore, the visualization generated using CiteSpace based on the search term "Middle East & Sustainable Development Goals 6" on the Web of Science core repository provides a detailed bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature ( Fig. 1 ). The central cluster of terms revolves around "climate change," closely linked to concepts such as "sustainable development goals," "adaptation," "consumption," and "developing countries," highlighting the interplay between climate change and sustainability within the region. Significant areas such as "health," "global health," and "care services" indicate substantial scholarly interest in the health implications of sustainable development and climate change in the Middle East. The presence of terms like "bibliometric analysis" and "Google Scholar" suggests a meta-analytical approach to understanding the body of literature. Emerging themes such as "circular economy," "energy efficiency," and "renewable energies" underscore the evolving discourse towards sustainable resource management and innovation. The conclusion drawn from this analysis emphasizes the critical need for integrated strategies in water resources management and policy. In summary, the Middle East faces significant water resource challenges due to its arid climate, limited natural freshwater resources, and the exacerbating effects of climate change, pollution, and rapid population growth. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that incorporates environmental, economic, and health dimensions to SDG6 in the Middle East. The focus on water resource management policies is particularly crucial, as they play a pivotal role in mitigating the impacts of climate change and ensuring sustainable development in the region. Notably, some countries in the Middle East still lack effective water conservation policies and regulations, especially integrated water management mechanisms, which pose significant obstacles to optimal water resource utilization. Additionally, although many scholars have highlighted the water resource issues in the Middle East, current research methodologies often lack quantitative analysis using big data models to evaluate policies. Moreover, existing studies are predominantly focused on individual countries rather than adopting a comprehensive regional perspective. This study uses text analysis methods to conduct an in-depth analysis of the water resources policies of Middle Eastern countries. The official and authoritative SDG6 indicators will be used to review the water resources policies of these countries, systematically evaluate the current water resources management policies of Middle Eastern countries, and analyze their effectiveness, advantages and shortcomings. Through in-depth analysis, the main problems and challenges in the water resources policies of various countries are identified, such as the difficulty of policy implementation, uneven distribution of water resources, and insufficient pollution control. The purpose is to reveal the progress made in the region in achieving SDG6, highlight the differences between countries, and explore prospects.  2 Methodology The policy is a tool for government water resource management. Thus, policy texts can reflect the comprehensive status and issues of local water resources. They can also demonstrate the tendencies and guidance in the government's process of managing water resources [26] . Content analysis is a common method in policy research, where text data is encoded using a specific theoretical framework (coding book) in order to convert the text data into quantifiable data, which is easier to analyze. Additionally, tasks like keyword extraction can be performed using natural language processing technologies such as word frequency statistics to summarize and analyze the text content [20] . Traditional natural language processing techniques (such as word2vec) typically process data at the word level, and while they can perform some basic semantic embeddings, their limitations still result in the loss of much helpful information [35] . Currently, with the development of deep learning technologies, large language models are being applied in social science research. Compared to traditional NLP techniques, these advanced technologies can understand semantics at the sentence level, allowing researchers to process and study sentences as the basic unit [13,4,62] . Pretrained large language models are those that have been trained on a large dataset beforehand and can be directly applied to zero-shot text classification tasks. They also allow for specifying label descriptions, which means they can be used for content analysis encoding steps similar to those used in traditional methods [69] . This study initially processed and cleaned the policy texts on water resources from 15 Middle Eastern countries using NLTK. Subsequently, it encoded these texts within the SDG6 framework and a pre-trained large language model. Finally, it uses the TF-IDF algorithm to extract keywords from the encoded data, enabling the extraction of content information and the analysis of policies across these countries. 2.1 Data collection Generally, government websites provide all public policy documents. However, due to website development and language limitations, this study has not been able to adequately access relevant data in some countries. However, the websites of some international organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), do collect policy documents related to water resources. Therefore, to conduct this study as comprehensively as possible, multiple resources, including the government’s official websites and the FAO, were utilized to collect data. This study collected 141 policies, shown in the Appendix. Of these, 18 could not be used for subsequent processing and were marked in  Table 1 . The remaining 123 policy texts will be used as valid data for the next steps of this research.  2.2 Data processing and cleaning This study is conducted in English to ensure the accuracy of the results. Therefore, parts of the Arabic text are translated into English using Google Translate. This study processed the English text using Python and NLTK [8] . It segmented the text in English periods and deleted data with fewer than five words to further enhance data validity. The processed results are shown in Table 1 .  2.3 Coding BERT is a large language model developed by Google in 2019 and is widely used in research and applications related to natural language processing [13,49] . As more researchers have joined the study of BERT, more BERT-based large language models have emerged, such as RoBERTa introduced by Facebook AI [33] . United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 specifically targets the sustainable development of water resources. The SDG6 website has 12 indicators to monitor this development globally, which can also serve as a coding book for this study (Table 3 in Appendix). This study employed the cross-encoder/nli-roberta-base model for zero-shot classification, using the 12 monitoring indicators of UN SDG6 as labels.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Middle east water resources in SDG6 framework Water is a vital resource necessary for the survival of human society and of ecosystems [16] . SDG6 indicators framework encompasses multiple aspects such as water resources management, sanitation facilities, water quality improvement and water-related disasters, which can comprehensively reflect the world's progress in clean water and sanitation facilities [59] . In order to achieve the targets of SDG6, Middle Eastern countries need to take action to ensure that everyone, especially vulnerable groups and people in poor areas, has access to clean and safe drinking water.  Fig. 2  shows the status of water resources in Middle Eastern countries as well as the regional and global average. As the figure presents, the regional average data are significantly higher than global data in Water stress and Cooperation, while it is lower than global data in Transboundary. Specifically, the water stress in Middle Eastern countries is apparently higher than the global average (Fig. 2 ), which shows that the water issues in the Middle East are serious and have high research values. So, the Middle East region urgently needs to solve water resource problems. Moreover, from a national perspective, Kuwait has few policies on water resources and surpasses other countries in many indicators, especially in water stress, which is almost eight times the regional average. Except for Kuwait, Iraq's and Syria's water resources policies are not so much either. However, Turkey’s water policies are various and abundant, while Yemen’s policies are older. The differences in data reflect the different basic backgrounds and policy management of water resources in different regions of the Middle East. In addition, in the collections and analysis of water resource indicators, the Middle East region as a whole displays an unevenness in great stress, sanitation, transboundary issues, and cooperation issues regarding water resources. It is particularly worth mentioning that much of the data on water resources in the Middle East is incomplete, especially in terms of sanitation, water quality, and cooperation. In consumption, it shows that water resources in the Middle East are unevenly distributed, and the overall water resource stress is far greater than the global average. It can also be negatively affected by hygiene and efficiency, making water resource management more challenging. In the Middle East, the issue of water scarcity has always been present [40] . According to the United Nations SDG6 data website, several Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar rank among the top 5 globally in terms of the water stress indicator. The average freshwater withdrawal in the Middle East accounts for 524 % of the available freshwater resources, with Kuwait and UAE exceeding 1000 %, significantly higher than the global average of 19 %. Differences in policy frameworks highlight the different political, social and geographical contexts of the region. This situation can be attributed to natural reasons and social origins. Widespread conflict and human rights violations, driven by unsustainable water and energy supplies and exacerbated by climate change, are leading to population displacement and environmental migration [52] . Most Arab countries experience high to very high water stress, with water withdrawals exceeding 40 % of their total renewable freshwater availability [9] . Highly variable and unpredictable rainfall exacerbates these high levels of water stress. In the Arab region, annual freshwater availability can fluctuate by over 75 % from the long-term average, compared to a global average of 25 % [9] . Simultaneously, as population and economic development grow, the demand for water resources continues to rise. This, coupled with the unreasonable allocation of water resources, has resulted in increasingly severe water shortages [15] . . The word cloud of the water stress-related policy text of the Middle Eastern countries, shown in Fig, reveals that these countries have taken action to encounter highly increased water stress. For instance, the “industrial, pollution, marine, wells” indicate that Middle Eastern governments are managing their water resources. "Projects, changes," etc., suggest that Middle Eastern governments are initiating projects aimed at specific issues to alter the water resource situation in the region. Specifically, "salinity, sea," etc., refer to desalination technologies, indicating that projects related to desalination are underway in the Middle East and are reflected in policy documents. Desalination technology exists in many countries, particularly in desert regions. It has been significantly effective in alleviating water stress in the Middle East, providing an important alternative to decreasing water stress for some water-scarce countries [10] . Additionally, the Middle East, holding about 39 % of the total worldwide desalination capacity, also brings substantial market and political influence [34] . Although several Middle Eastern countries, such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, are actively pursuing desalination projects, water resource management remains fragmented. This is often hindered by outdated infrastructure, political instability, and incomplete health and water quality datasets. This study suggests that Middle Eastern countries could benefit from adopting more advanced water purification technologies [41,61,6]  and addressing water resource pressures through policy interventions. As Fig. 2  shows, the Transboundary, which means cross-regional river basin cooperation [59] , is 14.375 and significantly lower than the global average. Two primary factors, geography and conflict, contribute to this outcome [65] . Firstly, the Middle East encompasses extensive desert regions that span multiple states, presenting significant challenges for the implementation of transboundary water management. Secondly, conflict in the areas through which rivers flow exacerbates these difficulties, further complicating effective water resource management in the region. Despite this, there are still some large-scale transboundary water resource management collaborations in the region. For example, the cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Jordan, including the desalination project, the draft environmental protection agreement, and the Global Water Resources Organization, which is the most efficient approach to alleviating water scarcity in both countries and promoting water management and conservation across the Arabian Peninsula [39] . Cooperation, defined as the global amount of water-related official development assistance [59] , is obviously much higher than the global average. Even though the emphasis on cooperation among countries in the Middle East is rarely reflected in policy, many countries, such as Jordan, still attach great importance to financial investment in water resources management [60] . Furthermore, some countries, like Syria and Iraq, use water resources as a weapon of war and invest a lot of funds in construction [17] .  3.2 Water resource management in the Middle East Area Although Middle Eastern countries are geographically close, their environmental conditions, especially water resources, vary significantly. Additionally, due to human factors such as wars, there are varied situations regarding water resource management among Middle Eastern countries.  Fig. 4  shows the number of sentences processed from water resource policy texts by country, highlighting noticeable differences in the length of water management policies among these countries. Due to ongoing wars in some Middle Eastern countries, there is no stable governmental foundation for policy formulation. For instance, Syrian policies on water resource management are quite brief, totalling only 308 sentences. Kuwait's policy texts are also relatively brief due to low precipitation and high evaporation rates. The country primarily relies on desalination and purchasing water from neighboring Iraq, which are more controllable and easier to manage. Additionally, Kuwait's abundant oil resources have led to a relative neglect of water resource management [1] . Yemen's policies are outdated due to tyranny and weak institutions, leading to chaotic water resource management and a lack of timely policy updates [64] . Turkey has the most extensive policy documentation among Middle Eastern countries. Located at the junction of Europe and Asia, it is a source of passage for many international rivers, such as the Euphrates and Tigris. Its geographically abundant water systems necessitate a focus on water resource management, resulting in numerous policies. Additionally, as a major agricultural nation, Turkey needs to develop water resource policies to support agricultural irrigation and water management.  Fig. 5  shows the statistics of policy sentences encoded for each country. Overall, the 15 Middle Eastern countries focus primarily on four key aspects of water resource management: drinking water, wastewater, water management, and transboundary. However, there is relatively less attention to sanitation, hygiene, water quality, efficiency, and cooperation. Drinking water is a critical dependency for human survival, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals emphasize the safe management of drinking water, a stance with which Middle Eastern countries are aligned. Wastewater treatment is a crucial part of the water cycle and one solution for ensuring a safe water supply. Through wastewater treatment, wastewater can be transformed into reusable water resources, reducing reliance on groundwater and surface water and lessening environmental pollution [51] . This is particularly important for the water-scarce Middle East. Moreover, according to UN data, Kuwait and Qatar have achieved 100 % household wastewater treatment. Transboundary cooperation is a significant topic in the Middle East. According to UN data in Fig. 2 , it is below the global average, but it receives considerable attention in policy documents. In some countries, sovereignty issues over water resources are prominent, and there are disputes over river ownership and utilization, such as differing views between Turkey and Arab countries regarding the use of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Meanwhile, some countries have attempted cross-border water trade and related cooperation projects. For example, Israel, Jordan, and the UAE reached an "energy for water" agreement, under which Israel increased the provision of desalinated seawater to Jordan [21] , while Jordan built photovoltaic power stations with UAE funding to supply renewable energy to Israel [22] . In this case, the UAE leveraged its economic and technological strength to use water as a medium to cooperate with other countries in water resource management and water-saving technologies. It not only alleviated water scarcity but also enhanced its political capital and influence in the Middle East. However, tense political relations among some countries in the region, along with cultural, historical, and religious differences, may affect transboundary cooperation. Sanitation and hygiene are health-related indicators. Although the regional average indicators are not significantly different from the global averages, there is relatively less emphasis on health-related policies compared to other areas. Firstly, most Middle Eastern countries focus on increasing water supply and ensuring basic water needs, relatively neglecting the management of public health regarding water resources. Secondly, some countries in the region are economically underdeveloped with insufficient infrastructure, including water treatment and sanitation facilities, limiting their public health efforts, which could lead to a higher risk of water-borne diseases, especially in underdeveloped areas and refugee camps [63] . In terms of efficiency, Middle Eastern countries have implemented a range of measures to improve water resource utilization, including promoting water-saving technologies, strengthening water resource management, and optimizing agricultural irrigation. For instance, Israel is one of the countries with the highest water use efficiency in the world, using technologies such as drip irrigation and desalination to enable sustainable agricultural development despite severe water shortages [36] . Data on participation and ecosystems also show that these aspects are less frequently mentioned in policy texts, indicating that water resource policies in the Middle East need further improvement. These areas typically require the collective efforts of multiple government departments and societal forces. For example, public and stakeholder participation may need to raise awareness of water resource conservation, and ecosystem-related regulations may involve negotiations and trade-offs related to industrial economic development, necessitating comprehensive and managed leadership by water resource management departments.  3.3 Policy effectiveness in representative countries 3.3.1 Jordan Jordan's water resource situation is relatively complex and severe, with the country mainly relying on groundwater and surface water. However, Jordan's water quality and cooperation indicators are relatively high according to SDG6 metrics. This success is due to Jordan's recent policy efforts in managing water resources, which have yielded significant achievements [60] . . In water quality, the word cloud of Jordan's legal provisions on water quality features terms such as “quality, monitoring, management, and indicators”, indicating that the Jordanian government has policies for regular water quality testing, which are crucial for water management [18] . For example, there is a policy stating that “regular groundwater quality monitoring should be implemented nationwide” [30] . Additionally, terms like “groundwater and pollution” indicate that the Jordanian government controls pollution of available water resources through policies, such as there is a policy stating “to improve the water quality of surface and groundwater by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, and minimizing the proportion of untreated wastewater” [27] . Moreover, terms like “salinity and saline” relate to desalination technology. Given Jordan's relatively low total water resources, which do not meet the country's total needs, Jordan heavily relies on external water sources, namely transboundary rivers and international trade [66] . The Jordan River is one of the transboundary rivers, serving as a primary water source for Jordan, Syria, Israel, and Palestine. Due to the multiple countries involved and the uneven distribution of water needs, the allocation of the Jordan River's water resources is a complex and sensitive issue, prompting the Jordanian government to seek new water sources. Consequently, Jordan has engaged in international cooperation on desalination with the UAE and Israel: Jordan built photovoltaic power stations with funding from the UAE to supply energy to Israel in exchange for stable quality desalinated seawater provided by Israel [19] . . According to the United Nations, the cooperation indicator in SDG6 refers to the amount of official development assistance payments related to water and sanitation hygiene. In Jordan's policies, terms such as "Bank, funding, fee" appear, indicating that Jordan has incorporated funding sources related to water resource management into its policies, and has also established some preferential policies, such as "Capital projects are funded from the central budget, through grants from international donors or through development bank loans to the Government." [28] . Additionally, the Jordanian government encourages non-governmental and civilian forces to invest in water-related facilities and projects. While seeking diversified funding channels, it also promotes multi-party participation in water resource management, such as "Private sector investments are also being encouraged." [28] , aligning with the United Nations' advocacy for SDG6. Moreover, terms like "planning, system, integration, united, sustainability" indicate that they have established plans or systems related to funding, and they also emphasize the integration and sustainability of water resource management, such as "Each important operating unit must have a clear purpose, incentives to perform effectively and efficiently, a sustainable source of funding, and effective regulatory support" [28] . Furthermore, the original legal texts also mention capacity-building projects for water-related sectors, which can receive low-cost loans, tax incentives, grants, and fee waivers. For example, "Developing the capacities of water sector institutions, through: … Such programs might include low-cost loans, tax incentives, grants and fee waivers." [29] .  3.3.2 Kuwait Unlike Jordan, Kuwait experiences extremely high water stress, making it the country with the greatest water resource pressure. According to the latest SDG indicators, Kuwait's water stress level has soared to 3851 %, with per capita water usage reaching 447 litres per day and an annual growth rate of 3.6 %. However, Kuwait excels in indicators related to drinking water and water quality. The metrics for drinking water, sanitation equipment and systems, and sanitation facility coverage are all excellent, exceeding the global average. Its practices in desalination, freshwater transport, and wastewater treatment meet the strictest global quality and safety standards, indicating effective policy management by the Kuwaiti government. . The policy text on water stress mentions many terms related to human activities, such as “economic development, population, agriculture, irrigation, and climate change”, which are all potential factors exacerbating water stress in Kuwait. Geographically, Kuwait is located on the Arabian Peninsula and has a typical tropical desert climate. The territory is mostly covered by deserts, and there are no rivers or lakes, which lack naturally formed freshwater resources. These geographical conditions are one of the fundamental reasons for water stress in Kuwait. Furthermore, factors such as rapid population growth, continuous economic development, and improving living standards in Kuwait lead to a constantly increasing demand for water, yet the domestic water resources are entirely insufficient to meet these growing needs. Despite these challenges, Kuwait still manages to maintain good water quality and drinking water supply. Although severely water-scarce, Kuwait's rich oil resources provide financial support for desalination, allowing the purchase of advanced desalination machinery from abroad. Currently, Kuwait has 11 desalination plants with a total production of 2.1 million cubic meters per year (455.5 million gallons per year) [1] . Kuwait also purchases water resources from neighboring countries with more abundant water supplies, such as Iraq and Turkey. This transnational water trade not only resolves Kuwait's water issues but also promotes regional economic cooperation and development. Additionally, in October 2021, Kuwait's Ministry of Electricity, Water and Renewable Energy (MEWRE) initiated a smart meter project as part of its digital transformation strategy. This project aims to install approximately 800,000 smart electricity and water meters within two to three years. The goal is to improve data monitoring of consumption patterns and leaks, thereby promoting sustainable resource use [1] . In terms of wastewater treatment, some wastewater treatment plants are being expanded and upgraded through public-private partnerships, improving treatment effectiveness and efficiency. As of 2022, about 75 % of wastewater was treated, of which 58 % was reusable (treatment efficiency was 77 %) [55] .   3.4 Policy instruments, strategies, best practices, and policy implications This study identifies several key policy instruments and strategies in water resource management across the Middle East, offering practical insights for policymakers dealing with similar challenges in other regions. Desalination Technology is a cornerstone for addressing water scarcity in countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Investing in desalination, as these countries have done, can provide a stable water supply for arid regions globally [1,19] . Policymakers in water-stressed areas should consider integrating desalination technology into their national strategies, promoting technological innovations to meet growing water demand. Transboundary Water Cooperation is critical for managing shared water resources. The successful collaboration between Jordan, Israel, and the UAE demonstrates the value of regional partnerships in mitigating water stress [19,60] . For regions with shared rivers, such as the Nile or Indus, similar diplomatic frameworks can help resolve conflicts and ensure sustainable water distribution. Water Quality Monitoring and Wastewater Treatment are essential for improving water availability. Jordan’s focus on groundwater monitoring and wastewater reuse shows how integrating these into national policies can enhance both water security and environmental sustainability [30] . Policymakers should prioritize the development of wastewater treatment infrastructure to reduce reliance on natural freshwater sources. Technological Innovation in water management, such as Kuwait’s use of smart water meters, can significantly improve efficiency and reduce waste [1] . Expanding the adoption of such technologies could lead to more sustainable water use, particularly in urban areas. Governments should support the deployment of smart technologies to optimize water resource allocation. Finally, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) are vital in overcoming the financial and technical challenges of large-scale water projects. Countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia have benefited from such collaborations (Patrick, 2013), and this approach should be further promoted to enhance infrastructure development and sustainable water management. In conclusion, this study provides practical policy implications for improving water resource management, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach that includes technology, cooperation, and private-sector involvement. These strategies can serve as models for other water-scarce regions, contributing to the global efforts to meet SDG6.   4 Conclusion In conclusion, this study underscores the urgent need for integrated, multifaceted approaches to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) in the Middle East. The findings highlight that water scarcity, exacerbated by population growth and political instability, requires comprehensive strategies that encompass technological innovation, regional cooperation, and robust policy frameworks. Notably, the successful application of desalination technologies and wastewater treatment in countries like Kuwait and Jordan illustrates new concepts that can be scaled and adapted across the region. To develop and implement these integrated strategies, we recommend a framework that includes: 1) enhancing transboundary water cooperation through diplomatic agreements that facilitate shared water resource management; 2) investing in advanced water technologies, such as smart meters and efficient irrigation systems, to optimize resource use; 3) fostering public-private partnerships to leverage financial and technical resources for large-scale projects; and 4) prioritizing capacity building in governance to ensure sustainable management practices are rooted in local contexts. Comparatively, our findings align with existing literature that emphasizes the critical role of innovation and collaboration in addressing water scarcity [9,18] . However, this study expands on previous work by providing a detailed analysis of policy gaps and proposing concrete recommendations tailored to the unique challenges of the Middle East. Ultimately, achieving SDG6 in the region will depend on the commitment of governments, stakeholders, and communities to embrace integrated water resource management strategies that are adaptable, sustainable, and inclusive.
