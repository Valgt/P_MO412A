                  Abstract
                  One of the smallest nations in Southeast Asia, the Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is politically stable and economically vibrant, with a GDP growth rate of 6% or higher for a decade or more. This rate of development has outpaced food and agricultural policy, which remains focused on output-driven, productionist targets focused on expanded production of commodity crops, notably rice.
                  Taking as its point of departure the key policy documents in agriculture and nutrition sectors over the past decade, this chapter provides a synopsis of policy guidance across these sectors at the national level. It illustrates conflicting currents in the policy mix over the past decade, as the Lao government seeks to reconcile the agriculture sector's role in supporting economic growth, reduce levels of chronic malnutrition, and service the international development agenda.
                  The advent of the Agenda 2030 era, and the alacrity with which the Lao PDR government has endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals mask the extent to which adherence to those international commitments have been used as the basis to maintain a business-as-usual approach to food security, reinforcing policy trajectories which are entrenched in Lao policy. In this regard, the SDGs do not provide new impetus or momentum, but rather provide useful political cover, supporting the trend towards policy as “governance by indicators” long favored by the Lao Peoples Democratic Party government.

Keywords Lao PDR  Sustainable development goals  SDG2  Food security  Nutrition  Agenda 2030    1 Introduction Lao PDR is the only landlocked nation in Southeast Asia, with a surface area of 237,000 km2  and a population of 6.8 million people, giving it the lowest population density in the region. It is one of the poorest nations in Southeast Asia, ranked 139th in the world according to the UN's Human Development Index (UNDP 2018 ). Since 1992, the proportion of the population living in poverty had declined from 46% in 1992 to 23% in 2012, and life expectancy has risen to 68 years (World Bank, 2015b ). This low-income status is offset by rapid rates of growth. Between 2010 and 2015, Lao PDR maintained growth rates of 7.5% or higher, building on extensive investments in infrastructure, extractive industries and the energy sector (especially hydroelectric power generation) (World Bank, 2015a ). FDI, led by PR China, Vietnam and Thailand, exceeded 1.16 billion USD in 2011 (Phommahaxay, 2013 ), with Lao PDR joining the WTO in 2013.a  a Challenges to inward investment remain extensive. In 2017 Forbes magazine rated Lao PDR 140th of 153 countries surveyed in its Best Countries for Business list, with Lao PDR scoring at or near the bottom on trade freedom, technology, red tape, investor protection, corruption, and personal freedom (Forbes, 2017 ).   Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) topped 700 million USD per annum in 2012, but has declined as a percentage of GDP to under 10% (GoL and UN, 2013 , p. 168). > 40% of ODA is spent in the health and rural development/agriculture sectors, and some 24% was oriented towards attainment of MDG 1 (Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger) (GoL and UN, 2013 , p. 169). Despite the generally positive trend described by these indicators, in an economically vibrant part of the world, Lao PDR lags behind its more powerful, larger neighbors, and remains one of poorest nations in Southeast Asia. It is, as a result, often described as being at a “crossroads.”b  b Citations of this crossroads are evoked by the most respected observers of the country (Evans, 2002 ; Stuart-Fox, 2011 ), in journal articles (Linter, 2008 ), by advocacy groups (Delforge, 2001 ) and in books of contemporary political analysis, (Pholsena and Banomyong, 2006 ). The United Nations' Country Analysis Report (2012)  has as its opening statement, “This Country Analysis report argues that the country is at a cross-road” [sic].   Implicit in this metaphor is the potentiality and the many options available to the nation. Lao PDR is politically stable, lightly populated, culturally fecund, abundant in natural resources, with a growth rate of 6% or higher for a decade or more. Peacefully situated in a well-integrated, economically expanding region, Lao PDR is generally free of external entanglements, with good working relations with all of its neighbors and global powers. Although many of its people lead lives of very limited means and considerable hardship, even at the height of the Indochina war, Laos never experienced levels of poverty and human suffering of the scope or profundity found in south Asia or sub-Saharan Africa (Rigg, 2005 ). As a consequence of this happy combination of factors, the policy options available to the government and nation are virtually limitless. This chapter explores how food security policy has evolved in Lao PDR, with particular attention on the past decade (from 2010), covering the final five years of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), leading into the Agenda 2030 era (from 2015).  2 Food security policy in Lao PDR from independence to 2000 In their review of land policy in Lao PDR since independence, Lestrelin et al. (2012)  identify three macro level drivers in policymaking: from independence in 1975 through the mid-1990s, national integration—that is, creating the Lao state—was the core commitment of policy efforts, characterized by government decentralization and resettlement policy, and expanding central control over peripheral regions. From the mid-1990s through mid-2000s, “scientific expertise” became as a key driver, in which the role of the development sector and its proffered expertise came to be a major factor in policy processes. Thereafter to the present day, with the country opening up and increasing engagement with regional and market forces, FDI and economic growth is seen to be a key component of sustainable development, and the development sector declined in influence and importance in the overall policymaking process. Trends in food security policy described below broadly follow this progression. In the latter half of the 1970s and 1980s, the focus for food security policy was domestic self-sufficiency in rice. With the declared goal of agricultural self-sufficiency, collectivization of peasants was introduced in the late 1970s, with the border with Thailand closed to agricultural trade between 1976 and 1980 in order to build up domestic food supplies (Sacklokham, 2014 ). Due to poor management and successive natural disasters, the collectivization policy was a comprehensive failure, convincing the LPRP leadership that modernization and private enterprise, rather than collectivization, was the basis for increasing production (Evans, 2002 , p.191–195). This paralleled the doi moi  reforms in Vietnam; in 1986, the New Economic Mechanism in Lao PDR set the stage for increased intra-regional trade of food and agricultural inputs (both formal and informal) as relations with Thailand (with which Lao PDR shares a long border) improved. The policy focus on rice was maintained through the early 2000s, with the 6th NSEDP (2005–2010) stating “food (rice) security is a pressing concern for the population in general, and for the poor in particular. Geographic and seasonal pockets of rice scarcity persist, and many communities still lack adequate coping mechanisms. Availability of adequate quantities of rice throughout the year is the key component of food security.” (NSEDP quoted in WFP, 2007 , parenthesis original.) A dedicated food security strategy was drafted in 2000, focusing on higher rice production for increased caloric intake, which made no mention of malnutrition, dietary diversity or nutrition knowledge (WFP, 2007 , p. 28). The policy was not well disseminated and was of little lasting significance. Lao PDR attained rice self-sufficiency at the national level in 2000, although interprovincial rates of year-round availability continue to vary. (Pholsena and Banomyong, 2006 , p. 95). The remit of food security policy was expanded to consider issues of malnutrition in the late 2000s, with the publication of the World Food Programme's (WFP) Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment, and the subsequent drafting of the first National Nutrition Strategy and Plan of Action (MoH, 2009 ; WFP, 2007 ). With Lao's progress in MDG1 nutrition targets reported as “Seriously off track” in 2010 (GoL and UN, 2013 ) the focus of food security policy was expanded with MAF acknowledging a role in nutrition by the time of the 2013 Risk and Vulnerability Survey (MAF and FAO, 2013 ). As an outcome-level focus of policy, the central emphasis then emerged as reducing the prevailing rate of chronic malnutrition. As this chapter will show, food security policy in Lao PDR orbits around the high levels of chronic malnutrition, and the impediment this poses to higher-order policy commitments, notably attainment of the SDGs and LDC graduation. This, together with a steadfast commitment to increased crop production, represent the twin poles around which food security policy is formulated. 2.1 Institutional architecture around food security in Lao PDR No single Lao Government ministry or department is uniquely responsible for food security. This is consistent with international development discourse, which posits food security as a multisectoral, multidimensional issue (Fukuda-Parr and Orr, 2013 , p. 8). With food security perceived as closely affiliated with poverty reduction and progress toward international development targets, food security is nested tightly within the Lao government's engagement with international development sector actors. At the sectoral level, food security policymaking in Lao PDR nominally includes multiple policy sectors simultaneously, including agriculture, environment, public health, nutrition, trade, and rural development,c  c ‘Rural development’ is a broadly interpreted term, which can refer to any and all development which takes place in rural areas. Specific topics contained within this rubric may include: land access and tenure, rural infrastructure, commercial agriculture, access to credit and financial services, public health and nutrition, education, water/sanitation, stallholder-based farming systems (including livestock and aquatic life), access to NTFPs for consumption and income generation, land tenure, conversation and biodiversity protection.   with an expansive set of institutions engaged in different aspects of policy. As key priority for international development support to Lao PDR, it involves donor governments, IFIs, UN specialized agencies, NGOs and CG-group research bodies. In practical terms, the policy agenda is dominated by three ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), the Ministry of Health (MoH), and the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). These first two ministries are most directly engaged in setting food security policy, with the third responsible for oversight of international development cooperation. With agriculture contributing between 19% GDP in 2016 (MPI, 2016 ) (and as much as 42% within the past decade (MAF, 2010 , p. 2)), the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has a central role in setting food security policy. The ministry coordinates international development assistance to the agricultural and forestry sector as a whole, with additional liaison at technical level between external partners and the departments of agriculture, forestry, fisheries and others depending on the nature of the programming. MAF also has oversight of the National Agriculture & Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI), and the National Agriculture & Forestry Extension Service (NAFES). With nutrition traditionally falling under the remit of public health, the Ministry of Health,  supported by the Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion and the National Institute of Public Health, have jurisdiction over national nutrition policy, including development of the National Nutrition Strategies. The MoH is engaged in sector-specific efforts in nutrition-relevant interventions such as deworming, micronutrients, infant and young child feeding (IYCF), maternal and child health. The Ministry of Health chairs the Sector Working Group on Health, co-chaired by the Embassy of Japan and the WHO. MoH also chairs the National Nutrition Forum introduced at the end of 2015 (MPI, 2016 ). Finally, as the government body responsible for coordinating international development cooperation, the Ministry of Planning and Investment develops the five-year National Socio-economic Development Plans, provides overall national level coordination of Lao PDR's engagement with donor governments, international institutions (including the UN and IFIs), and participation in processes such as the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals. It monitors all “foreign funding, total commitment amounts, funding plans and disbursements, location, MDG alignment, sector, type of assistance, individual contributions from other organizations, implementing agencies, and key information for each activity” (GoL and UN, 2013 , p. 165). The MPI convenes the annual Roundtable Meetings between the Lao government, donor governments and development partners. Finally, the MPI also oversees the function of the Lao Statistics Bureau and the National Economics Research Institute. As part of the Cabinet, these ministries report to the Prime Minster of Lao PDR. Other ministries with potential interest or mandates on issues related to food security include Natural Resource and the Environment, Industry and Commerce, and Labour and Social Welfare. However, engagement from these ministries on food security has been ad hoc and inconsistent to date.   3 Key policies for food security in Lao PDR Three key policy documents form the foundation of food security policy in Lao PDR. First, the five-year National Socio-economic Development Plans, which presents the macro-level policy agenda for both for the overall development of the nation and its development partners alike. The NSEDPs form the overall policy framework within which all sector-specific actions are taken. Second, the Agricultural Development Strategy is the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's contribution to the NSEDP, outlining the agricultural sector's contribution to both economic growth and national development—food security is positioned as a component of both of these objectives. Third, the National Nutrition Strategy sets out the strategies to reduce malnutrition, with the framework of the NSEDP. In sum, the NSEDP sets out the overall development trajectory of the country and sets system-level objectives, and the sectoral plans for agriculture and nutrition then provide the sector-specific actions and overall policy directions to be pursued in service of the macro-level NSEDP goals. This chapter examines two sets of documents for the most recent NSEDP periods, 2010–2015, and 2016–2020, identifying how food security and nutrition are presented as policy issues, and what strategies are identified to address them. 3.1 The seventh national socio-economic development plan (2010–2015) The benchmark policy document for the government of Lao PDR for the period 2010–2015, the 7th NSEDP sets out to “transform the country into a modern and industrial society.” (MPI, 2011a , p. 11). Its goals include an annual GDP growth of 8%, graduating from Least Developed Country Status by 2020, attaining the MDGs by 2015. Four specific targets are presented under the NSEDP, including1. Ensure continuation of national economic growth with security, peace and stability, and ensure GDP growth rate of at least 8% annually and GDP per capita to be at least USD 1700.  2. Achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and adopt appropriate technology, skills and create favorable conditions for graduating the country from LDC by 2020.  3. Ensure the sustainability of development by emphasizing economic development with, cultural and social progress, preserving natural resources and protecting the environment.  4. Ensure political stability, peace and an orderly society (MPI, 2011a , p. 11).    In order to achieve this, a number of targets are set for in food security related sectors:– Agriculture should grow by 3% per annum and contribute 23% to overall GDP.  – Rice production should increase to 4 million tonnes per annum, across 1.04 million hectares, with a yield of 3.9 tonnes per hectare. Growth across various livestock sectors is estimated at 2–6%.  – Reduce underweight to 20% and stunting to 34% for children under five (MPI, 2011a , p. 14–15).    “Ensuring food security” is presented as a sectoral priority for agriculture (MPI, 2011a , p. 17), listed second after “industrialization and modernization priorities in areas that have favorable conditions.” As indicated above, specific targets are given for rice, commodities, livestock and forestry. In the section entitled Nutrition Development, the strategic direction is presented as “to ensure adequate nutrition and food security for the Lao people, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals” (MPI, 2011a , p. 24). Three measures are proposed to attain this:• To encourage scientific research for improving the capacity in the areas of drug and food safety.  • To attract investment in the nutrition development sector, for the implementation of planned activities.  • To increase the awareness of three hygienic principles (in eating, drinking water, and habitat) among the Lao people for practice in daily life (MPI, 2011a , p. 24).    Per the 7th NSEDP, national policy priorities are threefold: maintaining economic growth with peace and stability (at a proposed growth rate of 8% per annum), graduating from Least Developed Country status by 2020, and achieving the MDGs; for food security, “It is important to ensure adequate nutrition and food security for the Lao people, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals ” (MPI, 2011a , p. 24, emphasis added). Within that overall blueprint, food security (interpreted in the 7th NSEDP as increased agricultural production and  improved nutrition outcomes) is presented as: a component of economic growth, part and parcel of Lao PDR adhering to its international obligations, and as a contributing factor for transitioning from LDC status. The NSEDP presents a number of the basic organizing statements around which food security policy in Lao PDR are developed. In the section entitled “Overall Directions of the NSEDP,” seven directions are presented, including “support a shift of economic structure and labor structure toward an industrialized and modernized one” (MPI, 2011a , p. 13). With agriculture the mainstay of the economy (agricultural targets are listed first in the sections on macroeconomic targets, economic sector, and economic development targets (MPI, 2011a , p. 15, 17)), industrialization and modernization in agriculture (and natural resources management) is a baseline assumption from which the narrative of state modernization is constructed. The first indicator of national economic performance listed in the sub-section on economic indicators is rice production, listed above extractive industries, infrastructure development, and tourism. Rice yield targets are set at 4 million tonnes per annum, on productivity projections of 3.9 MT per hectare (MPI, 2011b , p. 14). Production targets for all crops are provided on a kgs/per capita/per annum ratio in sector specific targets for agriculture. Improved rates of chronic malnutrition is listed in sixth position in the sub-section on social indicators (MPI, 2011b , p. 15), with targets for underweight and stunting derived from the MDGs. All indicators are qualitative, expressed as percentages (for malnutrition data) or absolute numbers (for rice).  3.2 Strategy for agricultural development 2011–2020 Developed in 2010, the 2011–2020 Agricultural Development Strategy serves to orient the actions of both the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and development partners in the agricultural sector overall, taken to include commercial and smallholder crop production, livestock, fisheries and forestry. As well as a contributor to GDP growth, agriculture is presented as a means toward alleviating rural poverty, and that to date, agriculture's role therein has been “below its potential” (MAF, 2010 , p. 11). The Strategy foresees a significant shift in the role of the Ministry: as market-oriented commercial agriculture and private sector investment increases, the role of the ministry will transition from that of service-provider to regulatory agency, overseeing and facilitating the work of the private sector. The Agricultural Strategy recognizes the diversity of agricultural systems in place in Lao PDR, and proposes a dual goal, servicing both the for national development policy priority of economic growth and the needs of smallholder farmers. The Goal statements of the Strategy is presented as:• Gradual introduction and increased application of modernized lowland market-oriented agricultural production, adapted to climate change and focused on smallholder farmers  • Conservation of upland ecosystems, ensuring food security and improving the livelihoods of rural communities    In the ADS, food security is defined per the 1996 World Food Summit definition, with the following caveat added; “the key word is ‘access' which implies that merely increasing food production is an insufficient concept to achieve food security. Among others, additional measures of generating cash income (market integration of producers, off-farm income opportunities, etc.) are indispensable complimentary elements” (MAF, 2010 , p. v). High levels of chronic malnutrition, although not analyzed, are defined as “the biggest problem” (MAF, 2010 , p. 7), a phrase taken from the 2010–2015 National Nutrition Strategy and Plan of Action discussed below. Within these goals, the following specific goals to 2015 are proposed:Goal 1: The improvement of livelihood (through agriculture and livestock activities) has food security as its first priority. Goal 2: Increased and modernized production of agricultural commodities will lead to “pro-poor and green value chains,” targeting domestic, regional, and global markets, based on organizations of smallholder farmers and partnering investments with the private sector. Goal 3: Sustainable production patterns, including the stabilization of shifting cultivation and climate change adaptation measures, are adapted to the specific socio-economic and agro-ecological conditions in each region. (Adapted from MAF, 2010 , p. ix)   The 2011–2020 Agricultural Strategy illustrates three key aspects of food security policy in Lao PDR. First, it seeks to reconcile the need for national economic growth and the need to preserve the livelihoods of smallholders in spatial terms, suggesting that market-based agriculture is applicable in the lowlands and along the Mekong Valley, whereas more remote uplands should preserve biodiversity and cultural practice through more traditional modes of smallholder agriculture. It proposes that by 2020, lowland farmers will provide national food security: that is, enough rice, vegetables, fodder crops and oil seeds to meet national requirements. Upland farmers will seek to produce enough to meet “local” needs (MAF, 2010 , p. 42–3). This two-tiered policy orientation of commercialized lowland agriculture and more-subsistence oriented upland livelihoods is a recurrent feature of rural policy in Lao PDR (Lestrelin et al., 2012 ). Second, the Strategy acknowledges that finding a balance between modernization and tradition may be a challenge (MAF, 2010 , p. 37). This sets up a tension between traditional modes of smallholder agriculture and commercialized agriculture. Third, viewed in historical context, the 2011–2020 Strategy represents a recognition of the multifaceted role that agriculture plays in the country, with references to livelihoods, climate change, sustainability, globalization and biodiversity protection throughout its text, whereas the previous such policy had as its goals a straightforward series of quantitative production targets (MAF, 2010 , p. 29). As will be discussed below, the ADS 2011–2020 turned out to be something of a positive aberration, which was not repeated in the 2016–2020 iteration. Finally, the 2011–2020 Strategy presents a set of 13 drivers of change for agricultural development in Lao PDR which would not be out of place in developed world food policy discourse. Presented in the order provided in the Strategy document, these include (MAF, 2010 , p. 37–41):Unlabelled Table  • Intensive farming driven by FDI     • Globalization and Lao's accession to the WTO requiring adherence to global trade rules     • Global markets and potential growth for high-value, niche products     • Higher consumer demand for food safety     • Organic agriculture     • Fair Trade     • Geographic indicators, potentially useful for rice, coffee, and tea     • Comparative advantage in global markets on the basis of organic, biosafety, non-GMO and low carbon footprint     • Climate change, links to hydropower     • Climate change, adaptation needs across the sub-region     • Biodiversity under threat     • New international finance mechanisms (i.e., REDD, REDD +)     • Private-sector carbon markets          The 2011–2020 Agricultural Development Strategy attempts to balance modernization and consolidation of the agricultural sector (presented as a means towards poverty reduction), and the need to protect and strengthen smallholder rural households. The ADS does not posit these two threads as an “either/or” proposition, but rather as a “both”: food security policy can simultaneously be increasingly commercialized and market oriented and  responsive to smallholders. In this interpretation, the smallholder is not antithetical to increased modernization, but is rather repurposed in the service of state-led modernization: smallholders can continue to exist, but will need to modernize.Lowland agricultural production in the Mekong corridor will foremost [sic] provide sufficient rice and other staple crops (i.e., vegetables, fodder maize, pulses and oil crops) to maintain national food security. Lowland smallholder farmers also will raise sufficient livestock and fish to supply low-cost sources of protein to domestic markets. Lowland agricultural production will be responsible for providing both sufficient quantities to guarantee that the nutritional needs of the population are met. (MAF, 2010 , p. 42).   By contrast, upland farmers in more remote, biodiverse and less agriculturally productive (in terms of yield) will provide for more localized food security needs (MAF, 2010 , p. 43), through the production of fish and animal proteins, and high value cash crops. In order to reconcile the potential for divergence between the two goals, the ADS introduces geographic frames which serve to situate the policy in global, national and sub-national contexts. First, at the global and regional level, Lao PDR's engagement and integration with global political and economic systems is presented as a net-positive fait accompli.  It is then suggested that Lao PDR has a nascent global market advantage in what the ADS calls “the new agriculture,” including organics, free trade, and geographic indicators/PDO (Protected Domain of Origin) products. In both frames, smallholders are presented as central to the overall policy, and increased commercialization and market integration is presented as wholly consistent with the aims of both national and local food security. Within this delineation of national vs. local food security/self-sufficiency, no quantitative thresholds are identified; while a “continuous improvement of national rice self—sufficiency and local food security” is noted (MAF 2010 , p. 21), targets are not identified, nor are any other metric by which these targets will be measured, other than total rice production. As illustrated by the syntactically muddled phrasing of Goal 1 (“The improvement of livelihood (through agriculture and livestock activities) has food security as its first priority”) (MAF, 2010 , p. 47), food security is presented both as an instrumental objective, in order to alleviate poverty and protect livelihoods, and as an intrinsic goal in and of itself, as a “first priority,” and as a target for MDG1. Finally, the ADS acknowledges prevailing levels of chronic malnutrition as “the biggest problem,” with little to no progress over the past decade (MAF, 2010 , p. 22). More problematically, it attributes malnutrition to overall availability, stating “The most significant constraint to the availability of food is the low level of domestic production of food items resulting from low levels of productivity and high risks in the agricultural sector,” before stating that nutrition will be more fully treated in the National Nutrition Strategy. This goes to emphasize that whether the focus is on promoting smallholder traditional agricultural systems or full agricultural modernization and industrialization, the focus remains on increasing productivity, as measured by aggregate volume, yield, and quantity.  3.3 National nutrition strategy and plan of action 2010–2015 The National Nutrition Strategy and Plan of Action (NNS/PoA) is the first ever policy document developed by Lao PDR expressly to address acute and chronic malnutrition. As with the Agricultural Development Strategy, it is intended as a guide to all actions to be taken in the nutrition sector, and is developed in line with the broader 7th NSEDP framework. The NNS/PoA presents Lao PDR's commitment to addressing malnutrition in the context of international agreements to which Lao PDR is signatory (MoH, 2009 , p. 1). In this document, food security is presented in a form largely consistent with the 1996 WFS definition: “Food Security is achieved when adequate food (in term of quantity, quality, safety, socio-cultural acceptability) is available and accessible and satisfactorily used and utilized by all individuals in all regions, at all times to live a healthy and active life.” (MoH, 2009 , p. 36). The four principles underpinning the NNS include: defining a realistic but bold strategy, promoting good governance, achieving short term measurable impact (within 2–5 years) and sustainability, and maximizing impact and cost effectiveness (GoL and UN, 2013 , p. 51; MoH, 2009 , p. 13–14). The NNS identifies malnutrition as both a global and national crisis, epitomized in Lao PDR by rates of underweight and stunting estimated at 23 and 37%.d  d Due to different methods of computation applied to the national datasets, rates of chronic malnutrition for this period are variously cited at between 37% and 44%, and underweight at either 23% or 27%. In the NNS, data is not consistently used, with a figure of 37% undernourished cited in the introduction, and 40% stunted later in the document. This variance in the data continues through the 2016 documents, with the NSEDP and NNS citing disparate numbers (27% vs. 44%) for chronic malnutrition.   These data are then followed by supporting indicators indicating poor performance on breastfeeding, vitamin A deficiency, anemia, iron deficiency, parasitic infection rates (MoH, 2009 , p. 5). Reinforcing the sense of crisis, all of these indicators are presented as “problems requiring urgent action.” As with the ADS, addressing malnutrition is identified as a priority in order to “achieve the priority development goals of the MDGs.” (MoH, 2009 , p. iv). In other words, just as in the ADS, Lao PDR is resolved to address malnutrition because  of its international commitments. This explicit imposition of external commitment into national context is reflected throughout the NNS document. For instance, an analysis of the immediate, underlying and basic causes of malnutrition is drawn from the UNICEF causes of malnutrition framework (understood in this document to apply at the individual, household and national level respectively). Chronic malnutrition is described as a “crisis” and “the biggest problem in Lao PDR” (MoH, 2009 , p. 2, 4). Populations with the highest rate of malnutrition are described as.Poor households, households with unskilled laborers or whose household heads have no or low education, households that live in villages with little or no access to key infrastructure and services like access to sanitation and safe water facilities. Specific ethnic groups were found to be at a higher risk of undernutrition like the Sino-Tibetan and Hmong-Mien and Austro-Asiatic ethnic groups. These ethnic groups can be found living mostly in the Northern Central and Southern Highlands of the country. (MoH, 2009 , p. 6)   Food insecurity and malnutrition is therefore presented as being interrelated with poverty, ethnicity, low education levels, poor sanitation and high altitude. In terms of the “basic” causes of chronic malnutrition—per the NNS' own formulation, applicable at the national level—the issue is presented as fundamentally a result of poor planning and policy processes:Food security and nutrition objectives have not yet been incorporated in national development policies and plans which consequently resulted in limited investments made for nutrition and related actions. Knowledge/information systems, targeted initiatives and programmes supported by consistent, coherent and effective actions at all levels of government are required to ensure a sustainable, effectively integrated and holistic nutrition strategy and action plan. (MoH, 2009 , p. 10)   In its review of the overall policy context around MDG1, the Government of Lao PDR and the UN in 2013 described the challenges and opportunities which were affecting progress toward the target as follows:– Unclear accountabilities and the limited awareness of nutrition outside of the health sector translate into low levels of investment in appropriate interventions for nutrition.  – Malnutrition is a cross-sectoral issue that involves many non-health factors.  – Access to the right types of food is required, not just food availability.  – Budget allocations to the health sector need to be increased (GoL and UN, 2013 , p. 50).    Progress can therefore be achieved by more concerted, better coordinated collaborative efforts led by government (MoH, 2009 , p. 26–27). This is a theme that reaches its apogee in the NNS 2020, the successor to this policy. Two key elements of food security policy emerge here. First, the “proof” of a food security problem is presented as: the high, stagnant and persistent rates of chronic malnutrition. Second, challenges in addressing food security and malnutrition are presented as a question of governance and coordination, such that addressing how the issue is “coordinated” will address the issue itself. In addition to hewing to the UNICEF conceptual framework, the NNS adopts the language and assumptions of global nutrition discourse. Large sections of the document are given over to boilerplate statements which are both globally applicable and wholly lacking any local specifics. By way of example, the section on family planning (Strategic Objective 5, Action Area b) is quoted in full below:SO5: Improve Mother and Child Care Practices b) Promote Family Planning Practices/Responsible Parenthood The promotion of family planning practices will address the interlinked areas of populations, the economy, health and nutrition. It recognizes that previous emphasis on improved family planning services have contributed to a decline in mortality rates. Giving women access to contraception and family planning resources will help to boost economic growth and hence increased means to access food. It will also reduce high birth rates and thus contribute to the reduction of endemic poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition, poor education, and high numbers of maternal and infant deaths. (MoH, 2009 , p. 23)   While there is nothing particularly contentious in the statement above, it also generic, and in no way tailored to the Lao PDR context; such a statement would be true anywhere in the world. Overall, the scope of the National Nutrition Plan of Action encompasses 99 interventions, with a pricetag of 600 million USD over 5 years, involving the active engagement of 20 government bodies (including 17 ministries) and 20 development partners, including donors, UN agencies, IFIs, and NGOs. With this scope in mind, it is perhaps understandable that a great deal of the NNS and NPAN is given over to governance and coordination. In this context, better governance becomes  the solution to malnutrition. Under Strategic Objective 7, Action Area “a” is presented as:Enhancing the existing structures and practices of coordination, represent a critical step in the government's on-going efforts to address malnutrition and food insecurity throughout the country. Here, coordination is defined as the systematic sharing of information and joint planning of interventions by partner organizations in such a way that duplication is avoided and cost-savings are realized. […] As such, coordination is the first step towards organized cooperation and joint-implementation of actions. (MoH, 2009 , p. 26).   Coordination within and between government and development partners is thus an intrinsic outcome in and of itself. Moreover, it is so complex that coordination itself  needs to be coordinated (MoH, 2009 , p. 27). This level of reflexivity is replicated in the National Plan of Action, which stresses on its first page that despite its title, it is not  a plan, but is rather “a plan for a plan.” (MoH, 2009 , p. 1). It follows, therefore, that addressing food and nutrition security is a process of constant refinement and upgrading of the planning and coordination process itself, from which positive outcomes can then emerge.   4 2016–2020: A new five-year cycle 4.1 The 8th national socio-economic development plan 2016–2020 Launched in June 2016, the 8th NSEDP seeks to set Lao PDR on the path toward continued development in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, and with the express intention of supporting graduation from LDC status by 2020 (MPI, 2016 , p. 89). In 2016, Lao PDR enthusiastically embraced the Agenda 2030 in toto, adopting all 17 global goals and adding an 18th to do with Unexploded Ordinance.e  e Somewhat unexpectedly, Lao PDR adopted SDG 14 (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development), despite the fact that it is landlocked state with no access to the sea. A UN report in November 2015 stated, “SDG 14 focuses on protection and sustainable management of marine resources and is not applicable  to Lao PDR, a land-locked country” (UN, 2015 —emphasis added). Lao PDR adopted SDG 14 anyway, on the basis that the Mekong and its tributary systems represented as important a factor for the country as the health of the oceans did for coastal states. As the June 2018 Voluntary National Review stated, “Lao PDR considers that three targets under SDG 14 (14.4, 14.6, and 14.b) are relevant to freshwater resources. Lao PDR, therefore, has replaced the ‘oceans, seas and marine resources’ in the original formulation of SDG 14 with ‘aquatic resources,’ which shall be taken to mean resources relating to lakes, rivers, and streams” (GoL, 2018 ).   The overall Objective of the 8th NSEDP is presented as:[To] ensure political stability, peace and order in the society; the poverty of the people is reduced significantly in all areas; the country is developed out of LDC status by 2020 through continuous, inclusive and sustainable growth; there is effective management and efficient utilization of natural resources; development is enhanced through the national potential and advantages; Lao PDR participates in regional and international integration with ownership. (MPI, 2016 , p. 87, all punctuation original)   In the service of this objective, there are three outcomes, with food security included under Outcome 1 (under the aegis of agriculture's contribution to GDP), and Outcome 2 on human development.• Outcome 1: Sustained, inclusive economic growth with economic vulnerability (EVI) reduced to levels required for growth support.  • Outcome 2: Human resources are developed and the capacities of the public and private sectors is upgraded; poverty in all ethnic groups is reduced, all ethnic groups and both genders have access to quality education and health services; the unique culture of the nation is protected and consolidated; political stability, social peace and order, justice and transparency are maintained.  • Outcome 3: Natural resources and the environment are effectively protected and utilized according to green-growth and sustainable principles; there is readiness to cope with natural disasters and the effects of climate change and for reconstruction following natural disasters (MPI, 2016 , p. 89).    As a result of the focus on LDC graduation, food security and nutrition related indicators are bundled within the LDC's parameters of Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) and Human Assets Index (HAI) (UN, 2018b ): in other words, the benchmarks for performance within the NSEDP are derived from the indicators by which Lao PDR's progress towards graduation will be measured: this includes nutrition indictors such as undernourishment for the HAI, and a reduced share of Agriculture and Forestry within the overall GDP (leading therefore to lower EVI) (MPI, 2016 , p. 90–91). In this regard, food security and nutrition are not intrinsically valuable as outputs, but only insofar as they promote a higher-level policy ambitions; that is, graduating from LDC status. Within Outcome 1, quantified food targets to ensure national supply are set. Key data presented in the section on food supply include:– A Kcal target of 2600–2700 per capita.  – Domestic production of 2.5 million tonnes of rice, of which 2.1 million tonnes is for domestic consumption.  – Domestic production of 258,000 tonnes of meat and eggs, and 229,500 tonnes of fish and aquatic animals  – Domestic production of Potatoes and other starches of 304,000 tonnes, 800,000 tonnes of fruit, and 1.5 million tonnes of vegetables (adapted from MPI, 2016 , p. 99).    Two striking detail emerge from presenting data this way. First, these targets are premised on the assumption that 100% of gross requirements will be met through domestic production, and in turn, how much food security is still understood to be analogous to gross availability. Second, the targets set in metric tonnages bear little relation to the Kcal requirements of the population.f  f Taking the rice production figures alone, against current population figures of 6.85 million people, 2.1 million tonnes would be equivalent to 830 g of rice per person per day, with a Kcal value of 3, 154 per person per day. In other words, before even taking proteins and fats into account, and without adjusting for the reduced Kcal intake of elderly or very young populations (which comprise > 30% of the total population of the country), supply of rice alone is already providing > 500 Kcal excess  calories per capita. Although grossly oversimplified, these basic calculations suggest that the targets presented in the NSEDP are not derived from global nutritional guidelines.   Food security is then given fuller consideration under Outcome 2, Output 2: Food Security Ensured and Malnutrition Reduced. Within the overall Direction ofEnsuring food security with adequate nutrition and safety for consumers' health is a key development task which will require upgrading production performance, improving physical and mental health (especially for disadvantaged youth and children, and women of reproductive age) in order to contribute to solving poverty, reducing malnutrition and improving their livelihoods in a sustainable and inclusive manner. (MPI, 2016 , p. 127)  Seven targets are then set, all of which are within the agricultural sector, other than the reiteration that the Kcal target of 2600–2700 per capita is to be maintained. At this point in the NSEDP, there is no mention of any nutrition issues, indicators or targets.g  g Confoundingly, stunting, underweight, wasting and food poverty (i.e., households or individuals unable to meet their basic 2100 Kcal daily needs) are all then included in Annex I, as indicators for Outcome 2, Output 2 (MPI, 2016 , p. 178). It is tempting to speculate that this will have been due to the time lag between the drafting of the narrative and the development of the NSEDP Monitoring and Evaluation Framework, which was contingent on the SDG localization process in Lao PDR, which started after the NSEDP was already in draft.   Discarding the household vs. national designation of geographic crop production proposed in the 2011–2020 ADS, the NSEDP recommends crop-based land allocation: rice in valley floors and plains, livestocking and fruit trees in higher elevations (MPI, 2016 , p. 128).  4.2 National nutrition strategy to 2025 and plan of action 2016–2020 The successor document to the 2010–2015 NNS/PoA, the National Nutrition Strategy to 2025 and Nation Plan of Action on Nutrition (NNS/NPAN 2025) begins by acknowledging the shortcomings of its predecessor, suggesting that this was due to: an absence of coordination mechanisms, limited budgets, and “declining direct assistance for nutrition interventions” (MoH, 2015 , p. viii). Where the 2010–2015 NNS/PoA described malnutrition as a crisis, the NNS/NPAN 2025 suggests that progress has not been made due to a failure of leadership and coordination, which it seeks to resolve. In order to address this, the NNS 2025 announces the creation of the National Nutrition Committee, charged with oversight of the strategy (MoH, 2015 , p. 1). The scope of work is presented in 29 interventions, of which 22 are first priority, with an overall price tag to 2020 of 411 million USD. The NNS 2025 explicitly links nutrition and food security, using of the acronym NFS (nutrition and food security, which it does not formally define) throughout. As with the 2010–2015 NNS/PoA, the NNS 2025 is replete with references to global nutrition discourse: it highlights the importance of the first 1000 days, the SUN movement, the SDGs and the MDGs. Within the overall goal of reducing malnutrition rates “and thus contribute to the preservation and development of the nation so that it is elevated from its status as a least developed country (LDC) in 2020 and attains its strategic targets in 2025” (MoH, 2015 , p. 8), the 22 first priority interventions of the NNS are divided across three policy sectors, with 10 interventions (that is, programming priorities) in the health sector, four in agriculture, four in education and an further four in a category defined as “other” (MoH, 2015 , p. 12–13). As with the NESDP, reducing malnutrition is situated as a necessary step towards supporting progress on the LDCs, and in accordance with Lao PDR's international commitments: the drivers, in other words, are externally imposed on Lao PDR. In defining malnutrition in Lao PDR, the NNS 2025 maintains that malnutrition is a function of poverty, rurality and poor education:Factors concerning malnutrition mostly relate to household poverty, mothers with low education levels, and ethnic groups residing in remote areas with no access to clean water, sanitation, environment and health services. Malnutrition is also associated with beliefs, customs, and traditions which can lead to incorrect nutritional practices. (MoH, 2015 , p. 3)  Just as the 2010–2015 NNS/PoA did, this frames malnutrition as an issue primarily for rural, poorly educated poor households. In further unpacking the nutritional context of Lao PDR, the NNS 2025 posits that “the major problem is the lack of diversity in the nutritional values consumed. Food consumption in Laos is mostly based on rice. On average, 73% of caloric intake comes from carbohydrates, 12% from meat and 15% from fats.” (MoH, 2015 , p. 5). This creates something of a contradiction with the NSEDP's insistence that food security will be ensured by increasing rice production (and thus, presumably, consumption). While the 18 sector-specific interventions cleave to a reasonably predicable slate of options, with nutrition interventions drawn from the Lancet's 13 priority interventions for maternal and child health (The Lancet, 2008 ), and nutrition—sensitive agriculture and school feeding given their due, what is of perhaps greater interest is the “Other” interventions. The four additional interventions spread over Strategic Objectives 8, 9 and 11 are given over to the coordination, management and monitoring of the NNS itself. Indeed, while for the most part the NNS 2025 represents a continuation in form and content from the previous strategy, where it differs is that the cost of managing the NNS itself is itemized, coming in at 32.4 million USD over 5 years. There is no equivalent to this in the 2010–2015 NNS/PoA. This opens up the possibility, not taken up in other policy documents, that keeping up with the Agenda 2030 is not a zero-cost option, suggesting that maintaining and upgrading the suite of indicators embodied in that Agenda 2030 and supporting progress thereon bears costs in and of itself. This builds upon the suggestion drawn from the 2010–2105 NNS/PoA that coordination and governance of nutrition is as important as direct action itself.  4.3 Agriculture development strategy to 2025 and vision to the year 2030 Unlike the 8th NSEDP or the NNS/NPAN 2025, the ADS 2025 appears comes into effect while the timeframe of its predecessor policy is still underway—the previous plan had taken as its time frame 2011–2020, so from a strictly chronological point of view, there was little need for a new ADS in 2015. In so doing, however, the government of Lao PDR brought the ADS into synchrony with both the NSEDP cycle and the SDGs themselves. Its promulgation effectively supplants its predecessor as the core policy document for the agriculture sector. The Vision to the Year 2030 is presented as:Ensuring food security, producing comparative and competitive potential agricultural commodities, developing clean, safe and sustainable agriculture and shift gradually to the modernization of a resilient and productive agriculture economy, linking with rural development contributing to the national economic basis. (MAF, 2015 , p. 16)  Unlike the deep continuity of structure, tone and content between the NNS/PoA 2015 and the NNS/NPAN 2025, the ADS 2025 discards the analysis, drivers of change and nested logic of household and national food security of the ADS 2011–2020, in favor of a reversion to the productionism of the 2001–2010 strategy. The ADS 2025 is firmly focused on increasing production, and sets precise targets across a range of > 15 food and cash crops, as well as multiple livestock categories, with incrementally increasing targets per crop and animal to be met by 2020 and 2025. The quantitative targets cited are of a piece with those presented in the 8th NSEDP, and as a consequence are not repeated here. The basis for increases in production are presented as necessary because the agriculture sector is again characterized as having “not reached its full development potential,” and as necessary for “ensuring food security” despite the fact that Lao PDR is, described at national level as, “self-sufficient in food” and has been so since 2000 (MAF, 2015 , p. 1). These increases in production are not presented as a function of population growth, increasing income or changing diets but rather is framed as demonstrative of Lao PDR's commitment to global  food security: “To meet the needs of growing population, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has assessed the need of food and urged countries around the world to increase the quantity of food production up to 60% from the current quantity.”h  h Although not otherwise attributed or qualified, it is possible that this statement is derived from the FAO's How to Feed the World in 2050  document (FAO, 2009 ), although that document makes reference to a 70% increase in gross production, not 60%.   (MAF, 2015 , p. 13). In keeping with the NNS 2025, the ADS 2025 tabulates the anticipated costs to realizing the strategy: the total estimated costs for 2016–2020 is presented as 9.9 billion USD, of which 8.125 billion will be derived from Foreign Direct Investment, 1.625 billion USD from Overseas Development Assistance, and 150 million USD from government budgets (MAF, 2015 , p. 26). These levels of investment appear to be predicated on a sequence of assumptions whereby government sets the agricultural plan at the provincial and agroecological zone level, for which external partners (both private and development sector) will then provide the funding and implement the government's vision. There is otherwise scant mention of partnerships across the ADS, except in generic, nonspecific terms: this reinforces the autarkic, domestically self-sufficient perspective of this strategy. Within the purview of food security, what is most striking about the ADS 2025 is the reversion of MAF's interest in food security to specifically focus only on food production (or, in food security parlance, availability), leaving access, utilization and stability of food security to be addressed by other parties. While this is consistent with MAF's historical perspective on food security (Armstrong, 2018 ), food security had more recently been subject to a more comprehensive interpretations, as suggested by the inclusion of nutrition-sensitive agriculture in the NNS 2025, and the Risk and Vulnerability Survey (MAF and FAO, 2013 ) which acknowledged that food security in Lao PDR was as much a function of access and utilization as it was of availability.   5 Out with the MDGs, in with the SDGs In late 2015, it was acknowledged that Lao PDR did not attain MDG 1, having missed the targets for Target 1C (Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger), based on Indicators 1.8 and 1.9 (prevalence of underweight children under-5 years of age (indicator 1.8, measured by weight for age) and prevalence of stunting (that is, chronic malnutrition) as indicator 1.9, measured by height-for-age.) This was a political embarrassment, a “loss of face” which the government would not repeat in the SDG era. The Government of Lao PDR would embrace the SDGs as the blueprint for all government policy to follow. Concurrently, at the Tenth Party Congress in 2015, the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining 7.5% annual GDP growth, in the service of graduating from LDC status by 2020 (Vientiane Times, 2016 ). The 2018 SDG Voluntary National Review's (VNR) Opening Statement (GoL, 2018 ), signed by Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith, declared the government to be “strongly committed” to the SDGs, stating that the SDGs are “embedded” in the 8th NSEDP. In addition, some 60% of the SDG indicators are aligned to the NSEDP, with additional plans in place to provide full congruence between the 168 indicators of the SDGs and the NSEDP itself. Furthermore, the 2030 Agenda is wholly consistent with the government's previous policy goal of LDC graduation. Spread over a color three-page diagram, the VNR provides a matrix which indicates complete congruence between the NSEDP outcomes, the 18 SDG targets and LDC graduation (GoL, 2018 , p. 10–12). International donor response to this commitment to the SDGs has in turn been robust. In early 2016, the EU renewed its commitment to Lao PDR, to the tune of 500 million euros over the next 5 years (2016–2021), much of it oriented toward nutrition and agriculture. An additional 6 million dollars was made available for nutrition by a resurgent USAID, in advance of President Obama's maiden visit to Vientiane (VOA, 2016 ). In late 2015, the Zero Hunger Challenge Roadmap was released, outlining a 2.06 billion USD plan to attain the ZHC (National Food Security and Commodity Development Committee, 2015 ). A new National Nutrition Forum was launched in November 2015, “in light of Lao's unprecedented national commitment to reduce stunting” (NNC, 2015 ). Beyond the rhetoric of engagement with the global development agenda, a more complicated reality was perceptible. By late 2015, with the triennial LDC global review scheduled for 2018, it became increasingly evident that Lao PDR would not meet the threshold for LDC graduation. The Background Document to the 2015 Round Table Meeting discreetly reset the timeframe to 2024 stating, “while theoretically possible, is not actually necessary and it may not be advantageous to graduate too soon” (MPI, 2015 ). Nevertheless, references to Lao PDR's graduation from LDC status remained a constant feature of policy documents such as the NESEDP, the NVR and state-controlled media until 2018, when the Prime Minister confirmed that the 2020 target was out of reach (Vientiane Times, 2018 ). Importantly for discussions for food security policy, although almost wholly unremarked in discussions on this point, was that this failure to meet the LDC graduation requirements had little to do with the Human Assets Index, (within which prevalence of undernourishment is tabulated) but rather, the issue lay in the Economic Vulnerability Index (UN, 2018a ), which, if anything, supports a reduction  in the share of GDP derived from agriculture. In blunt terms, LDC graduation as an overarching policy goal presents no further incentive to address food insecurity or chronic malnutrition; this in turn suggests that the rhetoric of “embedding” the SDGs papers over more substantial disconnects between national and global level policy statements.i  i The same could be said as LDC graduation as a whole. A nation's LDC graduation can be undertaken in two ways: via clearing thresholds on GNI per capita, EVI and HAI (Lao PDR in 2018 meets two of three of these criteria), or via in the income-only method, though which a state's GNI per capita is double the graduation threshold of 1242 USD. If Lao PDR is able to maintain a growth rate of 6% of higher, then it is possible that it will meet the income-only criteria within 4–5 years, circa 2022–2023. However, with LDC review carried out on a triennial basis, and the next review scheduled for 2021, this would still come too late for a 2024 graduation date.   The scale and ambition of the SDGs on hunger far outstrips that of the MDGs, with SDG 2.1 setting out to “end hunger,” SDG 2.2 “end[ing] all forms of malnutrition,” SDG 2.3 “doubling productivity” for a range of smallholder and vulnerable populations, SDG 2.4 “ensur[ing] sustainable food production systems” while adapting to climate change, and SDG 2.5 protecting genetic diversity and equitable sharing of the benefits therein (UN, 2016 ). And additional three goals (SDG 2a-c) go on to correct trade imbalances, improve agricultural research, and encourage commodity markets to behave. In the race to embrace the SDGs as an overall approach, much of the complexity (and potential contradiction) they introduce for national level policy has been papered over. A 2016 review of SDG2’s applicability in Lao PDR commissioned by MPI and WFP flagged this, expressing doubt or skepticism about Lao PDR's ability to attain four of five of the SDG2 targets, describing Lao PDR's ability to reach the targets as “likely to fall short” (SDG 2.2), “difficult to achieve” (SDG 2.3), “very difficult-if not impossible” (SDG 2.4), and “by no means realistic” (SDG 2.5) (Bouapao et al., 2016 ). This review questioned how it would be possible for the SDGs to be attained in full when progress towards goals which require momentum in opposing directions. How is agricultural productivity to be doubled  in 15 years in ways which are simultaneously net-zero contributors to climate change? How will all forms of malnutrition and hunger be ended or eliminated  in 15 years?j  j In this instance, the rhetoric of the goal statement is mitigated by the target for chronic malnutrition, which, while still ambitious, is stated as: a 40% reduction in the number of stunted children under five by 2025 (WHO, 2014 ). Applied to Lao PDR, this would imply a reduction from 33% to < 20% within 6 years, implying a rate of change without precedent in Lao PDR, and highly unusual in the global context.   In the national context of Lao PDR, the adoption of 2030 Agenda was taken as read to be a lodestar of policy at the highest political levels. Considerably less consideration given the sector-level or “technical” implications of individual goals, or indeed the interchanges implicit across and between goals. While global discourse has made much of the intertwined, indivisible nature of the SDGs (ICS, 2017 ), at the national level it is easier to adopt the 2030 Agenda in its entirety than it is to work out how to climate-proof agriculture (SDG 2, target 4) while doubling smallholder productivity (SDG 2, target 3), before even considering linkages to other SDGs. There is an element of pragmatism to this: for nations in the Global South in which governments are reliant on external funding and support, rather than alienating a potential donor by downgrading target the donor may value, it is simply easier to claim to adopt the whole SDG portfolio. But this should not be taken as meaningful “localization” or adaptation of the SDGs to context.  6 Discussion Early sections of this chapter suggested that despite occasional adjustments to the overall framing of the issue, the focus of food security policy in Lao PDR has consistently retained productionism at its core, with the mainstay of policy being the increased production of rice. Food security (and more latterly, nutrition), are seen as an issue applicable to rural, poor, poorly educated, ethnic minority populations. Food insecure and malnourished populations in periurban and urban areas are largely exempted from consideration—indeed, little is known about them at all. Issues of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), overweight and obesity are also excluded. The importance of trade and the private sector is partially treated, largely as a source through which improved economic performance can be derived, and thence improved household income and therefore, presumably food security. Above all, food security is presented as a policy problem which can be “solved,” through the simultaneous increase in agricultural production, and the reduction in incidence of malnutrition. This goes to suggest that despite variations on the formatting and presentation of the issues over time, food security policy in Lao PDR boils down to a simple binary formula: increase food production and reduce rates of chronic malnutrition. As is indicated by food security's placement within the NSEDPs, food security is only as valuable as its contribution to higher-order political outcomes—namely economic development, LDC graduation and attainment of the SDGs. With LDC graduation no longer meaningfully contingent on further reductions in undernourishment, it is possible that food security's importance in the overall policy agenda may be further diminished in the medium-term. While the advent of the SDG Agenda 2030 does draw attention to those MDG targets where Lao PDR fell short, the rush to adopt the 2030 Agenda as a whole portfolio has elided more complete discussion of what this will imply, or sector-level consideration of what “localization” of the SDG agenda might mean. Indeed, close reading of sector-level policy documents suggests that the operant logic is that servicing the SDGs will for the most part involve maintaining or reinforcing pre-existing policy commitments, (such as increased rice production and domestic self-sufficiency). This comes despite the fact that even per the government's own preferred metrics of Kcal or kilograms of food per capita, there is little reason to continue to pursue this policy orientation. Lao PDR is not alone in this regard. In their review of the SDGs in Ecuador, Horn and Grugel (2018)  stated “The SDGs, in other words, are not determining what Ecuadorian development means. They are, rather, legitimizing development goals and policies that have already been decided on.”  7 Conclusion Non-democratic political regimes derive legitimacy from economic outputs: with no popular mandate from the national body politic, the legitimacy of Lao PDR's “socialist market” rule as based on outputs, such that the end justifies the means: sustained economic growth confirms of the political rightness of the chosen path (Sayalath and Creak, 2017 ). The Agenda 2030 era ushers into the mainstream of global development policy a process of “governance by numbers” (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ), as nations prioritize progress toward the targets and indicators of the SDGs. In this regard, nations such as Lao PDR which were already strongly oriented towards quantitative targets as a basis for measuring process, (or indeed “policy-making by aspirational statement,” as the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights described Lao PDR's approach (OHCHR, 2019 )) will find the SDGs an easy fit. This, however, will have important corollary effects in closing off policy space for any issues not included in the SDGs: while the SDGs in theory allow for elaborate discussion of interlinkages between and across goals, governments may find it easier simply to accept the 2030 Agenda in full, rather than embark on a comprehensive “localization” process. For food security, which has long been understood as a multisectoral, multidisciplinary issue, this may lead to a turn to oversimplification, reifying the SDG indicators while discarding all else. With important insights emerging on how the SDGs were crafted at the global level, (McNeill, 2019 ), more attention is needed in understanding how commitments made at the global high-table are translated into meaningful national policy agendas.
