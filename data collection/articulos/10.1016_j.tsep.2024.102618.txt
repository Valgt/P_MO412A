                  Biodiesel is a suitable alternative to solve global pollution and declining non-renewable resources. This aligns with the sustainable climate goals and policies to cater to SDG 7. Sustainable technology and solutions have to be fostered. The higher blends of biodiesel will result in engine performance and emissions degradation. Therefore, this research aims to improve the engine performance and emissions of diesel engines operating with B20 POME biodiesel and isobutanol. The Central Composite Design (CCD) model was used to construct the RSM model to determine the optimised condition of the engine testing. Engine performance and emissions of diesel engines were tested on the Yanmar TF120M at 50 % load. Six fuel samples, diesel, B20 Palm Oil Methyl Ester (POME) biodiesel blended fuel, and another four B20 POME biodiesel blends added with 5–20 % in volume percentage of isobutanol, were tested. The optimised RSM obtained a desirability of 0.7. The optimal conditions for the engine testing were at 1868 rpm and a 10 % isobutanol additive percentage. The brake power, BSFC, and BTE of the B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 show an improvement compared to the B20. The exhaust emission shows the lowest CO emission for B90IBU10 at 50 % load. The lowest NOx emission was obtained by B95IBU5 and B90IBU10, with an improvement of 1.8 % and 2.4 %, respectively. Therefore, from this study, it can be concluded that a lower percentage of isobutanol additive of 5–10 % is a promising additive for biodiesel blended fuels.

This aligns with the sustainable climate goals and policies to cater to SDG 7. Sustainable technology and solutions have to be fostered. The higher blends of biodiesel will result in engine performance and emissions degradation. Therefore, this research aims to improve the engine performance and emissions of diesel engines operating with B20 POME biodiesel and isobutanol. The Central Composite Design (CCD) model was used to construct the RSM model to determine the optimised condition of the engine testing. Engine performance and emissions of diesel engines were tested on the Yanmar TF120M at 50 % load. Six fuel samples, diesel, B20 Palm Oil Methyl Ester (POME) biodiesel blended fuel, and another four B20 POME biodiesel blends added with 5–20 % in volume percentage of isobutanol, were tested. The optimised RSM obtained a desirability of 0.7. The optimal conditions for the engine testing were at 1868 rpm and a 10 % isobutanol additive percentage. The brake power, BSFC, and BTE of the B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 show an improvement compared to the B20. The exhaust emission shows the lowest CO emission for B90IBU10 at 50 % load. The lowest NOx emission was obtained by B95IBU5 and B90IBU10, with an improvement of 1.8 % and 2.4 %, respectively. Therefore, from this study, it can be concluded that a lower percentage of isobutanol additive of 5–10 % is a promising additive for biodiesel blended fuels.

This is due to problems connected to the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Biodiesel is one of the attractive renewable energies that is actively studied by all researchers worldwide. In many ways, biodiesel is a better candidate for mineral diesel substitutes. Biodiesel emits cleaner emissions, and the supplies can be renewed indefinitely because of the feedstock grown domestically. This will reduce the dependence on petroleum products. Despite biodiesel benefits, there are some drawbacks to engine performance and exhaust emissions of compression-ignition (CI) engines fuelled with biodiesel. Most of the drawbacks related to the problems of biodiesel used in CI engines are associated with biodiesel fuel properties. Therefore, to improve these drawbacks, researchers blend biodiesel with various fuel additives to overcome the problems associated with biodiesel fuel properties. Therefore, isobutanol is one of the candidates for fuel additives to be blended with biodiesel to improve the performance and emissions of CI engines fuelled with biodiesel instead of mineral diesel. A non-renewable energy source such as petroleum-based is largely consumed worldwide, involving transportation, generating electrical energy, and industrial sectors [1] . US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported in 2022 that the total fossil fuel consumed was higher than the total fossil fuel produced, as much as 36 %, compared to renewable energy, which contributed 13 % of total energy consumption by energy source. US Energy Information Administration also reported that renewable energy consumption increased in percentage from 2021 to 2022. This increasing trend of using renewable energy might be due to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were established in 2015 [2] . The UN SDGs targeted a period of action from 2016 to 2030 to implement a sustainable development mechanism to achieve 17 goals of economic, social, and environmental aspects [3] . This includes Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This SDG 7 focuses on accommodating the growing energy demands around the globe to ensure everyone can access modern, clean, and sustainable energy resources. This is to ensure the availability of energy sources at an affordable price, hence providing energy security for all [4] . At the same time, to secure SDG 13, which is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, SDG 7 is dedicated to tackling the climate change problems, especially the greenhouse effect, which is attributed to the global warming problem worldwide [5] . Recent studies predicted that 2030 energy demand will increase by approximately 50 % of today's consumption [6,7] . A. Atabani [8]  concluded that 45 % of the energy will be accounted for in China and India, while M. Mofijur et al. [9]  mention that approximately 60 % of the increase will be from China, India, and the Middle East. Even though fossil fuels are still being processed in the earth's crust, petroleum consumption is rapidly increasing every year because it is the most abundant resource available and the most reliable source of all. The steady growth of the transportation sector in the past years [7,10]  has increased energy consumption in the transportation sector. Globally, the transportation sector is the second-largest energy consumer after the industrial sector [8] , contributing 30 % of the world's total energy consumed. In contrast, road transport contributes approximately 30 % of the energy the transportation sector consumes. This increase is due to population growth, industrialisation, and the improved standard of living of the world's population [11,12] . Continuous consumption of petroleum resources will lead to a shortage of this resource in the future because petroleum is being consumed faster than it is generated. Biodiesel is one of the most competitive and attractive alternatives among the other alternatives due to its abundant resources around the world and the fact that feedstock can be grown domestically. Blending biodiesel with mineral diesel is the most common method of improving the fuel properties of biodiesel [13,14] , and it is usually called biodiesel blended fuels. According to American Testing for Testing and Materials D7467 (ASTM D7467), biodiesel can be blended with mineral diesel at a low blending ratio, which is up to 20 % of biodiesel (B20) [13,15] . Besides that, the usage of biodiesel in CI engines does not require vast or no modification at all for engine models from 1992 onwards [16,17] . This is because the value of the cetane number of vegetable oil and biodiesel is close [18,19] . There has been a considerable amount of research emphasising the fuel properties to solve weaknesses of biodiesel [20,21] . Major weaknesses of biodiesel compared to mineral diesel include its boiling point, viscosity and density, which are higher than mineral diesel and its calorific value, which is lower than mineral diesel [22,23] . This condition makes biodiesel less prone to evaporate, diffuse, and combust in the closed combustion chamber of the CI engine, resulting in lower performance and higher emissions than conventional mineral diesel engines. There is also ongoing debate regarding food versus fuel, environmental issues, and various economic and social issues regarding biodiesel production [12,24] . 1.1 Effect of fuel additives on engine performance To improve biodiesel properties and solve the disadvantages of biodiesel, researchers have initiated studies on various fuel additives as one of many options for solving the problems regarding the disadvantages of biodiesel [25,26] . The properties of biodiesel blends can be improved using fuel additives in the biodiesel blends [27,28] . Generally, by adding the fuel additives, the performance and emission of the CI engine operated by biodiesel blends will improve [29] . There is a long list of fuel additives today. Still, oxygenated additives [30,31]  are one of the major fuel additives used in the industry to compensate for the weakness of biodiesel blends. The additive functions act as a combustion catalyst to promote better combustion and improve the biodiesel's properties [32] . Alcohol from the butanol group is one of the many fuel additive candidates. Compared to methanol and ethanol, butanol is a longer carbon chain alcohol group with a higher cetane number, heating values, flash point, and density values closer to those of mineral diesel [33] . Moreover, the butanol alcohol group easily blends with diesel because of its excellent solubility [34,35] . Isobutanol is the isomer of the butanol group family. However, there is no investigation of the usage of isobutanol as a fuel additive in B20 POME biodiesel blended fuel on engine performance and fuel additive. M. Karabektas and M. Hosoz [34]  investigate the performance and emission characteristics of isobutanol-mineral diesel (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % in volume percentage) and found that the brake power (BP) decreases as the isobutanol volume increases in the fuel blends at lower engine speed. The BP shows slight decreases, with 5 % and 10 % isobutanol, in the fuel blends, and significant BP decreases, with 15 % and 20 % in the fuel blends. The average BP decreases are 1.47 % and 6.04 % for 10 % isobutanol and 20 % isobutanol, respectively. For fuel blends containing 5 % and 10 % isobutanol, it can be observed that the BP decreases at low engine speed and slightly increases at high speed compared to the mineral diesel. Based on the authors, this increase is due to the shorter ignition delay due to higher temperatures in the cylinders during the high-speed conditions. This is consistent with the findings by M. I. Al-Hasan and M. Al-Momany [36] , which state that the BP increases with increasing engine speed due to increased combustion temperature. M. I. Al-Hasan and M. Al-Momany [36]  found that the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the mineral diesel-isobutanol blends will increases as the volume of isobutanol increases compared to the mineral diesel. This pattern of increasing BSFC was also found by M. Karabektas and M. Hosoz [34] , who investigated the performance and emission characteristics of tested four different isobutanol-diesel blends with the proportion of 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % isobutanol in CI engine. They found that BSFC increases proportionally to isobutanol content. The average increment of the BSFC is between 2.06 % and 8.55 % for ISB5 (95 % diesel fuel and 5 % isobutanol) and ISB20 (80 % diesel fuel and 20 % isobutanol), respectively. K.Venkateswarlu et al. [37]  investigate the effect of isobutanol additive in mineral diesel-fish oil biodiesel blends on performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of the CI engine. The BSFC of fuel blends with isobutanol decreases at lower isobutanol additive volume. At higher isobutanol additive volume (10 % volume), the BSFC slightly increased. The increase of BSFC of fuel blends with a higher volume of isobutanol is due to the lower energy content of the fuel sample produced when added with more isobutanol. Since isobutanol is one of the butanol isomers, the decreasing trends are also found by D.C. Rakopoulos et al. [38] . N. Yilmaz et al. [35]  and P.-M. Yang et al. [39]  investigate the effect of butanol addition in the biodiesel blends. Both authors found that the BSFC increases compared to the mineral diesel as the volume of butanol increases in the biodiesel fuel blends. Mineral diesel contains a higher calorific value than butanol, and the biodiesel blend itself. In this agreement, B. Rajesh Kumar and S. Saravanan [40]  in the later year found that the addition of isobutanol as much as 40 % in mineral diesel also shows a slight increase in BSFC compared to the mineral diesel without isobutanol. The lower calorific value of the isobutanol can be attributed to the decrease in BSFC. However, the BSFC did not significantly decrease due to the high oxygen content in the isobutanol. H. Sharon et al. [41]  did an experimental study using diesel-palm oil-butanol blends on a direct injection diesel engine. The fuel blends of palm oil biodiesel show a different effect on the BSFC compared to the diesel-butanol fuel blends. The BSFC for palm oil biodiesel-butanol blends is decreasing as the content of butanol increases in the palm oil biodiesel-butanol fuel blends. This is due to the excess oxygen content that promotes better combustion in the combustion cylinder. D.C. Rakopoulos [42]  also found that the addition of n-butanol in the cottonseed biodiesel fuel blends will decrease the BSFC of the fuel blends compared to the neat cottonseed biodiesel (B100). Po-Ming Yang et al. [30]  found that adding fuel additives in mineral diesel-waste cooking oil (WCO) fuel blends lower the calorific value compared to the fuel blends without isobutanol. The decrease in calorific value results in an increment in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) compared to the fuel samples without isobutanol. However, for fuel samples with isobutanol, the BSFC decreases as the volume of isobutanol increases in the fuel blends. V. Mathan Raj et al. [43]  also found that adding isobutanol in cottonseed-diesel biodiesel blended fuel will reduce the BSFC compared to the mineral diesel. The higher volatility of isobutanol can be attributed to the improved combustion process of the fuel samples. In agreement with the previous findings, B. Ashok et al. [44]  study the effect of isobutanol and Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel as a partial replacement in CI engine applications. The author found that the addition of isobutanol in mineral diesel–biodiesel blends improves the BSFC compared to the fuel blends without isobutanol. The improvement was caused by better combustion efficiency of mineral diesel + CIME biodiesel + isobutanol compared to CIME biodiesel due to the higher calorific value of the mineral diesel + CIME biodiesel + isobutanol and leaner air–fuel ratio. The higher isobutanol volume in mineral diesel + CIME biodiesel + isobutanol blends will result in leaner air–fuel mixture combustion due to the higher oxygen content of the fuel blends with isobutanol compared to mineral diesel and CIME biodiesel. In other studies using mineral diesel–biodiesel blended fuel, K.Venkateswarlu et al. [37]  found that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increases with the blends and the volume of isobutanol compared to the mineral diesel. The author studies the effect of isobutanol additive in mineral diesel-fish oil biodiesel blends on the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of the CI engine. D.C. Rakopoulos [42]  also found that the BSFC of fuel blends will decrease when added with n-butanol, which is one of the butanol isomers that is the same as isobutanol. The finding is consistent with the study by H. Sharon et al. [41] . The author examined the fact that adding butanol to the palm oil biodiesel-mineral diesel blended fuel will increase the BTE value. The biodiesel blend used is B50 used palm oil (UPO). Then, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % of the volume percentage of isobutanol are added to the biodiesel blends. Mathan Raj et al. [43]  investigate the effect of the isobutanol additive in cottonseed biodiesel on the performance, combustion, and emission of the CI engine. In this experiment, B10 and B20 cottonseed biodiesel is added with 5 % and 10 % by volume of isobutanol. A single-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine with a power output of 5.2 kW is used, and the test is carried out at the speed of 1500 rpm and under varying load conditions. The result shows that adding 5 % and 10 % isobutanol in the cottonseed biodiesel slightly increases the BTE. The B10 + 10 % isobutanol blends show 3 % higher BTE than the mineral diesel BTE at full load condition. This is due to the advanced combustion resulting from the excess oxygen content of the blends. A similar research finding by b. Ashok et al. [44]  also points towards increases in BTE by adding isobutanol in the fuel blends. B. Ashok et al. [44]  found that ternary fuel blends, which the blending of mineral diesel, biodiesel, and isobutanol, show an improvement of 3.19 % for fuel blend with 10 % if isobutanol concentration compared to the neat biodiesel fuel. This is because the fuel with a higher calorific value, such as mineral diesel, is replaced with a lower calorific value fuel. In addition, as the concentration of biodiesel increases, the BTE also will increase due to the excess oxygen content of the blended fuel.  1.2 Effect of fuel additives on exhaust emissions M. Karabektas and M. Hosoz [34]  published a paper in which they studied the effect of isobutanol addition in the mineral diesel. The diesel-isobutanol fuel blends contain 5, 10, 15, and 20 % of isobutanol concentration. The result shows an improvement in carbon monoxide (CO) emission compared to the mineral diesel CO emission. The fuel blends with 5 % and 10 % isobutanol producing lower CO emission compared to the fuel blends with a higher concentration of isobutanol. A higher concentration of isobutanol in fuel blends tends to produce more CO emissions due to decreasing cetane number as the concentration of isobutanol increases. The average reduction of CO emission for fuel blends with isobutanol compared to the mineral diesel is between 3.2–11.3 %. Mixing isobutanol with mineral diesel leads to a lower stoichiometric air–fuel ratio, which causes lean combustion to take place. Moreover, the addition of isobutanol produces fuel blends with higher oxygen content. This is supported by D.C. Rakopoulos et al. [38]  study which reveals that by adding butanol class alcohol, the CO emission will be reduced. In the study, the author used n-butanol with a concentration of 8 %, 16 %, and 24 % blended with mineral diesel. The CO emission of butanol–mineral diesel blends is lower than that of mineral diesel alone. Another research by B. Rajesh Kumar et al. [45]  found that the addition of 30 % by volume of isobutanol in mineral diesel will result in a reduction of CO emission. Among all the test fuels, mineral diesel added with 30 % by volume isobutanol shows the highest reduction. This reduction is due to the fuel blends having the highest oxygen content among all the fuel blends. In another study, K.Venkateswarlu et al. [37]  investigate the effect of isobutanol additive in mineral diesel-fish oil biodiesel blends on performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of the CI engine. According to the author, CO emission shows significant decreases compared to the mineral diesel as the concentration of isobutanol increases in the fuel blends. A research finding by D.C. Rakopoulos [42]  also points towards the reduction of CO emissions by adding fuel additives such as isobutanol in the biodiesel-mineral diesel fuel blends. Furthermore, H. Sharon et al. [41]  did an experimental study on a mineral diesel-used palm oil-butanol fuel blend in a direct-injection engine. The result showed a significant reduction of CO emission at high-load engine conditions when the B50 palm oil fuel blend was used. As the concentration of butanol increases, the CO emission decreases. The lowest CO emission was the fuel blends with 15 % butanol. From the discussed literature, the reduction of CO emission is due to the effective oxidation of CO as a result of high in-cylinder temperature and high oxygen content of the fuel blends. The high viscosity of fuel blends will result in incomplete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder. The same result, which is decreasing CO emission, was found by G.R.K. Sastry et al. [46]  with the addition of isobutanol in the diesel–biodiesel blends. The author also concludes that isobutanol is suitable to be used as a fuel additive due to its higher energy density and lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). According to P.-M. Yang et al. [30] , the combustion temperature is expected to be raised and reduce CO emission if the fuel-bound oxygen is high. The presence of 10 % isobutanol in the biodiesel blends resulted in CO reduction of as much as 3.53–18.4 % for biodiesel blends of B10 to B40. In the latest year, B. Ashok et al. [44]  investigated the effect of adding isobutanol in mineral diesel–biodiesel fuel blends. The result shows that adding isobutanol reduced the CO emission compared to mineral diesel. However, as the isobutanol content increases in the fuel blends, the CO emission will be high due to the latent heat of vaporisation of the isobutanol, resulting in lower combustion temperature, thus producing more CO. M. Karabektas and M. Hosoz [34]  found that the oxides of nitrogen (NOx ) emission decreases as the concentration of isobutanol in the mineral diesel-isobutanol blend decreases. The NOx  emission is produced when the cylinder's combustion temperature and oxygen content are high. However, alcohol produces a lower combustion temperature due to the low calorific value and oxygen content. The author reported that the average decrease of NOx  emission for fuel blends with isobutanol compared to the mineral diesel is 4.9–13.9 %. A research finding by D.C. Rakopoulos et al. [38]  also points toward the same justification for reducing NOx  emission when the butanol is blended with mineral diesel. The NOx  emission was reduced because of the leaner combustion and lower combustion temperature due to low cetane number and low calorific value. B. Rajesh Kumar et al. [45]  found that the NOx  emission decreases compared to the mineral diesel when 30 % volume of isobutanol is added to the mineral diesel fuel. The diesel – 30 % by vol. isobutanol fuel blends produce the lowest NOx  emission for all engine loading (low, medium, and high). The presence of isobutanol in the fuel blends leads to leaner engine combustion, and the cooling effect that reduces combustion temperature is due to the higher latent heat of vaporisation of isobutanol. Therefore, lower combustion temperature in the combustion cylinder leads to lower NOx  emission. Another study using biodiesel-mineral diesel blends showed that with the addition of isobutanol in the fuel blends, NOx emission was reduced marginally compared to the mineral diesel [37] . This reduction is due to the lower calorific value and oxygen content, thus producing a lower combustion temperature. As a result of the lower combustion temperature, the NOx  emission is reduced. The author [37]  also concludes that as the isobutanol concentration increases in the fuel blends, the NOx  emission will be reduced. D.C. Rakopoulos [42]  also found that the NOx  emission is reduced by adding n-butanol in cottonseed biodiesel blends due to lower combustion temperature. However, a different study by H. Sharon et al. [41]  did an experimental study on mineral diesel − used palm oil −butanol fuel blend in a direct-injection engine. Generally, the NOx  emission increases as the load increases, resulting in higher combustion temperature. The result shows that the NOx  emission decreases as the concentration of butanol increases in the fuel blends. At 100 % load, the NOx  was found to be lower than mineral diesel fuel. Despite the higher oxygen content of the fuel blends with butanol, which will lead to increased NOx  emission, butanol's high latent heat of vaporisation caused the temperature-lowering effect during combustion. Therefore, the lower combustion temperature due to the butanol decreases the NOx  emission. On the contrary, B. Ashok et al. [44]  found that the NOx  emission of fuel blends with isobutanol is decreased as much as 8.16 % compared to the binary (diesel – biodiesel) and ternary (diesel – biodiesel – isobutanol) blends. The reduction of NOx  emission is due to the higher latent heat of vaporisation of isobutanol. In addition, the cooling effect of the isobutanol also reduces the NOx  emission due to the lower combustion temperature.  1.3 Optimization using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is an approach widely used in the industry to solve and optimize the experimental data [47] . The Central Composite Design (CCD) approach is used to design the experiment via a highly statistically significant model [48] . This CCD is a sophisticated statistical experimental design method used in the design of experiments (DOE) in various fields. I. M. Yusri et al. [47]  found that adding butanol to gasoline blends leads to improved engine performance and also exhaust emissions. The author utilised the RSM method to optimise the engine performance and exhaust emissions by minimising and maximising the engine performance. From the optimised model, the author obtained a 15 % increase in engine performance except for the brake specific fuel consumption while a 15 % reduced exhaust emissions except for the carbon dioxide. A.K. Singh et al. [49]  implement the RSM to enhance the engine performance of diesel engines. The author found that the RSM method is useful to maximise the engine performance of the diesel engine and emissions of 31.27 % brake thermal efficiency (BTE), 13.224 MJ/kW-h brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), 0.057 % volume of carbon monoxide (CO), 31.05 ppm of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC), 555.8 ppm oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and 28.8 % smoke. Similar findings were obtained by P. Sharma et al. [50] , who used RSM to optimise the engine performance and emissions of the ternary blend of societal-biodiesel-diesel in a diesel engine. The utilisation of RSM predicted the optimised engine performance of approximately 29.4 % of BTE, 0.396 kg/kWh BSFC, 0.39 % of CO, 228 ppm of NOX , and 52 ppm of unburnt hydrocarbon. The author concludes that adding Solketal additive improved the engine performance and exhaust emissions. Isobutanol has gained attention from researchers to be used as a fuel additive in CI engines [51] . Although studies of isobutanol as a fuel additive for gasoline have been extensively done for SI engines, little is known about isobutanol as a fuel additive in palm oil methyl ester (POME) biodiesel blended fuels. Due to the attributes discussed previously, isobutanol is feasible to be used in CI engines, and it is the best candidate to be used in POME biodiesel blends as a fuel additive compared to the other butanol isomers. In addition, as discussed in the previous section, the engine behaviour and emission characteristics are closely related to the fuel properties such as kinematic viscosity, density, cetane number, and calorific value. However, some properties of isobutanol make it suitable to be used as additives for B20 POME biodiesel blended fuels. One of the properties is isobutanol, which can be produced from various renewable sources, making its utilisation viable. Moreover, the water affinity characteristics of biodiesel are low compared to ethanol and methanol, which makes isobutanol feasible to mix with gasoline and mineral diesel. This characteristic will prevent phase separation for a long period of time. Furthermore, isobutanol contains an oxygen content of 21.5 % [34] , promoting a better combustion process. Besides that, the addition of isobutanol in diesel and biodiesel shows an improvement in certain combustion characteristics. However, the relationship between performance and exhaust emissions characteristics with fuel properties remains unclear. It can be concluded that although butanol isomers such as n-butanol have been used widely as an additive for biodiesel, the isobutanol additive remains in its infancy. Furthermore, there is no study on the effect of isobutanol additive up to 20 % in volume percentage in the POME biodiesel blended fuel towards the engine performance and exhaust emissions using CCD RSM optimisation. Therefore, this research aim was to investigate the relationship between isobutanol additives in B20 POME biodiesel and to determine the optimal conditions for the engine performance and exhaust emissions using the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) approach.   2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Palm Oil Methyl Ester (POME) biodiesel was procured from a local supplier, KLK OLEO. The trade name for the POME supplied is Palm Methyl Ester MS2008:2014 (CAS Number: 91051–34-2 /67762–38-3). The POME biodiesel characterise under CAS No. Description 67762–38-3 Fatty acids, C16-18 and C18-unsatd., Me esters. The fuel properties of the POME biodiesel used in this experiment can be seen in Table 1  . The isobutanol used is the 99.5 % laboratory-grade R&M Chemical brand iso -butanol (CAS xNo: 78–83-1) or iso -butyl alcohol; 2-methyl-1-propanol was acquired from a local company named Evergreen Engineering & Resources from Selangor. Table 2   shows the properties of the chemical used as fuel additives in this research, which is iso -butanol.  2.2 Fuel samples preparation Six samples of fuels were prepared, as illustrated in Table 3  . All fuel samples were prepared by blending and mechanical mixing based on volume percentage. Except for pure mineral diesel, all the other fuel samples were using B20 POME biodiesel blended fuels. Five litres of fuel was prepared for each of the fuel samples, as indicated in Table 3 . B20 POME biodiesel was prepared by the ratio of 80 % pure mineral diesel blended with 20 % POME biodiesel. B20 samples act as a baseline fuel. Then, ratios of 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % in a volume percentage of isobutanol were added to the B20 blended fuels and named B95IBU5, B90IBU10, B85IBU15, and B80IBU20, respectively. The mixture of pure mineral diesel and POME biodiesel was stirred using a mechanical stirrer at a low stirring rate. The mixture was stirred continuously for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the fuel was left for 30 min at room temperature before being tested in the engine as recommended by Obed Majeed Ali et al. [52] . This was done to let the fuel samples reach equilibrium before engine testing. Each fuel sample was prepared directly before engine testing. This is to avoid any issues of phase separation.  2.3 Property test for fuel samples All fuel samples in this research were tested to obtain the physicochemical properties at the University Malaysia Pahang and Universiti Teknologi MARA. The fuel physicochemical properties that were measured in this research are density, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, and calorific value. Fig. 1   shows the fuel samples sent to the lab for testing. Table 4   shows the result for the physicochemical properties of the tested fuels.  2.4 Experimental test setup for engine testing In this research work, the engine testing was performed on a YANMAR TF120M four-stroke horizontal single-cylinder direct injection with 0.63 L and 17.7 compression ratio. It is a water-cooled, low-speed with a maximum power rating of 7.8 kW at 2400 rpm. The was coupled to the 15 kW eddy current dynamometer with a universal controller model DC5-10KW to control the engine speed and torque. The test fuel was supplied to the engine using an integrated fuel system. The fuel system consists of a few components, which are tanks, fuel lines, and fuel consumption measurement burette. The setup of the engine testing can be seen in Fig. 2   and also Fig. 3  . The specification of the engine used in this experiment can be seen in Table 5  . The whole experiment was conducted in a steady-state condition. This experiment was conducted with engine speeds ranging from 1200 rpm to 2400 rpm with speed intervals of 300 rpm at 50 % load conditions. At each speed, the engine performance parameters, which were brake power, brake specific fuel consumption, and brake thermal efficiency, were collected. To ensure accurate and reliable measurement, the tests were repeated five times for each fuel. All steps were repeated for each fuel sample. The whole experiment was conducted in a steady-state condition. This experiment was conducted with engine speeds ranging from low, medium, and high speed. The low-speed range is from 1200 rpm to 1500 rpm. The medium speed range is between 1500 rpm to 1800 rpm. While the high-speed range is between 1800 rpm to 2400 rpm. The measurement started with 1200 rpm until 2400 rpm with speed intervals of 300 rpm. The experiment was conducted with three load conditions: low load, half load, and high load. For each load condition, all the fuel samples were tested from 1200 rpm to 2400 rpm with speed intervals of 300 rpm. To measure the exhaust emission, a portable Kane Automotive gas analyser model 4–1 was used. Before conducting the experiment, the Kane gas analyser was calibrated to ensure the accuracy of the exhaust gas emission measurements. To obtain consistency and accuracy of the measurement using a Kane gas analyser, the reading was taken after running the engine for approximately 5 min. The measurement was repeated three times for each fuel sample, and the average was calculated. Before each measurement was taken, the purging process needed to ensure the new reading was accurate and not affected by previous fuel sample data. The specification of the Kane gas analyser is shown in Table 6   below.  2.5 Uncertainty analysis Because it determines the dependability of the outcomes, evaluating uncertainty is crucial in all experimental research. Measurement errors, inaccurate instrument calibration, and fluctuating operating conditions are the sources of uncertainty in this study. The degree of uncertainty was ascertained by statistically analysing the experimental results using the GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) technique [49] . Important engine performance and emissions characteristics were the subject of an uncertainty analysis. The root-sum-of-squares approach was utilised to compute the combined standard uncertainty, as demonstrated in (1)(1) T o t a l  u n c e r t a i n t y = √ { u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  c a l o r i f i c  v a l u e     2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  c e t a n e  n u m b e r    2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  v i s c o s i t y    2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  d e n s i t y     2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  d y n a m o m e t e r    2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  f u e l  f l o w    2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  C O    2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  N O  X     2  + u n c e r t a i n t y  o f  C O 2     2  ] = √  [ 1.6  2     + 1.5    2  + 1.1    2  + 0.04    2  + 1.4    2  + 1.6    2  + 2.4    2  + 1.8    2  + 1.6    2  }  = ± 4.7 %       2.6 Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach 2.6.1 Design of experiment (DOE) The design of the experiment for the RSM approach to investigate the effect of the independent variables, including engine speed (X1  ) and fuel blends (X2  ) on the response variable of brake power (Y1  ), brake specific fuel consumption (Y2  ), brake thermal efficiency (Y3  ), carbon monoxide (Y4  ), carbon dioxide (Y5  ), and oxides of nitrogen (Y6  ). The RSM design in Table 7   uses two factors: five levels of coded central composite design (CCD) and a quadratic model. In a CCD, the levels of factors are typically coded as −1, 0, and + 1 for low, central, and high levels respectively. The central level is usually chosen to represent the typical operating conditions or the expected optimal point for the process under study. The central level is important because it helps in estimating curvature and assessing the behaviour of the response surface near the centre of the experimental domain. It allows for the exploration of both linear and quadratic effects of factors on the response variable. Thirteen runs, including four factorial, four axial, and five centre points, were randomly performed according to the CCD that can be seen in Table 7 . In RSM, the relationship was approximated by a polynomial model as in equation (2) . The equation also can be written as in (3) where Y    is the predicted response, i    is the linear coefficient, j    is the quadratic coefficient, k    is the factor, beta is the regression coefficient, and script epsilon is the random experimental errors assumed to have a zero mean [47,48] .(2) Y = f  ′  X    β + ε     (3) Y  = β  0  + ∑ i  = 1  k   β  i   X  i   + ∑ i  < j    β  i  j    X  i   X  j   + ∑ i  = 1  k   β  i  i    X  i   2  + ε       The significant values between the input variables and responses were determined by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The model was evaluated by the probability value of 95 % confidence. The design matrix with input variables and responses can be seen in Table 8  .    3 Results and discussion In this study, the RSM modelling results were presented and discussed in detail in the first section of the discussion. Then, all the experimental engine test result of each fuel sample was presented and discussed in detail. The engine experimental testing was done using fuel samples of additive ratios ranging from 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % of isobutanol. All experimental tests were conducted at a constant 50 % load with five engine speeds ranging between 1200 rpm to 2400 rpm with an increment of 300 rpm. 3.1 Performance characteristics 3.1.1 Brake power The engine BP can be calculated based on engine torque obtained at each speed. However, the dynamometer data acquisition equipment had recorded the brake power data at each speed. The variation of brake power at 50 % load was presented in Fig. 4  . Generally, the brake power increases as the engine speed increases for all fuel samples and the highest brake power was achieved at 2400 rpm. A similar trend was found by Md.A. Iqbal et al. [53] , where the brake power increases as the engine speed increases. The brake power for fuel samples with isobutanol additives increases as the ratio of isobutanol increases for the whole engine speed. In the case of fuel samples with isobutanol additives, at each speed, the B95IBU5 shows the highest brake power, followed by B90IBU10, B85IBU15, and B80IBU20. This is due to the effect of decreasing the calorific value of the fuel as the isobutanol volume increases in the fuel samples [34,36] . From Table 4 , the calorific value of fuel samples decreases as the isobutanol volume increases. Moreover, the decreases in brake power reflect the findings by Al-Hassan and Al-Momany [36] , where the brake power with fuel blends decreases resulting from the isobutanol's higher heat of vaporisation. The B95IBU5 and B20 have a higher brake power than Diesel from 1200 rpm until 2400 rpm. The fuel samples of B95IBU5, B90IBU10 and B85IBU15 have the higher brake power than the B20 and Diesel at 1200 rpm with the value of approximately 1.85 kW, 1.76 kW, 1.72 kW. At 1800 rpm the B95IBU5 still has the highest brake power than the other fuel samples with the brake power value of approximately 3.29 kW. While at 1800 rpm B20 has the second-highest brake power with a value of 3.21 kW. At 2400 rpm, the fuel samples of B20, B95IBU5, and B90IBU10 with brake power values of 3.88 kW, 3.96 kW, and 3.83 kW, respectively, have a higher brake power than the Diesel (3.78 kW). At 2400 rpm, the B80IBU20 fuel samples have the lowest brake power among the other fuel samples. Fig. 4  shows that, at 1200 rpm, the B20 fuel has a slight increment of brake power than the Diesel fuel, as much as 3.84 %, with a brake power of 1.64 kW. The fuel sample of B95IBU5 has the highest brake power at 1200 rpm with a value of 1.85 kW. The B95IBU5 has a significant increment of as much as approximately 12.7 % and 17.1 % at 1200 rpm than the B20 and Diesel, respectively, at 1200 rpm. For the other fuel samples that contain isobutanol fuel additives, the brake power decreases as the ratio of isobutanol fuel additives increases. The second-highest among fuel samples with isobutanol fuel additives are B90IBU10, B85IBU15, and B80IBU20, with brake power of approximately 1.76 kW, 1.72 kW, and 1.47 kW, respectively. Except for the B80IBU20, all the other fuel samples have brake power more than the B20 brake power at 1200 rpm with an increment of approximately 7.1 % and 4.4 % for fuel samples of B90IBU10 and B85IBU15, respectively. The lowest brake power at 1200 rpm is the B80IBU20 with a decrement of approximately 10.7 % than the B20. At 1800 rpm, B20 in Fig. 4  shows an increment of as much as approximately 2.4 % than the Diesel. The result at 1800 rpm shows that the B95IBU5 has the highest brake power among the other fuel samples with a value of approximately 3.29 kW. The brake power of B95IBU5 increases by approximately 2.4 % and 4.9 % compared to B20 and Diesel, respectively, at 1800 rpm. B90IBU10 has a slight decrement of approximately 1.0 % than the B20 with a value of brake power of approximately 3.18 kW at 1800 rpm. Although the B90IBU10 has slightly decreased than the B20, the B90IBU10 brake power is still slightly higher than the Diesel at 1800 rpm with an increment of 1.4 %. However, at 1800 rpm, B85IBU15 and B80IBU20 decrease by approximately 6.1 % and 9.1 % with the brake power of approximately 3.02 kW and 2.92 kW, respectively, than the brake power of the B20 fuel sample. At 1800 rpm B85IBU15 and B80IBU20 decrease lower than the brake power of Diesel. The brake power of B85IBU15 and B80IBU20 at 1800 rpm decreases by approximately 3.8 % and 6.9 %, respectively. Fig. 4  shows that at high engine speed, which is 2400 rpm, B20 shows an increment of as much as 6.3 % than the Diesel with a brake power value of approximately 3.88 kW. The highest brake power at 2400 rpm was the B95IBU5 with brake power of approximately 3.96 kW with an increment of as much as approximately 1.9 % and 4.7 % compared to B20 and Diesel, respectively. Meanwhile, at 2400 rpm, there is a slight decrement of brake power for B90IBU10, approximately 1.3 % than B20 fuel samples with a brake power value of approximately 3.83 kW for the B90IBU10. However, the brake power of B90IBU10 shows a slight increase in the brake power of approximately 1.5 % compared to Diesel at 2400 rpm. At 2400 rpm, there are two fuel samples with brake power lower than the Diesel, which are B85IBU15 and B80IBU20. The B85IBU15 engine brake power decreases slightly to approximately 0.64 % than the Diesel. However, the B80IBU20 shows the lowest brake power with a value of 3.61 kW at 2400 rpm with a decrement of as much as approximately 7.0 % and 4.3 % than B20 and Diesel, respectively. Generally, at all speeds, the B20 fuel samples show higher brake power than the Diesel fuel, which is consistent with the findings by W.N.M. Wan Ghazali et al. [54]  and Md.A. Iqbal et al. [53] . The higher biodiesel blends above B20 are not favourable because it will increase the kinematic viscosity and reduced calorific energy will reduce the brake power [13,55] . The effect of isobutanol additive with B20 POME blended fuel seems clear at high additive ratios, which are higher than 10 %. As depicted in Table 4 , the higher the isobutanol additive volume, the lower the calorific value of the fuel samples. Although the density and kinematic viscosity in Table 4  shows improvement, the improvement does not give significant effect to improve the brake power as the calorific value is decreasing. The increases of isobutanol additive result in decreasing in the brake power of the engine. A similar finding was found by the Al-Hassan and Al-Momany [36] .  3.1.2 Brake specific fuel consumption The BSFC is one of important the parameters to measure the engine efficiency, measuring the work produced by the supplied fuel. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) can be defined as the mass flow rate of the fuel per unit power output. The fuel flow was measured by using a burette and stopwatch. Then, the mass flow rate was determined by using the mass of each fuel sample obtained from the calculation using the density of each fuel sample. The mass flow rate of the fuel was divided with the respective brake power to obtain the BSFC. In the next section, the result of BSFC is presented and discussed. It can be seen that in Fig. 5   the BSFC at 50 % load of all fuel samples is higher at lower speed and keeps decreasing until the BSFC reaches the lowest at 1800 rpm. It then keeps on increasing back until 2400 rpm. The lowest BSFC overall attained by all fuel samples is the B20 at 1800 rpm with the BSFC value of approximately 191.03 g/kWh while the highest BSFC overall is Diesel at 1200 rpm with BSFC value of approximately 322.30 g/kWh. The B20 obtained the lowest BSFC overall at 1800 rpm compared to the fuel samples with isobutanol additive. This was due to the calorific value of the B20 which was higher than those fuel samples with isobutanol additives. The higher calorific value is favourable to produce higher brake power with less fuel consumed [13] . The BSFC of B20 is lower than the Diesel due to the lubricity of POME biodiesel that promotes better atomisation which in turn promotes better combustion and produces lower BSFC [56] . Moreover, N. R. Abdullah et al. [56]  conclude that the POME good lubricity provides better atomisation by protecting the fuel injection system [57] , enhancing combustion and producing lower BSFC. Better lubricity is favourable to reduce the loss of friction between the piston and cylinder wall thus producing more efficient mechanical power output [11] . In general, for the case of fuel samples with isobutanol, at each speed, the BSFC of fuel samples with a lower volume of isobutanol, which is B95IBU5 and B90IBU10, obtained lower BSFC values than the fuel samples of a higher volume of isobutanol, which are B85IBU15 and B80IBU20. Among all fuel samples with isobutanol, the BSFC of B85IBU15 shows the highest BSFC than the others except at the speed of 2400 rpm. At 2400 rpm and a constant load of 50 %, the B80IBU20 shows the highest BSFC among all fuel samples that contain isobutanol additives with a BSFC value of approximately 273.20 g/kWh. The higher the isobutanol additive in the fuel samples is, the higher the BSFC of the fuel samples is [37,38] . The increases of BSFC can be related to the lower calorific value of the fuel samples with isobutanol additive, especially B80IBU20, with the value of the calorific value of 43.11 MJ/kg as indicated in Table 4 . An increase in the BSFC was due to the increases of isobutanol additives in the fuel samples as the fuel of higher calorific value being substituted with lower calorific value fuel [44,58] . Compared with the Diesel, the B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 show lower BSFC at all engine speeds. Compared with the B20, at 1200 rpm and 2400 rpm, the B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 show a lower BSFC than the B20 fuel samples. However, at 1500 rpm to 2100 rpm, the BSFC of B20, B95IBU5, and B90IBU10 are almost identical. However, interestingly, this is contrary to the study by B. Ashok et al. [44]  and S. Madiwale [58] . Both authors [44,58]  found that the higher alcohol content in the fuel blends will result in the reduction of BSFC due to the lower calorific value of fuel samples with high alcohol content. However, lower kinematic viscosity and high cetane number of fuel samples with higher isobutanol content, as in Table 4  compensate for the lower calorific value disadvantages and produce better BSFC than the B20 fuel.  3.1.3 Brake thermal efficiency The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is the method to indicate the efficiency of the engine to convert the fuel to useful energy. The BTE is the ratio of power output by the engine to the amount of energy in the fuel supplied. BTE is determined by using the BSFC and calorific value of the fuel information. Fig. 6   shows the variation of BTE at varying engine speeds from 1200 rpm to 2400 rpm at 50 % load. The BTE generally increased to the highest value at 1800 rpm for all fuel samples. However, the BTE started to decrease slightly from 2100 rpm to 2400 rpm. This was due to the combined effect of the decrease in brake power and the BSFC [34] . The highest BTE was obtained at 1800 rpm by the B20, followed closely by the second highest BTE of B90IBU10 and B95IBU5, with BTE values of approximately 42.2 % and 42.1 %, respectively. The lowest BTE is obtained by the Diesel at 1200 rpm with the BTE value of 24.4 %. The B20 always has a higher BTE value than the Diesel at all speeds. As discussed earlier in the previous section, the higher oxygen content and the lubricity of the B20 POME biodiesel fuel lead to a better combustion process, improving the BTE of the B20 fuel samples compared to the Diesel [59,60] . Another factor that might influence the increases of the BTE may be the increase of brake power and reduction of the BSFC for the B20, as depicted in Fig. 4 . and Fig. 5 . Moreover, among all fuel samples with isobutanol additives, the B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 consistently exhibit higher BTE values than the B85IBU15 and B80IBU20 at all engine speeds. At 1800 rpm, the B90IBU10 obtained a slight 0.2 % improvement of BTE compared to the B20 and a significant improvement of 10.5 % BTE compared to the Diesel fuel. Unlike the other engine speeds, at 2400 rpm, the B90IBU10 obtained approximately 5.6 % higher BTE than the B20. Generally, the fuel samples with a lower volume of isobutanol, which are B95IBU5 and B90IBU10, produce higher BTE than the higher volume of isobutanol, which are B85IBU15 and B80IBU20. In the previous section, in Table 4 , the fuel samples with a higher ratio of isobutanol additive have a lower kinematic viscosity. However, it still cannot compensate for the significant reduction of the calorific value, as can be seen in Table 4 . Therefore, more fuel is injected to produce the same brake power, which leads to the reduction of BTE, as can be seen in Fig. 4 . and Fig. 5 . Moreover, at 50 % load, the BTE can be observed not significantly differ from each other among the Diesel, B20, B95IBU5, and B90IBU15. The same result was found by V. Mathan Raj et al. [43] , which concludes that the addition of isobutanol up to 10 % does not produce a significant difference in BTE among the tested fuels, which are diesel and fuel samples with isobutanol additive. The authors also commented that despite the lower calorific value of fuel samples with isobutanol additive, the lower kinematic viscosity and high cetane number have compensated the calorific value to produce a better combustion process, leading to a higher BTE. Another reason for the increases in BTE for fuel samples with isobutanol additive is the excess oxygen promoting more complete combustion.   3.2 Emission characteristics The efficiency of the engine output is determined by various exhaust emissions. In this section, all the experimental exhaust emissions are presented and discussed in detail. All the tested fuel was measured by the Kane gas analyser. This experimental testing was done to obtain a clear understanding of the exhaust emissions with B20 POME biodiesel blended fuel and different volumes of isobutanol additive in the B20 POME biodiesel blended fuel. The engine adopted isobutanol additive ratios of 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 %. All experimental tests were conducted at four different loads (25 %, 50 %, and 75 %) with five engine speeds ranging between 1200 rpm to 2400 rpm with an increment of 300 rpm. The results and trends of the carbon monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx ) are presented and discussed in the following section. 3.2.1 Carbon monoxide The emission of CO is due to the incomplete combustion that occurs in the combustion chamber. The incomplete combustion is a result of inadequate oxygen during the combustion process or a rich air–fuel ratio in the combustion chamber [61,62] . Fig. 7   shows the variation of CO emission at different speeds at a constant load of 50 %. The result depicted little variation of CO emission as the engine speed was increasing. The increasing isobutanol additives in the fuel samples increase the CO formation. This is due to the high latent heat of vaporisation and the ignition quality of fuel samples containing a higher amount of isobutanol [44] . At a high speed of 2400 rpm, the lowest CO emission was obtained by the B90IBU10 with approximately 0.01 % CO emission. This is due to the adequate oxygen content that promotes complete combustion hence reducing the CO emission [45] . The reduction of CO is also connected to the lower kinematic viscosity of the fuel samples with isobutanol compared to the Diesel and B20, as depicted in Table 4 . The lower kinematic viscosity leads to a better combustion process due to the enhanced fuel atomisation. The enhanced combustion process is also due to the oxygen content of the fuel samples that increases the in-cylinder temperature, thus resulting in a reduction of CO emission [63] . Besides, as reported by B. Ashok et al. [44]  the increased of CO emission is also due to the lower cetane number of the fuel samples. In Table 4 , the cetane number increases as the isobutanol content increases. Therefore, the B90IBU10 shows the lowest CO emission at 2400 rpm due to the combined effect of cetane number and kinematic viscosity.  3.2.2 Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) The exhaust emission of CO2  for all fuel samples can be seen in Fig. 8  . The formation of carbon dioxide is associated with carbon monoxide. The complete combustion leads to the formation of the carbon dioxide. However, CO2  is not favourable because it will cause global warming [47] . As depicted in Fig. 8 , the CO2  increases as the engine speed increases. The more the volume of isobutanol fuel additives in the fuel blends increases the CO2  emissions. The highest CO2  emissions can be observed at the engine speed of 2400 rpm. The highest CO2  was formed by B85IBU15, with a value of approximately 5.2 %. This formation might be due to the excess oxygen in the isobutanol that promotes better combustion [63] . However, at all speeds, the B80IBU20 consistently shows the lowest emissions of CO2, which was due to the complete combustion of the fuel samples attributed to the excess oxygen in the isobutanol. The lowest CO2  was observed at 1200 rpm for the B80IBU20, with CO2  values of 3.3 %. At 1200 rpm, the emissions of CO2  was improved as much as approximately 2.1 % and 5.2 % compared to Diesel and B20 respectively. Similar findings were found by C.R. Seela et al. [64] , that did experiments on isobutanol additive in B30 Jatropha Curcas biodiesel blended fuels. The author found that the CO2  decreases significantly with the addition of isobutanol at a 10 % volume percentage.  3.2.3 Oxides of nitrogen The assessment of NOX  for all fuel samples at numerous engine conditions is shown in this section. Combustion temperature is the main factor of NOx formation [65] . Fig. 9  . shows that NOX  emission decreases as the engine speed increases. The lowest NOX  emission can be observed at 2400 rpm by the B80IBU20 fuel samples with a value of 103 ppm compared to the B20 with a NOx  emission of 136 ppm. However, at 1800 rpm, it was observed that the B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 NOX  emissions were the lowest, with improvement of approximately 1.8 % and 2.4 % compared to the B20 fuel samples. The influencing factors might be the higher cetane number of the fuel samples, as can be observed in Table 4  similar to Adam et al. findings [66] . The higher cetane number will shorten the ignition delay, thus preventing the maximum heat release rates. Indirectly, this will reduce the in-cylinder temperature during the combustion process. Another factor is the cooling effect that was discussed earlier in the previous section. The increasing isobutanol additive ratio in the fuel samples produces lower NOX  emissions compared to the B20 biodiesel.   3.3 Analysis of developed model The Table 9   shows the parameters for analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the design of the experiment (DOE). In this study, there were thirteen data run have been constructed as indicated in Table 8 . The p − value  for all of the responses parameters were less than 0.05 hence, implies the model terms are significant and 95 % in confidence level for the point prediction. From the ANOVA response, the value of the coefficient of determination, R  2     for all responses were near to 1, where it is a desirable in agreement with the value of adj R  2    . In RSM, the R  2     is used as a measure of how well the regression model fits the observed data. An R  2     value close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the response variable can be explained by the regression model. Therefore, a high R  2     value, near to 1, is desirable because it suggests that the model captures most of the variation in the data and provides a good fit to the observed responses [67] . All the responses were using the quadratic model except for the CO2 and NOx, where the DOE suggest to use a linear fits model for both of the responses. The Adequate Precision (AP) measures the signal-to-noise ratio. A ratio greater than 4 is desirable [47] . Therefore, this model can be used to navigate the design space. The diagnostic graph from Fig. 10   (a) to (h), shows the normal probability plots for all types of responses. The normal probability plot indicates whether the residuals follow a normal distribution, thus following a straight line. From Fig. 10  also can be seen that the data shows a good correlation with the normality assumption of the regression model equation. Based on Fig. 10 , similar findings were found by P. Sharma et al. [50] . The addition of the Solketal additives to the biodiesel blended fuel shows most of the data lies close to the 45 degree line that indicate the robustness of the regression results. 3.3.1 Effect of the isobutanol fuel additives and engine speed towards brake power The relationship between engine speed (A ) and isobutanol fuel additives (B ) can be observed in the Eq. (4) . The quadratic model relationship of the engine speed and isobutanol fuel additives towards the engine power is depicted in the Fig. 11   (a) and (b) using a contour plot and 3D surface plot, respectively, for a constant engine load of 50 %. The figures depicted that as the engine speed increases, the brake power for each of the fuel blends also increases. Moreover, the increases of volume of isobutanol additive in the fuel blends results in decreasing the brake power at each of the engine speed. Notably, at each of the engine speeds, B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 obtained the highest brake power compared to the B85IBU15 and B80IBU20. However, the B20 POME biodiesel fuel obtained the highest brake power at each of the engine speeds. Among all the fuel samples with isobutanol additives, the B95IBU5 obtained the highest brake power of 3.5 kW at a much lower engine speed. This is because the B95IBU5 obtained a higher calorific value than the other fuel blends with isobutanol, as depicted in Table 4 [34,36] . A similar finding was found by the Al-Hassan and Al-Momany [36] . The author found that the adidtion of isobutanol in the fuel samples increases the engine performance due to the lower heating value for the fuel blends. However, the BSFC of the fuel samples was increasing due to the lower heating value of the isobutanol.(4) B P  ( k W )  = - 3.46363 + 0.00555452 A + 0.0249213 B - 3.9185 E  - 6   A B - 1.04065 E  - 6   A  2  - 0.00150797 B  2        3.3.2 Effect of the isobutanol fuel additives and engine speed towards brake specific fuel consumption The relationship between the engine speed and isobutanol additives can be modelled by Eq. (5) . The statistical indicators for the quadratic model can be seen in Table 9 . A significant relationship can be observed between engine speed and isobutanol additives percentage towards the BSFC. From the Fig. 12   (a) and (b), the BSFC decreases as the engine speed approaching 1800 rpm and increases from 1800 rpm to 2400 rpm. The lowest BSFC observed was at 1800 rpm with a value of approximately 190 g/kWhr at 1800 rpm. Fuel blends with 5 % and 10 % of isobutanol shows the lowest BSFC value at 1800 rpm. However, the BSFC continues to increase as the volume of isobutanol in the fuel blends increases. This is parallel with the findings of brake power depicted in the Fig. 5 . This finding is consistent with B. Ashok et al. [44] , whereas the volume of isobutanol increases in the fuel blends, the BSFC also will increase. This is due to the fact that the increasing volume of isobutanol will lower the BSFC but will improve the other physicochemical properties, as indicated in Table 4 . The attributes of POME biodiesel that provide better atomization due to the lubricity of the fuel blends result in the decrease of the BSFC in general. However, S. Pitchaiah et al. [68]  found that the increase in the biodiesel concentration is attributed to the increase in BSFC.(5) B S F C  ( g / k W h r )  = 723.721 - 0.579314 A - 0.713136 B - 0.000975047 A B + 0.000159193 A  2  + 0.211857 B  2        3.3.3 Effect of the isobutanol fuel additives and engine speed towards brake thermal efficiency Eq. (6)  represent the quadratic mathematical model for the engine speed and isobutanol additives percentage towards the BTE. As represented in Fig. 13  , the BTE increases as the engine speed increases to 1800 rpm and decreases from 1800 rpm to 2400 rpm. As the isobutanol additives volume increases in the fuel blends, the BTE shows a decreasing trend. The lowest BTE was obtained by the B80IBU20 at 1200 rpm with a value of approximately 27 %. The highest BTE was obtained by both B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 at 1800 rpm, with values of approximately 42.2 % and 42.1 %, respectively. From Fig. 13  (a), the trends of the BTE improving can be seen from the region of 1500 rpm to 2100 rpm. At all engine speeds, the B95IBU5 obtained the highest BTE compared to the other fuel blends with isobutanol additives. As BTE is closely associated with the BSFC and BP, similar to the justification by Pitchaiah et al. [68] , due to the decreases of BSFC at 1800 rpm as depicted in Fig. 12 , this will result in a better BTE.(6) B T E  ( % )  = - 41.405 + 0.090634 A + 0.266001 B + 8.44151 E  - 5   A B - 2.49232 E  - 5   A  2  - 0.0299963 B  2        3.3.4 Effect of the isobutanol fuel additives and engine speed towards carbon monoxide Fig. 14   (a) and (b) show the quadratic model graph from Eq. (7) . From Fig. 14 , the CO emissions increase as the engine speed increases for all fuel blends. However, from Fig. 14  (a), it can be seen the CO emissions were not more than 0.02 % within the region of isobutanol additives of 5–10 %. As discussed earlier in the previous section, this might be due to the high latent heat of vaporisation and the ignition quality of fuel samples containing a higher amount of isobutanol [44] .(7) C O  ( % )  = - 0.0391571 + 9.52107 E  - 5   A - 0.00876245 B + 1.11111 E  - 6   A B - 2.49042 E  - 8   A  2  + 0.000343678 B  2        3.3.5 Effect of the isobutanol fuel additives and engine speed towards carbon dioxide The linear mathematical model for the effect of the engine speed and isobutanol additives percentage in the fuel blends towards the CO2  can be seen in the Eq. (8) . Fig. 15   shows that the CO2  increases as the engine speed increases. The highest CO2  can be seen at the engine speed of 2400 rpm, with a value of approximately 5 %. However, as the isobutanol additive volume increased, the formation of CO2 decreased. The lowest CO2  formation can be seen in the region of 15–20 % of isobutanol additives, with a value of approximately 3.8 %. This phenomenon might be due to the enhanced combustion of the fuel samples due to the excess oxygen in the fuel blend attributes of the isobutanol fuel additives. Similar findings were obtained by A.S. El-Shafay et al. [48] , where the author explained that the formation of CO2 was due to the increased oxygen content in the fuel samples, which promotes complete combustion. J.A. Oyebanji et al. [69]  also mentioned that using a suitable catalyst will be a better method to reduce carbon dioxide and indirectly reduce the greenhouse effect and global warming.(8) C O  2   ( % )  = - 0.0391571 + 9.52107 E  - 5   A - 0.00876245 B + 1.11111 E  - 6   A B - 2.49042 E  - 8   A  2  + 0.000343678 B  2        3.3.6 Effect of the isobutanol fuel additives and engine speed towards oxides of nitrogen Fig. 16   (a) and (b) shows the relationship between the linear mathematical model of the engine rpm and isobutanol additives percentage. From Fig. 16 , as the engine speed increases, the NOX  formation decreases. The highest formation of NOX  can be seen in the region of 15–20 % of isobutanol additives at 1200 rpm with the value of approximately 200 ppm. However, the lowest formation of NOX  with a value of approximately 120 ppm can be seen at the same region of 15–20 % at 2400 rpm. For the lower speed rpm of 1200 rpm to 1500 rpm, the NOX  formation was increased as the isobutanol additives percentage increased. However, for higher engine speeds of 1800 rpm to 2400 rpm, the NOX  formation decreases as the percentage of the isobutanol additives percentage decreases. This phenomenon occurs due to the nature of NO X formation itself. The NOX  formation is closely related to the combustion temperature, where the higher the combustion temperature, the higher the NOX  formation [7071] . Therefore, at lower engine speeds, the time taken for the combustion to take place was longer taking into account the stroke cycles that need to be completed. The longer time taken for the combustion combined with the excess oxygen content in the fuel blends with higher isobutanol additives resulting in higher NOX  formation. However, the NOX  formation for the higher engine speed combined with the cooling effect of the isobutanol due to the higher latent heat of vaporisation also reduces the in-cylinder temperature during the combustion process, thus reducing the NOX  formation. Lastly, the relationship between engine speed and isobutanol fuel additives percentage can be seen in Eq. (9) .(9) N O  X   ( p p m )  = 216.831 - 0.0304167 A + 4.90278 B - 0.00270833 A B        3.4 Optimization The desirability function was used to determine the optimal region for the RSM model [68,72] . The value of numerical optimisation using desirability function was from 0 to 1. However, the overall goal is to obtain the overall desirability of the factors and responses of the model. The optimisation criteria were presented in Table 10  . In the Table 10 , the goals, limits, and importance level for each of the parameters are shown. The point prediction for engine performance and exhaust emissions optimisation was shown in Table 11  . The optimal factor setting was shown with red points, while the optimal response prediction was shown with blue points. There was only one best solution obtained using the desirability approach. The maximum overall desirability was found at 0.7 with the input of 10 % isobutanol fuel additive and 90 % POME biodiesel blended fuel at 1868 rpm. The optimum responses for Brake Power, BSFC, BTE, CO, CO2 , and NOX  were 3.31 kW, 192.52 g/kWhr, 42.21 %, 0.02 %, 4.42 %, and 158.47 ppm respectively. Then, the optimum results were compared with the baseline fuel, which is B20 POME biodiesel blended fuel at similar conditions. The summary of the comparison can be seen in Table 12  . It can be observed that the engine performance characteristics and the brake power for the optimised model decreased by approximately 8.56 % compared to the B20. For BSFC and BTE for B90IBU10, the performance was improved by approximately 1.3 % and 0.3 %, respectively, compared to the B20 baseline fuel. Next, the exhaust emissions characteristics were improved by approximately 50 % and 6.8 % for CO and NOX , respectively, compared to the B20 sample. While the emission of CO2, it increases by approximately 2.8 % compared to the B20 fuel sample.  3.5 Validation test result The experiment was done on the engine under specific conditions to validate the optimised data. Three mean actual values were calculated from each of the parameters in Table 13  . The mean value of the experimental engine testing was analysed to ensure the accuracy of the optimised data [73] . The formula for the percentage of absolute error was based on Eq. (10) . In the Table 13 , it was observed that all the parameters obtain a percentage of absolute error of less than 5 %. Therefore, it can be concluded that the optimisation experiment model that was developed was quite accurate for the engine performance characteristics and exhaust emissions characteristics. The percentage of absolute error for brake power, BSFC, and BTE was 1.1 %, 3.0 %, and 1.9 %, respectively. However, the lowest was the CO and CO2 , which was 0 %, while the NOX  was 1.2 %.(10) P e r c e n t a g e o f a b s o l u t e e r r o r %    = Actualvalue - P r e d i c t e d v a l u e  Actualvalue      × 100 %        4 Conclusions The optimisation using RSM and the engine testing was done to analyse the behaviour of the single-cylinder CI engine. The engine behaviour of various fuel samples with isobutanol additives was described in correlation with the fuel properties of the fuel samples. For the RSM optimisation part, The ANOVA indicates that the DOE model was significant with an overall desirability of a factor of 0.7. The RSM optimisation suggests that the optimal engine speed and isobutanol additive percentage should be at 1868 rpm and 20 %, respectively. While for the experimental engine testing and exhaust emission testing,1. The maximum brake power was achieved by the B95IBU5 with an increment of brake power approximately 2.1 % and 4.8 % compared to the Diesel and B20.  2. Lower ratio of isobutanol (5 % and 10 % in volume percentage) B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 shows a comparable result with the Diesel and B20 POME biodiesel blended fuel.  3. The fuel sample B95IBU5, which contains 5 % isobutanol, obtained the lowest BSFC among all fuel samples. The B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 show an improvement of BSFC of approximately 2.3 % and 3.7 % compared to the B20 fuel samples. From the result, fuel samples with a lower ratio of isobutanol, B95IBU5 and B90IBU10, show a consistent lower BSFC compared to the high ratio of isobutanol fuel samples B85IBU15 and B80IBU20.  4. The BTE results for B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 show improvements of 2.3 % and 3.7 % compared to the B20 fuel samples. Among all fuel samples with isobutanol additives, the B95IBU5 and B90IBU10 consistently exhibit higher BTE values than the B85IBU15 and B80IBU20 at all engine speeds.  5. The CO emission of B90IBU10 produces the lowest CO emission at 50 % load. At a high speed of 2400 rpm, the lowest CO emission was obtained by the B90IBU10 with approximately 0.01 % CO emission.  6. The lowest NOx  emission can be observed at 2400 rpm by the B80IBU20 fuel samples with a value of 103 ppm compared to the B20 with a NOx  emission of 136 ppm. The lowest NOx  emissions obtained at 1800 rpm were 167 ppm and 166 ppm for B95IBU5 and B90IBU10, respectively.    In conclusion, the addition of isobutanol to the B20 POME biodiesel will enhance engine performance, exhaust emission, and combustion characteristics. Generally, the lower ratio of isobutanol, 5–10 %, was promising and comparable to the B20 POME biodiesel blended fuel. Indirectly, these results align with the SDG 7 purposes.
