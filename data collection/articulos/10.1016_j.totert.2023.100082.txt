Keywords Gender equality  Gender Pay Disparity  Sustainable Development Goal  Mid-term evaluation   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   Introduction Gender inequality has a substantial impact on the SDGs. Poverty and an absence of access to financial, medical, and educational opportunities affect women more than men, according to a study (Women, 2020b ). According to data, It will require input from the World Economic Forum for an additional 25.7 decades for the gender wage gap to be closed globally at the present pace of progress. (World Economic Forum, 2020 ). Health and happiness may suffer as a result of gender disparity. Anxiety, sadness, and symptoms of trauma-related stress disorder are just a few of the mental and physical health issues that discrimination and violence based on gender can cause, as stated by the World Health Organisation. (WHO, 2019). Furthermore, women are frequently excluded from health-related processes of decision-making, which can result in programs and policies that fail to meet their needs (Women, 2020b ). Less attention is given to just how committed women are to bringing about change, how competent they are in adjusting to the consequences of the changing climate, or the way they address the root causes of risk. (Dankelman and Jansen, 2010; MacGregor 2010; Pérez and Tavits, 2018; Huyer and Partey, 2020 ). Davidson (2016) pointed out that research on gender has mainly concentrated on challenges for women to adapt so far, learning that women are, on average, weaker in all sorts of households and that women tend to lead farming families, which makes their vulnerability to the effects of climate change is greater. Women also contribute to agriculture through forests and fisheries in addition to crops. Additionally, this improves the variety and nutritional value of the diet, not just for poor families but also for all families. Regarding sixty million indigenous people are almost entirely reliant on forests, making up one in six of the world's population, especially when it comes to supplemental food (World Health Organization., 2013 ). On the other side, it has been demonstrated that Gender-responsive policies and activities promote both economic growth and women's empowerment and sustainable development. For instance, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation showed in a study that boosting women's financial access can contribute to both economic growth and the eradication of poverty (IFC, 2014 ). The health of women can be improved, the expense of unpaid care labor reduced, and their economic possibilities increased by investing in gender-responsive infrastructure, which includes sanitation and water supplies (ODI, 2017 ). The SDGs must therefore be implemented to advance sustainable development, and SDG 5, a goal that focuses on achieving gender parity and the equal rights of girls and women, is a key component (Filho et al., 2022 ). This includes addressing gender inequities in labor, education, and economic opportunity as well as promoting participation of women in decision-making and preventing violence and prejudice against women. (Women, 2020b ). This paper's goal is to examine how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda 2030 connect to the gender inequality and how gender-responsive policies could enhance sustainable development. The study's objective is to present actual data from many countries that shows how gender gaps hinder the SDGs' achievement, notably in areas like poverty reduction, education, health, and economic growth. It is also crucial to emphasize SDG 5, which is focused on attaining gender equality and encouraging girls and women, to encourage sustainable growth. This essay also discusses how India and the rest of the globe follow gender-specific indicators the best.  Methodology We hypothesize that industries with a better percentage of girls in employment, coupled with improved health & sanitation, develop extra slowly in nations with gender inequality. This relationship is likely influenced by both significant and extensive employment margin effects, alongside the positive impact of enhanced health and sanitation. In particular, we argue that greater gender equality and improved health & sanitation cause educated women to participate in the labor force at higher rates, creating a broader and more qualified talent pool that employers may choose from when hiring. This, in turn, enhances marginal employee productivity, ultimately driving overall business productivity and growth. Additionally, on a broader scale, increased gender equality and better health & sanitation would allow women to reach their full potential in the job market, thereby propelling them to administrative or powerful positions, which might further spur economic growth.  Results & discussion According to the study, gender inequality poses a substantial barrier to attaining the SDGs, especially in areas like promoting economic growth, decreasing poverty, and improving health and education. Evidence from numerous countries supported this finding. (UNDP, 2021 ). The study also discovered how gender-responsive policies and activities can support the promotion of voting rights for women and gender equality by assisting in the removal of these barriers. The study's final finding was that SDG 5, which aspires to attain gender parity and promote the self-reliance of women and girls, is essential to furthering sustainable development and realizing the SDGs (Table 1 ) .  Case study The case studies that illustrate gender equality initiatives in developing or low-income nations are provided below. (UN Women, 2022).1. Rwanda - Political Gender Parity:  Rwanda's commitment to gender parity has led to women holding 61% of parliament seats, inspiring global progress on SDG 5 (Gender Equality).  2. Bangladesh - Maternal Health:  Bangladesh's investments in healthcare have reduced maternal mortality, aligned with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being).  3. Nepal - Girls' Education:  Nepal's policies prioritize girls' education, reducing gender disparities and supporting SDG 4 (Quality Education)  4. Uganda - Women Entrepreneurs:  Uganda empowers women entrepreneurs through training and finance access, promoting SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)  5. Malawi - Water and Sanitation:  Malawi's GENET program enhances girls' school attendance with gender-sensitive WASH practices, contributing to SDGs 6 and 4  6. Kenya - Ending FGM/C:  Kenya combats FGM/C through grassroots activism and legal measures, aligned with SDG 5 (Gender Equality).  7. India - Digital Literacy:  India's digital literacy program empowers rural women, supporting education, gender equality, and digital inclusion-related SDGs.   These case studies demonstrate several strategies for tackling gender equality and achieving the SDGs in underdeveloped or low-income nations. They emphasize the significance of specialized approaches, community involvement, policy support, and comprehensive initiatives across multiple sectors to make significant advancements toward a more just and sustainable future.    Factors affecting gender equality Gender wage gap Women typically make a little more money than males when doing the same job. Women in the United States only make 82 cents for every dollar made by men, to data from the National Women's Law Centre, with the disparity being considerably greater for women from lower-income backgrounds. (National Women's Law Centre, 2021 ). According to a recent World Economic Forum report, closing the worldwide wage gap for women will require an additional 217 years of advancement. (World Economic Forum, 2021 )    Discrimination Women are often discriminated against in hiring, promotions, and other work-related opportunities. By Pew Research Centre research, 42 percent of women across the nation have encountered workplace gender discrimination, such as being passed up for a job and promotion. (Pew Research Center, 2017 ). Women are often underrepresented in politics, media, and other areas of public life. According to the UN, women make up just 25% of global legislators and 21% of conventional media news items. (United Nations, 2021 ).  Gender-Based violence Women are far more likely to experience gender-based violence than men, which encompasses all forms of assault. According to the Nations, one in every three women in the globe may experience either sexual or physical assault throughout their lifetime, most commonly at the hands of an intimate partner. (United Nations, 2021 ). Unwanted sexual approaches, statements, or behavior that result in a hostile or unpleasant work atmosphere are examples of this. According to research conducted by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, twenty-five percent to eighty-five percent of Women have reported sexual harassment at work. (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2016 ).  Traditional gender roles Traditional gender norms in society can limit women's possibilities and encourage gender inequality. In many societies, for example, women are obligated to prioritize family and caregiving obligations above their jobs, which might limit their possibilities for professional progress. (Budig and England, 2001 ).  Limited access to education In some areas, girls and women are not given the same educational opportunities as boys and men. According to UNESCO, 130 million girls worldwide are still not enrolled in educational institutions, and Women make up about two-thirds of the world's uneducated population.  Child marriage In many countries, girls are compelled to get married at an early age, limiting their opportunities for education and personal development. According to Girls Not Brides, dedicated to ending child marriage, 12 million females marry before the age of 18.  Health disparities Women may face unique health challenges or be denied access to healthcare due to their gender. For example, Women are more prone than males to have reproductive health problems, and in some countries, they may face legal or cultural barriers to accessing contraception or abortion services (World Health Organization, 2021 ).  Gender specific indicators Good Following (Achieving):  India is considered to be in a state of “good following” if it has made substantial and consistent progress toward achieving the specific targets and indicators set for the relevant SDG goal (UN Women, 2020). Positive trends would be evident across key indicators, such as improvements in quality of life, access to services, reduction of disparities, and implementation of effective policies. India's efforts in integrating SDG principles into its national development plans would be notable, leading to visible and sustained improvements in the chosen SDG area. Medium Following (Progressing):  India falls under the category of “medium following” if it has taken steps toward achieving the SDG goal, but there is still work to be done. There might be improvements in certain indicators, but challenges or gaps persist. India's progress may be hindered by factors like resource constraints, complex socio-economic dynamics, or policy implementation gaps. While there may be some positive changes, a continued focus on addressing challenges is required for more significant progress. Bad Following (Challenges Remain):  India is categorized as “bad following” if its progress toward the chosen SDG goal is significantly lacking or regressive (Women, 2020b ). This might be due to persistent challenges, inadequate policies, resource limitations, or systemic issues. Key indicators related to the SDG goal may show little improvement or even deterioration. In this scenario, India would need urgent and comprehensive interventions to address the root causes and drive positive change.  Relation between SDG-5 (Gender Inequality) and other SDG goals No Poverty (SDG 1):  Gender inequality remains a contributing factor to the prevalence of severe poverty, disproportionately affecting women and girls. The number of people living in severe poverty has decreased prior to COVID-19, signaling success in the fight against it. From 11.2% in 2013 to 8.6% in 2018, fewer people are surviving on less than a week's pay. Although the pandemic has halted this trend, it is anticipated that by the end of 2022, approximately 383 million girls and women would still be living in severe poverty. Due to their limited access to chances for employment, healthcare, and education, women and girls are especially affected by poverty. SDG 1 aspires to eliminate poverty in all of its manifestations and dimensions, including severe poverty, by 2030, and equal treatment for men and women is critical to accomplishing this goal. It is critical to achieve gender equality through SDG 5 to eliminate poverty & promote sustainable development (World Bank, 2018 ). Women constitute nearly all of the world's poor and are more inclined than men to live in poverty. Women's poverty is linked to several gender-based injustices, including uneven access to healthcare, employment opportunities, and education, as well as discriminating laws and policies. Gender equality can help to decrease poverty by increasing women's access to resources such as job opportunities, medical care, and education (Women, 2020a ) (Fig. 1  ). Zero Hunger (SDG 2):  The achievement of SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 5 (Gender Equality) is significantly hampered by gender inequality because women are especially impacted by food insecurity and there is a widening gender gap. The agriculture sector is a significant source of employment for women, yet they face discrimination, uneven distribution of resources, and limited opportunities to participate in procedures for deciding decisions (FAO, 2019). To achieve SDG 2, gender inequalities must be addressed, and women empowered in agriculture and food systems to improve productivity and promote sustainable agriculture (UN Women, 2020). SDG 5 is crucial for achieving SDG 2 as gender-based discrimination can limit women's provision of resources and hinder their agricultural participation and food systems, exacerbating food insecurity (FAO, 2019). Addressing gender-based discrimination and empowering women in agriculture and food systems can contribute to increased productivity, improved nutrition, and more sustainable food systems (UN Women, 2020). Women and girls make up almost fifty percent of the agricultural workforce worldwide, but their efficiency and contributions to food security are limited due to unequal access to assets like property, financing, and technology (FAO, 2018). For instance, closing the gender gap in agriculture might raise agricultural output by up to 4% in developing countries and result in a reduction of up to 150 million undernourished people. (FAO, 2011). If women farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa had equal access to resources as males, their yields might rise by 20–30%, possibly rescuing 150 million people from starvation. (FAO, 2011). Engagement of women in farming decision-making can lead to the adoption of farming practices that are more resilient and sustainable, improving both food security and environmental sustainability. 2018 (UN Women). Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3):  SDG 3, which seeks to guarantee a healthy existence and encourage happiness for all ages, can be challenging to achieve because gender-based injustices, including prejudice and assault, can negatively affect the well-being and health of girls and women. Due to a lack of access to healthcare and reproductive health services, as well as an incomplete awareness of reproductive and sexual health issues, girls and women commonly encounter specific health difficulties. The eradication of discrimination and violence based on gender, the expansion of access to reproductive health care, and the empowerment of women and girls to make informed decisions about their physical and mental well-being are all necessary for the achievement of SDGs 3 and 5. Furthermore, greater wellness results for both individuals and their families may be attained through empowering women and girls and providing them with equitable access to healthcare, services related to reproductive health, and other opportunities (Women, 2020b; World Health Organization, 2021 ). Rahman and colleagues' research (2020) indicated that gender inequality can have a negative impact on the physical and mental well-being of women and girls by causing disparities in the accessibility of medical care and facilities connected to reproductive health. It is crucial to address discrimination and violence based on gender, increase access to medical care and reproductive health services, and provide women and girls the freedom to make their own health-related decisions in order to fulfill SDGs 5 and 3. The authors argue that prioritizing gender equality when designing healthcare policies and programs can enhance the health results for women and girls, thereby assisting in the accomplishment of SDG 3. (Rahman et al., 2020). Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6) : Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation), as well as SDG 5 (Gender Equality), are intertwined because gender inequality can restrict the availability of sanitation and clean water amenities, which may have serious repercussions for women and girls' well-being, security, and health. Even though SDG 6 aims to advance access to clean water and sanitation for all people, women and girls face disproportionate disadvantages as a result of unfair laws and procedures, cultural and social customs, and poor infrastructure. Research papers have identified gender disparities that affect women's and girls' well-being, safety, and health by restricting access to sanitary facilities and clean water, as well as the consequences for those groups' safety and well-being. (Branham & Wright, 2018; UNICEF, 2021. Addressing discriminatory policies and practices, investing in infrastructure, and promoting social and cultural change are among the strategies recommended for achieving both goals (UN-Water, 2019). Women and girls' responsibilities for collecting water and managing household sanitation put them at risk of violence and harassment when facilities are far from their homes or are inadequate. To achieve SDG 6, gender inequalities must be addressed, including eliminating discriminatory policies and practices, investing in infrastructure locations where women and girls suffer disproportionately, and promoting social and cultural change. SDG 5 is crucial for achieving SDG 6 as gender-based discrimination could set limits to females’ provision to clean water and sanitation facilities). (Ahmed et al., 2016; Women, 2019b ). Encouraging gender equality can help increase access to sanitary facilities and clean water, in addition to supporting the safety, health, and well-being of women. (UN-Water, 2019). Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) : SDG 7 and SDG 5 are closely related because gender disparities may restrict access to clean, energy-efficient solutions, which may have detrimental effects on women's and girls' well-being, schooling, and economic opportunities. Even though the goal of SDG 7 is to guarantee that everybody has access to reliable, modern, and inexpensive energy, girls and women are particularly impacted by energy insecurity and a lack of accessibility to clean energy alternatives because of discriminatory policies and practices, social and cultural norms, and a lack of investments in renewable energy facilities and technologies in the regions where they are most affected (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2015 ). To achieve SDG 7, gender inequalities must be addressed, including eliminating discriminatory policies and practices, and increasing investment in sustainable energy infrastructure and technologies. locations where women and girls suffer disproportionately, and promoting social and cultural change. SDG 5 is crucial for achieving SDG 7 as gender-based discrimination can set a boundary to women's & girls' access to renewable and clean energy solutions. Promoting gender equality can contribute to improving accessibility to clean and sustainable energy, as well as boosting women's and girls' economic, social, and environmental well-being. (Aina, 2011). Quality Education (SDG 4):  The advantages of teaching young girls have been proven over many years of research. SDG 4 seeks to aim that all individuals have equal accessibility to excellent schooling and to encourage opportunities for continuous education. However, gender inequalities, such as discrimination and cultural biases, can limit the provision of education for girls & women (UIS, 2021). This can lead to significant disparities in educational attainment and achievement between genders, with girls and women often facing more significant challenges in accessing education and completing their studies. Addressing gender inequalities is critical for promoting access to quality education for all. This entails doing away with discriminatory laws and practices, investing more in the education of girls, enhancing the availability of education for those who are marginalized, and tackling cultural and social conventions that restrict girls' and women's access to higher education. (UNFPA, 2017). In summary, achieving SDG 5 is crucial for achieving SDG 4 as gender equality is essential for promoting inclusive and equitable quality education for all. Increasing funding for girls' education, combating gender-based prejudice, and encouraging changes in culture and society can all help to improve the situation for females. Excellent schooling and chances for lifelong learning should be available to everyone (Fig. 2 ) . Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8):  Since gender inequality can limit women's and girls' access to dignified work and economic opportunities, SDG 5 and SDG 8 are strongly related (ILO & UNDP, 2018). SDG 8 seeks to promote full and profitable employment, sustained, inclusive, and equitable growth in the economy, and decent work for everyone. However, discrimination on the basis of a person's gender can prevent women from getting leadership positions, fair pay, and safe working conditions, among other things. Gender equality and the empowerment of all girls and women are the goals of SDG 5 (UNDP, 2015). In order to promote economic growth and development, it is crucial to address gender inequities in the workplace, according to a World Bank Group report from 2019. In the study, it is emphasized how important it is to advance gender equality in terms of access to higher education and training, do away with discriminatory laws and practices, and deal with cultural and social conventions that prevent women from obtaining respectable employment and other economic prospects. The United Nations Entity for Gender Diversity and the Independence of Women (UN Women) (2018) also stresses the importance of giving gender equality a top priority in economic decisions and investments. This includes guaranteeing that women have the same access to economic services and resources, supporting women's entrepreneurship, and eliminating the gender wage gap. According to the International Labour Organization, (2017)  and Undp, (2021) , disparities in gender continue to be a major impediment to decent work and economic growth, particularly in developing countries. This is because of discriminatory regulations, social conventions, and practices that can prevent women from accessing education and training opportunities as well as jobs that offer fair wages, decent working conditions, and possibilities for career advancement. In order to increase access to righteous work and economic possibilities for women and girls, it is important to address gender-based discrimination, advance equal compensation for equal work, provide access to training and education, and encourage social and cultural change (Women, 2018 ). These actions can result in long-term economic growth and development. Overall, research suggests that in order to advance gender equality and increase access to decent jobs and economic possibilities for all (ILO & UNDP, 2018; Women, 2018 ; World Bank Group, 2019), SDG 5 must be realized. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9):  SDGs 9 and 5 have a connection since gender inequality can limit women's and girls' access to infrastructure, creativity, and technological advances, which can be detrimental to their environmental, social, and financial well-being. SDG 9 seeks to support innovation, resilient infrastructure development, and sustainable industrialisation. However, discrimination based on gender in laws and societal customs might prevent women and girls from pursuing careers in the STEM sectors of math, science, technology, and engineering (STEM). In order to provide equitable access to innovations, technology, and infrastructure, SDG 5 works to achieve gender parity and empowering women and girls. Achieving this objective will require eradicating discriminatory laws and practices, encouraging equal access to STEM education and training, and tackling cultural and societal conventions that prevent women and girls from having equal access to innovation and technology. Sustainable development may be facilitated by including more women in technology and inventive sectors. These claims can be supported by pertinent sources and academic studies, such as the UN Women's study on “Turning Promises into Action” (Stoet & Geary, 2018 ). Reduced Inequality (SDG 10):  SDGs 10 and 5 are related because inequality in society and the economy can be made worse by gender disparities, which restrict access to assets and possibilities for women and girls. The economic, social, and political inclusion of all people, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or other variables, is a key component of SDG 10′s goal to eliminate inequality within and between nations. However, discriminatory legislation and societal norms may make it more difficult for women and girls to access jobs, healthcare, and education, which adds to greater social and economic inequities (Leal Filho et al., 2022 ). Due to the importance of gender equality in decreasing larger social and economic disparities and fostering inclusion for everyone, SDG 5 is key to attaining SDG 10 in this context. In order to achieve this, discriminatory laws, practices, and policies must be eliminated. Equal access to work, healthcare, and education must also be encouraged. Achieving these objectives can help to lessen inequality within and between nations, which will benefit women, girls, and the general populace. Numerous sources and academic studies back up these claims (Kapur, 2019 ). For instance, gender-based discrimination can hinder economic development and social cohesion while gender equality can improve output and financial results, according to a 2018 World Bank research. Similar to this, a 2020 research indicated that discrimination based on gender can worsen income disparity while programs that support gender equality can lessen it. This study was originally published in the International Journal of Development Economics. The need of tackling gender inequality in fostering social and economic participation, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, is also highlighted in a 2021 study by UN Women (Cingano, 2014 ) (Figs. 2 and 3)  . Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11):  The Sustainable Development Goals, also known as SDG 11 and 5 must both be achieved for the other to be fully realized. Women's and girls' access to secure and welcoming metropolitan areas and services may be restricted due to gender inequality, which has a detrimental effect on their financial, social, and environmental wellness. SDG 11 aims to create inclusive, secure, robust, and sustainable cities and human settlements. The women's and girls' utilization of secure and welcoming urban environments and services including housing, transit, and public places, however, can be hampered by discriminatory legislation and societal norms. SDG 5 seeks to advance gender equality and provide all women and girls with more influence. Achieving the SDGs requires eradicating gender-based discrimination, boosting the involvement of women and girls in urban development and decision-making, and dealing with cultural and social conventions that restrict their access to urban areas and services. Research has demonstrated that gender disparities can prevent women and girls from accessing safe and welcoming urban areas and services, which can negatively impact their wellbeing. In public places, on public transit, and in housing, women and girls experience discrimination and abuse, according to a UN Women study from 2018. This makes it difficult for them to obtain basic services, engage in social and cultural activities, or take part in economic activities. Gender-based discrimination can prevent women from participating in urban development and decision-making, which leads to policies and plans that are insufficiently responsive to their needs, according to a World Bank report published in 2019. This demonstrates the necessity of raising the involvement of women and girls in urban development and decision-making procedures (Bureau and (NCRB) report on crimes against children under the POCSO Act, 2019 Jayachandran, 2015 ). Responsible Consumption and Production(SDG 12), Climate Action(SDG 13), Life below Water(SDG 14), Life on Land(SDG 15):  The accomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG s 11 as well as 5 are inextricably linked (IPCC, 2021 ), Europe, portions of China, as well as U.S. of America all experienced heatwaves that broke records (NOAA, 2022 ) (Lau et al., 2021 ). Additionally, 18.4 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya are at risk of starvation due to severe droughts resulting from four consecutive seasons without rain, while 7.2 million individuals in northeast Bangladesh were severely affected by flash floods (UN News, 2022 ). Changes in the climate and the decreasing supply of natural resources like forests and oceans disproportionately affect women from marginalized communities (Women, 2019b ). Women are making a significant contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation despite numerous challenges. For instance, in Yap, the Federated States of Micronesia and women function as native plant nursery that yields seeds for food and medicine, plant palm trees in taro patches that have been inundated to prevent coastal flooding, and provide fiber for weaving and home construction. The Barbuda Council as well as Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson developed the first driven community’s ocean zoning schedule in the Caribbean that promotes the profitable, enjoyable, and ecologically sound utilization of ocean resources while maintaining economic, cultural, and conservation uses (Johnson, 2021 ). These programmes are founded on the idea that social justice, as well as environmental protection, must coexist, alongside women as well as their communities actively participating in decisions that have an impact on both their daily lives and the natural world (Women, 2020b; Women, 2020a ). Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions(SDG 16):  SDG 16 and SDG 5 are connected because gender inequalities may make it harder for girls and women to utilize the legal system as well as engage in making choices, which has a significant impact on their well-being. In order to ensure that everyone has access to justice and to develop inclusive and responsible institutions at all levels, SDG 16 aims to advance inclusive and peaceful societies. However, gender disparities, such as anti-woman legislation and societal customs, can obstruct women's pursuit of justice and prevent them from taking part in decision-making processes, particularly those in politics and government organizations (Un, 2021a ). SDG 5 seeks to promote the empowerment of all girls and women to achieve gender equality. For everyone to have equitable access to rights and processes for making decisions, gender inequities must be addressed. This includes doing away with discriminatory laws and practices, increasing the participation of women in government and political affairs, and promoting equal access to the legal system and counsel (UN, 2021b ). As a result, fulfilling SDG 5 is critical to reaching SDG 16. We can build societies that are secure and welcoming with to account and welcoming organisations at all levels that are beneficial to women and girls as well as the broader population by addressing discrimination based on gender, promoting equal access to fairness and legal representation, and increasing women's participation in governance and public institutions (Un, 2021a,b ) (Fig. 4 ) . Partnerships to achieve the goals (SDG 17):  SDG 17′s emphasis on partnerships for sustainable development and SDG 5′s objective of increasing gender equality are related objectives. The attainment of the SDGs may be hampered by gender disparities that restrict women's access to assets and decision-making processes. SDG 17 encourages cooperation between governments, civil society, the commercial sector, and other stakeholders with the goal of strengthening international partnerships for sustainable development. However, discriminatory legislation and societal norms can limit women's access to resources which includes education, healthcare, and money as well as their involvement in decision-making processes. Since gender equality is critical for advancing the cause of sustainable development and accomplishing the SDGs, fulfilling SDG 5 is essential for reaching SDG 17. As part of this, equal utilization of assets and decision-making processes is encouraged. Discriminatory laws and practices are also eliminated, and women and girls are encouraged to participate in all spheres of society. We can create effective collaborations and partnerships for sustainable growth that benefit not only women and girls but the larger population as well by addressing discrimination based on gender, promoting equal access to materials and encouraging the involvement of women and girls (UN, 2021b; UNDP, 2021 ).  Gender equality in developing & developed nations According to UN Women and the UNDP, gender equality is an unalienable human right that cuts across national borders. For both emerging and wealthy nations, achieving this aim has significant ramifications. The Sustainable Development Goals, also known as the SDGs, in underdeveloped nations can only be achieved by establishing gender equality. Societies flourish where girls and women are given the same chances for education, healthcare, employment, and leadership positions. By removing obstacles based on gender, these countries unleash the potential of 50% of their people, promoting economic growth, social advancement, and a better future for all. In developed countries, the journey towards gender equality is just as important. While these nations often boast higher levels of overall development, persistent gender disparities continue to hinder progress. Advancing gender equality is not just a moral obligation but a strategic imperative for fostering innovation, creativity, and productivity (Walter Leal Filho, 2021 ). By embracing gender diversity in workplaces, leadership positions, and all aspects of society, developed countries can tap into a wealth of diverse perspectives and talents, driving sustainable growth and inclusive prosperity. The pursuit of gender equality is intricately linked to the global effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (Walter Leal Filho, 2021 ). From ending poverty to ensuring quality education, from promoting good health to achieving economic growth, gender equality is a linchpin that strengthens each of these goals. When women and girls are empowered, families are healthier, communities are more resilient, and societies become more just and equitable. Recognizing that gender equality is more than just an issue of fairness will help us build a more progressive, innovative, and harmonious society (Walter Leal Filho, 2021 ). We make substantial progress towards building a future in which everyone, regardless of gender, has the chance to prosper by appreciating and advancing gender equality in both developing and developed nations. Together, we can create a society that upholds the values of inclusion, respect, and dignity for all people, regardless of gender.   Targets • End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.     In order to advance gender equality and ensure that women and girls are fully included in all aspects of society, it is imperative that this goal be met. Prejudice towards girls and women was a widespread issue that affects the entire world and restricts their possibilities and options. 90% of nations, according to a UN Women report, has a minimum of one legal restriction on women's ability to participate in the economy. Additionally, the gender wage gap is still very large for women, with a global estimate of 16 percent for women (World Economic Forum, 2021 ). Their access to healthcare and education is further hampered by prejudice against girls and women. Girls and women are far less inclined than compared to boys to obtain healthcare facilities and attend education, respectively, in many nations. (World Health Organization (WHO), 2019 ).• Eliminate all forms of violence, including trafficking, sexual exploitation, and other forms of exploitation, towards all women and girls in both public and private settings.     The pervasive and international issue of attacks on women and girls seriously jeopardizes their physical and mental health and constitutional rights. World Health Organisation research (World Health Organization., 2013 ) indicates that one in three women worldwide are victims of sexual or physical assault. Especially when it comes to forced labour and trafficking in people, girls and women are especially more susceptible to exploitation. The International Labour Organisation, also known as the ILO, estimates that 25 million people are victims of forced labour globally, with women and girls making up 71% of these victims (International Labour Organization, 2017 ).• Eliminate all harmful practices, including female genital mutilation and child, early, and forced marriage.     A harmful practice that violates the rights and respect of women and girls is female genital mutilation, which also includes child marriage, marriage before 18, forced marriage, and early marriage. These practices have detrimental psychological, social, and physical effects. According to UNICEF research, 650 million women got hitched as young girls are now living. Domestic abuse is more likely to occur and school dropouts and early pregnancies are more common among girls who married as children. Female genital mutilation is a widespread activity, with an estimated 200 million women and children undergoing the operation (UNICEF, 2018a; UNICEF, 2018b ).• Recognise and reward unpaid care and household labor by offering public services, assisting facilities and social protection programs, and encouraging shared accountability within the home and family in accordance with national standards.     Establishing gender parity and promoting women and girls depends on acknowledging and appreciating the contributions made by women in unpaid childcare and household work. Unpaid caregiving is frequently the responsibility of women and girls, which restricts their access to political, economic, and educational opportunities. Women and girls worldwide perform unpaid care work for 12.5 billion hours daily, by a report by Oxfam (Oxfam, 2020 ). Policies that provide public facilities and services that enable caring work, in addition to protectionist measures that acknowledge the contributions of carers, are required to solve this issue.• Ensure that women have equal chances for responsibility at all levels of economic, political, and public decision-making, as well as full and effective involvement.     To achieve gender equality and advance sustainable development, it is crucial to support women's leadership and decision-making. Only 22 nations have female heads of state or administration, and only 23% of legislative seats worldwide are held by women (Women, 2019b ). Women are underrepresented on business boards of directors and in executive roles. According to research, businesses and organizations can benefit from having more women in positions of decision-making (Catalyst, 2020 ).• Ensure that everyone has access to sexual including reproductive health care and reproductive rights, as outlined in the Beijing Declaration of Principles for Action, the UN Conference on  the Population and Development's Programme of Action, and the final reports from those conferences' reviews.     To advance gender parity and empower women and girls, it is essential to ensure that everyone has a right to health services related to sexuality and reproductive rights. In poor nations, roughly 214 million women who desire to prevent pregnancy do not use modern contraceptives, according to a Guttmacher Institute report (Guttmacher Institute, 2021 ). Women's ability to manage their ovulation and make decisions about how they spend their time is hampered by their inability to get reproductive healthcare.• Implement changes to national legislation to ensure that women have equal access to economic assets, as well as control and ownership over land and other types of assets, financial services, heirlooms, and natural resources.     Providing everyone with access to reproductive and sexual health services is essential for advancing gender equality and the status of women and girls. A Guttmacher Institute estimate states that more than 214 million women in poor nations who desire to avoid pregnancy do not use modern contraception (Guttmacher Institute, 2021 ). The lack of access to reproductive healthcare makes it difficult for women to control their fertility and make preferences about how to spend their time.• Promote the empowerment of women through making better use of enabling technology, particularly information and communications technology.     Promoting women's equitable access to and use of technology is essential for achieving gender equality and advancing the rights of women and girls. In the world, there is a 17% gender disparity in Internet usage, with 58% of men and 41% of women using it, according to research by the International Telecommunications Union (International Telecommunication Union, 2020 ). Lack of digital access for women may restrict their access to social networks, employment possibilities, and education.• Adopt and reinforce sensible laws and policies that will promote gender equality and provide all women and girls the opportunity to succeed at all levels.     For gender parity to be achieved and for women and girls to be empowered, there must be strong legislation and regulations that address the root causes of prejudice against them. Only 79 nations have policies that address sexual harassment at work, according to a UN Women's research, while 75% of nations have rules that discriminate against women. To guarantee all women and girls get the same opportunity for schooling, medical care, financial possibilities, and political involvement, strong laws and regulations are required (Fig. 5  ).  Conclusion SDG 5 and other SDGs are impacted by gender inequality because it prevents women and girls from accessing opportunities and resources that are essential to their overall well-being and slows down the achievement of sustainable development goals. For instance, gender inequality may make it more difficult for people to access political engagement (SDG 16), healthcare (SDG 3), work opportunities (SDG 8), and education (SDG 4). All of these are crucial for reaching the sustainable development goals. Achieving SDG 5 and other SDGs will depend on addressing discrimination based on gender and ensuring equitable utilization of resources and opportunities, such as medical care, job opportunities, and political engagement. Additionally, SDG 16, which strives to advance equitable, peaceful, and inclusive societies, can be impacted by gender inequality. Progress towards reaching this aim might be hampered by discriminatory legislation and social practises that restrict women's and girls' access to legal services and participation in decision-making We can create societies that are secure and welcoming with effective, transparent, and welcoming organisations on all levels that are beneficial to everyone by advancing gender equality and raising the representation of women in public institutions. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development acknowledges the significance of women's rights and gender equality in accomplishing the goals of sustainable development. Although gender equality is a distinct goal (SDG 5), it is crucial to consider gender in all initiatives to enhance sustainable development and fight climate change. SDG 5 on gender parity tackles a range of important issues for women, including putting an end to assault on women and girls, eliminating any kind of discrimination, and recognizing domestic labor and unpaid caregiving. To effectively strive towards gender parity, it is crucial to include gender in all sustainable development initiatives and integrate gender into the SDGs. Finally, establishing equal opportunities for women and men is not only a goal in and of itself, but also a way to advance all-around sustainable development. To make sure that the SDGs are implemented with a focus on promoting equality between men and women to ensure the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development works for everyone, it is the duty of every national & local government, and also individuals.
