                  Even when water scarcity and quality issues are not severe in the European Union (EU) countries, the impacts of climate change and external pressures vary across EU nations, leading to different outcomes. Achieving sustainability requires prioritizing the efficient management of water resources and sanitation services. To this end, conducting studies to identify countries needing appropriate measures is essential. This research focuses on evaluating and analysing the situation of water resources and sanitation systems in the European Union, with two specific objectives in mind. The first objective is to compare disparities between Member States (MSs) in a particular year and track their progress over two periods of five and ten years concerning variables related to water resources and sanitation services. By examining these disparities, the study aims to identify which countries have made significant improvements and which require more attention and resources to enhance their water management and sanitation systems. The second objective is to identify the countries best positioned to achieve certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6, SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 8, SDG 10, SDG 11, SDG 12).
                  The results indicate that the countries best positioned in terms of meeting the SDGs and achieving sustainability in water and sanitation are Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. However, in contrast, Romania, Lithuania, and Slovakia face greater challenges, particularly in sanitation. Factors such as economic level and climate change, which impact southern countries more severely (Greece, Spain, Cyprus) where water scarcity is more acute, contribute to these difficulties. Additionally, the lack of information on wastewater management hinders decision-making and the proper management of these wastes.
                  This study analyses the progress and current status of water and sanitation indicators from an environmental perspective for the first time. It introduces variables to assess sustainability in EU countries that are not listed as indicators on the United Nations website, aiming to evaluate compliance with the SDGs.

Handling editor: Lixiao Zhang Even when water scarcity and quality issues are not severe in the European Union (EU) countries, the impacts of climate change and external pressures vary across EU nations, leading to different outcomes. Achieving sustainability requires prioritizing the efficient management of water resources and sanitation services. To this end, conducting studies to identify countries needing appropriate measures is essential. This research focuses on evaluating and analysing the situation of water resources and sanitation systems in the European Union, with two specific objectives in mind. The first objective is to compare disparities between Member States (MSs) in a particular year and track their progress over two periods of five and ten years concerning variables related to water resources and sanitation services. By examining these disparities, the study aims to identify which countries have made significant improvements and which require more attention and resources to enhance their water management and sanitation systems. The second objective is to identify the countries best positioned to achieve certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6, SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 8, SDG 10, SDG 11, SDG 12). The results indicate that the countries best positioned in terms of meeting the SDGs and achieving sustainability in water and sanitation are Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. However, in contrast, Romania, Lithuania, and Slovakia face greater challenges, particularly in sanitation. Factors such as economic level and climate change, which impact southern countries more severely (Greece, Spain, Cyprus) where water scarcity is more acute, contribute to these difficulties. Additionally, the lack of information on wastewater management hinders decision-making and the proper management of these wastes. This study analyses the progress and current status of water and sanitation indicators from an environmental perspective for the first time. It introduces variables to assess sustainability in EU countries that are not listed as indicators on the United Nations website, aiming to evaluate compliance with the SDGs.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Water resources  Sanitation system  Wastewater generation  Sustainable hydric resources  SDGs  Sustainability   Data availability The data used in this research have been obtained from Eurostat database   1 Introduction Actions such as meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are necessary to meet the world's future sustainability needs in cities (Regona et al., 2024 ). Three essential elements are required: economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection (UN, 2023 ). This is what the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets aim to accomplish. Monitoring water implications in sustainability is crucial to do so, including the digitalization transition, which is so important nowadays (Monks et al., 2021 ). To monitor their progress, 232 specific indicators were designed, which can be measured through the data collected by official entities. Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, official United Nations initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (Sachs et al., 2023 ) have been implemented. Aligned with these trends, Bertelsmann Business Group publishes an annual report with the collaboration of hundreds of public and private bodies, in which it carries out a thorough analysis of the degree of implementation of the SDGs in at least 80% of the countries included in the 2030 Agenda that have a population of over a million inhabitants (Sachs et al., 2016 ). The overall calculation of achievement of the goals is determined by the SDG Index (Sachs et al., 2023 ), using a scale ranging from 0 to 100 (0 is the worst level, and 100 means the full attainment of the goals). In this ranking, Finland (86.8), Sweden (86.0), and Denmark (85.7) occupy the leading positions. The top 20 countries on the SDG Index are all in Europe, and most of them are European Union (EU) Member States (MSs). Still significant challenges are missing, especially those related to climate, biodiversity, sustainable diets, and food systems. In recent years, several studies have been conducted to assess progress toward achieving the 17 SDGs (Firoiu et al., 2022 ; Ricciolini et al., 2022 ). These studies provide valuable information that may help identify implementation challenges and recognize priorities for action. Various approaches have been employed, ranging from the use of composite indicators (Rocchi et al., 2022 ; Delli Paoli and Addeo, 2019 ), dynamic indicators for each SDG (Firoiu et al., 2022 ), quantitative analysis based on a hypothetico-deductive model (Hurduzeu et al., 2022 ), the application of different ARIMA methodologies (Firoiu et al., 2022 ) or even a hybrid multiple-criteria decision-making approach (Stanujkic et al., 2020 ). However, all research on the assessment of the current state of SDG implementation faces a common constraint related to the availability and accuracy of the data provided. Some authors (Piwowarski et al., 2018 ; Delli Paoli and Adeo, 2020; Ricciolini et al., 2022 ) have noted the availability of data for certain indicators published by Eurostat is too limited, and in some cases, it is absent for specific countries, which hinders thorough examination. It is worth noting that although there is substantial literature on indicators, most studies rely on those proposed by the United Nations. At the global level, the availability of water has decreased more and more due to the lack of rainfall and its erratic pattern on the spatial and temporal scales, and also due to the severe pressures on water resources (demographic, economic, social causes, environmental degradation, climate change, among others) (Yannopoulos et al., 2019 ). Water demand is expected to increase in all production sectors (WWAP, 2012 ). Water is considered an input to economic activities, including agricultural production, energy generation, health services, and industrial manufacturing, and plays a vital role in environmental ecosystems (rivers, and wetlands, among others). The sustainability of communities depends directly and indirectly on water quantity (e.g., shortage), quality (e.g., pollution), reliability, and affordability (Rezaee et al., 2021 ; de Castro et al., 2023 ). In addition, water system decisions can create social challenges, but social behaviours may change the status of water systems (Sivapalan et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, integrated studies considering water and sustainability are needed to understand the importance of the issue (Bilalova et al., 2023 ). A crucial action that helps to combat the water crisis is to promote the advancement of scientific technologies that treat and reuse water (Dixit et al., 2022 ), mainly grey water (i.e., washing machines, dishwashers, showers, sinks, among others) (Hernández-López et al., 2022 ). In developed countries, the average production of grey water is around 60–200 L per person per day, so reusing this type of water could potentially result in water savings of between 50% and 80% (Noutsopoulos et al., 2018 ). Effective water resource management requires action across all community economic and social sectors (Di Baldassarre et al., 2019 ). An example of sustainable water management could be strategies similar to zero discharge to reuse the water from tourist cities to agriculture (Pérez-Sánchez et al., 2024 ). In Europe, the distribution of water consumption varies significantly between different sectors. Southern Europe has a higher demand for water in agriculture, while industry consumes a lower portion (Vanneuville et al., 2012 ; Lavrnić et al., 2017 ). Conversely, in Northern Europe, the situation is the opposite, with industry being the main consumer of water (Werner, 2012 ). In addition to a different distribution, there are different patterns of water consumption among EU countries (Zikos, 2010 ). In Southern Europe, where water is scarce, competition for this valuable resource is divided between agriculture, tourism, and domestic users, whereas in Western Europe, industries such as navigation and recreation also compete for water resources in terms of quantity and quality (Zikos and Hagedorn, 2017 ). Furthermore, it is crucial to find indicators related to sustainability in order to be able to compare actions from several countries and improvements (ZamanZad-Ghavidel et al., 2021 ; Jam et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, efforts have been made in some countries, such as the initiative in Portugal to analyse water use sustainability at the municipal level (Costa Freitas et al., 2022 ). However, a comprehensive analysis across the entire European Union is necessary to assess the overall situation, taking into account all the relevant SDGs related to water and other factors. Nevertheless, as it is said by Ricciolini et al. (2022) , there is a tendency to give priority to social and development indicators and to pay less attention to environmental ones due to it is so difficult to acquire environmental data. In fact, many authors, such as Stanujkic et al. (2020)  and Rocchi et al. (2022) , only use 1 or 2 indicators to assess compliance with environment-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) like SDG6, SDG13, SDG14, and SDG15. Furthermore, they often do not include any indicators in the environmental dimension that specifically address the quantity and availability of water resources. The SDG6 is frequently categorized under the Services Dimension , and the indicators used to evaluate it focus on the well-being of the population. This research aims to assess the sustainability of the European Union's water resources and sanitation systems. As a novelty, the manuscript compares differences between MSs in a given year, and a methodology is presented to monitor the progress over two periods of five and ten years concerning water resource variables and sanitation services. Furthermore, this research establishes which countries are best placed to meet certain SDGs, placing them in a position of greater sustainability. It could be noted that although there is substantial literature on the SDGs status in Europe, there is a lack of studies, such as the present study, that examines the progress and the status of hydric and sanitation indicators from an environmental point of view for the first time. This research utilizes variables to assess the sustainability status of EU countries that are not proposed as indicators on the United Nations website for determining SDG compliance. Authors such as García et al. (2023)  have demonstrated that other indicators can also be used to evaluate the achievement of different SDG objectives. The variables used in this research are closely related to SDG 6, as well as to other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (provision of essential services to people), SDG 2 (water consumption for food production), SDG 8 (water consumption for economic growth), SDG 10 (reduction of inequalities), SDG 11 (promotion of sustainable communities), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption of resources and waste generation).  2 The data and methods The method followed to carry out this work is divided into three phases, (Fig. 1  ). In the first phase, a dataset is created by downloading data from Eurostat (2023) . The data is sorted into three Dimensions  based on the type of information obtained: water resources, social services and wastewater generated and treated. The second phase involves the determination of a) the status of each EU MS, establishing a ranking of the 27 countries according to the worst (status 0) and best (status 100) position for sustainable use of water resources, sanitation, and waste generation related to the wastewater generated in different economic and social activities (0–100); and b) the progress in each of the three Dimensions  over two time periods of five years (short period) and ten years (long period), determining whether progress in the desired direction for sustainable use is made in each period. Lastly, the study data is connected with the SDG targets. This connection facilitates the identification of Member States well-positioned to achieve SDG 6 and other associated SDGs. The process involves evaluating specific variables or Dimensions  relevant to the SDG being considered and then jointly analysing the position and progress of each of the 27 countries concerning these variables. Finally, countries are ranked based on their status and progress in achieving the SDG, using a classification system similar to that described in the EU Publications office (2023) . 2.1 Data source A set of variables was chosen to evaluate the sustainability of water resources and sanitation systems (Table 1  ). These variables considered the volume of renewable hydric resources, the volume of resources abstracted, the population served, and the waste generated by water consumption and usage. Data from Eurostat (2023)  for two time periods of five years (2014–2019) and ten years (2009–2019) for the 27 MSs were used. Most of the variables examined lacked data for the years 2020–2022, precluding the use of more recent data. However, in some data collections, certain countries either do not provide data or have an incomplete time series. As a result, the variables under study had to be confined to a shorter period and/or the number of countries limited. The data collection is divided into three Dimensions  for study: Resources  (availability and abstraction), Social Services  (water services for the population), and Wastewater  (generation of waste related to water). The first Dimension  considers variables related to the amount of water abstracted (volume of superficial and groundwater) for specific uses (public supply, agriculture-forestry-fishing, and industrial manufacturing) (Abstrac_urban supply; Abstrac_Agric-Forest-Fishing; Abstrac_Manufact-indust ) and the renewable resources available (Renew-Resources ). It represents the total freshwater withdrawn each year (m3 /inhabitant) of renewable water available in a country at a given moment. Furthermore, the Water Exploitation Index (WEI+ ), used as an indicator for water scarcity, drought, and resource sustainability, was also downloaded from Eurostat. The second Dimension  corresponds to the social services data, which are the population connected to public water supply, urban wastewater collecting systems, wastewater treatment plants, and wastewater treatment (independent and other), at least secondary treatment (Pop_connect_ supply; Pop_connect_ WWcollect; Pob_connect_ WWTP; Pop_connect_2ndary ). The third Dimension  corresponds to the variables of waste generated during water use and the subsequent treatment required to restore its quality. The data used are the volume of wastewater generated in different activities and services, such as wastewater generated in urban areas (WW_Urban ); in domestic sources (WW_domestic ); in agriculture-forestry-fishing activities (WW_agricul-forest-fish ); in manufacturing industries (WW_indust ); the total inflow of urban wastewater treated in wastewater treatment plants (Urban_WWTP ); the ratio of urban wastewater treated/urban wastewater generated (Urban_WW_treat/gen ); and lastly, sewage sludge generated by wastewater treatment (Sludge_production ). It is important to highlight a lack of data available in Eurostat's records for these variables. Only seven of the 27 MS countries have provided data for all the variables used in this third Dimension . Data on an additional variable — Gross Domestic Product per capita — have also been downloaded. These data are needed to assess the contribution of the economic growth of each country to water variables involved in economic activities.  2.2 Methodology to establish the status and progress The study examined the status of specific variables for each country in the year 2019. The analysis looked at the changes in these variables over two-time frames: five years (2014–2019) and ten years (2009–2019), similar to the Eurostat method to evaluate the achievement and progress of SDGs, as outlined in the EU Publications office (2023) . This process includes the following steps.a) Status score at the Variables and Dimension  level.    First, scores for each variable studied in a year must be calculated using Eq. (1a)  and Eq. (1b) . The country's status score is calculated by comparing it to the range of values from the worst to the best-performing country, excluding outliers. The calculation is based on normalising indicator values using a min-max method.(Eq 1a) X i c   = x i c   − min i  ( x i c   )   max i  ( x i c   )  − min i  ( x i c   )        (Eq 1b) X i c   = max i  ( x i c   )  − x i c    max i  ( x i c   )  − min i  ( x i c   )     i      Where X ic    is the normalised value of variable x ic   , i  is the indicator, c  is the country, and max i    and min i    are the maximum and minimum values of the variable across all MSs for the select year of available data. Equation (1a)  is used when higher variable values are better, while equation (1b)  is used when lower values are better (e.g., for Renewable Resources, Eq. (1a) , and for Water Abstraction, Eq. (1b) ). Finally, the score values of the variables studied in the three Dimensions  are aggregated using the arithmetic mean for each country, with the resulting values ranging from 0 to 100. Then, the score of each Dimension  is compared to the average EU aggregate status score of the same Dimension . This comparison shows the percentage by which a country's status is either above or below the EU average.b) Progress of aggregate score to short-term (five years) and long-term (ten years) at the Variables and Dimension  level.    The progress of a variable is based on the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) formula (Eq. (2) ), which assesses the pace and direction of a variable trend.(Eq. 2) C A G R = ( Y t  Y t 0    )  1 t − t 0     − 1     Where t 0   = initial year, t  = last year, y t0   = variable value in initial year, y t   = variable value in last year. The CAGR formula uses the variable value from the first and the last year of the analysed period and is employed to calculate the average annual rate of change of the variable value (in %) between these two data points. This formula is applied to all variables, regardless of their units, and the results provided are a percentage change per year, which can be compared between different periods (Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020 ). When evaluating these results, it is important to consider the desired direction for a variable to achieve sustainability, determining whether the value of the variable should increase or decrease. Then the value is inserted into a scoring function (Fig. 2  ) to calculate a score ranging from +5 (best score) to −5 (worst score). Finally, to calculate the score for each Dimension , the arithmetic means of the individual scores forming the Dimension  is obtained (EU Publications Office, 2023 ).c) The joint assessment of status and progress. \    The results are evaluated together to assess the status and progress for a selected year (2019) and the previous five and ten years (2014–2019 and 2009–2019) (Fig. 3  ). Depending on the location of the countries on the graph of Fig. 3 , it is possible to determine whether they are above or below the EU average and whether the progress is positive or negative. This can help understand whether the countries are moving towards a sustainable situation and thus may be useful to evaluate the achievement of some specific SDG targets (SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 6, SDG 8, SDG 10, SDG 11, SDG 12).d) Evaluation of compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)    Using the previously described methodology to assess the status and progress of various Variables and Dimensions , individually and collectively, according to the SDG considered, it is possible to determine whether countries are advancing towards sustainability and the extent of their compliance with the SDGs. Table 2   indicates the dimensions  and variables used to evaluate the compliance of each SDG. For example, the joint assessment of the status and progress (in the short and long term) of the three dimensions allows us to determine the level of compliance with SDG 6 and whether this progress is moving towards a sustainable situation. In the case of SDG 2 and SDG 8, the evaluation is conducted using one and two joint variables, respectively.   3 Results 3.1 Water resources dimension The Water Resources Dimension  jointly assesses the amount of water extracted for different uses, identifying which countries are best positioned for sustainable water resources. Using the methodology explained, a score for each MS is calculated. Additionally, the progress of these variables is analysed to establish a ranking of values (Fig. 2 ). In Table 3  , the first column shows the average score of all the variables considered in this Dimension . The second column displays each country's score in relation to the average EU score. The last two columns show the progress of the Water Resources Dimension  over five and ten years. Based on the results, Luxembourg, Finland, Croatia, Sweden, and Lithuania are the best positioned countries in terms of water resources. These countries scored over 80 and have a status ≥40% of the EU average. They are at the top regarding renewable resources, while their water extractions for industry and agriculture hold high and intermediate positions. They also occupy intermediate positions in extractions for public supply. With the considered data, the worst countries ranked and a status well below the EU average are Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Spain, Bulgaria, Poland, France, Malta, and Czechia. This is due to the lower availability of renewable resources and high withdrawals of water for agriculture, particularly in the case of Greece and Cyprus. After analysing the progress of Water Resources over five and ten years (as shown in Fig. 4  a and b), the following observations can be made.i) Countries such as Finland (progress score long term = 2.40 and short term = 2.46), Denmark (1.53 and 1.91), and Spain (3.0 and 2.23) made adequate progress towards sustainable water resource management in both the short and long terms. Denmark made more rapid progress in the short term, while Spain's progress slowed in the last five years.  ii) Countries including Poland (−2.20 and −2.16), Greece (−3.70 and −3.68), Latvia (−3.80 and −3.29), and Ireland (−4.63 and −4.90) did not show any progress in either the short or long term.  iii) Countries such as Slovakia (−2.30 and −3.06) and Croatia (−0.93 and −2.66) showed negative progress over both periods, and their situations worsened in the last five years.  iv) Some countries showed a change in progress from negative to positive scores or vice versa between the two periods. These countries include Belgium (0.63 and −3.0), Bulgaria (1.72 and −2.20), the Netherlands (0.60 and −1.79), Cyprus (−1.27 and 2.32), Malta (−0.42 and 3.49), and Luxembourg (−1.34 and 2.17).    There is no correlation between a country's ranking in water resource management, scored from 0 to 100, and its progress in achieving sustainability goals scored from 0 to +5. This correlation is only observed in Finland and Denmark. Furthermore, Greece has a score of 0 and a negative rate of progress over both the long and short periods, with the lowest values recorded.  3.2 Social-Services dimension The Social Services Dimension  evaluates the availability of water resources and sanitation services. The ranking is based on the percentage of the population with access to these services. Countries with the highest population rate receiving these services are awarded a score of 100, while those with the lowest receive a score of 0. The results of this evaluation are displayed in Table 4  . The top six countries are the Netherlands (score 99.6), Malta (99.2), Luxembourg (98.8), Austria (97.0), Germany (96.6), and Denmark (92.8), placed at 34%–45% above the EU average. On the other hand, Slovakia, Ireland, Latvia, Croatia, and Lithuania are the bottom countries in the ranking, with scores ranging from 38 to 49 and a status that is 29%–44% below the EU average. Romania scored the lowest (score of 5.0), indicating that only 50%–55% of the population has access to the evaluated services. This score is 92.8% below the EU average. In most cases, countries with a higher status score in the Social Services Dimension  exhibited a lower rate of progress towards desired goals, with similar progress values in both the short- and long-term periods (Fig. 5  ). This pattern is observed in Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden, with scores of ≥90, and the progress rates remained similar in both periods (less than 1). Spain presented a different scenario, with a high score of 81.2 and a long-term negative progress rate. However, there was a positive trend in the last five years, resulting in a significant increase in the score in 2019. The countries at the bottom of the ranking, such as Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Hungary, made the most progress in both periods despite having a status below the EU average. The difference between these countries and those that rank higher is that the latter already has a value of or close to 100%, indicating that almost the entire population has access to the services evaluated in this Dimension . In contrast, countries with lower rankings have higher percentages of their population without access to these services and, thus, have more room for improvement.  3.3 Wastewater dimension Table 5   and Fig. 6   (Fig. 6 a and b) present the results of the assessment for the Wastewater Dimension.  This evaluation considers variables such as the volumes of wastewater produced, the volumes treated, and the quantities of waste generated during the water treatment process. Among the countries evaluated, Croatia achieved the highest score of 78.0 in the Wastewater Dimension , which is 29.7% higher than the EU average. The following countries are Slovenia, Poland, Malta and France, with score values ranging from 70 to 77, with values between 15% and 26% above the European average. On the contrary, there are 12 countries whose score values range from 32 to 61.5, namely Estonia, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Spain, Romania, Denmark, Hungary, Germany, Czechia, Latvia, Austria, and Lithuania, all of which have scores below the European average. The last two countries are 30.3% and 46.7% below the European average, respectively. In terms of reducing wastewater generation, increasing the volume of treated wastewater, and minimizing waste in water treatment, some countries made progress in both periods. These countries include Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Spain, Slovakia and Malta. It was observed that there is an inverse relationship between a country's position in the EU ranking and its progress rates in the desired direction. This inverse relationship implies that countries with higher scores tend to have lower rates of progress like Slovenia. Additionally, it was noted that progress slows down over five years in comparison with the progress made over ten years.  3.4 Status of water resources and sanitation in EU Member States: compliance with the sustainable development goals (SDG) The three Dimensions  have a significant relationship with SDG 6 and are also connected to other SDGs such as SDG11. Therefore, by evaluating these Dimensions  jointly (Table 6  ), it is possible to determine which countries are closest to meeting SDG 6 and SDG 11. The link between SDG 6 and water resources is direct because it connects the availability of water resources with the services provided to the population. The countries with the highest values in these resources and services that maintain and improve their actions over time can be classified as being closer to sustainable communities, which results in greater achievement of SDG 11. Finland, Luxembourg, Sweden, Belgium, Malta, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany are the countries that are most likely to achieve SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). These countries scored between 70 and 85.2 (Table 6 ), positioning them above the average of the EU, with percentages ranging from 8.7% to 32.1%. Some countries achieved high scores, due to their performance in the variables related to renewable resources, such as Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. These countries are in the northern part of Europe and benefit from their favourable geographical location and climatic conditions, which provide them with abundant water resources. However, Belgium and Malta are exceptions to this geographical trend, as they rank high due to their exceptional scores in water extraction per inhabitant for various activities such as agriculture, industry, and water supply to the population. In the case of Malta, however, the low per capita water abstraction can be attributed to the limited availability of renewable resources (Lavrnić et al., 2017 ). At the bottom of the ranking are Romania, Greece, and Lithuania, with score values between 31.9 and 50.6. The percentages of these countries fall below the European average, ranging from 20% to 50%. Each country belongs to a different subregion — Central, Eastern, Southern, Western, and Northern Europe, respectively. Therefore, their inferior position cannot be attributed to geographical and/or climatic causes, as is the case with the best-ranked countries. The main reason for these results could be that the countries at the bottom of the list are relatively new EU members. They may not have fully adapted to EU regulations and, therefore, may not have properly implemented the SDGs yet. The assessment of the Social-Services Dimension  helps to determine the status of countries with regard to compliance with SDG 1 since it evaluates services that the population receives, in this case, related to water and sanitation. In addition, possible inequalities among the EU population regarding access to these services will also affect the fulfilment of SDG 11. As mentioned in section 3.2  (Table 4 ), the best and worst-ranked countries in this dimension either meet or fail to comply with SDG 1 and SDG 10. The Abstract-Agric-forest-Fishing variable included in the Resources Dimension  is assessed to study how the variables contribute to compliance with SDG 2. The countries with the best position, which therefore contribute to the achievement of SDG 2, are Luxembourg, Slovenia, Estonia, Czechia, Belgium, Slovakia, Germany, Croatia, Sweden, and the Netherlands; and the worst-ranked are Cyprus, Greece, and Spain. The latter three had a score of 0. Water variables are considered in relation to economic activities to assess the contribution to the countries’ economic growth, as referred to in SDG 8. In this context, water extractions for agricultural activity (Abstrac_Agric-Forest-Fishing), and water extractions for industrial use (Abstrac_Manufact-indust) are analysed (Table 7  ). These variables in the Resources Dimension  were evaluated from an ecological point of view, considering that sustainability is achieved with fewer resource extractions without taking into account whether this leads to lower or greater economic productivity. Therefore, it is impossible to observe a direct relationship between the best use of these variables and economic growth. In order to do so, a new variable was incorporated that indicates economic growth, Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP per capita) (data not shown). In the joint evaluation of sustainable water withdrawals for agricultural and industrial activities in relation to economic growth (Table 7 ), it was generally observed that countries ranked highest in economic growth had made water withdrawals in a sustainable manner (Luxembourg, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium). In contrast, those at the lower end of the ranking had done so less sustainably (Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Estonia, Slovakia, Greece). Consequently, the countries in the first group were classified positively for their contribution to sustainable economic growth, while the second group was classified negatively (indicated by a red label in Fig. 7  ) concerning the fulfilment of SDG 8. The exploitation and use of water resources entail the generation of waste, so it is necessary, as indicated in SDG 12, to use resources responsibly to generate the least amount of wastewater. The evaluation of the variables (Wastewater Dimension) provides information on the contribution of hydric resources to achieving SDG 12. The top-ranked countries in this dimension, as mentioned in section 3.3  (Table 5 ), show greater compliance with SDG 12. In contrast, the lower-ranked countries would need to implement improvements in wastewater treatment and management to achieve better performance regarding this SDG. The best and worst status of countries regarding the SDGs, as well as the direction of their progress, are shown in Fig. 7 . In this figure, the colours of the boxes indicate the status (worse, improved, best, and no data) of each country concerning the SDG in question. The arrows indicate the progress towards the SDGs (Significant, Moderate, No Progress, Moderate Movement Away from SD, and Significant Movement Away from SD) over both time periods studied (Long and Short).   4 Discussion The countries forming the European Union differ in many aspects due to geographical location, climatology, major socio-economic activities, etc. These differences make the EU a heterogeneous group that faces water and sanitation problems differently; therefore, the environmental and social variables considered (water abstraction, population connected to sanitation services, generation and treatment of wastewater, etc.) have distinct implications. Based on the results obtained in the Water Resources Dimension,  within the EU countries, Nordic ones (Finland, Sweden, Denmark) are the most advanced. These countries are ranked first in all studies by other authors (Ricciolini et al., 2022 ; Rocchi et al., 2022 ), despite the different methodologies and indicators they use to assess some or all of the SDGs. These Nordic countries have populations that are more concerned about climate change. This information is based on the Eurobarometer (2023)  survey results. In contrast, countries like Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria, etc., which rank lower in the classification for sustainable use of water resources, have populations that are less environmentally concerned, according to the same Eurobarometer (2023)  survey. In addition to environmental concerns, another factor that may influence the ranking of countries in terms of sustainability is their membership in the European Union. Northern and Western European countries, such as Sweden, Denmark, Finland, France, and Germany, have been part of the EU for a long time. According to Stanujkic et al. (2020) , this long history under EU regulations has allowed them to work for a longer period on implementing positive practices aimed at achieving sustainability. Climate change is significantly impacting water resources in the European Union, particularly in countries with limited renewable resources. Mediterranean countries such as Cyprus, Malta, and Greece are classified as water-stressed systems according to the WEI + index data studied. These countries are experiencing the effects of climate change, combined with the overexploitation of their water resources, which has led to a decline in water storage volume and a deterioration in water quality due to contamination (Sofroniou and Bishop, 2014 ; Sapiano, 2020 ). On the contrary, the Nordic countries are less affected by climate change. However, they are not immune to the potential changes. In Finland, (with a very high level of water security due to its favourable natural conditions), authors such as Veijalainen et al. (2019)  have conducted studies to estimate the impact of possible changes in hydrological regimes produced by droughts based on data from a reference drought occurring in 1939–1942. As a result, fields related to energy security and food security would be affected, even in a country with abundant water. The poor results obtained by countries in the Mediterranean region, such as Greece, Spain, Italy, and Croatia, regarding the Water Resources Dimension , may be due to high water withdrawals caused by urban water consumption. These countries are known to have high pressure from tourism (Giulietti et al., 2018 ), and urban water consumption is often attributed to the resident population (census) rather than the actual population, including tourists. The economic sector with the highest water consumption differs from country to country. The assessment of the data on water withdrawals for agricultural uses classifies Cyprus, Greece, and Spain as the largest consumers with the worst ratings. These results agree with the indications presented in the EEA (2018)  article. Although the EEA (2018)  article places the largest water consumers for the manufacturing industry in northern Europe, the results of the present research show these countries to be in different areas of Europe, such as Greece, Estonia, France, and Slovakia. People's access to water-related public services is not of concern to the developed countries that make up the EU from a general point of view. According to the European Commission (2021) , there are no particular affordability concerns for lower-income households in almost all MSs. However, in studies by authors such as Gurotova et al. (2018)  and Martins et al. (2023) , at each country's level and even within each country by region, inequalities in access to water in households are detected. The results obtained in the present study indicate that the countries that lead the ranking in terms of the population's access to water and sanitation services (the Netherlands, Malta, Luxembourg, Denmark) are those with a high economic level, with Malta being the only country with a low GDP per capita that has a good position in the ranking of services. This situation in Malta may be attributed to its promotion of low water consumption, lower tariffs for low-income households, and free access to sanitation for all residents. (Baptista and Marlier, 2020 ; Martins et al., 2023 ). According to the results depicted in Fig. 7 , the worst-placed countries in the ranking of water and sanitation services are mainly located in Central and Eastern Europe (Slovakia, Ireland, Latvia, Croatia, Lithuania, Romania). These results are consistent with those obtained in the work of Gurotova et al. (2018) , which pointed out affordability problems in Eastern European countries. In the case of Ireland, its poor performance may be due to the lack of Eurostat data, especially for households with access to public water supplies. Authors such as Clinch and Pender (2019)  highlighted the difficulty in financing drinking water and wastewater services due to the problems in establishing a water-use charging system. In the group of worst-placed countries, Romania stands out far from the rest, since the state of development of the country's water and sanitation services sector is among the poorest in Europe. The main weaknesses in Romania, especially in rural areas, are inadequate water treatment, poor sewerage networks, and poor access to centralised water and wastewater systems (Frone and Frone, 2021 ). Despite the dire results in Romania, its prospects are fairly positive due to European funding. However, many targets need to be addressed and met to increase access to water and sanitation services in rural Romania (Frone and Frone, 2019 ). In terms of the implications for future practices, the depicted results encourage managers to invest in actions for resilience, monitoring, and adaptation to climate change. This will reduce water consumption while increasing the energy efficiency and the position of countries in challenges for water and sanitation. In the Social Services Dimension, the results also ordered the considered countries. In general, actions focused on protecting public health by requiring better levels of water supply quality and sanitation are required, to provide safe and sustainable services. This should be done by professionalization in the service and by the use of public finances and social policies, differentiating geopolitical zones for these investments. These indicators could be very helpful for managers to take such decisions and to prioritize actions within the different European regions. In the Wastewater Dimension , it was not possible to reliably determine the countries in the best and worst situation concerning the quantities of wastewater generated and treated in EU countries, mainly due to the lack of data published in Eurostat. For example, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark are countries that lead the global calculation of the achievement of the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2023 ). Nevertheless, the first two countries do not provide data on the variables considered in this study, and the third only presents data on wastewater generation but not on treated wastewater. Thus, the lack of information means it is not possible to determine whether wastewater management is being carried out correctly from a sustainability point of view. Although they are not official indicators, the variables studied in this work contribute to evaluating the achievement of some SDGs, especially SDG 6. Therefore, a good assessment of these variables provides information on which countries are better positioned for water sustainability, and studying these variables can also assess positive effects on other SDGs. The results obtained in this research — in relating the variables studied with SDGs 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12 — show that two countries, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, appear in the best positions in almost all the SDGs considered. Conversely, Romania, Slovakia, and Lithuania are the countries that should do more to improve their situations. In view of this, it could be said that countries with lower economic status are further away from achieving the SDGs, which would indicate that the contributions of SDGs to global sustainable success differ according to a country's income (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). By focusing on SDG 6, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, and Malta are classified as being in the "best position" in terms of water and sanitation variables, according to the findings of this study. However, according to the 2023 Sustainable Development Report (Sachs et al., 2023 ), none of these countries have fully achieved SDG 6. In fact, that report evaluated 193 countries, and only two— Monaco and Andorra—have met SDG 6. In the report of Sachs et al. (2023) , only 5 out of the 11 indicators set by the United Nations for SDG 6 were assessed, and the countries that meet this goal do so with just 3 indicators related to services provided to the population. As data for the other two indicators are unavailable. For this reason, we consider that the assessment of SDG 6 in our study is stronger, as it evaluates 16 variables covering three key aspects: water resource extraction and availability, services received by the population, and wastewater generated and treated. In general, fighting antimicrobial resistance, monitoring sanitation indicators and optimizing the drainage systems have many important implications for the sustainability policies. Furthermore, wastewater and sustainable urban systems for drainage can provide valuable resources and economic opportunities, especially in urban areas and places where water is scarce.  5 Conclusions This study provides valuable insights into the sustainability of hydric resources in EU countries. The results were obtained through a comprehensive analysis of variables related to the extraction and use of water resources and the sanitation services provided to the population. These findings present a ranking of the 27 MS best positioned in terms of sustainable use of hydric resources and, consequently, better prepared to achieve SDG 6 and other related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The main conclusions obtained are as follows.1. Relationship Between Water Resources and the Achievement of the SDGs : Water resources and sanitation services play a crucial role in advancing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDGs 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, and 12. Luxembourg and the Netherlands consistently rank among the top performers across nearly all the SDGs examined. In contrast, Romania, Slovakia, and Lithuania must make more significant efforts to improve their standings. Focusing on SDG 6, the study identifies Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, and Malta as having the "best situation" regarding water and sanitation variables.  2. Economic Disparities and Environmental Impact : There is an economic disparity among EU countries that impacts their environmental actions. High-income countries tend to demonstrate greater environmental concern, which is reflected in more sustainable water resource management, as seen in Luxembourg, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, and Belgium. In contrast, countries with lower economic levels, such as Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Estonia, Slovakia, and Greece, tend to be less sustainable in managing their water resources.  3. Geographical and Climatic Factors : In addition to economic level, a country's geographical location and climate influence the availability and use of water resources. Climate change has exacerbated water problems, particularly in Southern European countries (Spain, Greece, Cyprus), where renewable resources have decreased.  4. Challenges in Sanitation Services : Overall, water supply and sanitation services in developed EU countries do not pose significant challenges. However, in certain countries like Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, and Croatia, there is a need for improvements in sanitation and wastewater treatment, as not all residents have access to these essential services.  5. Lack of Data on Wastewater : There is a notable lack of data on wastewater generation, treatment, and disposal in most EU countries. This lack of information hinders decision-making processes aimed at minimizing and treating such waste, underscoring the need to improve data management at all levels to advance the achievement of the SDGs.
