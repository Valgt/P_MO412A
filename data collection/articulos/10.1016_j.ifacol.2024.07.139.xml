                  Our paper explores exemplary educational practices in engineering education from Ireland and Austria, focusing on their contributions to fostering sustainability mindsets among students. By examining initiatives such as miniXplore at the Technical Museum Vienna and educational programs at TU Wien, as well as Green Schools initiatives in both countries, we demonstrate how early education plays a crucial role in shaping engineers committed to addressing global challenges. Through these case studies, we illustrate the intersection of technology, culture and international stability, offering insights into how engineering education can advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

INTRODUCTION  In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and  global challenges, the role of engineering education has taken  on profound significance (Elfert and Ydensen, 2023),  particularly concerning its impact on international stability.  Our paper, titled 'Innovations and Challenges in Engineering  Education for the Future: Contributing to the UN Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs),' addresses this pivotal theme  within the context of the 22nd IFAC Conference on  Technology, Culture and International Stability (TECIS). By  exploring innovative approaches to engineering education in  Ireland and Austria, we aim to demonstrate how early  education fosters a mindset prioritizing sustainability, thus  contributing to the broader discourse on technology, culture,  and international stability.   Engineering is often regarded as a driving force behind  innovation and progress. It holds immense potential to  contribute to the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) (FEANI WG SDG, 2021). These  goals encompass a wide range of critical issues, from clean  energy and infrastructure development to quality education  and reduced inequalities, all with the ultimate aim of creating  a more sustainable and equitable world for present and future  generations. However, the path to achieving these ambitious  objectives requires a fundamental shift in the way we educate  our future engineers and problem solvers.  Recognizing that education plays a central role in shaping the  values, knowledge and skills of individuals, it is essential to  foster a culture of sustainability and responsibility from the  earliest stages of learning (Federico, 2003). The educational  journey towards engineering excellence and sustainability  must begin early, extending from Kindergarten through the  entire spectrum of schooling. By doing so, we lay the  groundwork for a generation of engineers who not only  possess the technical proficiency required for their field but  also embrace a profound commitment to sustainability, ethics  and the welfare of all.  This paper explores the innovative approaches to engineering  education adopted by institutions in Ireland and Austria,  highlighting the transformative potential of early education in  fostering a mindset that prioritizes sustainability. By offering  insights into exemplary educational practices in both  countries, we aim to demonstrate the importance of integrating  sustainability principles into engineering education at various  levels.

Our paper, titled 'Innovations and Challenges in Engineering  Education for the Future: Contributing to the UN Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs),' addresses this pivotal theme  within the context of the 22nd IFAC Conference on  Technology, Culture and International Stability (TECIS). By  exploring innovative approaches to engineering education in  Ireland and Austria, we aim to demonstrate how early  education fosters a mindset prioritizing sustainability, thus  contributing to the broader discourse on technology, culture,  and international stability.   Engineering is often regarded as a driving force behind  innovation and progress. It holds immense potential to  contribute to the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) (FEANI WG SDG, 2021). These  goals encompass a wide range of critical issues, from clean  energy and infrastructure development to quality education  and reduced inequalities, all with the ultimate aim of creating  a more sustainable and equitable world for present and future  generations. However, the path to achieving these ambitious  objectives requires a fundamental shift in the way we educate  our future engineers and problem solvers.  Recognizing that education plays a central role in shaping the  values, knowledge and skills of individuals, it is essential to  foster a culture of sustainability and responsibility from the  earliest stages of learning (Federico, 2003). The educational  journey towards engineering excellence and sustainability  must begin early, extending from Kindergarten through the  entire spectrum of schooling. By doing so, we lay the  groundwork for a generation of engineers who not only  possess the technical proficiency required for their field but  also embrace a profound commitment to sustainability, ethics  and the welfare of all.

Furthermore,  we will explore the broader implications of such educational  innovations, emphasizing their alignment with the overarching  objectives of the UN SDGs.  2. BEST PRACTICE EXAMPLE I: MINIXPLORE @  TECHNICAL MUSEUM VIENNA, AUSTRIA  The "miniXplore" activity, offered at the Technical Museum  Vienna is an example for early engineering education designed  to make STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and  mathematics) engaging and accessible for children aged three  and above (Technical Museum Vienna, 2021). This interactive  exhibition, launched on March 26, 2021, focuses on fostering  playful exploration, emphasizing that there are no "right" or  "wrong" approaches to learning. It encourages children and  accompanying adults to embark on a journey through STEM  subjects without fear of failure while having fun and  excitement. With a sprawling 500 mÂ² adventure playground  featuring multiple stations, miniXplore stimulates the joy of  experimentation, promoting communication, cooperation,  creativity, and problem-solving skills.  Sustainability is an integral part of the miniXplore experience,  extending beyond just teaching STEM concepts. Natural  materials like birchwood, sheep's wool, Swiss pine wood  shavings, cherry stones and buckwheat chaff are thoughtfully  incorporated into the exhibition's design, alongside recycled  plastics and environmentally certified furniture. This approach  demonstrates a commitment to sustainability in early  education, teaching children not only about science and  technology but also about the importance of environmentally  responsible choices. Regional businesses were prioritized in  the selection of external partners, aligning with sustainability  principles and promoting local economic growth. Overall,  miniXplore stands as a remarkable example of how  engineering education can blend learning, fun, and  sustainability to inspire young minds and nurture a generation  of eco-conscious engineers.   3. BEST PRACTICE EXAMPLE II: PROGRAMS AND  EVENTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG WOMEN AT  TU WIEN  Women's active participation and empowerment in STEM  (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields  (Chowdhury et al, 2022) is essential for achieving the UN  Sustainable Development Goals, as it promotes innovation,  economic growth and gender equality, ultimately contributing  to a more sustainable and equitable world.   TU Wien, also known as Technische UniversitÃ¤t Wien, is  Austria's largest institution for natural sciences and technology  research and education. It is part of the Austrian Universities  of Technology consortium, along with TU Graz and MU  Leoben, with over 42,000 students and a significant research  and financial presence.  TU Wien offers a wide range of STEM initiatives aimed at  supporting individuals interested in pursuing careers in  technology and natural sciences. These initiatives are designed  to help students, newcomers and researchers discover the  opportunities in these fields. The university provides various  information formats, available centrally, through faculties,  institutes and student associations, allowing everyone to  explore the options at Austria's largest university in technology  and natural sciences. These activities run throughout the year  and cater to individuals, school classes and special events for  young women. Personalized counseling sessions are also  available to address specific questions. Additionally, the TU  Wien has established the Network FU[TU]RE.experts and  offers resources through the Gender Competence Department,  Equal Treatment Working Group and TU Kids &amp; Care Office  to support staff members in science communication.  For children and young women, the TU Wien offers several  specialized programs and events. These include FIT-Infotage  and FIT Botschafterinnen (Women Only, FIT stands for  Frauen in die Technik, which means women into technology),  BeStÂ³ (the major career and study information fair in Austria),  Wiener TÃ¶chtertag (Viennese day for daughters, Girls Only),  Girls Day Mini (for small kids, four-six years old, Girls Only),  techNIKE-Workshops (Women Only), Hannspeter Winter- Preis (Women Only), and Young Science-Ambassadors from  the TU Wien. These programs aim to engage and inspire young  girls and women to pursue careers in STEM fields by  providing them with exposure to various aspects of technology  and natural sciences. The university's commitment to  promoting diversity and inclusivity is evident through these  initiatives, which encourage girls and women to explore  opportunities in traditionally male-dominated fields.   One specific example shall be highlighted in more detail here:  The Transformer Project at TU Wien. In line with the focal  themes of climate, future and technology, the project  "Transformer" has commenced at TU Wien, in collaboration  with the Climate and Energy Fund and the Austrian Research  Promotion Agency (FFG). This initiative utilizes an empty  space in the city as a platform for creative exploration and  learning, with a particular emphasis on engaging children and  adolescents in hands-on research and education related to the  topic of climate change. The new innovative and creative  learning space that is emerging in an old 17th-century  orphanage with approximately 900 square meters of usable  space is being developed collaboratively with scientists from  TU Wien to generate solutions related to climate change,  climate adaptation and the circular economy. The  "Transformer" project involves researchers and staff from six  different faculties at TU Wien. The initiative aims to engage  children, youth, educators, families and the wider community  in addressing these critical issues and encouraging creative  solutions.  The project's core team consists of four members, along with  nine representatives from the six participating faculties, each  contributing unique knowledge and expertise. The project  involves repurposing the old building to create spaces for  experimentation, learning and interdisciplinary collaboration,  with a focus on ecological building materials, recycling and  136 Ille C. Gebeshuber  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 134â€“138 sustainability. The ultimate goal is to empower children and  youth to take action and make a positive impact on the  environment and their future. The project's implementation  spans three years (starting in 2023) with an emphasis on active  participation and practical learning experiences aiming to  transform knowledge into tangible solutions and inspiring a  sense of optimism for the future.  This initiative has gained substantial support from various  partners, including BIG (Austriaâ€™s federal real estate  company), who provided the project with the necessary  facilities. The project's broad goals include raising awareness,  fostering sustainability, and encouraging concrete actions  towards a more sustainable future, all while providing a safe  and engaging space for children and youth to explore,  experiment, and develop their skills.  4.

It links positive  environmental impact with the core school curriculum. It aims  to push the learning beyond the classroom by developing  responsible attitudes and commitment, both at home and in the  wider community.  Green-Schools has the ambitious aim of promoting long-term,  whole school, positive actions to improve the local  environment. To ensure that this programme is a success it is  student-led but has engagement and involvement from the  wider community.  Green-Schoolsâ€™ mission is to protect planet Earth, our shared  home, and this means everyone must play a part in this  challenging project. Participants from all backgrounds,  cultures, races and ethnicities, religions and belief systems,  abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities are part of  the global team. Equity, diversity and social justice are  fundamental to the Green-Schoolâ€™s value system.  The core themes of the programme are:  Litter and Waste, focusing on litter and waste issues by  encouraging a sense of responsibility for all.  Energy looking at the steps that can be taken at school level to  reduce energy consumption and raise awareness of climate  change.  Water, developing awareness around water conservation as  well as how to effectively manage this important resource in  schools.  Travel, increasing the number of students walking, cycling,  scooting, using public transport or carpooling to school can  have a very positive effect.  Biodiversity, looking at increasing the awareness in schools of  the importance of native plants, animals and habitats.  In addition, Global Citizenship in the following areas are  considered: Litter &amp; Waste, Energy, Marine Environment,  Travel and Biodiversity.  In order to enhance the activities in schools, Green-Schools  offers many free resources to Teachers on their website. It also  has a calendar of events that the students and staff can take part  in, including clinics to ensure that the participant get the  maximum from each initiative. Newsletters and competitions  keep the community informed and motived.   4.3 The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schoolâ€™s  initiatives  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) interacts  with the Irish educational communities, from preschool to  primary and post primary, providing workshops to bring  energy and sustainability into the classroom in a fun,  interactive way. These energy workshops are for both teachers  and pupils at primary and post-primary levels. SEAI have also  Early Childhood Ireland to bring the â€œGuzzlerâ€� energy  programme to pre-school children. Here pre-school children  develop an understanding about energy and sustainability, and  the values built when they are young children will stay with  them for the rest of their lives and, ultimately, they are more  likely to be empowered citizens in the future (SEAI.IE, 2024).  5. IRISH EDUCATIONAL POLICIES FOR  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  Ireland has taken a very active interest in building  sustainability into Irish education at all levels. The Irish  Government, through the Department of Education in 2014,  launched â€˜Education for Sustainability.â€™ The National Strategy  on Education for Sustainable Development in Ireland states its  main objective is to â€œensure that (Irish) education contributes  to sustainable development by equipping learners with the  relevant knowledge (the â€˜whatâ€™), the key dispositions and   Ille C.

Here pre-school children  develop an understanding about energy and sustainability, and  the values built when they are young children will stay with  them for the rest of their lives and, ultimately, they are more  likely to be empowered citizens in the future (SEAI.IE, 2024).  5. IRISH EDUCATIONAL POLICIES FOR  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  Ireland has taken a very active interest in building  sustainability into Irish education at all levels. The Irish  Government, through the Department of Education in 2014,  launched â€˜Education for Sustainability.â€™ The National Strategy  on Education for Sustainable Development in Ireland states its  main objective is to â€œensure that (Irish) education contributes  to sustainable development by equipping learners with the  relevant knowledge (the â€˜whatâ€™), the key dispositions and  skills (the â€˜howâ€™) and the values (the â€˜whyâ€™) that will motivate  and empower them throughout their lives to become informed  active citizens who take action for a more sustainable future.  (GOV.IE, 2014).  The Irish government facilitates this in practice by organizing  an annual national forum on Education for Sustainable  Development, the most recent taking place on December 1st,  2023. (GOV.IE, 2024)   This forum discussed in depth the following topics:  â€¢ Progress on ESD to 2030   â€¢ Transforming Learning  â€¢ Partnerships for ESD  â€¢ Sustainable and Inclusive Learning Environments  â€¢ Creative thinking for Climate Action and  Sustainability    The priority action areas pinpointed were; transforming policy  in Ireland, transforming the Irish learning environments,  building the capacity of educators, empowering and  mobilizing youth and accelerating local actions. Updates on  each of these actions were described in detail and the following  plan was proposed for building capacity of the Irish Educators:   â€¢ National Forum â€“ Strategic Alignment of Teaching and  Learning (SATLE) - funding with ESD actions  (transforminglearning.ie, 2024).  â€¢ National Technological University Transformation for  Recovery and Resilience national project (NTUTORR) project  â€“ Sustainability focus (NTUTOR, 2024)  â€¢ Mapping of ESD Continuous Professional Development  (CPD) for teachers  â€¢ Inclusion of sustainability as criteria for teacher summer  courses   â€¢ Peer Learning Activities â€“ Learning for Sustainability  â€¢ SDSN Ireland launched, Feb 2023 â€“ UCC and Queens  (sdsnireland.org, 2024).  Actions at a policy level will mean that all stakeholders will be  actively involved in change making throughout the Irish  education system.  6. NTUTORR  Engineers and scientists play a critical role in the use of global  resources and need to be educated with the tools to make a  positive difference. Engineering education at third level is  greatly enhanced by the use of the NTUTORR tools in the  classroom.  NTUTORR is described as an innovative collaboration across  the technological higher education sectors in Ireland to  transform the student experience through technology and staff- student collaboration, in alignment with the UN sustainable  development goals. (NTUTOR, 2024).   It is composed of seven third level technological universities  and is funded by the European Union initiative  NextGenerationEU.  (NextGenerationEU, 2024) NTUTORR  has five themes and these themes are streamed into three areas:  Student Empowerment, Staff Capabilities and Digital  Ecosystem.   The first theme addressed is Digital Transformation, and here  transformation in the local educational partners is enabled by  implementing digital ecosystems which support teaching,  learning and assessment. The second theme is Universal  Design for Learning. This focuses on improving the student  experience by promoting more flexibility in the methods used  in teaching and assessing the work. The third theme is  Education for Sustainability. The objective here is to develop  a culture of change across the sector by the integration of the  UN Sustainable Development Goals in the delivery of the  overall project. The fourth theme is Academic Integrity. This  looks at equipping our academic staff and students with the  appropriate tools to ensure â€œhonesty, trust and fairness in  teaching, learning and assessment in the context of rapid  technological advancements.â€� The fifth theme is Equality,  Diversity and Inclusion. This focuses on establishing an  inclusive, safe, equitable and respectful culture across the  technological higher education sector. Finally, the sixth theme  is Employability. This area is concerned by the enabling our  students to be successful after graduation and throughout their  working lives.   The themes are transformed into streams, one of which is  student empowerment stream, which changes the learners  experience in a positive manner. In order to do this nine work  packages (WP) are made available, and an example of one is  WP 1.3: The Academy for Sustainability, Leadership &amp;  Employability. In essence, this provides opportunities for  students to develop skills and literacy in sustainability and  global citizenship, digital identity and transformation, EDI and  mental health and well-being. It is flexible, accessible and self- directed learning pathways for students to earn a "digital  backpack" of credentials.  7. CONCLUSIONS  In conclusion, our paper underscores the transformative  potential of early engineering education in fostering  sustainability mindsets among students, thus contributing to  the broader discourse on technology, culture and international  stability. By highlighting best practices from Ireland and  Austria, we provide insights into how educational initiatives  can shape future engineers committed to addressing global  challenges. Our findings not only enrich the literature on  engineering education but also offer practical implications for  advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals and  promoting international stability. We believe that our research  aligns with the objectives of the TECIS conference, and we  look forward to further discussions on this vital topic.  In an increasingly complex world, where the pursuit of  sustainability and global well-being stands as a paramount  objective, reimagining engineering education becomes  imperative. The transformative power of education in shaping  the engineers of tomorrow, who will drive innovation and  address the world's most pressing challenges, cannot be  overstated. This paper seeks to shed light on the vital role that  138 Ille C. Gebeshuber  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 134â€“138 early education plays in realizing a sustainable future and how  nations like Ireland and Austria are at the forefront of this  transformative journey. Through their innovative practices,  these nations may serve as best practice examples for others,  showing potential paths toward a more sustainable and  prosperous world for all.   It is acknowledged and recognized in this paper that positive  influence starts at the preschool stage, and the value systems  can be enhanced and encouraged throughout the educational  journey. Governments can play a pivotal role by providing a  sustainable strategy in education as well as practical guidance  and fanatical support in the classroom. Connecting SDG to  everyday life and empowering students to make a positive  difference throughout their education in a holistic way, as part  of their community, will naturally facilitate them in their quest  to make a positive difference and become Global responsible  leaders of the future.
