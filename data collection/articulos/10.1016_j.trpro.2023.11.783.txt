A recent approach aims at decreasing  parking space for private cars in cities as a travel demand management strategy that reduces congestion, pollution, and  fosters both active and mass transportation modes. For instance, Paris is removing up to half of its street parking by  2025. Amsterdam is removing 10.000 parking spots in the city centre. Stockholm is implementing a plan for dynamic  curb parking spaces.   However, this approach cannot be implemented directly to freight and service vehicles as the demand and mode  choice for these commercial vehicles have a completely different nature. This fact motivates the study of curbside  policies, particularly for freight and private parking, and how a proper management and fluent dialogue among  stakeholders can minimise adverse impacts on sustainability. Research on this topic is called to reflect on how to  transform curbside conflicting conditions into more sustainable systems with innovative and creative solutions that  make the most of the benefits of having dynamic, flexible-use, and self-adjusting spaces. This paper studies the  different approaches documented in the literature for managing curbside for freight operations and summarizes their  impacts on the SDG metrics. Specifically, this paper aims at understanding the link between the implementation of  freight curbside management practices and the SDG metrics associated with urban sustainability, i.e., SDG11 â€“  Sustainable cities and communities.    2. Background  In 1987, the Brundtland report launched one of the first definitions of sustainable development (SD) that remains  relevant, stating that SD â€œ(â€¦) meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations  to meet their own needsâ€� (WCED, 1987). This definition pointed out at three fundamental components to achieve SD:  economic growth, social equality, and environmental protection. Aiming at addressing this definition in citiesâ€™  contexts, several researchers and practitioners have called the attention to focus on the study and solutions for the  challenges cities are facing nowadays regarding the quality of life, the local economy, transport and traffic  management, environment, and interaction with government offices (Papachristou & Rosas-Casals, 2018; WÄ™ziak- BiaÅ‚owolska, 2016).  Unifying those challenges in a more strategic perspective, the United Nations included cities in the seventeen  Sustainable Development Goals, focusing interventions on public space, mobility, health, energy, economic growth,  infrastructure, and productivity (United Nations, 2017). For instance, the SDG11 â€“ Sustainable cities and communities,  promotes policies and actions that leverage universal access to safe, inclusive, and green public spaces.   SDG11 guides policymakers in coping with one of the most critical cities' sustainability issues, i.e., public space  use. In essence, it measures the effectiveness of managing competing demands for public space for uses that deal with  human needs of social interaction, mobility, access to supplies, activation, and a healthy environment. Aiming at  linking public space management to SDG, Emanuel et al. (2020) have paraphrased the SD definition by inviting public  space policies to move towards a fair allocation of urban space whereby â€œone person's mobility does not come at the  expense of another's mobility in the present or future generationsâ€�.  Cities worldwide are moving in that direction. Nowadays, mobility plans have a clear focus on more space for  human interactions, promoting active and mass transportation modes, reducing congestion and pollution levels.  However, they tend to overlook the distinct nature of demand and mode choice of freight deliveries compared to  private cars (Malik et al., 2017). For example, commercial establishments are part of streets' activation strategies, but  little attention has been paid to their demand for freight parking curbside space (Al-Turjman & Malekloo, 2019).  Similarly, home deliveries are part of consumption trends that the pandemic has accelerated and that nowadays require  special attention in terms of fair access (Sanchez-Diaz et al., 2021) and parking infrastructure to avoid curbside  conflicts in neighbourhoods (MacÃ¡rio, 2021). Ignoring freight transport activities in policies and urban plans leads to  improper conditions for people and businessesâ€™ provision of goods and services, resulting in congestion, pollution, and  productivity loss issues. In the specific case of freight parking operations, limited space for parking and its misuse,  e.g., double-parking or search for parking, is one of the main roots of citiesâ€™ unsustainability (Mingardo et al., 2015).   Juan Pablo Castrellon  et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 72 (2023) 2581â€“2588 2583 Juan Pablo Castrellon et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2022) 000â€“000  3  2.1. Unsustainable impacts of freight parking   Freight transportation represents 20 to 30% of the total traffic in cities, yet it accounts for up to 60% of transport- related CO2 and PM emissions (Dablanc, 2007). The time a freight vehicle is parked represents more than 40% of the  time it spends in a city (Sanchez-Diaz et al., 2020), and in some contexts, it is up to 80% (Fransoo et al., 2022).  Cruising (search for parking) or double parking are the most common practices under scarcity scenarios of freight  curbside allocation, with high negative impacts on urban sustainability. Besides environmental emissions,  unsustainable effects of poor conditions for freight parking operations are also economic losses, congestion, noise, and  intimidation of public space users due to vehicle size and safety risks. The authors summarized findings from several  research publications that quantified the unsustainable effects of freight parking operations as follows:   - Social impacts: The lack of parking spaces conduces to cruising practices and sometimes the illegal use of the  public space such as double parking or parking in banned zones. Both practices lead to traffic congestion, which  negatively affects citizensâ€™ stress and, in general, city liveability. For instance, Kawamura et al. (2014) found that  double parking is the third most important cause of nonrecurrent traffic congestion after construction projects and  crashes. Shoup (2011) estimated that cruising for parking accounted for more than 30% of downtown traffic. Lopez et  al. (2016) found that cruising for parking occurs in 70 â€“ 80% of the last-mile deliveries in European cities. Seemingly,  Roca-Riu et al. (2017) affirmed that illegal double parking occurred in up to 50% of the freight movements. The social  implications of these impacts are evident in traffic delays and their associated consequences on citizensâ€™ health. In the  case of the United States, illegal freight parking generates 476 million vehicle hours of delay each year (Wenneman  et al., 2015). In Paris, the daily loss due to double parking accounted for 2.777 hours (Beziat, 2015). For the case of  Athens (Greece), Kladeftiras & Antoniou (2013) concluded that eliminating double parking could reduce traffic delays  by up to 33%. Besides delays, noise is another negative consequence of high traffic congestion. Kijewska et al. (2018)  have documented the impacts of traffic noise on the quality of sleep, rest, and work.   - Economic impacts: Freight parking is part of the last-mile logistics operations, the last leg of supply chains aimed  at meeting customersâ€™ demands. Cost estimations of this last leg differ from city to city and are conditioned by  commodity type. The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals estimated that last-mile deliveries represent  28% of the cost of the entire supply chain (Butrina et al., 2017). Gevaers et al. (2011) affirmed that last-mile deliveries  can cost between 13% and 75% of the total logistics cost. Dablanc & Rodrigue (2017) concluded that due to the low  levels of operational efficiency, last-mile operations are the weakest link of the supply chain, accounting for up to 50%  of the total cost. Low payloads ratios â€“average load factor between 30-40%â€“, empty trips, deliveries fragmentation,  congestion, searching for parking (cruising) are among the leading causes of these inefficiencies (de Marco et al.,  2017).  For the specific case of freight parking operations, the economic consequences of cruising and illegal parking  practices have been quantified in particular contexts. For instance, in New York (US), HolguÃ­n-Veras (2008) found  that freight vehicles often are forced to park illegally with costly consequences due to parking fines, i.e., USD$500 to  USD$1000 per truck per month. In the case of Toronto, freight vehicles incurred more than CAN$27 million in parking  fines. (Wenneman et al., 2015).  Cruising for parking and double-parking add traffic volume to the cityâ€™s congestion levels. According to researchers  from the Harvard School of Public Health, congestion had an economic impact of USD$100 billion by 2020 (Fahim  et al., 2021).   - Environmental impacts: Freight vehicles contribute to 15% of the GHG emissions in urban contexts (Hammami,  2020) and 50% of the particulate matter (PM) (de Marco et al., 2017). These impacts are directly related to the  kilometres travelled, the technology of freight vehicles, and traffic conditions during urban logistics operations. High  congestion levels and travel delays due to double parking and cruising for parking increase the negative impacts of  freight parking operations on cities environment as shown by Iwan et al. (2018). The consequences of high levels of  emissions are lethal for human life. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) estimates that around 7 million  premature deaths are related to air pollution globally (Fahim et al., 2021).  Providing the proper conditions for freight vehicle parking can potentially reduce travel time, pollutant emissions  as well as congestion levels (Comi et al., 2018). Given the relevance of freight parking impacts on urban sustainability,  this paper studies how freight curbside management can make parking operations and delivery more efficient while  lessening their unsustainable effects.  2584 Juan Pablo Castrellon  et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 72 (2023) 2581â€“25884 Juan Pablo Castrellon et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2022) 000â€“000  2.2. Freight curbside management  Freight parking operations are part of the microscopic level of the urban freight transport concept (Sanchez-Diaz  & Castrellon, 2022). At this level, urban space is often provided for freight operations in the form of (un)loading  zones, defined by Transport Departments as areas reserved for loading or unloading goods (Regal-Ludowieg et al.,  2022). The set of decisions on these loading zones (LZ) is referred as freight curbside management.  The concept of freight curbside management has recently emerged in the academic literature (Olsson et al., 2019).  It refers to strategic (long-term), tactical (mid-term), and operational (short-term) decisions that public and private  actors make to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of freight parking operations at LZ (Castrellon & Sanchez- Diaz, 2022). Decisions about LZ can refer to the number, location, size, parking duration limits, monitoring  technology, and enforcement, among others. (Castrellon et al., 2022) identified the following factors as determinants  for successful freight curbside management: a) matching freight supply-demand of public space, b) knowledge and  management of parking durations, c) enforcement capabilities, and d) data sharing strategies.  Several cities worldwide have implemented policies related to freight curbside management to improve traffic  conditions and reduce the negative impacts of freight parking. HolguÃ­n-Veras et al. (2018) conducted a survey showing  that 29.8% out of the 56 surveyed cities had implemented freight curbside management as part of their mobility plans.  Practitioners, freight companies and society ranked high this infrastructure initiative as a solution for urban mobility  issues. In de Marco et al. (2017), 35% of the 70 European cities considered in the study had implemented freight  curbside management.   The effects of freight curbside management have been measured mainly via microsimulation and optimization  tools, evaluating several performance measures. Butrina et al. (2017) proposed a set of performance measures  according to the objectives of the curbside management decisions. This research adopted the curbside management  factors presented in (Castrellon et al., 2022) and collected data about their impacts on the Butrinaâ€™s performance  measures referred to delivery time, cost, cruising for parking, occupancy levels, emissions, and parking violations.  Hence, freight curbside management is linked to the SDG11 according to the extent it impacts the selected  performance measures (Fig. 1).  Fig. 1. Framework for assessing freight curbside management impacts on SDG11.   SDG11 metrics shown in Fig. 1 correspond to the United Nations framework that proposed four metrics for this  goal, i.e., average global share of the urban area allocated to streets and open public spaces, participation of civil  society in urban planning and management, mean levels of fine particulate matter, and development of urban public  policies.   3. Method  Although several research publications have quantified the effects of curbside use on emissions, economic costs,  and urban mobility, there is still a long path to understanding how freight curbside management contribute to the SDG.

This research conducted a systematic  literature review aimed at building a meta-analysis of reported curbside management effects on SDG11 metrics. The  paper presents the first stage of a meta-analysis study by describing the systemic literature review and results from the  data extraction process.  Meta-analysis is a technique for extracting quantitative data necessary to conduct a statistical combination of  multiple studies (Xiao & Watson, 2017). The systematic literature review searched for a summary statistic, e.g.,  performance measures of freight curbside management, in each study to serve as the dependent variable. Since effect  measures vary from one study to the other, authors followed the approach described by Ewing & Cervero (2010), who  obtained studies statistics at comparable scales, e.g., elasticities or percentage of change, by either copying them from  published studies if reported explicitly or calculating them from regression coefficients or performance evaluation  tables. Then, data extraction considered the percentage of change in performance measures of freight curbside  management factors and linked them to the SDG11 metrics. The research question that guided the study was: what  are the effects of freight curbside management on sustainable development goals?  A systematic literature review was built upon a search query derived from the research question, i.e., (â€œfreight  parkingâ€� OR â€œloading zoneâ€� OR â€œloading bayâ€�) AND ("curbside" OR "curb side" OR "kerbside" OR â€œstreetâ€�) AND  (â€œimpactâ€� OR â€œeffectâ€�) AND (â€œsustainabilityâ€� OR "sustainable development" OR "environment") AND ("urban" OR  "city"). To avoid sources of sample bias such as publication bias, authors used Google Scholar database for accessing  grey literature, i.e., unpublished reports, thesis, preprints, and white papers. The first 980 results were available for  being included in the sample out of the 2350 search results. Publications from Web of Science, ProQuest, and Scopus  databases were also included. The search process was conducted in April 2022. Depuration of the first query results  consisted of selecting studies based on information from the title and snippet. Only studies that contained the keywords  connected coherently in aspects related to this research were selected.   The screening process deleted 138 duplicated results and filtered 357 records that fit the research interest. After  applying the deletion and exclusion criteria shown in Fig 2., 55 records were included for data extraction. The list of  references is available at https://dsw.chalmers.se/projects/d69106a2-6a4b-42d5-9a47-5185b9f7f621.    Fig. 2. Prisma diagram of the systematic literature review.   Papers selection was based on the possibility of accessing quantitative results of the performance measures shown  in Fig. 1 when implementing freight curbside management. Besides the summary statistic, the authors collected  information about the country, city and zone of study, data collection methods, and assessment tools, e.g.,  microsimulation and optimization. Performance measures were assigned to the corresponding SDG11 metrics based  on each paperâ€™s aim and practical implications.

Results and Discussions   Figure 3 presents a summary of the data extracted from 55 studies conducted in 158 cities from more than 60  countries worldwide since 2005. Results were grouped by freight curbside management factor and linked to the  corresponding SDG11 metric based on the reported performance measures. The figure shows in parenthesis the  number of studies that referred to the specified performance measure, SDG11 metric, and freight curbside  management factor. For the cases when (N ï‚³ 2), figure 3 (left) shows the increasing (ï‚­) or decreasing (ï‚¯) range of the  performance measures change reported from the corresponding freight curbside management factor. Figure 3 (right)  shows the number of studies linked to each SDG11 metric. Based on the evaluated performance measures and practical  implications, one study could fall into more than one classification. Results discussions are grouped by SDG11 metric.   Fig. 3. Results from the data extraction process of the systematic literature review.  Mean levels of the particulate matter in the city: Seven studies quantified the impact of freight curbside  management on emissions. This number is low compared to other SDG11 metrics, e.g., allocation of urban space,  which makes evident the need for more research quantifying the environmental impacts of curbside initiatives. Reports  found that urban space allocation and data sharing implementations generate pollutant reductions ranging from 5% to  95%. Research findings suggest that increasing public space for parking and information about its occupation levels  would decrease GHG emissions and local emissions due to reduced traffic levels achieved with less cruising and  double parking. Also, the promotion of modal shifts, e.g., cargo bikes, electric trucks, and increased transport and fuel  efficiency, are expected outcomes of the enhanced management of parking and delivery practices.  Allocation of urban space to streets and open spaces: Most of the contributions, i.e., 80% of the sample, fell in this  category due to the evident alignment between this SDG11 metric and the core function of city authorities of public  space management. Findings showed how public authorities must face dilemmas among several options for curbside  uses according to user demands, e.g., bike lanes, parking spaces for private vehicles, public transport stops, service  times, and loading zones. Evaluations concluded that effective management of space for freight could free up space  for other users (up to 70% in one of the studies) and most of the time, reduce cruising for parking (ï‚¯ 12.8% â€“ 100%),  and cost (up to 27%) through allocation of LZ, enforcement, data sharing, and parking limits initiatives.    The most popular performance evaluation was delivery time. Improvements ranged between 2% and 78%. Data  sharing related to parking availability or pre-booking systems reported reductions between 28 and 66%. However, it  was a common finding that equilibrium in the space allocation and enforcement are challenges in the management of  parking spaces as they cannot improve the system further or negatively impact the system.

A generalized finding related to reductions in delivery times was  evidenced by data sharing, enforcement, duration limits and urban space allocation policies. Research reports  concurred that technology adoption improved public and private decision-making processes and reduced the last-mile  distribution cost by preventing cruising for parking and illegal parking. Introducing data-driven policies for managing  curbside space also opens the possibility of introducing dynamic curbside management. This means a wide array of  opportunities for new business models and innovations, e.g., on-street lockers, charging stations for e-vehicles,  parking for scooters and new dynamic commercial or recreational spaces. Few studies (N = 6) reported measures on  occupancy rate, although its importance for public authorities. Data collection improvements in cruising for parking  studies could revert this situation.  Participation of civil society in urban planning policies: Only one study matched civil society's involvement goal  in the definition of parking policies by considering different stakeholders' perspectives. This finding represents an  opportunity for future research whereby citizensâ€™ perceptions and interactions with freight parking activities can be  considered in the formulation/evaluation of policies. By understanding users' needs for public space and assessing  conflicting conditions, public policies could better suit stakeholders' interests, reallocate rights-of-way, and strive for  fairer decisions under people-centred curbside solutions.   5. Conclusions and limitations  This research investigated the effects of freight curbside management initiatives on metrics of a sustainable  development goal. Findings suggested that actions in data sharing, enforcement, parking limits and allocation of public  space contributed to the goals of emissions reduction, congestion management, efficient delivery time, and equitable  access. However, there are some trade-offs between the different initiatives.  The main contribution of this research is to pinpoint the contribution of freight curbside management to the UN  Sustainability Development Goals of achieving universal access to safe, inclusive, and green public spaces, i.e.,  SDG11. Outputs from the systematic literature review can foster reflection of urban mobility stakeholders about  policies and initiatives implementation that include freight operations while providing open public space for all the  citizens, free of stress, noise, pollution, and traffic hazards. In essence, knowledge on enhanced management of the  curbside space can help in designing actions that positively impact SDG11 metrics. Nonetheless, more research is  needed on people-centred design, implementation, and evaluation of freight curbside management practices by  understanding conflicting conditions, urban space demands and social equilibriums.  Future works could develop meta-analysis methods of the collected statistics and propose techniques for  performance measures standardization given the multiple scales and metrics found.

Overlooking freight activities in urban mobility policies leads to conflicting scenarios in public space use with negative consequences in congestion, pollution, crashes, and productivity losses. This paper aims at identifying the unsustainable effects of freight parking practices and the solutions reported in the literature to overcome them. A systematic literature review was conducted to collect quantitative evidence of curbside management impacts on sustainability. Key performance indicators from the 11th  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG11) were linked to the 55 selected studies. Findings suggested positive impacts from four practices of freight curbside management and the need to include people-centred approaches in the design, implementation, and evaluation of public space policies.
