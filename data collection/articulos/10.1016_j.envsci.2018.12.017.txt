                  Where poor people rely on land that is degraded or vulnerable to degradation, they are at high risk of being locked into a downward spiral of poverty. It is estimated that over 1.5 billion people are affected by land degradation (UNCCD, 2014).
                  The World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) and Both ENDS and their networks of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), promote sustainable land management (SLM) as a necessary shift from degrading the land to sustainable use and restoration. However, many SLM initiatives started by communities remain below the radar of policy makers and government institutions and therefore, being unrecognised for what they are, do not get institutional support, i.e. an enabling policy environment, economic incentives, and the technical support that they need to develop and be adopted by others.
                  This paper analyses the contribution of community-based initiatives to SDG15.3: Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), and the three LDN indicators: land cover, land productivity and carbon stocks. In addition, enabling conditions for community-based initiatives to contribute to the implementation of LDN are identified and discussed. The contribution of community-based SLM initiatives to LDN will be illustrated by the SLM practices documented in WOCAT’s global database and by the example of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). It is concluded that community-based SLM initiatives can make a relevant contribution to addressing land degradation and achieving LDN, particularly so by improving land productivity and carbon stocks, and to some extent and in the case of FMNR, vegetation cover also. Creating enabling conditions for community-based initiatives to develop include: knowledge development by scientists, local communities and policy makers, inclusive land governance (land tenure security, strengthening institutions and the recognition of local knowledge), and access to technical and financial resources.

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD, 2014 ) estimates that over 1.5 billion people are affected by land degradation which includes a large number of the rural poor. WOCAT and Both ENDS, a development-oriented environmental CSO, and their networks promote sustainable land management as a way to facilitate the necessary shift from degrading the land to sustainable use and restoration of the land. Sustainable land management (SLM) is defined as “the use of land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, for the production of goods to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of these resources and ensuring their environmental functions” (Liniger et al., 2011 ; Liniger and Critchley, 2007 ). However, many SLM initiatives started by communities, remain ‘below the radar’ of policy makers and government institutions and therefore do not get the institutional support, i.e. an enabling policy environment, economic incentives, and technical support, that they need to develop and be adopted by others (Mudhara et al., 2016 ). Community-based initiatives for SLM are those that have been developed or adopted by communities or by land users groups. Community-based SLM initiatives improve the management of land to meet the needs and well-being of communities in a sustainable way and thus enhance livelihoods. Thereby, they potentially contribute to LDN (Akhtar-Schuster et al., 2016 ). Customary practices and knowledge of indigenous peoples and within local communities can be effective for avoiding, reducing and reversing land degradation (IPBES, 2018). Documenting and sharing SLM knowledge is important to provide options for better land use, governance and sustainable and inclusive policy environment that contribute to LDN (Mudhara et al., 2016 ). Facilitating and supporting the active engagement of local communities, awareness-raising and capacity development in SLM initiatives are necessary for establishing and enhancing SLM (in order to avoid and reduce land degradation (IPBES, 2018; Orr et al., 2017 )), restoring degraded lands (or reversing land degradation (IPBES, 2018 ); Orr et al., 2017 )) and therefore contributing to the implementation of SDG target 15.3: “By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world”. IPBES (2018 ) confirms the importance of supporting policies: “land degradation is rarely, if ever, the result of a single cause and can thus only be addressed through the simultaneous and coordinated use of diverse policy instruments and responses at the institutional, governance, community and individual levels. Land managers, including indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as experts and other knowledge holders, all have key roles to play in the design, implementation and evaluation of more sustainable land management practices”. IPBES (2018 ) states that the success of SLM initiatives highly depends on creating enabling conditions, which include policies that confer and protect individual and collective land tenure, empower indigenous peoples and local communities, and recognize the role of indigenous and local knowledge and practices for SLM. Community-based initiatives are often assisted by CSOs, through financial, organisational and/or lobby & advocacy support. Therefore, CSOs play an important role in creating enabling conditions as mentioned by IPBES (2018 ) through advocating SLM policies (including land tenure policies) by informing relevant policy makers; facilitating local knowledge exchange and disseminating information amongst land users and their organisations, and brokering between communities, policy makers, scientists, companies and other actors. Against this background, this paper aims to analyse existing knowledge on community-based SLM initiatives from WOCAT and Both ENDS in respect to how they contribute to LDN, by impacting on the three LDN indicators defined by the UNCCD (Orr et al., 2017 ), namely land cover/land cover change, land productivity/net primary productivity, and carbon stocks/soil organic carbon. In addition, enabling conditions for community-based initiatives to contribute to the implementation of LDN will be identified and discussed. After providing a short description of the methodology used for the analysis, the paper will analyse how the SLM initiatives that were developed or adopted by communities that are documented in the WOCAT database contribute to LDN. It further explores enabling and hindering conditions for these initiatives. The contribution of community-based SLM initiatives to LDN will be illustrated by analysing the example of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). FMNR is a technology and an approach that is published in the WOCAT database. The analysis of FMNR is based on literature and findings from the initiatives supported by CSOs that are involved in Both ENDS’ network. Based on a discussion of the results of the analysis, conclusions will be drawn as to the relevance of community-based SLM initiatives for contributing to LDN and measures will be recommended on how to enhance their effectiveness.  2 Background & methodology The community-based SLM initiatives in WOCAT (www.wocat.net ) have been recorded through the use of the standardized methods and tools which are developed and refined through their application in various projects, initiatives, countries and institutions (Schwilch et al., 2014 ) since 1992. WOCAT’s overall aim is to document and share knowledge drawn from site-specific field-tested SLM practices in order to promote SLM and address land degradation. At the core of the standardized WOCAT methodology are the WOCAT questionnaires. The documentation of the various SLM practices has led to a global database that is freely accessible (https://qcat.wocat.net/en/wocat/ ). In 2014 the UNCCD recognised WOCAT as the primary recommended database for reporting SLM practices (UNCCD, 2015 ; Wunder et al., 2018 ). The community-based SLM initiatives under WOCAT are recorded as SLM technology and/or SLM approach. SLM technology is a physical practice that controls land degradation and/or enhances productivity and consists of one or several measures. SLM approach comprises the ways and means to implement one or several SLM technologies, including technical and material support, and stakeholder engagement. As at April 2018, out of 928 SLM technologies documented in WOCAT’s global SLM database, one third (324) of the SLM technologies were introduced through land users’ innovation and/or as part of a traditional system in place for at least 50 years, and therefore can be considered community-based SLM technologies. The community-based SLM technologies were analysed on aspects relevant to land degradation i.e. land use and climatic conditions, the type of degradation they addressed and what land degradation response they pursued, to which SLM groups they belonged and, most importantly, how well they contributed to achieving LDN. Furthermore, other community-relevant impacts of the technologies were looked at i.e. food security, land use and water rights, and community institutions. The overall costs were analysed also. In order to gain a better understanding of the socio-economic and institutional context in which the community-based SLM technologies are implemented and further spread, the original dataset was further reduced to those technologies, in total 54, which are linked to a SLM approach under which more comprehensive socio-economic and institutional data is documented. Since 1991, Both ENDS has been working with CSOs and networks on inclusive sustainable land and water governance and international capital flows. These are CSOs working with local communities on SLM practices, on land restoration and tenure security. Both ENDS has also been involved in the international policy dialogues on desertification, land degradation and land restoration. Together with CSOs working in communities, Both ENDS realises clearly that community-based initiatives are often not noticed by extension services, development projects or policy makers. They are therefore not discussed, nor supported by policies or policy instruments. One of the community-based initiatives that is supported by CSOs in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, which has a positive impact on degraded lands, and, moreover, has been documented in the academic arena, is Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). For this paper, we looked into this literature and analysed FMNR against the three LDN indicators, namely land cover, land productivity, and carbon stocks, which were commonly, implicitly, mentioned in the literature. Furthermore, we looked at the enabling conditions required to support development of FMNR further within communities as a measure to halt land degradation, and to stimulate adoption of FMNR by other communities.  3 An analysis of WOCAT data on community-based SLM technologies and their contribution to achieving LDN 3.1 SLM and land degradation Almost 80% (257) of the 324 community-based SLM technologies in WOCAT are recorded as to having been implemented in either a sub-humid or semi-arid agro-climatic zone where growing period ranges from (approx.) 75 up to 270 days, and only about 10% each in humid and arid agro-climatic zones. Regarding land use, nearly half of the community-based SLM technologies were applied on cropland which is a similar proportion to the overall WOCAT database (Liniger et al., 2018 ). On grazing land and on land with mixed land use it was nearly 20% each. The category of mixed land use types is defined by WOCAT as a mixture of land use types within the same land unit which also includes agroforestry. Less community-based SLM technologies were implemented in forests or woodlands, and in areas of waterways, waterbodies, wetlands, settlements, infrastructure, mines, industries, and unproductive land (referred to as the category ‘other’) (Fig.1  ). The community-based SLM technologies implemented addressed different types of degradation of land resources ranging from soil erosion by water or wind, chemical or physical soil deterioration, biological degradation, to water degradation (Fig.1 ). The technologies mostly focused on addressing soil erosion by water (e.g. through cross-slope measures such as contour bunds or terracing), chemical soil deterioration (e.g. through improving soil fertility with manure and compost), biological degradation (e.g. through improving forest or grazing land management), and water degradation (e.g. through improving surface water and irrigation management and harvesting water), mainly on cropland, followed by mixed and grazing land (Fig.1 ). Per technology, multiple land degradation responses could be mentioned. Different stages of interventions ranging from “prevention”, to “reduction”, and “restoration” (“avoiding”, “reducing” and “reversing” respectively, as per the terminology of IPBES (2018 ) and UNCCD (Orr et al., 2017 )) are differentiated. Most community-based SLM technologies mentioned land degradation prevention and reduction as a goal (79% of total mentions) whereas only 20% cited the goal of restoring land that already has been degraded to such extent that the original use is no longer possible and land therefore has become unproductive. An example for restoring degraded land are ‚gully gardens ‘where farmers construct barriers to capture sediment and water thereby producing very fertile and well-watered soil on previously unproductive land. In view of the land degradation responses of the technologies according to land use type, in cropland reduction is mostly mentioned, followed by prevention and “restoration, which is the same pattern for grazing land and mixed land, while in forests, restoration receives the highest number of mentions, followed by prevention and reduction (Fig. 1 ). The land degradation responses of prevention (avoiding), reduction (reducing) and restoration (reversing), were also analysed according to SLM groups (Fig. 1 ). For a majority of technologies aimed at preventing land degradation, improving ground and vegetation cover was mentioned more than other SLM groups. For both reducing land degradation and restoring degraded land, improving ground and vegetation cover and cross-slope measures were mentioned most frequently. For evaluating how well the community-based SLM technologies have contributed to achieving LDN, the three LDN indicators are approximated by selecting the appropriate data documented in WOCAT as part of the impact assessment of a technology:• LDN indicator ‘land productivity (net primary productivity)’: WOCAT data on production of crop, fodder and wood  • LDN indicator ‘land cover (land cover change)’: WOCAT data on vegetation cover  • LDN indicator ‘carbon stocks (soil organic carbon)’: WOCAT data on carbon below ground    Overall, the community-based SLM technologies led to improvements across the LDN related indicators (Fig. 2  ). On cropland significant improvements in production and in carbon below ground were noted. On grazing land, improvements in production were mentioned more than in carbon below ground. In forests, the number of mentions of improvements in wood production and in carbon below ground were similar. Technologies in the category of mixed land use types showed the greatest improvements for all three LDN related indicators, and improvements in vegetation cover were mentioned most compared to the other land use types. Contrary to a general expectation that improved crop, fodder and wood production would correlate with increased vegetation cover, the latter was mentioned only rarely, as it did in an analysis of the entire WOCAT dataset (Liniger et al., 2018 ). Other impacts were analysed i.e. food security and self-sufficiency, land use and water rights, and community institutions (Fig. 3  ). Across all land use types, food security showed the greatest improvements, followed by the strengthening of community institutions: this is unsurprising as the first is likely to have been the main motivation for the initiative, and the latter a consequence, as the initiatives were developed by communities. Land use and water rights, on the other hand, had improved only minimally. This needs to be further analysed in view of land tenure security that is discussed in 3.2  (Fig. 5 ). Finally, costs for establishment (labour, equipment, plant material, fertilizer, construction material) and for maintenance/recurrent activities of a technology were compared to the benefits resulting. From the perspective of the land users returns for the community-based SLM technologies in the short term were often viewed more positive than negative, while in the long term returns were mostly positive. Compared to establishment returns, maintenance returns received fewer negative and more positive mentions, particularly in the short term. In the long term, maintenance returns were still seen more positive when technologies were aimed at land degradation prevention and reduction, while for restoration, maintenance and establishment returns were seen similarly positively. This follows the pattern of the entire WOCAT dataset.  3.2 Key enabling or hindering conditions The socio-economic and institutional context in which the community-initiated SLM technologies were implemented and further spread were analysed for the 54 technologies that were linked to a SLM approach. For that purpose, the conditions that enable or hinder the implementation of a technology were analysed. Across all land degradation responses, the four most frequently mentioned hindering conditions were financial resources, institutional settings, legal framework, and knowledge about SLM and access to technical support (Fig. 4   ). Though the legal framework was often hindering, paradoxically it also emerged as the most frequently mentioned enabling condition which underlines the relevance of the legal framework for SLM implementation (Liniger et al., 2018 ). Financial resources, on the other hand, is the most common hindering aspect. The resulting challenge is how hindering conditions can be turned into enabling factors to support the implementation of a technology. Simultaneously it is important to know what would be the most appropriate measures to enhance knowledge about SLM, facilitate access to technical support, strengthen the capacities of institutions, and ensure policies contributing to SLM. Addressing the knowledge gap will be critical to support land users in recognizing the value of SLM and developing appropriate land management strategies (Liniger et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, the analysis looked in more detail at land tenure security and incentives in the form of external financial or in-kind support, which are both considered very relevant to the implementation of community-based SLM technologies. Land tenure security in particular is seen as a crucial factor in motivating land users to invest in more sustainable practices which is important for achieving LDN. For assessing land tenure security, the area of land on which the technology was applied (as per the local context), land ownership and land use rights were taken into account (Fig. 5 ). Across all land use types, small-scale land areas were mentioned most (as with the whole WOCAT dataset) followed by medium-scale land areas, whereas large-scale land areas were only few and limited to cropland and grazing land. The mix and proportion of different land ownership, as well as of land use rights, varied across the different land use types. On cropland, individual land user rights were cited most often. For other land use types, land user rights were more equally mixed across communal, individual, leased and open access. Regarding incentives in the form of external financial or in-kind support, 65% of community-based SLM technologies had not received any support. For the remaining 35%, support was mainly received for equipment (e.g. machinery, tools) and agricultural inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers), and to a lesser extent for construction inputs (e.g. stone, wood), while only few mentioned support of labour (e.g. food-for-work, paid in cash) and infrastructure (e.g. roads, schools) (Fig. 6  ). Most support was received for technologies aimed at preventing and reducing land degradation, whereas little support was received for technologies aimed at restoring degraded land. Finally, the extent to which other land users in the neighbouring area have adopted a technology was analysed. The adoption rate was indicated for 63% of community-based SLM technologies and among these was highest for technologies aimed at reducing and preventing land degradation, and lower for technologies aimed at restoration (Fig. 6 ). But also the single case or experimental adoption was relevant. It is significant that most land users who initiated or adopted a technology did so spontaneously, receiving no or little incentive in form of payment or in-kind support: their true ‘incentive’ was, apparently, the benefit they expected from their own investment.  3.3 Discussion The comprehensive SLM knowledge documented through WOCAT proved useful for analysing the contribution of community-based SLM technologies to achieving LDN, principally based on a qualitative assessment of proxy indicators for the three LDN indicators. This knowledge helped to identify the focus areas of the technologies regarding land degradation types they addressed, the land degradation responses they pursued, and the SLM groups they covered. Furthermore, it enabled the analysis of how the community-based SLM technologies contributed to community-relevant aspects i.e. food security, land use and water rights, and community institutions. It also made an overall cost-benefit comparison possible. Then, it helped to identify the most important enabling and hindering conditions for the implementation of a technology, to give an indication of land tenure security (using the relative size of land on which a technology was applied, land ownership, and land use rights) and to show what incentives were received, and at what rate a technology was adopted by other land users.   4 Land restoration through regreening led by farmers and pastoralists In countries which are consistently affected by droughts and food insecurity, the loss of productive and fertile land threatens the livelihoods of both farming communities and pastoralists. Rapid expansion and unsustainable management of croplands and grazing zones is the most extensive global direct driver of land degradation (IPBES, 2018). In dryland areas, land degradation is one of the greatest and most direct threats to the livelihoods of millions of people. This process is exacerbated by climate change which causes more erratic rainfall patterns, longer periods of drought and unpredictable growing seasons. As a result, conflicts between farmers and pastoralists over land for cultivation and grazing grounds and access to water are intensifying. In Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger and Senegal (WOCAT database; Weston et al., 2015 ; Stith et al., 2016 ) local communities have restored vast tracks of land by nurturing the trees that spontaneously spring from the soil by protecting the shoots from cattle and hazards. Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), as this method is called, is the practice of actively managing and protecting non-planted  trees and shrubs with the goal of increasing the value or quantity of woody vegetation on farmlands. FMNR is distinct from most currently promoted agroforestry techniques because it relies on encouraging the growth of indigenous  trees. It requires no nursery-raising or planting (Haglund et al., 2011 ). Tony Rinaudo, one of the first promotors of FMNR, describes it as: “the systematic regeneration of the ‘underground forest’ of living stumps of trees just waiting for a little encouragement to grow and provide multiple benefits at little or no cost” (Rinaudo, 2012 ). Local farmers in Niger have applied FMNR since the 1990s, and in cooperation with pastoralists they have added (through protection and management) about 200 million new trees and ‘regreened’ no less than 5 million ha in Southern Niger (Reij et al., 2009 ). The farmers have identified useful species of trees in the stumps on their land, protected the naturally-emerging tree sprouts, and assisted regeneration of trees by pruning them to promote growth. The technology itself is not complex; it requires knowledge of trees, skills in pruning the shoots and protecting the root systems in the soil from which trees can regenerate. FMNR promotes the growth of trees, which has multiple benefits. Rinaudo (2012)  notes that FMNR:• produces firewood and building timber;  • contributes to restoration;  • positively impacts crop yields and animal production;  • increases biodiversity and reduces dependence on pesticides;  • contributes to the local economy; and  • contributes to the quality of life.    For this article, we focus on the contribution of FMNR to the LDN indicators of land cover and carbon stocks and land productivity, and the enabling conditions, which enables FMNR initiatives and their potential in contributing towards LDN. 4.1 Land cover As trees are regenerated by farmers on lands which had been cleared, the result of FMNR (more trees) should lead directly to a positive change in land cover. FMNR in Southern Niger indeed resulted in increased tree cover: in 2005 the cover was approximately 3 times more than the same area in 1975 (Reij et al., 2009 ). Weston et al. (2015)  describe FMNR resulting in more trees, increased tree cover and greater species diversity in Mali. In Northern Ghana, the most valuable outcomes of FMNR were increased tree stocks and improved soil fertility and crop yields. Stith et al. (2016)  note positive vegetation trends in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal by tree cover increase and natural regeneration of forest cover through FMNR.  4.2 Carbon stocks The vegetation regenerated through FMNR helps restore, maintain, and improve soil fertility by maintaining or increasing soil organic matter (Winterbottom, 2013). Francis and Weston (2015)  note that higher densities of tree cover on farmland rebuild soil quality and fertility by depositing organic matter (through leaf fall), attracting birds and animals that deposit manure and urine, and trapping airborne topsoil. The FMNR trees in cropland and pastures cause soil fertility, organic matter, and soil moisture to increase, while there is a corresponding decrease in wind and heat damage, and soil erosion. Faidherbia albida  is an indigenous leguminous tree that is commonly regenerated through FMNR practices. According to Garrity et al. (2010) , FMNR provides numerous benefits to the surrounding ecosystem: it fixes nitrogen into the soil, sheds its leaves when the rainy season starts and does not compete with food crops for sunlight, nutrients or water during the growing season, therefore making an ideal candidate to be regenerated in cropped fields. The seedpods of Faidherbia albida  are fodder for livestock, and are often collected and sold. The fallen leaves contribute useful nutrients and organic matter to the soil and trap wind-borne silt and organic matter. Regenerated trees also attract termites that break the soil crust, which results in improved soil structure and better water infiltration.  4.3 Land productivity Due to the fact that trees are regenerated on land that was earlier cleared by people or grazed by livestock, the net primary productivity of the land and thus the productivity increases. This is observed by Binam et al. (2015) , who note that the FMNR trees contribute to the reduction of carbon in the atmosphere by accumulating biomass via photosynthesis. Therefore, FMNR can be perceived as an improved land use management practice that is also essential to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition, several studies (Haglund et al., 2011 ; Reij et al., 2009 ; Binam et al., 2015 ) state that FMNR improves agricultural productivity. Reij et al. (2009)  note that FMNR has both direct and indirect impacts on household food security by enhancing food availability through higher crop yields in FMNR fields. They suggest that FMNR increases cereal yields on average by 100 kg/ ha.  4.4 Creating enabling conditions for FMNR For upscaling a community-based initiative like FMNR, an enabling institutional, technical and policy environment needs to be promoted (Binam et al., 2015 ). It is essential to understand the way knowledge and practice about FMNR is disseminated amongst land users. To improve dissemination of FMNR knowledge and practices Winterbottom et al. (2013)  propose encouraging peer-to-peer learning, strengthening knowledge management systems, improving access to information and expanding monitoring of FMNR practices. Several academics (Tougiani et al., 2009 ; Sendzimir et al., 2011 ; Stickler, 2012 ; Winterbottom et al., 2013 ) note that enabling conditions that contribute to the success of FMNR are: 1) security of land tenure, including the tenure of on-farm trees (ownership of trees, usufruct of trees, including wood etc.) through supporting policies (which includes agriculture, land tenure and forestry legislation); 2) changing unsupportive policies; and 3) creation of committees for natural resources management. Tougiani et al. (2009)  observe that contradictory and unsupportive policies and practices stimulate degradation. Until the 1980s, farmers in Niger were convinced (amongst others by agricultural extension services) that trees compete with crops. Farmers were encouraged to remove tree stumps in order to ‘modernize’ their agricultural practices (clean fields are part of the ‘myth of modern agriculture’). In addition, theft of trees (for firewood or construction materials) by other community members (for which the land owners would be blamed and fined) and associated conflict were additional strong disincentives to keep on-farm trees. Furthermore, the law prescribed that all trees were owned by the government, which further discouraged farmers to plant trees on-farm, as farmers of (whether intentionally or unintentionally) felled or fallen trees would risk a fine. In short, many farmers preferred keeping their farms free of trees. Sendzimir et al. (2011)  note that with the rise of FMNR in Niger, fodder availability increased locally, thereby decreasing the need to move livestock over wider areas. The success of FMNR also motivates farmers and pastoralists to cooperate to overcome the erratic demand for fodder caused by the dynamic heterogeneity of the Sahel. For example, farmers have marked migration corridors for pastoralists’ livestock which has decreased inadvertent trespass onto their fields when crops are growing. When fields are opened to pastoralists post-harvest, the manure from livestock increases soil health which supports the roots and the trees regenerate more quickly. CSO mediation to include pastoralists in village committees that oversee, monitor and sanction use of lands, further supported this cooperation. FMNR therefore contributes to social cohesion between communities. Stickler (2012)  confirms that these institutional reforms in Niger helped communities resolve resource conflicts, take action against uncontrolled tree cutting and livestock grazing, and reinforced local efforts to regenerate on-farm trees. These informal initiatives were subsequently supported by both official policy and law. These new rules and institutions proved crucial to the rapid spread and adoption of FMNR techniques across the region. Dallimer et al. (2017)  confirm that simple low-cost and/or traditional SLM practices that are known to work should be prioritised within policy to improve soil and increase yields and should be supported by subsidies or other economic incentives. Winterbottom et al. (2013)  confirm that it is critical to develop the capacity of local institutions (i.e. village development committees) to negotiate and locally enforce rules concerning access to, and use of, natural resources. This includes the development of locally enforceable rules to sanction illegal cutting of trees, limit damage caused by livestock to on-farm trees, and to control bush fires.  4.5 Discussion As the SDGs were only adopted in 2015 and the LDN indicators are fairly new, they have not yet been explicitly included into research on FMNR. As FMNR seems to be successfully contributing to restoration of land, specifically focussed research on the role of FMNR in the implementation of the SDGs in general and to LDN more specifically, both quantitative as well qualitative, is strongly recommended. In addition, it is advisable to stimulate, alongside the formal Natural Sciences domain, more knowledge development in the Social and Behavioural Sciences domain on how communities adopt community-based initiatives like FMNR, and how specific and general, local and national, policies can help the adoption of FMNR. For government institutions to support FMNR and its contributions to LDN, it is important to have supportive policies and policy instruments. Governance of land should be participatory and inclusive, the UN Committee on World Food Security Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests are very supportive in this context. National government institutions that are involved in the implementation of SDG15 Life on Land, should also actively engage with communities on their contributions to LDN. Institutions that report on SDG15 should make sure community-based initiatives are included in the national SDG monitoring frameworks. To facilitate adoption of FMNR, context-specific actions could be taken, such as: capacity development of FMNR support institutions including extension services, forest agencies and micro-credit providers; facilitation of development of village committees; capacity development of communities and local authorities on inclusive and sustainable land use planning; and exchange visits and communication (i.e. radio outreach) between FMNR communities and others that are interested in restoring their lands. For these context-specific actions, governments and donors should make tailor-made finance accessible for communities to take the necessary steps.   5 Conclusions Community-based initiatives on SLM are developed or adopted by, and therefore rooted in local communities. These are initiatives that have great potential to contribute to LDN. The analysis of the WOCAT data shows that community-based technologies in SLM can achieve much impact with few resources. It was found that these can make a relevant contribution to addressing land degradation and achieving LDN, particularly so by improving land productivity and carbon stocks, and to some extent vegetation cover. Community-based technologies, particularly, implemented in the category of mixed land use types with agroforestry led to substantially more improvements with regards to all three LDN related indicators compared to the other land use types and therefore deserve particular attention in future. Although there has not been an explicit focus on LDN indicators, the available literature on FMNR confirms that it contributes positively to the three LDN indicators. The lands to which FMNR was applied were very degraded by former practices that were encouraged by misguided policies, and this restoration technology has emerged partially as a result of a new and enlightened enabling policy environment. The resilience of communities dependent on land, will ultimately be determined by how sustainably they use that land and how effectively they tackle land degradation issues at the early stage through SLM and land degradation prevention. Communities, therefore, have an important function and responsibility as stewards of land. They need and deserve to be supported to promote inclusive and sustainable land management in a given physio-geographic and climatic context. Knowledge development by scientists, local communities and policy makers, inclusive land governance (land tenure security, strengthening institutions and the recognition of local knowledge), and access to technical and financial resources are important supportive measures. Sharing knowledge and learning from the implementation of SLM to combat land degradation and contribute to achieving LDN are considered critical elements for providing the grounds necessary for such a transformation. Indeed, the literature on FMNR highlights that exchange between communities that had already applied FMNR with communities that were still dealing with degraded lands supports the adoption of this restoration approach and use the land sustainably. An enabling policy environment that promotes land tenure security is another key determinant which, together with other enabling conditions such as: raising awareness about the values of SLM and the concept of LDN, empowering indigenous peoples and local communities, recognizing the importance of indigenous and local knowledge on SLM, and knowledge sharing and capacity development on SLM practices, helps facilitating the continued and longer-term involvement of communities in supporting and implementing SLM in order to effectively avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation. The analysis on FMNR confirms that policy, legal and institutional environment influence what local people can and will do. Also, the analysis of WOCAT data confirms the relevance of the legal framework for the implementation of SLM. People have no incentive to regenerate trees when they are not sure if they can use the land again next year, when the trees are formally owned by the government, or when pastoralists let their livestock graze the young shoots. Inclusive governance of land and trees is crucial to make community-based initiatives like FMNR a success. In the case of FMNR, land and tree tenure reforms improved land tenure security which supported and created an enabling policy environment for implementing and spreading FMNR. The financial support for promoting community-based SLM initiatives amongst communities is often relatively small. Promoting measures are: exchange visits, knowledge development, technical support, and advocacy for a more supportive enabling policy environment. There is a need for many of these relatively small financial investments in many communities to deal with the gravity of land degradation. In this context, CSOs supporting community-based initiatives are effective at the local level, and therefore are relevant and required for promoting and contributing to LDN.
