                  How should local governments guide their efforts toward realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) when the statistical data describing SDG indicators do not directly inform the prioritization of specific issues? This study considered the current status of efforts toward achieving SDG 11 on the local government level in Japan to construct frameworks that can be applied to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these efforts. Key elements of the SDG 11 local indicators—related to sustainable urban living—were identified by the principal component analysis, and prefectural progress was classified by cluster analysis. The correlations of SDG 11 progress to quality of life and fiscal capacity index (FCI) were then respectively evaluated using binomial logistic regression and multiple regression analyses. Finally, the causal relationships among SDG 11 indicators were determined using structural equation modeling to consider related indicators together in policy formulation. For example, the identified correlation between “high urbanization,” high quality of life, and high FCI helps governments to focus efforts on urbanization to achieve SDG 11. The proposed method can thus inform a simpler understanding of global and local indicators to promote the realization of SDGs in Japan or any other country.

How should local governments guide their efforts toward realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) when the statistical data describing SDG indicators do not directly inform the prioritization of specific issues? This study considered the current status of efforts toward achieving SDG 11 on the local government level in Japan to construct frameworks that can be applied to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these efforts. Key elements of the SDG 11 local indicators—related to sustainable urban living—were identified by the principal component analysis, and prefectural progress was classified by cluster analysis. The correlations of SDG 11 progress to quality of life and fiscal capacity index (FCI) were then respectively evaluated using binomial logistic regression and multiple regression analyses. Finally, the causal relationships among SDG 11 indicators were determined using structural equation modeling to consider related indicators together in policy formulation. For example, the identified correlation between “high urbanization,” high quality of life, and high FCI helps governments to focus efforts on urbanization to achieve SDG 11. The proposed method can thus inform a simpler understanding of global and local indicators to promote the realization of SDGs in Japan or any other country.

The translation of these SDGs into regional strategies and policy initiatives is more urgent than ever and requires governance mechanisms at the local level based upon a common understanding and shared framework among local authorities (Biggeri, 2021 ). Indeed, the importance of localizing the SDGs in order to effectively address them has been repeatedly identified, with many studies highlighting challenges for local government leadership, accountability, and awareness of stakeholders including citizens and businesses (e.g., Iyer, 2021 ; Abraham and Iyer, 2021 ; Dube et al., 2021 ; Dziva and Kabonga, 2021 ; Immler and Sakkers, 2022 ). Recent efforts to develop methods for the identification, use, and evaluation of SDG local indicators include the measurement of SDG progress at the local level of several Chinese cities based on an entropy weighting method (Wei et al., 2021 ); proposed approaches to achieve the SDGs through local government policies in Turkey that included an analysis of the relationship between budgets and women's quality of life (Gunluk-Senesen, 2021 ); and the development of an index to measure progress in achieving the SDGs at the local and regional levels in Romania by evaluating statistical data such as per capita income and local agricultural area as indicators (Benedek et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the plan-do-access/analyze-report-utilize (PDARU) cycle has been applied to examine localized SDG-oriented street design in a small Indian city using a logic model (Mwebesa et al., 2021 ). In other research, Liu et al. (2022)  developed an evaluation system using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of statistical data describing the SDGs of Chinese cities to measure their sustainability performance; Rama et al. (2021)  conducted a study analyzing classification and regression trees using the random forest machine-learning algorithm to identify key sustainability indicators in the Spanish urban system; Amoushahi et al. (2022)  conducted a study in the Iranian province of using the Fuzzy Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process to assess the weight and relative importance of urban sustainability indicators. Additional research has focused on the development of a neighborhood sustainability assessment model (Moroke et al. 2019 ) as well as investigations of the importance of public transport service policies in achieving the SDGs (Nikulina et al., 2018 ; Akuraju et al., 2020 ). Critically, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015 ) states that "We are determined to ensure that all human beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and that economic, social, and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature." Given numerous such statements regarding living standards, the achievement of the SDGs will be a major factor in improving the quality of life of the population. Thus, the identification of the SDG indicators closely related to the quality of life establishes a basis for its improvement. Furthermore, a systematic review of the literature researching the relationship between finance and sustainability (Carolina Rezende de Carvalho Ferrei et al., 2016 ) has indicated that financial crisis shocks have a negative domino effect on many poverty-related SDGs (Antoniades et al., 2020 ). Indeed, the relationship between finance and environmental sustainability is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers and experts in the development field. Positive interactions have been identified between economic activity and the achievement of SDGs, such as in the development of transportation, and negative interactions have been identified between urbanization and the natural environment and human health (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ). Thus, quantifying the SDG indicators that are closely related to the financial health of local governments could be useful for promoting sustainable development at the local level. As a result, local governments must take the lead in achieving SDGs. This requires significant efforts and resources that in turn require strong local leadership and suitable infrastructure and systems (Mutiarani and Siswantoro, 2020 ). Furthermore, as local governments develop SDG policies, they must consider where to focus their efforts (Reddy, 2016 ), measure their achievement in terms of development and impact (Tan et al., 2019 ), allocate financial resources in a manner that reflects community priorities (ElMassah and Mohieldin, 2020 ), and establish criteria that reflect the short- and long-term demands of the population (Mwebesa et al., 2021 ). Efforts are accordingly underway in cities around the world to analyze the progress achieved toward SDG 11 in particular, as it is concerned with urban sustainability and sustainable urbanization processes as well as the importance of public transport service policies (Arslan et al., 2016 ; Almeida et al., 2018 ; Nikulina et al., 2018 ; Almeida, 2019 ; Akuraju et al., 2020 ; Kaviti Musango et al., 2020 ). However, there remains a need to promote the development of appropriate indicators to assess the effectiveness of efforts to achieve SDG 11 based on systematic official data and information systems (Choi et al., 2016 ; Patel et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, as SDG 11 is related to other SDGs (Koch and Ahmad, 2018 ; Vaidya and Chatterji, 2020 ), a systems approach for the realization of sustainable cities is required (Bai et al., 2016 ). In Japan, several studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between forest management policies and national SDGs (Tabata et al., 2021 ), understand the actual implementation of SDGs by local governments (Kawakubo et al., 2018a) , assess the sustainability of cities and communities using environmental performance rating systems (Kawakubo et al., 2018b ; Miyazaki et al., 2019 ), and organize the history and current status of local government efforts to achieve the SDGs (Makise, 2020 ). As local governments around the world implement SDG policies, they will need to consider cultural characteristics such as individual and group beliefs, morals, and customs (Zheng et al., 2021 ); shared values between local governments and businesses (Malay and Aubinet, 2021 ); and prioritization and implementation of customized policies in both urban and rural areas (Baffoe et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, local governments must consider changes in development goals with technological advances and diffusion (Yonehara et al., 2017 ), national support and increased prioritization of SDG policies in local governments (Tiwari et al., 2021 ), and continuous monitoring and evaluation of progress (Klopp and Petretta, 2017 ; Giles-Corti et al., 2020 ). Ideally, SDG indicators should be tailored by each country to its own circumstances (Vandemoortele, 2017 ); it is important that an analytical framework to examine potential synergies and trade-offs among the various SDG goals and targets (Mainali et al., 2018 ) as well as a procedurally sound conceptual indicator framework for selecting and designing indicators (Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Hák et al., 2016 ) be developed to do so successfully. Based on the relevant literature, three major gaps in the efforts towards the realization of SDG 11 have been identified: first, the need to develop approaches that help local governments target and address SDG 11 (e.g., Biggeri, 2021 ); second, the need to explore effective local indicator evaluation methods and operations as the content of local indicators varies according to country and local government, making it necessary to provide background so that local governments can understand the most important local indicators for their region (e.g., Benedek et al., 2021 ; Rama et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2022 ); third, the need to quantitatively analyze the relationship between resident quality of life, local government finances, and the realization of SDG 11 indicators (e.g., Reddy, 2016 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ). Thus, it is clearly necessary to develop an improved understanding of SDG-related issues at the regional level to realize sustainable urban and social development, and to formulate and implement policies to improve the region accordingly. Research has therefore been undertaken to better understand the SDG indicators, their implementation, and their achievement. Though research on SDG 11 has been conducted in various countries around the world, Japan experiences specific urban problems including environmental pollution and waste generation owing to urbanization, frequent earthquakes and typhoons, and extensive damage from natural disasters that have made the achievement of SDG 11 and related goals a particular issue. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no empirical research on the realization of SDG 11 from a Japanese perspective. This study, therefore, focused on SDG 11 to understand the current status of efforts toward achieving this goal at the local government level and construct frameworks that can be applied to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these efforts. Notably, the United Nations defines the goals and targets of the SDGs as well as their corresponding global indicators, while each country defines its local indicators at the national and regional levels. In Japan, local indicators are developed by the national government, then local governments set targets to be achieved based on these indicators and formulate policies accordingly. However, there are hundreds of local indicators for the SDGs as a whole, including 52 for SDG 11 alone. Furthermore, since these indicators are merely statistical data, it can be difficult for each local government and its constituents to identify priority issues. It can also be difficult to grasp the importance of one's own region to the ability of the country to meet its goals. Therefore, this study was undertaken to enable local governments to guide their efforts toward realizing the SDGs using statistical data describing SDG indicators that do not directly inform the prioritization of specific issues. Frameworks were accordingly developed considering the current status of efforts toward achieving SDG 11 on the local government level in Japan to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of those efforts. Indeed, while many European cities and regions are preparing Voluntary Local Reviews—which are used by subnational governments to assess the process of implementing and achieving the SDGs—it has been stated that “selecting accessible data sources to measure localization performance has been challenging for both local and regional governments” (Ciambra, 2021 ). To address these challenges in Japan, this study first reviewed the key characteristics of the local indicators for SDG 11. Each prefecture in Japan was then categorized based on these characteristics to understand their relative importance according to prefectural characteristics. Next, the relationships between the characteristics of each prefecture and its residents’ quality of life—one of the basic principles of the SDGs—were determined. As budgetary expenditures will be required to achieve the SDGs, the relationships between the key features of SDG 11 and the financial status of each prefecture were also analyzed. The results of this analysis can help to form a simpler understanding of global and local SDG indicators. In addition, the analysis method employed in this study is quite versatile and therefore applicable in different countries and regions. The results obtained in this study clarify the challenges related to implementing SDG 11 on the prefectural level in Japan and address the goals that each prefecture should achieve by 2030, thereby contributing to local policy making and urban problem solving.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data collection A total of 52 local indicators comprising 40 types of statistical data related to SDG 11 provided by the Cabinet Office of Japan (2019a ) were considered in this study as shown in Table 1  . These local indicators were established by the Cabinet Office to reflect Japan's national circumstances based on the 232 global indicators defined by the United Nations Statistical Commission, which were developed from a global perspective and are not necessarily easy to use at the national and prefectural levels in Japan. For example, Indicator 1.1.1—proposed to manage progress on Target 1.1 "Eradicate extreme poverty (people living below $1.25/day)" set under SDG 1 "Poverty"—is "Percentage of population living below the international poverty line ($1.25/day)." It is unconstructive to apply this particular poverty level to Japan because the average income in the country is much higher than the global average, as is the cost of living (Cabinet Office of Japan, 2019a ). According to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, global indicators are to be complemented by indicators developed at the national and regional levels as well as efforts to augment the lack of baseline data at the national and global levels (United Nations, 2015 ). In addition, some indicators defined by the Japanese Cabinet Office are not included in the SDG global indicators but are expected to be of interest and use by many local governments in Japan given the country's unique circumstances; these Japan-specific local indicators include an "x" in the indicator numbers reported in Table 1 . Finally, the statement "This indicator is under consideration" in Table 1  denotes that the government is presently considering the use of this indicator but has not yet officially released it. The data used in this study were collected by surveying 47 prefectures, a form of local government in Japan between the national and municipal levels. While Japan has further governmental subdivisions, prefectures were employed in this study since the data describing local SDG indicators is lacking and inconsistent at lower levels. Fig. 1   shows the target prefectures considered in this study. The required local indicator data were obtained from The Portal Site of Official Statistics of Japan (The Portal Site of Official Statistics of Japan, 2022 ), a database for government statistics, then used to determine the principal components of the local indicators.  2.2 Data analysis The analyses of the collected data presented in this study were conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 software. The analyses employed in this study included a principal component analysis, cluster analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. 2.2.1 Principal component analysis The principal component analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of the identified local indicator data. This method of analysis is well-known and the most widely used dimensionality reduction method for large data sets as it is able to significantly reduce the number of variables while retaining much of the information in the original data set (Syms, 2008 ). In this study, the data sets for the local indicators were summarized and characterized to determine their key characteristics (principal components) describing progress towards the realization of SDG 11. These components can then be analyzed and used as a basis for comparison between prefectures, directing focus toward improving specific indicators within. Note that as the principal component analysis is concerned with the mathematical description of the overall data set, it can often be difficult to make intuitive sense of the results themselves. However, the identified components provide a valuable basis for the differentiation of important indicators from irrelevant indicators. Thus, the results of the principal component analysis were then used as the basis for a cluster analysis in this study.  2.2.2 Cluster analysis A cluster analysis was used to analyze the indicators describing the progress on SDG 11 in each prefecture. This analysis classifies objects into groups characterized by similar values of a set of variables (Vandeginste et al., 1998 ). The cluster analysis conducted in this study employed a non-hierarchical, k-means method to classify each prefecture into a typology based on its principal component scores, as obtained by the principal component analysis described in Section 2.2.1 . After considering the use of 8 to 12 typology clusters, 11 clusters were employed to describe the progress of local indicators, as the significance of all variables when using 11 clusters was p  < 0.05 according to an analysis of variance. This classification can help policy makers and residents in each prefecture to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their region in realizing SDG 11, compare them with those of other regions, and consider countermeasures without having to individually consider dozens of statistical indicators.  2.2.3 Regression analysis As previous studies have stated that the achievement of the SDGs is related to resident quality of life and the financial situation of the local government, the presence of relationships between quality of life/satisfaction and progress on SDG 11 and between prefectural financial indices and progress on SDG 11 were analyzed using regression analyses (McIntosh et al., 2010 ). The "Survey on Satisfaction and Quality of Life," conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan (2019b) , was employed to quantify quality of life in this study. This survey investigates the following factors: (1) household finances and assets; (2) employment environment and wages; (3) housing; (4) work-life balance; (5) health status; (6) education level and educational environment; (7) social connections such as friendships and community; (8) trust in politics, government, and courts; (9) quality of the surrounding natural environment (air, water, etc.); (10) personal safety; (11) ease of raising children, (12) ease of taking care of your family; and (13) enjoyment/interest of life, each rated on a 10-point scale. The "Satisfaction with life (overall)" is defined as the total score of all 13 survey items. The relationship between "Satisfaction with life (overall)" and progress on SDG 11 was then determined using a binomial logistic regression analysis (Banks and Fienberg, 2003 ), with 1 (satisfied) implying a response above the average value for all prefectures and 0 (dissatisfied) implying a response below the average value. The principal component scores for each prefecture, calculated by the principal component analysis, were employed as the explanatory variables in the regression analysis. To achieve SDG 11 by improving the corresponding indicators, local governments need to budget resources to improve the living environment in each prefecture. A multiple regression analysis (Flowerdew, 2009 ) was therefore applied to analyze the relationship between the fiscal year 2018 prefectural financial index table produced by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (2019)  (hereinafter referred to as the “fiscal capacity index” or FCI) and progress on SDG 11. The FCI is frequently used as an indicator of the fiscal capacity of a local government and is calculated by dividing the base fiscal revenue (tax revenue) by the base fiscal demand (necessary expenses). The objective variable in this analysis was the FCI, and the explanatory variable was the principal component score for each prefecture, as calculated by the principal component analysis. Note that to ensure an effective and accurate regression analysis, it is desirable to employ a sample size that is ten times the number of variables evaluated (Peduzzi et al., 1995 ). Since the sample size used in this study was limited to the 47 prefectures of Japan, the analysis of all 52 indicators and their associated variables is unlikely to indicate any significant p -values. Taking this into account, the results of the calculations for all variables were reviewed and the five variables with the highest principal component scores were selected using the forward–backward stepwise selection method. Note that in addition to the forward–backward stepwise selection method, the backward–forward, backward, and forward stepwise selection methods were conducted and found to obtain the same results.  2.2.4 Structural equation modeling If related local indicators describing SDG 11 progress are grouped together and named, policy makers and residents of each municipality can consider measures to achieve their targets by group rather than considering only one indicator at a time. Therefore, structural equation modeling—a multivariate analysis method typically used to test hypotheses describing the effects among interacting variables (Harrison et al., 2007 )—was applied to determine the causal relationships between SDG 11 progress and the data from the Local Development SDGs Local Indicator List, obtained from The Portal Site of Official Statistics of Japan. The accuracies of the obtained relationships were evaluated in terms of the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The GFI has been compared to the squared multiple correlation in a multiple regression; when the value of GFI is close to 1, the fit is good. The AGFI corresponds to the squared multiple correlation adjusted for degrees of freedom; when the value of AGFI is close to 1, the fit is good. Note that AGFI is always less than or equal to GFI. The CFI is always between zero and 1; when the value of CFI is close to 1, the fit is good. Finally, when the value of RMSEA is small, the fit is good. (Hayashi et al., 2011 )    3 Results and analysis 3.1 Characteristics of local indicators The local indicators outlined in Table 1  were summarized and characterized using a principal component analysis to identify their ability to describe key features. The selection conditions for the principal components were eigenvalues of 1 or higher and cumulative contributions of 80% or higher. Variables with linear combinations were excluded because they exhibited correlations greater than ±0.8 with other variables and can therefore be substituted by those variables. Thus, the linearly combined variables “11.3.1.3 Net migration of population,” “11.7.1.3 Number of libraries and community centers per inhabitable land area,” “11.7.1.6 Library and community center space per habitable land area,” “11.x.11 Percentage of normal households whose distance to the nearest emergency refuge site is greater than 2000 m,” and “11.x.16 Percentage of head households with a household member aged 65 or older whose distance to the nearest senior day service center is greater than 2000 m” were excluded from this analysis. Table 2   identifies and describes 10 principal components of the remaining 47 SDG 11 local indicators based on their respective loadings. Each principal component describes a set of indicators that share a common correlation in the collected prefectural data, thereby enabling a simplified analysis of their influence on SDG outcome. The principal components labeled "Mix" indicate that several indicators with equal loadings are included in a single component; Mix components were defined to reduce the number of principal components in the subsequent analyses while still considering relevant indicators. A municipality can have a high or low value for one or multiple of these indicators. For example, a high loading for “Mix 1: (Library density, High number of fires)” indicates a high library density and/or a high number of fires. These “Mix” components were created to simplify the analysis by reducing the overall number of components. The ten identified principal components are described as follows.1 Principal component 1 has high loadings for many indicators related to cities such as “Number of regular households whose distance to the nearest transportation facility is less than 2000 m” and “Population change”; as a result it was named “High level of urbanization.”  2 Principal component 2 was named “High level of suburbanization” owing to its higher loading for “Percentage of area in urbanization control area” and “Percentage of population in the urbanization control area,” as well as its lower loading for “Percentage of normal households whose distance to the nearest emergency refuge site is less than 250 m” compared to principal component 1.  3 Principal component 3 was named “High level of air pollutants” owing to its high loading for “Annual average concentration of fine particulate matter” and “Annual average concentration of sulfur dioxide,” and its low loading for “Rate of environmental standard achievements for PM2.5 concentration.”  4 Principal component 4 was named “Lack of community centers” owing to its low loading for the “Number of community centers per inhabitable land area.”  5 Principal component 5 was named “Improvement in living environment” owing to its high loading for “Number of parks per capita,” “Percentage of houses with household members aged 65 years or older that are barrier-free,” and its low loading for “Number of complaints due to odors per 1000 residents.”  6 Principal component 6 was named “Mix 1: (Library density, High number of fires)” owing to its high loading for “Number of libraries per inhabitable land area” and “Number of fires per 10,000 residents.”  7 Principal component 7 was named “Mix 2: (High concentration of Ox, Low percentage of barrier-free dwellings, Low percentage of municipalities that have established regional supporters)” owing to its considerable loading for “Number of days with photochemical oxidant (Ox) concentrations greater than 0.12 ppm for 1 h during daytime” and low loading for “Percentage of houses with household members aged 65 years or older that are barrier-free” and “Percentage of municipalities that have established regional supporters.”  8 Principal component 8 was named “Mix 3: (Disaster prevention plan has been established, High percentage of waste for final disposal)” owing to its high loading for “Whether a disaster prevention plan has been established” and “Percentage of waste for final disposal.”  9 Principal component 9 was named “Mix 4: (High rate of environmental standard achievements for SPM concentration, High average cost of conservation projects for cultural properties)” owing to its high loading for “Rate of environmental standard achievements for SPM concentration” and “Average cost of conservation projects for cultural properties.”  10 Finally, principal component 10 was named “Mix 5: (Low rate of environmental standard achievements for SPM concentration, Low percentage of municipalities that have established regional supporters)” owing to its lower loading for “Rate of environmental standard achievements for SPM concentration” and “Percentage of municipalities that have established regional supporters” compared to the other principal components.    Each prefecture was then classified using these components as discussed in the next section.  3.2 Understanding progress on SDG 11 in each prefecture Based on the principal component scores obtained in Table 2 , a cluster analysis was conducted as described in Section 2.2.2 . The 11 typologies of the local indicators are defined in Fig. 2  . Table 3   lists the prefectures according to their SDG 11 local indicator typology, and Fig. 3   shows the typologies according to prefecture location. In these figures and table, the term “promotion” indicates that efforts are in progress, while “consideration” indicates that measures and improvements are desired in the future. Taking into account the values of the cluster centers in Fig. 2  and the classification of prefectures in Table 3 , as well as the 47 considered SDG local indicators for each prefecture, the 11 typologies were determined as follows.1 The “Natural environment promotion type” indicates prefectures that ranked low in “High level of urbanization” and highest in “Lack of community centers” and “Mix 3”; this is the opposite of the “Capital standard type” described below.  2 The “Promote natural environment, air quality consideration type 1” indicates prefectures that ranked lowest in the “High level of urbanization” and “Mix 4,” and highest in the “High level of air pollutants” and “Mix 5.”  3 The “Metropolitan suburban type” indicates prefectures that ranked third highest in “High level of urbanization” and second highest in “High level of suburbanization.”  4 The “Rural areas, air quality consideration type 1” indicates prefectures that ranked second highest in “High levels of air pollutants” and third lowest in “Lack of community centers.”  5 The “Living environment promotion, air quality consideration type 2” indicates prefectures that ranked highest in “High level of suburbanization,” “Improvement in living environment,” and “Mix 2,” and lowest in “Lack of community centers.”  6 The “Region, living environment and consideration type” indicates prefectures that ranked highest in “High level of urbanization,” second highest in “Lack of community centers” and “Mix 2,” second lowest in “Mix 3” and “Mix 4,” and lowest in “Improvement in living environment” and “Mix 5.”  7 The “Capital standard type” indicates prefectures that ranked highest in “High level of urbanization” and “Mix 1,” and lowest in “High level of suburbanization” and “Mix 3.”  8 The “Rural areas fire outbreak consideration type” indicates prefectures that ranked higher in “High level of suburbanization” and “Mix 1.”  9 The “Prospective capital, cultural promotion type” indicates prefectures that ranked the second highest in “High level of urbanization,” highest in “Mix 4” owing to the “High average cost of conservation projects for cultural properties,” and lowest in “Mix 2.”  10 The “Suburbs of the capital standard type” indicates prefectures that ranked higher in “High level of urbanization,” while the other indicators were of average value.  11 The “Rural areas standard type” indicates prefectures that ranked lower in “High level of urbanization,” while the other indicators were of average value.     3.3 Relationships between quality of life/satisfaction and progress in terms of SDG 11 principal components The relationships between the indicators for SDG 11 progress and comprehensive life satisfaction were determined using the EXP (β ) for each principal component in the regression equation obtained as described in Section 2.2.3 , as shown in Table 4   (A). The significance of the regression equation was p  < 0.001, and the percentage of correct classifications was 82.98%. The explanatory variables (principal components) that exhibited a strong relationship with life satisfaction (overall) were “High level of urbanization” and “Mix 4.” Indeed, the higher the value of “High level of urbanization” or “High level of suburbanization,” the more satisfied the respondents were with their lives, while the higher the value of “Lack of community centers” or “Mix 2,” the greater their dissatisfaction. Next, the relationships between the SDG 11 indicators and comprehensive life satisfaction (determined using the forward–backward stepwise selection method described in Section 2.2.3 ) are shown in Table 4  (B), again in terms of EXP (β ) for each principal component. The significance of the regression equation was p  < 0.001, and the percentage of correct classifications was 68.09%. The only explanatory variable (principal component) found to exert an influence on life satisfaction was “High level of urbanization,” and as its value increased, life satisfaction increased. Although each explanatory variable was not significant when considering all principal components, these results are provided to show that the percentage of correct classifications was over 80% and the significance of the regression equation was p < 0.001, which was judged to be a meaningful result. Table 4  (C) shows the results considering only the five independent variables (no mix components). Table 4  (D) shows the results of a multiple regression analysis performed to check the robustness of the results in Table 4  (C), in which it can be observed that the most important explanatory variables for life satisfaction are the same as indicated by the binomial logistic regression analysis. Indeed, both analyses found that "High level of urbanization," "High level of suburbanization," and "High level of air pollutants" were positively related to life satisfaction (Table 4  (C) and (D)).  3.4 Relationships between prefectural FCIs and progress in terms of SDG 11 principal components The obtained relationships between the indicators for SDG 11 progress and the prefectural FCIs are shown in Table 5   (A) in terms of the partial regression coefficient B  and regression coefficient β  for each principal component in the regression equation. The significance of the regression equation was p  < 0.001 and the adjusted R 2  was 0.83. Both a “High level of urbanization” and “High level of suburbanization” were strongly correlated to the FCI; the higher these values, the higher the FCI. Table 5  (B) shows the relationships between the SDG 11 principal components and the prefectural FCI (determined using the forward–backward stepwise selection method described in Section 2.2.3 ), again in terms of B  and β  values for each component. The significance of the regression equation was p  < 0.001 and the adjusted R 2  was 0.81. The remaining explanatory variables were the principal components “High level of urbanization,” “High level of suburbanization,” and “Mix 1”; a “High level of urbanization” can be observed to have a particularly considerable influence on the FCI; the higher its value, the higher the FCI. Table 5  (C) shows the result for the five independent variables (excluding the mix components). To confirm the robustness of the results in Table 5  (C), a binomial logistic regression analysis was performed with the results shown in Table 5  (D). The objective variable was set to 1 for prefectures with an FCI higher than the average and 0 for prefectures with an FCI lower than the average. Both analyses showed that a "High level of urbanization," "High level of suburbanization," and "Lack of community centers" were positively related to the FCI in Tables 5 (C) and (D). On the other hand, the positive and negative results differ for a "High level of air pollutants," but the small value for this variable suggests that its effect on the regression equation is small.  3.5 Causal relationships among the variables describing SDG 11 progress The causal relationship between indicators 11.1.1, 11.7.1.1, 11.7.1.2, 11.7.1.7, 11.7.2, and 11.a.1.2 defined in Table 1  was analyzed using structural equation modeling (described in Section 2.2.4 ) to investigate their importance in maintaining local communities, as shown in Fig. 4  . The results were evaluated in terms of the GFI, AGFI, CFI, and RMSEA, as discussed in Section 2.2.4 . The goodness-of-fit indices for the path diagram were GFI = 0.967, AGFI = 0.923, CFI = 1.000, and RMSEA = 0.000, making it a well-fitting model. In particular, the standardized estimates (values indicated along the arrows in the figure) for "11.1.1.1 Percentage of homeless people" and "11.7.2 Number of recognized sex offenders per capita" are high, indicating strong relevance to the maintenance of local communities. As a result, the relevant local government departments should be advised to address these issues by focusing on public safety and thereby promote SDG 11 progress. Similarly, the causal relationship between indicators 11.1.1, 11.x3, 11.x16, and 11.x17 defined in Table 1  was analyzed to investigate the accommodation of an aging society, and the results are shown in Fig. 5  . The goodness-of-fit indices for the path diagram were GFI = 0.996, AGFI = 0.979, CFI = 1.000, and RMSEA = 0.000, also indicating a well-fitting model. In particular, the standardized estimates for "11.1.1.1 Percentage of homeless people" and "11.x16 Percentage of head households with a household member aged 65 or older whose distance to the nearest senior day service center is greater than 2000 m" are high, indicating strong relevance for the accommodation of an aging society. Thus, local government efforts should focus on residential policy to address the aging of the population and realize progress toward SDG 11.   4 Discussion The objective of this research was to identify issues in the implementation of SDG 11 by Japanese local governments and develop indicators to guide each government in its progress. These indicators can therefore contribute to efforts to achieve SDG 11 by 2030 and help to address urban problems in Japan. First, the main characteristics of the local indicators of SDG 11 were analyzed using a principal component analysis. The results indicated that a “High level of urbanization” and “High level of suburbanization,” which indicate the form of cities, were related to many of the SDG local indicators. Next, a “High level of air pollutants” was found to be related to many local indicators concerning the environment. Thus, the key characteristics derived from this analysis can help guide the focus of each prefecture (Reddy, 2016 ) and represent topics that should be addressed when implementing SDG 11. Each prefecture can be classified based on these key characteristics to identify where they excel or need to improve and reflect such aspects in future policies, helping to prioritize and implement customized policies in both urban and rural areas (Baffoe et al., 2021 ). The indicator characteristics developed in this study, therefore, provide an understanding of the current status of each prefecture's efforts toward realizing the SDGs and can thus serve as benchmarks. Furthermore, cooperation among local governments in the same characteristic can also help to promote efforts towards realizing the SDGs in each local government. Next, an analysis of the relationships between the characteristics of each prefecture and the quality of life/satisfaction revealed that quality of life/satisfaction is particularly related to the level of urbanization, so all prefectures should be encouraged to maintain and improve local indicators describing the level of urbanization. Furthermore, as high urbanization was found to be related to a high municipal FCI, national financial support is desirable to increase the urbanization of each prefecture and, if necessary, to increase the priority of SDG policies in local government planning (Tiwari et al., 2021 ). In addition, by analyzing the causal relationships among the SDG 11 indicators, effective measures for improving multiple local indicators can be examined. If only the SDG global indicators provided by the UN and the local indicators provided by each national government are used, the SDG policies of local governments may not be evidence-based or understood by residents. The data analysis conducted in this study, therefore, allows each prefecture to understand its strengths and weaknesses, as well as its position relative to its goals, before formulating SDG implementation policies. The first of the research gaps identified in the introduction is the need to develop approaches that help local governments target and address SDG 11, and the second is the need to explore and operationalize effective local indicators. Since the SDG indicators are based on statistical data, it is possible to directly compare stand-alone data on an annual basis to determine progress. However, it is difficult to relate the statistical data for a given indicator to statistical data for other indicators to ascertain the relative importance of different indicators within the SDG targets, and to directly compare regions in the same or different countries. To address this issue in this study, key characteristics were extracted from the statistical data presented for the SDGs. These characteristics were then categorized for each region and can be used to determine to focus for each local government to achieve SDG 11. For example, for Okinawa prefecture, the “Region, living environment and consideration type” in Table 3  has a lower value for the “Improvement in living environment” characteristic than the other regions in Fig. 2 . In Table 2 , the main components of “Improvement in living environment” are the “Number of parks per capita,” “Number of complaints due to odors per 1,000 residents,” and “Percentage of houses with household members aged 65 years or older that are barrier-free” indicators. Therefore, to achieve SDG 11, Okinawa prefecture should propose policies to increase the number of parks, reduce odors, and increase the number of barrier-free houses in order to improve the living environment. Thus, by reviewing the results using the procedure presented in this paper, it is possible to identify specific issues that need to be addressed by each local government. The third identified research gap is the need to quantify the relationship between resident quality of life and the financial situation of local governments when promoting SDG initiatives. Tables 4  and 5  show that a “High level of urbanization,” which was identified by the principal component analysis as a desirable characteristic in achieving SDG 11, is closely related to the quality of life/satisfaction as well as the associated prefectural FCI. Indeed, Table 2  indicates that high urbanization is associated with a variety of beneficial community activities such as public transit, library space, and senior centers. This result supports the findings of previous studies that have analyzed urbanization and life satisfaction in other countries (Lenzi and Perucca, 2018 ; Kim, 2018 ). Furthermore, according to UN-Habitat (2015) , “appropriate financial management can tap into strategies that improve the efficiency of revenue collection, win public support, capitalize on urban and regional economies of scale, curb land speculation and sprawl, incentivize economic activity, and improve urban affordability for the poor.” Thus, the association between urbanization, quality of life, and financial health suggests that the governments of more urbanized areas can afford to provide more services for their constituents, thus improving their quality of life and making progress towards achieving SDG 11. Though these results appear to suggest that urbanization represents an ideal initiative for achieving SDG 11, there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between long-term urbanization and CO2 emissions (Aslan et al., 2021 ), which could adversely affect progress toward realizing other SDGs such as SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Furthermore, rapid urbanization can lead to the development of a socioeconomic gap in some cases (Asghar Pilehvar, 2021 ), potentially hindering progress toward realizing SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Therefore, municipalities should be wary of pursuing rapid urbanization to achieve SDG 11 simply because they have a high FCI, and instead carefully consider the size of cities, scale of implementation, and the requirements of meeting other SDGs along with the duration of any implemented urban policies to ensure uniform progress toward sustainable development. Urbanization can improve resident quality of life through the development of public transportation networks, which can shorten the distance from homes or public facilities such as libraries to transportation facilities, thereby reducing the overall burden of travel. At the same time, excessive population concentration is often accompanied by an increase in air pollutants owing to the increase in the density of automobiles and factories, representing a trade-off inherent to urbanization. However, given the country-specific nature of the approach employed in this study, it should be noted that air pollution is generally lower in Japan than in many other countries (IQAir, 2021 ). As a result, even if air pollution increases in a given prefecture, it is unlikely to have an immediate negative impact on the quality of life of the population. In addition, the "Survey on Satisfaction and Quality of Life” examines life satisfaction as a synthesis of 13 items, only one of which is related to air pollution, indicating that air pollution is relatively unimportant in the survey. Furthermore urban development to achieve the SDGs in one local government jurisdiction may have a negative impact on the achievement of the SDGs in other countries or regions where resource extraction and waste disposal take place. This suggests a need for indicators that account for effects beyond the framework of a single local jurisdiction, representing an intriguing direction for future research. For example, a cap-and-trade framework for greenhouse gasses has been considered to link emissions from producing regions/industries to otherwise disconnected consumers. However, the legal implementation of cap-and-trade systems has been faced with various problems (ScienceDirect, 2022 ), and SDGs are intended to be set voluntarily by national and local governments, negating the ability to make them legally binding altogether. Note that in this study, data from Japan's SDG local indicators were used as the basis of analysis. As indicated in the literature review, the analytical approach used in this study is considered useful owing to the commonality among a large quantity of statistical data, regardless of country or region. However, this study was limited by the statistical data designated for each SDG indicator by the considered national and local governments. Furthermore, the size of the sample used in this study was limited to the 47 prefectures in Japan. Also note that the classifications of the regions presented in this study still need to be defined in a way that is compatible with the regions to be analyzed. Since SDG indicators comprise a large quantity of data, it would be desirable to collect as many regional samples as possible to ensure an effective statistical analysis. Finally, since the principal component analysis applied in this study represents a mathematical method that summarized indicator data independently of the substance of each indicator, it was sometimes difficult to name the resulting principal components appropriately, as in "Mix 1: Library density, High number of fires." This may compromise the ability to provide a simpler understanding of SDG indicator progress, and as a result, future investigations should develop more transparent and effective naming schemes based on the results of the principal component analysis. Although the analytical model used in this study determined the effects of statistical data related to SDG 11 (defined by the Cabinet Office) on quality of life and FCI, other variables could have a more significant impact. This highlights the need to consider the potential missing variables in and endogeneity of the analytical model. Identifying these variables requires investigation and analysis from different perspectives than those relevant to this study of statistical data appropriate as indicators for SDG 11. This represents an issue that should be considered in future work by national institutions and researchers. For example, a highly urbanized region containing many large corporations may collect considerable tax revenues from these entities, resulting in a high FCI for the local government. However, the statistical data describing SDG 11 indicators do not include information such as the number of large corporations. Instead, this study assumed that in the variable "High level of urbanization," highly urbanized areas will contain more large corporate locations. Furthermore, residents of highly urbanized areas may have a higher quality of life owing to inherently higher incomes or a lower quality of life owing to inherently higher rents. Thus, a simultaneity argument (chicken-and-egg dilemma) is present regarding whether higher urbanization produces a higher FCI and quality of life or vice versa. Given these observations, it should be understood that the conclusions of this study are solely based on an analysis of the SDG 11 indicators as a statistical data framework, and a more nuanced perspective may be required on a local basis to evaluate the specific pathways towards SDG realization. Indeed, such complex interactions between local indicators emphasize the need for an approach to realizing the SDGs that can be understood on the local government level.  5 Conclusion This study developed indicators to understand progress towards the achievement of SDG 11 by Japanese 47 prefectural governments and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses. First, local indicators for SDG 11 were summarized using 10 principle components and their characteristics were outlined. The characteristics of each prefecture were then determined based on the results of a cluster analysis using these components. Next, the relationship between quality of life in each prefecture and progress on SDG 11, as well as that between the prefectural FCI and progress on SDG 11, were determined. The findings revealed that a "High level of urbanization" was related to a high quality of life/satisfaction and FCI because urbanization implies the development of transportation networks and public facilities in the region, and population growth due to urbanization results in a higher FCI. Yet urbanization also increases air pollution. Such complex trade-offs between indicators demonstrate the necessity of considering urbanization issues specific to the local government jurisdiction when making sustainable urban planning and development policies, and thereby represent an ideal application for a locally comprehensible framework describing SDG progress. Finally, the causal relationships among the SDG 11 variables were analyzed. The results revealed causal relationships between SDG 11 progress and local indicators describing the maintenance of local communities and accommodation of an aging society. These results can help the various stakeholders in Japanese prefectures to understand the implications of the SDGs and their corresponding challenges in their regions, and thereby provide guidance for achieving these goals. Furthermore, the analyses conducted in this study can be deployed to evaluate local SDG initiatives in various countries in a more accessible manner. Future research could analyze the progress towards achieving all the SDGs in Japan, study the target area at a more fragmented municipality level, and examine the effects of relevant policies. It would also be useful to further develop this study by analyzing data from local governments in other countries based on the analytical procedures presented in this paper. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic will affect social conditions, potentially causing fluctuations in the statistical data and necessitating continued research and analysis.
