                  This study examines the transformative role of self-help groups (SHGs) in the socioeconomic development of rural women in Cooch Behar District, India, and their contribution toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. In this study, we explored the effect of SHGs on rural women by specifically addressing SDGs, such as no poverty (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), good health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5). Given this issue, a cross-sectional survey and comparison analyses are needed to assess the socioeconomic development of rural women and their awareness level before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. The survey conducted as part of this study was divided into three sections, namely, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic development, and awareness level, with each focusing on different aspects. A group of 400 individuals who were part of SHGs completed the questionnaire survey form. The results showed that the participation of rural women in SHGs significantly improved their socioeconomic development and awareness level, as supported by both mean values and t test results. Memberships in SHGs and microcredit programs were the major elements that boosted the socioeconomic development of rural women, which also achieves SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This study revealed that participation in SHGs and related financial services significantly aided rural women in economically disadvantaged communities in accumulating savings and initiating entrepreneurial ventures. Moreover, participation in SHGs was instrumental in enhancing the self-confidence, self-efficacy, and overall self-esteem of rural women. Finally, doing so enabled them to move more freely for work and other activities and to make family and common decisions.

Role of self-help groups on socioeconomic development and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) among rural women in Cooch Behar District, India Debanjan Basak ⁎   Indrajit Roy Chowdhury  Department of Geography and Applied Geography, University of North Bengal, Siliguri, 734013, India Department of Geography and Applied Geography University of North Bengal Siliguri 734013 India  Department of Geography and Applied Geography, University of North Bengal, Siliguri, 734013, India  ⁎ Corresponding author.      This study examines the transformative role of self-help groups (SHGs) in the socioeconomic development of rural women in Cooch Behar District, India, and their contribution toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. In this study, we explored the effect of SHGs on rural women by specifically addressing SDGs, such as no poverty (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), good health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5). Given this issue, a cross-sectional survey and comparison analyses are needed to assess the socioeconomic development of rural women and their awareness level before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. The survey conducted as part of this study was divided into three sections, namely, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic development, and awareness level, with each focusing on different aspects. A group of 400 individuals who were part of SHGs completed the questionnaire survey form. The results showed that the participation of rural women in SHGs significantly improved their socioeconomic development and awareness level, as supported by both mean values and t  test results. Memberships in SHGs and microcredit programs were the major elements that boosted the socioeconomic development of rural women, which also achieves SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This study revealed that participation in SHGs and related financial services significantly aided rural women in economically disadvantaged communities in accumulating savings and initiating entrepreneurial ventures. Moreover, participation in SHGs was instrumental in enhancing the self-confidence, self-efficacy, and overall self-esteem of rural women. Finally, doing so enabled them to move more freely for work and other activities and to make family and common decisions.   Keywords Self-help groups  Rural women  Socioeconomic  development  Sustainable  Development Goals  (SDGs)  Microcredit  India    1 Introduction The majority of women living in rural areas of India face social isolation and encounter significant obstacles in the access to basic services (Dyson and Moore, 1983 ). Various interconnected fields, such as agriculture, food security, horticulture, livestock, nutrition, fisheries, energy, and family life, influence rural development and agriculture. These fields are vital for promoting growth and progress in rural areas (Gautam et al., 2012 ). Although rural women contribute to the economy, they are restricted in terms of access to markets, financial services, educational opportunities, and medical care. In addition, the job of women is to perform duties around the home, including cleaning, cooking, taking care of children, fetching water, and other similar activities. These responsibilities are regarded as the traditional responsibilities of rural women (Desai and Jain, 1994 ). Women must possess the authority to speak their minds, make decisions based on accurate information, and realize their full potential within the community at the same levels as men (Alkire et al., 2013 ). Accordingly, advancing the rights of women has become a significant focus of attention in India (Drèze and Sen, 2002 ). Advocates of self-help groups (SHGs) mentioned that the inclusion of women elevated their social position and made them arbiters of family norms and societal institutions. The concept of empowerment relates to the ability of individual or groups to make decisions and act on them (Cattaneo and Chapman, 2010 ; Basak and Chowdhury, 2023 ). Agency allows an individual or group to plan and strategically select options (Emirbayer and Mische, 1998 ). However, not all agency denotes empowerment. Even when given choices, individuals may not use them. All of these aspects work together to strengthen various levels and may reinforce each other. According to Alsop et al. (2006) , empowerment is the process of helping an individual or group to make successful choices and transform such choices into desired actions and developmental outcomes. The rationale underlying SHGs is that women with access to money could establish small enterprises that generated revenue, which, in turn, could ease poverty by supplementing family costs and improving the sense of self-confidence and effectiveness of women via their participation in decision making within the home (Mayoux, 1998 ). Socioeconomic development has become an essential part of the solution to various societal issues, including rapid population growth, deterioration of environment, and poor status of women. Empowerment, as defined by Nyagwanga (2016)  and Sindhav (2017) , involves decision-making abilities, access to resources, assertiveness, growth mindset, openness to change, and skill acquisition to increase power and influence opinions through democratic means. This study examines the impact of SHGs on the socioeconomic development of rural women in Cooch Behar District, West Bengal of India, in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, specifically no poverty (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), good health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5). To contextualize this discourse, the study initiates the discussion by critically analyzing the contemporary literature pertaining to the SDGs in the context of SHGs followed by the investigation of the contribution of rural women’s participation in SHGs toward achieving the objectives of SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In this regard, access to microcredit plays a vital role in promoting the socioeconomic development of women living in rural regions as facilitated by SHGs. The study of the impact of SHGs on the socioeconomic development of women has gained scholarly attention due to significant role of microcredit in achieving SDGs. However, there is a paucity of research on the impact of SHGs on the socioeconomic development of women in Cooch Behar District, West Bengal of India. Against this background, this study aims to address two key questions: whether or not the participation of rural women in SHGs can influence their socioeconomic development and whether or not the awareness level of rural women can change before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs.  2 Literature review The substantial investigation of many scholars from various countries has emphasized the theoretical and empirical aspects of SHGs. Furthermore, they have underscored the connection between SHGs and the advancement of the socioeconomic status of rural women. For example, Singh (2006)  proposed that women’s development increases awareness of their rights, which enables them to participate in social, economic, and political processes, identify in- and out-groups with similar experiences and attitudes, and act with them to define needs and exert collective pressure to meet these needs. Dinakaran et al. (2010)  found that gender equality and women’s development are internationally recognized as essential for the advancement of all sectors. However, gender-specific projects are empowering women. Women now know their rights and obligations. The social needs of women are met through women’s organizations. Kilby (2010)  mentioned that development is a dynamic process that helps women and other marginalized and alienated groups transform the institutions and ideas that keep them subjugated. In addition, power and allocation between individuals and organizations are crucial for development. Jakimow and Kilby (2006)  proposed the appropriate division of labor, competitive salary, in-job mobility, and formalization of women’s labor to increase the social standing of women. Specifically, women must participate more productively in rural development programs to improve their decision-making and status. According to Rao et al. (2014) , women’s development includes access to resources, self-awareness, health, legal rights, technology, and effective use of social and economic resources. Additionally, Mohammed et al. (2017)  observed that SHGs are a movement for women’s development that fights against direct and indirect impediments to self-development and social, political, and economic engagement. Women’s growth is constant and interconnected. Awareness and capacity development increase involvement, decision-making power, and transformational action to overcome limits. A recent research showed the positive effects of SHGs on women’s empowerment, poverty alleviation, and social status in Pakistan (Niaz and Iqbal, 2019 ). Al-Kubati and Selvaratnam (2023)  explored the implementation of the Self-Help Group Bank Linkage Programme in India, focusing on SDGs and women’s empowerment. Arora and Chawla (2023)  emphasized the global importance of women empowerment through political, legal, economic, and social pathways. Kandpal and Nautiyal (2023)  demonstrated how microfinance institutions and SHGs in India empower women, promoting gender equality and entrepreneurship. Survase and Gohil (2024)  investigated financial inclusion in rural areas of Maharashtra State, India, and highlighted the impact of SHGs on social conditions and their role in achieving SDGs. 2.1 Role of self-help groups (SHGs) for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) There is a growing body of research on how SHGs help women become more independent. The reason is that microcredit through SHGs plays a major role in contributing to achieving SDGs. Several SDGs strongly rely, directly or indirectly, on the availability of microcredit through SHGs. Figure 1   depicts a few of potential uses and roles that SHGs may play in achieving SDGs. The literature has presented in-depth discussions of the potentially direct influence of SHGs on achieving SDG 1. People who are economically disadvantaged and make 1.25 or 2.00 USD per day are eligible for microcredit through SHGs. This system may help low-income households to improve their financial situation and maintain a steady level of consumption (Murugesan and Ganapathi, 2010 ; Wickramasinghe and Fernando, 2017 ). Malnutrition is another extremely severe issue that affects people worldwide. To find a solution to this issue, a large number of studies have investigated the connection between participation in SHGs programs and the nutritional condition of participants (Adamsen and Rasmussen, 2001 ). Hamad and Fernald (2015)  found that using microcredit through SHGs exerted a favorable impact on the nutritional status of participants and their level of food security. Similarly, the connection between socioeconomic status and health has been extensively revealed (Cooper, 2002 ; Hamad and Fernald, 2015 ; Roy et al., 2023 ). People living in poverty and those with low socioeconomic status tend to have bad health. Launching small enterprises, increasing income, and moving closer to economic independence are made possible by microcredit through SHGs for low-income individuals by providing them with the financial means. Therefore, people worldwide agree that a link exists between health and wealth (Deaton, 2008 ). Inequalities in poverty and health are inseparable, and microcredit through SHGs programs offers solutions for addressing not only one but several of these issues simultaneously (Mahajan, 2005 ). Low-income families that participate in SHGs programs are more likely to gain access to insurance, as detailed by Brody et al. (2015) . Furthermore, the achievement of SDG 4 can also be facilitated through the utilization of microcredit through SHGs programs. The majority of low-income families in rural areas continue to work in agriculture, and many of them put their children to work on family farms to maintain their current standard of living. As a direct consequence, children continue to skip school. Thus, these families can stabilize their financial situation with the support of microcredit through SHGs, such that their children are more likely to go to school. Nader (2008)  discovered a significant connection between microcredit through SHGs and the education of children. Based on the discourse, we found that the introduction of microcredit through SHGs has transformed rural women’s income levels, empowered individuals to access better health care, increased nutritional supply for children, boosted household consumption, promoted women’s empowerment, and contributed to increased savings to achieve SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  2.2 Participation of rural women in SHGs in Cooch Behar District, West Bengal The SHGs movement was initiated very belatedly in West Bengal. It started slowly but picked up speed over time and is now affecting the rural economy (Sarkar and Malik, 2019 ). Although the number of SHGs has expanded as a result of measures taken by the state and central governments, this model is evidently not equitably designed across the districts and villages of the state for the sake of the economic well-being of low-income families. As a result of land redistribution in several land reform movements, most farmers in West Bengal own only small plots of land (Mahendra Dev, 2014 ). This is a factor that contributes to the predominantly agricultural and rural economy of the region. The majority of respondents join SHGs in the hopes of improving their social status. It encourages people to engage in income-generating activities, which enhances their chances of being approved for a loan, increases their propensity to save, and makes paying off their existing debts easy (Sahoo, 2013 ). In West Bengal, SHGs are economically and socially improving the lives of rural women. Two dominant philosophies form the function of these societies. In one scenario, everyone in SHGs would save 1.2 USD every month. The SHGs then lend money to its members at an annual interest rate of 2.00%. Another alternative is for participants to engage in the production of goods, such as food processing, handicraft, nursery, and animal rearing. The women share in the little profits from selling such goods. Figures 2 and 3    provide extensive data on SHGs of women in Cooch Behar District, West Bengal. These visuals offer valuable insights into their activities, achievements, and impacts, which highlight their crucial role in empowering women and promoting socioeconomic development in this region. Figure 2  provides a visual representation of the number of SHGs promoted in the study area. It is evident that the highest number of SHGs promoted in the study area was observed in 2017 (7461), constituting 21.54% of the total. In comparison, 17.47% and 15.55% of SHGs were promoted in the study area in 2015 and 2016, respectively. However, since 2019, the number of SHGs promoted in the study area has continued to decline, and this situation continued in 2020 and 2021. In 2017, the highest percentage of households were mobilized to join SHGs (22.08%), as shown in Figure 3 . This was followed by 16.83% in 2015 and 15.81% in 2016. After 2019, there was a noticeable decrease in the percentage of households that were mobilized to join SHGs, dropping to 2.94% in 2020 and further declining to 0.32% in 2021. The SHGs in Cooch Behar District showcase the mobilization of households and the active participation of women, which reflect prevailing trends and scenarios.   3 Materials and method This study is a field survey; thus, we opted for a quantitative data collection and analysis approach. This choice was based on the fact that this study is a survey research attempt. Specifically, the study employed a cross-sectional design. However, data were collected only once, because the study objective did not include the collection of repeated sets of data from the participants during the investigation. The tool used for data collection is a structured and systematic questionnaire. As a result of this approach, the researchers were able to perform statistical analyses to investigate the question: does the participation of rural women in SHGs affect their socioeconomic development and awareness level? The members of women’s SHGs in rural regions of Cooch Behar District were the focus of this study. The study used convenience sampling due to the unavailability of a sample frame. In addition, there were a significant number of women’s SHGs in Cooch Behar District, with a total of 54,213 SHGs and a cumulative number of 576,357 women’s membership. The necessary sample size for the study was calculated using the following formula (Yamen, 1967):(1) n = N 1 + N e 2    ,     where n  is the sample size; N  is the population size; and e  is the margin of error established at 5%. The survey included 400 respondents from different community development blocks within Cooch Behar District and was conducted between November 2022 and April 2023. The questionnaire does not contain open-ended questions and consists of two different parts. The first part describes the participation of rural women in SHGs and its influence on socioeconomic development, while the second part focuses on whether there is a change in the awareness level of rural women before and after participating in SHGs. The researchers formulated these constructs after considering the opinions and recommendations made by professionals and academics in the related field of research by reviewing the existing literature (Maheshwari and Goyal, 2014 ; Datta and Sahu, 2017 ; Al-Kubati and Selvaratnam, 2023 ) and noting the opinions of experts. These specialists and academics have been selected due to the scholarly articles they have authored, the unique experiences they have gained, and their extensive expertise on the many aspects of women’s empowerment and SHGs in India. To ensure the validity and reliability of the constructs, we conducted a pilot study to preliminarily test the research instrument. The items regarding socioeconomic development and awareness levels before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs were evaluated using a five-point Likert-type scale. The results indicate that the instrument is sufficiently reliable (Cronbach’s alpha=0.794) (Daud et al., 2018 ). Interviews were conducted with women who participated in SHGs to further collect data. The purpose of this action was to assess the conditions prior and subsequent to engaging in SHGs. This profile includes information on their socioeconomic conditions before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. In the process of data analysis, descriptive statistics and t  test were employed (Meena et al., 2008 ). Figure 4   provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the methodology employed in this study and a visual representation of the various steps and processes involved, which highlight the meticulous approach taken by the researchers to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings.  4 Results and discussion 4.1 Sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents Analysis of the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents was conducted (Table 1  ). These characteristics play a major role in determining the development levels of the respondents. Before analyzing these characteristics include age, marital status, religion, caste, level of education, family size, size of land holding, occupation, number of years of participation in SHGs, sizes of SHGs, and type of income-generating activities conducted by SHGs. Table 1  displays the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. Age is a key factor in determining the status of family and society. To a large extent, it acts as a kingpin in regulating the activities of a person. The data presented in this table indicate that the age group with the highest percentage of the respondents (33.75%) was those aged between 40 and 49 years old. This group is considered to have the capacity to contribute the most to development. They are capable of solving the problem that they may encounter. The respondents with 30–39 years old (33.00%) came in second. The rest of the respondents was composed of the less than 30 years old, 50–59 years old, and more than 60 years old, which accounted for 33.25%. Marital status plays a pivotal role in the lives of women. The married group constituted the majority (58.25%) of the respondents, followed by single (23.75%), widow (10.75%), and divorced (7.25%). Religion plays a predominant role in sketching the customs, values, and beliefs of the respondents. In terms of religion, majority of the respondents were Hindu (74.25%), followed by Muslim (25.75%). Notably, the respondents were mainly composed of women belonging to a particular religion in a specific region due to the lack of enthusiasm of women for other religions. In an attempt to analyze the caste of the respondents, Table 1  illustrates that 62.75% of the respondents belonged to Scheduled Caste, while the rest belonged to the general category (37.25%). Education serves as the crucial tool for unlocking the gateway to life opportunities, as it fosters human growth and fuels the progress of a nation. The level of education of a person indicates personality and potential. Specifically, 75.75% of the respondents were literate and completed elementary school levels or above, followed by 24.25% who were illiterate. The utilization of education can prove to be a powerful instrument in the advancement of women, because it equips women in rural areas with the necessary knowledge and technological skills to enhance and progress their work in various domains. The structure of the family unit holds a crucial position in the process of empowering and fostering the growth of rural women. The distribution of family sizes indicates that the majority, which accounted for 49.25%, consisted of four to six persons, while those with less than three persons made up 31.50%, and only 19.25% had more than six persons. Regarding the number of years of participation in SHGs, 47.25% of the respondents participated in SHGs for 5–10 a, and 28.50% participated in SHGs for more than 10 a. Nursery (22.25%), food processing (24.25%), handicraft (41.75%), and animal rearing (11.75%) were complementary occupations.  4.2 Comparing the socioeconomic development of rural women before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs Women empowerment contributes to socioeconomic development. Economic progress in any developed or undeveloped country can be achieved through social development. The participation of women is significant in their socioeconomic development through their utilization of income-generating activities, such as food processing, handicraft, nursery, and animal rearing. This section has attempted to analyze rural women’s freedom of mobility, community and family recognition, literacy levels, general awareness, work skills, individual and family income, interaction skills, participation in developmental programs, and involvement in decision-making before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. Table 2   presents a comparison of statistically significant changes in socioeconomic development of rural women before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. A total of 11 statements were used to assess the level of socioeconomic progress made by rural women over time. The study observed a significant change in rural women’s freedom of mobility after the participation of rural women in SHGs, which is reflected by the increase in mean value from 3.90 before the participation of rural women in SHGs to 4.10 after the participation of rural women in SHGs. The rural women’s community recognition increased after the participation of rural women in SHGs. This result was supported by the work of Anand et al. (2020) . The respondents further revealed the rural women’s family recognition, which was indicated by the increase in mean value from 2.76 to 3.39 before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. Rural women’s literacy levels and general awareness increased after the participation of rural women in SHGs, with the mean values increasing from 2.78 to 3.11 and 3.19 to 3.78, respectively. Rural women’s work skills, individual income, and family income also increased after the participation of rural women in SHGs, which is also supported by the work of Sivachithappa (2013) , Dahal (2014) , and Mohapatra and Sahoo (2016) . The study noted a significant change in rural women’s interaction skills, participation in development programs, and involvement in decision-making, which were reflected by the increases in mean value after the participation of rural women in SHGs (Vijayanthi, 2002 ; Dahal, 2014 ; Mohapatra and Sahoo, 2016 ). The study further compared changes in socioeconomic development using t  test. In particular, the t  values of the 11 statements were all significant. The results of this study show that participation in SHGs can lead to better socioeconomic development of women in rural areas of Cooch Behar District.  4.3 Influence of SHGs on awareness level of rural women Table 3   presents the mean, standard deviation, and t  value for awareness levels of rural women before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. We divided the statements that were used to evaluate awareness level of rural women into four broad areas, namely, social, health, economic, and political aspects. The results of t  value indicate that participation in SHGs significantly contributes to raising the awareness level of rural women. 4.3.1 Awareness level of rural women in social aspect Increased awareness of child labor led to a considerable shift in attitudes toward social problems, particularly in rural regions. This shift especially affected the practices related to child labor. The mean value increased from 2.76 to 3.39 before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs, so it is easy to deduce why people feel differently after the participation of rural women in SHGs. The mean value increased from 2.89 before the participation of rural women in SHGs to 3.11 after the participation of rural women in SHGs, indicating a better understanding of child marriage education-related practices (Dahal, 2014 ). However, families are compelled to resort to child marriage and employ their children due to the societal circumstances in which they exist (Kabeer, 2005 ; Abebe, 2008 ). As a result of participating in SHGs, the participants reported increased awareness about social injustice and domestic violence (Sundaram, 2012 ), which was most evident among those with low socioeconomic status, low level of education, and weak social networks within the community. A striking evidence of this finding is that rural women’s awareness of domestic violence and their understanding of the social inequalities that exist increased after the participation of rural women in SHGs. The findings of Brody et al. (2015)  confirmed the claims of participants that the direct consequence of participating in SHGs is improved status in family and society, as well as increased self-confidence in decision-making. The majority of family members participate in SHGs, which fosters a feeling of community and broadens the opportunities for participants.  4.3.2 Awareness level of rural women in health aspect Poor women and their families may access affordable health care and other fundamental necessities through SHGs. The mean value of knowledge regarding sanitary practices increased from 2.14 before the participation of rural women in SHGs to 2.90 after the participation of rural women in SHGs, which indicates a substantial change in awareness level. The mean value for the awareness of the importance of personal hygiene was 3.08 before the participation of rural women in SHGs, which considerably increased to 4.52 after the participation of rural women in SHGs. The Samaj Sathi is an insurance scheme against accidents for members of SHGs (Dasgupta et al., 2022 ). After the participation of rural women in SHGs, the people provided considerably more positive responses, on average, to whether or not they were aware of the Samaj Sathi insurance scheme. The mean value of raising consciousness on the Samaj Sathi insurance scheme increased from 2.60 to 4.89. The change clearly demonstrates that members of SHGs have embraced the norms and values of a small family.  4.3.3 Awareness level of rural women in economic aspect SHGs are comprised of small groups of rural women who can relate to one another and exhibit comparable demographic traits (Patil and Kokate, 2017 ). They feel an increased sense of belonging due to their social similarities. It is a tool that carries the potential to end poverty and boost the economic standing of women in India (Prasad and Sreedevi, 2007 ). The increase in the mean value from 4.04 before the participation of rural women in SHGs to 4.25 after the participation of rural women in SHGs is an evidence of the improvement in the capacity of controlling resources (Daniyan-Bagudu, 2018 ). In addition, the respondents acknowledged that being a member of SHGs was the most important factor in determining whether or not they would be able to improve their creditworthiness and qualify for loans via the conventional banking system (Dasgupta, 2001 ). Finally, the respondents confirmed that participating in SHGs has increased their access to financial resources and improved the quality of life. However, SHGs have proven to be a valuable instrument for fostering opportunities for self-employment, enhancing communication skills, and cultivating entrepreneurial knowledge. These findings are further supported by Vejju (2018) , Kapoor (2019) , and Siddeswari and Gopal (2021) .  4.3.4 Awareness level of rural women in political aspect Women’s participation in SHGs has increased their understanding of social and political issues, which has boosted their self-esteem and worth (Kapoor, 2019 ; Nayak and Panigrahi, 2020 ). After the participation of rural women in SHGs, the mean value increased from 3.98 to 4.35, reflecting that they now had more access to information on a wide range of government programs (Mohapatra and Sahoo, 2016 ). Women strongly believe that SHGs are a collective undertaking to raise awareness of their rights and advocate for women’s equal ownership of property (Choudhury, 2015 ; Kumar et al., 2021 ). Regarding the education about the rights of women and education on women’s equal ownership of property, the mean value increased from 4.55 to 4.68 and 4.91 to 5.57, respectively. Moreover, the study noted an increase in their involvement in development initiatives, which was indicated by the increase in the mean value from 6.99 to 7.57 before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs.    5 Conclusions In summary, the study conducted a comprehensive examination in Cooch Behar District, West Bengal, and clearly demonstrated the pivotal role of microcredit through SHGs in advancing socioeconomic development and awareness level of rural women. By employing a detailed cross-sectional survey on 400 members of SHGs, we effectively captured significant changes in socioeconomic development and awareness level of rural woman before and after the participation of rural women in SHGs. The findings are indicative of a substantial shift in the empowerment of rural women not only in terms of financial independence but also in social status and self-perception. Access to microcredit through SHGs has enabled these women to contribute more significantly to their financial well-being of their families, move beyond traditional roles, and make informed decisions regarding health, education, and household management. This transformation is profound in a context, in which women have been historically relegated to the background in economic and decision-making processes. Moreover, the study underscored the role of SHGs in achieving SDGs. The empowerment of rural women through financial and social means, as facilitated by SHGs, not only improves the individual lives of women but also contributes to the holistic development of the community and the nation. Thus, the study conclusively pointed out that empowering rural women by providing microcredit through SHGs is a significant step toward the realization of a developed, equitable, and inclusive society. The results emphasized the need for continued support and expansion of such initiatives to ensure sustained socioeconomic development and the achievement of SDGs in rural areas of India. However, the reliance of the study on primary data from the members of SHGs could introduce bias, its cross-sectional approach limits causal inference, and its focus on one district potentially affects the applicability of the results. Thus, future research should include longitudinal studies across regions to fully comprehend the long-term impacts and varying effects of SHGs in socioeconomic and cultural contexts of India.
