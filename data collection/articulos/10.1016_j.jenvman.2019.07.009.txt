                  Open dumping is a common practice for MSW disposal in most of the Indian cities, apart from the metro-cities. This practice poses significant environmental and health risks due to toxic and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission through direct combustion and/or decay of wastes. Therefore, integrated solid waste management (ISWM) using different methods viz., incineration, composting, anaerobic digestions, refuse derived fuel, material recovery facility and sanitary landfilling, is much needed. Accordingly, three waste management case scenarios were studied for year 2001–2051 by keeping weightage of sustainable development goals 2030 of India. Case I depicts Indian present scenario of waste management where 164–735 tonnes/year of wastes would be generated for year 2001–2051. Further, 60% of waste can be treated in case II that help in reducing the land requirement up to 40% from estimated conditions of 2031 i.e., 83.8 × 107 m3. The case III is most ideal waste management condition for year 2031 to reduce 80% waste hence landfill requirement would minimize up to 16.76 × 107 m3 where population is at controlled conditions. This article concludes the formal handling and treatment of ISWM would minimize the landfilling, where LCA can be an antidote to achieve sustainable development goals.

Table 5 A critical observations of LCA for different scenarios of MSW.  Table 5      References Functional Unit (FU), Software (SW) and Methods Waste Management Scenario/Options Impact assessments Critical Remarks   Cherubini et al. (2009)  FU is 1 tonne of MSW. S0: landfilling S1: biogas recovery from landfill S2: waste sorting plant S3: waste Incineration Landfilling is worst waste management option. GWP, AP, EP and Dioxin emissions are major environmental impacts. Sorting plant with biogas recovery and incineration would be the best option  Cleary (2009)  FU and SW are MSW and LCA computer software, respectively. Secondary literature data is used in Method. Secondary literature data AP and GWP effects are more common. Comparative analysis study suggested that many LCA users don't make clear decision during goal and scope phase  Koroneos and Nanaki (2012)  FU: LCA for Integrated SWM and energy production- A case Study SW: SimaPro 5 Methods: Landfilling, Biological treatment, paper recycling S1: Leachate and Biogas production are not utilized S2: Without capturing energy, biogas burned. S3: No utilization of thermal energy. S Biocells: Biocell can be used as utilization of biogas and leachate collection Energy recovery from biogas is expected to replace part of the Lignite electricity recovery. HH, EQ and RD are major environmental impacts. Segregation and collection at source and recycling of the segregated waste are needed. Modern sanitary landfill site should be equipped with sorting and material recovery plants.  Elwan et al. (2013)  FU: 3.52 KTonnes waste SW: GaBi v.4 Scenarios are not available Reduced emission to the air 5 tonnes to −10 kg CO2  eq., fresh water from 4 kg to −2 kg CO2  eq. AP, EP, GWP are major environmental impacts. Gasification is used to generate energy from the waste and its impact on the environment is negative.  Babu et al. (2014)  FU: 4500 tonnes Methods: Buswell and Mueller equation S1: Open dumps S2: Landfilling S3: Landfilling with recovery of gas S4: Bioreactor landfill Open dumping has the highest impacts (EDP, GWP, EP) on the Environment S1 has the highest and S4 has least impact on environment. Bioreactor landfill system proved better option as compared with the other scenarios, but the initial cost is very high and cost recovery period is ~50 years.  Fernandez-Nava et al. (2014)  FU: 480 Ktonnes of Municipal waste generated in Asturias SW: SimaPro and Ecoinvent Methods: Environmental impact categories S0: Landfilling with biogas recovery S1: Incineration of waste with energy reclamation S2: Source separated organic fraction converted into biomethanization, Sorting and incineration of rejected waste S3: Biomethanization, Sorting, and incineration S4: Biomethanization, Sorting, Aerobic stabilization of biodegradable fraction and Incineration S5: Biomethanization, Sorting, Aerobic stabilization and landfilling S3 has the least contribution to the HH category. Landfilling is the worst application in the damage categories. Major impacts are HH, EQ, GWP, RD Landfill produces the maximum environmental impacts in all analyzed damage categorize. Biomethanization contributes the reduction impact of damage categories. Incineration is always affecting the damage categories of human health and climate change but it is help to reduce the damage in resource category.  Ghinea et al. (2014)  FU: Waste management and recycled paper system SW: GaBi Methods: all the input and output assessment S1: Sorting, composting and landfilling S2: sorting, composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration S3: Sorting, composting, incineration and landfilling S4: Sorting, composting and incineration S3 is the most environments friendly than other scenarios which cases AP, EP, GWP, POCP, HTP, AD impacts. Tissue paper manufacturing scenarios developed, which propose the use of recycled fibers from recovered paper as raw materials, instead of virgin fibers.  Jeswani and Azapagic (2016)  FU: Disposal of 1 tonne of waste and electricity generation from MSW SW: GaBi v6.4 S1: Incineration (only electricity) S2: Incinerator (CHP) S3: Landfilling (only electricity) S4: Landfilling (CHP) Electricity and CHP incinerator estimates 496 and 487 kg CO2  eq. per tonne of waste without credits of recovered materials but with credits it has reduced to 174 and 58 kg CO2  eq. per tonne of waste. From Landfill electricity without credit is 271 kg CO2  eq. per tonne of waste and with credits 240 kg CO2  eq. per tonne of waste. The major impacts are GWP, ADP, EP, ODP, HTP, POCP. Electricity generation from incineration would have higher impact on environment as compared with from landfilling.  Sharma and Chandel (2017)  FU: 1 tonne of waste SW: GaBi v6.0 Method: IPCC S1: Open dumping, bioreactor landfilling S2: MRF, SLF S3: MRF, composting, SLF S4: MRF, AD, SLF S5: MRF, composting, SLF, AD S6: MRF, composting, incineration S7: MRF, Incineration The result was found that S5 had minimum environmental impacts (GWP, EP, AP, HT). Energy recovery from all the scenarios is saves the environment significantly.  Havukainen et al. (2017)  FU: MSW SW: GaBi v6.0 Methods: CML-2010 S1: Landfill S2: Incineration S3: RDF S4: AD AD plant has the lowest environmental effects (GWP, AP, EP). RDF has the highest potential for energy recovery as compared with MSW incineration.  Yadav and Samadder (2017)  FU: 1 tonne of MSW SW: SimaPro v8.0.1 Methods: CML Baseline 2000 S1: Transportation and collection S2: Base case scenario S3: Landfilling and composting S4: Composting, landfilling and recycling S4 had the lowest environmental impacts viz., GWP, EP, AP, ODP, POCP, HTP, AD, as compared with other three scenarios. S2 has the maximum impact on the environment (GWP, POCP and EP) and existing waste management practices is not suitable for climatic conditions.  Cetinkaya et al. (2018)  FU: Solid waste composition SW: SimaPro and Ecoinvent Methods: Library of Ecoinvent-3 and Impact 2002+  to assess the chemical toxicity S1: 75% landfill, 25% composting S2: 50% landfill, 35% AD, 15% incineration S3: 35% landfill, 25% AD, 25% AD, 15% Incineration S4: 30% landfill, 70% incineration The lowermost values for four types of damage categories (HH, EQ, CC, RD) are in S1. It shows S1 75% of landfilling is a good option to decrease the environmental damages but landfilling without any prior treatment is the worst application.  Cremiato et al. (2018)  FU: Effect of AD, MRF and secondary fuel production SW: GaBi Methods: Environmental impact of MSWM using LCA S1: Source separation having diversion rate 50% S2: Improved base case with diversion rate up to 60% S3: MRF and AD with diversion rate of 50% S4: Improved MRF and AD with diversion rate up to 60% Improved MRF and Anaerobic digestion with diversion rate up to 60% is a good option for decrease on environmental burdens (AP, GWP, HTP, POCP, EP).

Department of Environmental Engineering, Marwadi University, Rajkot, Gujarat, 360-003, India.. Department of Environmental Engineering Marwadi University Rajkot Gujarat 360-003 India       Open dumping is a common practice for MSW disposal in most of the Indian cities, apart from the metro-cities. This practice poses significant environmental and health risks due to toxic and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission through direct combustion and/or decay of wastes. Therefore, integrated solid waste management (ISWM) using different methods viz., incineration, composting, anaerobic digestions, refuse derived fuel, material recovery facility and sanitary landfilling, is much needed. Accordingly, three waste management case scenarios were studied for year 2001–2051 by keeping weightage of sustainable development goals 2030 of India. Case I depicts Indian present scenario of waste management where 164–735 tonnes/year of wastes would be generated for year 2001–2051. Further, 60% of waste can be treated in case II that help in reducing the land requirement up to 40% from estimated conditions of 2031 i.e., 83.8 × 107  m3 . The case III is most ideal waste management condition for year 2031 to reduce 80% waste hence landfill requirement would minimize up to 16.76 × 107  m3  where population is at controlled conditions. This article concludes the formal handling and treatment of ISWM would minimize the landfilling, where LCA can be an antidote to achieve sustainable development goals.

Globally, the major contributory countries in solid waste generation and their treatment are presented in Table 1   (Rigamonti et al., 2016; Sanchez et al., 2015; Taweesan et al., 2016 ). It infers that India stands fifth with a generation of 0.12 million tonnes/day solid wastes in the year 2016, behind the USA, China, Brazil, and Japan (World Bank, 2005 ). The approximation of worldwide municipal solid waste (MSW) generation is more catastrophic and anticipated to be more than 2200 million tonnes/year by 2025 (Tyagi et al., 2018 ). The 1.36 billion population of India is also expected to generate more than 56 million tonnes/year of MSW with a yearly growth rate of 5% (CPCB Report, 2017-18; EAI, 2019 EAI Report, 2019 ; Generation of solid waste, 2018). Therefore, generation of huge volume of MSW, due to the ceaseless urbanization of rural India, is exceeding its carrying capacity with the limited geographical area and facing a major challenge for safe disposal of MSW. The combination of household and commercial refuse/waste in the Indian MSW usually dominated by the organic constituents (70–80%), while rest belongs to the inorganic compounds (Gupta et al., 2015; Ramachandra et al., 2018 ). Therefore, a direct landfill disposal (without any pre-treatment) of MSW causes several geo-environmental issues such as emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and hazardous volatile organic compounds, rotten odors, and groundwater contamination due to leaching and seepage (Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2017; Gouveia and do Prado, 2009; Patil et al., 2017 ). Moreover, Singh et al. (2014)  have noted that ~11% of the global methane is produced due to the mismanagement of MSW and considered as the third largest anthropogenic source of GHGs. However, direct combustion is also a common practice to handle the MSW which is an unfavorable option (Mittal et al., 2017 ), as direct combustion of 1 Tonne MSW generates ~1090 kg CO2  equivalents (Botello-Alvareza et al., 2018 ). In the Indian scenario, both the direct combustion and landfill disposal without prior treatment are in practice, except few metro-cities of India (Rana et al., 2019; Rathore et al., 2019 ). Henceforth, two major challenges are recognized to be responsible for the improper management of MSW, these are: (i) collection and segregation of MSW and, (ii) the informal recycling and lack of treatment facilities (Babu et al., 2014; Botello-Alvareza et al., 2018; Mohanty et al., 2014 ). Looking at the huge volume of waste generation, its management is a tedious task in India which requires proper planning to handle such problem in a sustainable manner (Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al., 2017; Ramachandra et al., 2014; Yadav and Samadder, 2017  & 2018 ). The Government of India has taken significant step imposing the Waste-to-energy (WtE) policy under the Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) Rules. In this context, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), 2014 has reported that 1460 MW of energy can be obtained from the MSW (EAI, 2019; Kalyani and Pandey, 2014; Singh et al., 2014 ). Consequently, co-processing and co-generation technologies, part of integrated solid waste management (ISWM) plays significant role for managing Indian MSW. In these technologies, waste produced from one process can have potential use for another process such as kitchen wastes are used for composting and anaerobic digestion (Reza et al., 2013 ). This may bring sustainability in the environment, economy, and technical aspects; where the formal collection, transport, treatment, elimination and landfilling are included (Solid Waste Management, 2016 ). Nevertheless, the ISWM requires the concurrent fulfillment of the environmental, economic, technical, and societal constraints and it can be estimated by using life cycle analysis (LCA) tool in MSW. It includes an entire range from collection to treatment approaches that would handle all the possible materials of the waste stream (Rajamanikam et al., 2014; Sharma and Chandel, 2017 ). Therefore, LCA is the decision-making tool which can be helpful to govern the environmental and economic viability in the management of MSW (ISO 14040- 1997; ISO 14040- 2006 ). LCA can be divided into four steps as shown in Fig. 1   (Koroneos and Nanaki, 2012; Kulczycka et al., 2015; Lam et al., 2018 ). Moreover, looking at the major shift towards LCA in MSWM, the current practices in India along with the LCA guidelines in waste management system is vital to understand that can give a pathway to develop a better MSWM system in the country. Further, environmental impact and economic feasibility of MSW are discussed to harness the energy and potential material before MSW reaches to landfill.  2 Literature framework This study describes the waste management practices in India including waste generation from residential/commercial sectors, transportation, segregation, treatment and disposal in urban and metro cities of India. Further, study focuses on utilization of LCA for potential recovery of energy and materials from waste. This would minimize environment and economic impact and able to fulfill the sustainable development goals by 2030. It also highlights the formal treatment of MSW which utilizes cleaner technologies may improve the environmental and social impacts. The entire manuscript can be explored with waste management practices in India, treatment methods and impact analysis using LCA, Furthermore, three case scenarios are presented using hypothetical model to reduce the waste generation. It also minimizes the landfill space requirements and indicates the sustainable approach for waste disposal. The study focuses on global and Indian scenario of MSWM, MSW composition and management options, efficacy of LCA studies with functional unit and system boundary, and recommendation for best MSWM options in India including three different case scenarios that describe the sustainable perspectives of waste to resource for 2030.  3 Waste management in India The MNRE has identified huge energy potential for MSW that usually contains 50% biodegradable substances, 20% recyclable matters, and 30% inert and inorganic materials like sands, pebbles, and gravels (Planning commission India, 2014). The metropolitan cities and towns of different states of India generate ~0.5 kg/capita/day MSW however the amount of annual solid waste generations in urban areas and its collection in different states are shown Table 2  . Joshi and Ahmed (2016)  have reported that only 12–14% of the MSW is formally treated in India and rest are directly sent to open dumping and landfill disposal options, refer Fig. 2  a and b. On the other hand, the Planning Commission Report (2014)  has revealed around 377 million people residing in the urban areas are generating 62 million tonnes/year of MSW, which is anticipated to be 165 million tonnes/year and 436 million tonnes/year by the year 2031 and 2050, respectively. To accommodate this amount of generated MSW, the corresponding requirement of landfill space would be 23.5 × 107  m3  by 2031 and 43 × 107  m3  by 2050, piled up in 20 m height. The MSWM guidelines enforced to minimize the burden from landfills by recovering potential material and energy from the MSW. The current MSWM practices are shown in Fig. 3  , whereas 145 million tonnes of MSW is generated every day and further processed through MSW guidelines. In this practice, 85% of MSW is collected by Municipal Corporation and rest 15% waste is directly goes on open dumping. Of late, 30% of collected waste is getting treated and rest 70% wastes are preferred for landfilling options. However, several issues are encountered during implementation of MSWM guidelines in different cities of India such as formal collections, segregation, waste utilization awareness, and treatment, which has been summarized in Table 3  . To create awareness in waste management sector Clean India Mission is introduced by government where cities are getting rewards and recognition based on cleanliness and converting waste into wealth. Consequently, six WtE plants are functioning in India with cumulative installed capacity of 114.08 MW (MNRE report, 2018 ). It promotes segregation at source and formal treatment of MSW (Swachh Survekshan, 2019 ). The planning commission report of India (2014)  stated that only 31% expense share is for formal management of the MSW (12% from private parties, 12% central and 7% state governments), therefore informal sectors are mainly involved in collection and handling of MSW. However, 80–85% of cost spent on collection and transportation of waste and only 15–20% goes for treatment, which is very nominal cost. The overall treatment and disposal cost for MSW is shown in Table 4  . Owing to this, several environmental and economic issues are being raised with informal handling and disposal of MSW (Singh and Basak, 2018; Singh and Francis, 2017 ). It leads to environmental degradation and has severe impacts on human health (Joshi and Ahmed, 2016 ) as mentioned in the subsequent section. 3.1 Environmental and health impacts due to MSW Direct combustion and decay of MSW in open space causes gaseous emissions, mixing of particulate matters and volatile matters in the air, chemical and biological contamination in soil and groundwater due to seepage (Cremiato et al., 2018; Fernandez-Nava et al., 2014; Olaniyan et al., 2015 ). However, decomposition of organic waste produces huge amount of methane (greenhouse) gas that contributes to enhance the global temperature and changes the climatic conditions (Cetinkaya et al., 2018 ). Moreover, high organic contents in MSW increases the growth of microbial pathogens and may lead to infectious and chronic diseases to waste workers, rag pickers and people living in/nearby vicinity (Arafat et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2018; Marshal, 1995 ). Numerous health problems like respiratory system, skin irritation, eyes and nose, gastrointestinal problems, allergies and psychological disorders are noticed due to burning of MSW or pathogenic microbes (Salemdeeb et al., 2017; Kandasamy et al., 2013 ). In this context, glimpse of environmental and health impact due to MSW can be seen in Fig. 4  . Subsequently, Jayakrishnan et al. (2013)  have done study on occupational health and safety of workers who were associated with Kolkata and Mumbai Municipal Corporation and found that ~71% of waste collectors from Kolkata and 25% from Mumbai were suffering with respiratory diseases. Besides, other problems like chemical poisoning, low birth rate, cancer, congenital malformations, nausea and vomiting, neurological diseases are caused due to the mixing up of uncontrolled hazardous and electronic wastes with solid waste (Pathak et al., 2017 ). The risk of Hepatitis B and HIV are increased due to mixing of health care products and household biomedical wastes with domestic waste that disposed to dumping sites without treatment (MSW rules, 2016).   4 Assessment of impacts associated with MSW through life cycle analysis Life cycle analysis (LCA) helps in estimating the environmental burdens that occur during collection, treatment and disposal of waste (Winkler and Bilitewski, 2007 ). Different scenarios of waste management are being used to minimize their associated environmental impacts and some of them are shown in Table 5   (Cherubini et al., 2009; Fernandez-Nava et al., 2014 ). In the LCA study, generation of MSW is considered as the functional unit, FU (1 tonne of waste generated), whereas collection and transportation of MSW, its treatment and disposal, incineration, composting and landfilling methods are known as the system boundaries between product and waste management (Evangelisti et al., 2015; Havukainen et al., 2017 ). Further, environmental impacts can be determined within system boundaries of unit process, where time, space and functions are considered as the system boundaries (Cleary, 2009 ). The obtained processed data from system boundary is used in different softwares viz., SimaPro, OpenLCA, GaBi which includes different algorithms that determine the life cycle impact assessment, LCIA and life cycle costing, LCC (Gentil et al., 2010 ). The inbuilt secondary literature data and libraries in the software are being used to interpret the process impacts and help to analyze environmental costs and economical cost (Winkler and Bilitewski, 2007 ). Abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), acidification potential, global warming potential (GWP), ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation potential and resource depletion are significant environmental impacts produced by traditional MSWM practices (Cetinkaya et al., 2018; Fernandez-Nava et al., 2014 ). However, studies have shown that sorting of waste and changing raw materials may decrease environmental issues which promotes economic and environmental benefits (Arena et al., 2003; Bueno et al., 2015; Cherubini et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, LCA can also be useful in managing MSW for big events like world cup cricket tournaments, new year celebration, Kumbh Mela in India otherwise, it is difficult to manage waste due to various factors such as participation of different groups of people and complex waste disposal design procedure (Parkes et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2017; Swachh Survekshan, 2019 ). Therefore, it necessitates estimating environmental and economic costs prior to the events (Liikanen et al., 2018 ). The environmental cost of big events can determine using LCIA which entails the total environmental cost of a product service throughout its life cycle where the negative externalities such as pollution in air, water and soil are quantified during waste generation, collection, and treatment process. On the other hand, economic cost can overcome by the recovering material and energy from MSW and these reclamation options can be introduced into the events that can reduce the primary resource utilization. It is also opined that organic waste for aerobic and anaerobic conditions have good synergy between material recovery and energy generation instead employing conventional treatment method (Thomsen et al., 2017; Tyagi et al., 2018; Yap and Nixon, 2015 ). Further, the remaining waste goes to incineration and sanitary landfilling options (India Environmental Portal, 2018; Gradus et al., 2017; Kalyani and Pandey, 2014 ). Henceforth, circular economy is being promoted in ISWM where recycled materials (compost and compressed natural gas obtained from waste) are encouraged to use as raw materials instead of employing natural materials for manufacturing (Malinauskaite et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015; Waste to Energy, 2016 ). Further, it is also noted that WtE is suitable for minimizing carbon footprint by shifting the generation of electricity from fossil-fuel to waste. Consequently, it prevents uncontrolled methane gas emission from the landfill site and reduces the global warming potential (Waste to Energy, 2016 ).  5 Preeminent waste management methods for Indian MSW 5.1 Composting Composting is one of the most widely used treatment method in Indian MSW where organic waste fraction is 60–70% as mentioned in Table 2 . In this method, microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae and protozoa degrade the organics under controlled environmental conditions and acquire compost matter used as soil conditioner (Bohacz, 2018 ). The aerobic decomposition of organic fraction is shown in Eq. (1) .[1] Organic  matter +  O  2    → Compost + CO  2   + H  2   O + NO  3  −   + SO  4  2 −   + Heat      In the composting process, food waste and garden trimmings of MSW is used as a feed and four major reaction stages occurs in composting process as shown in Table 6  . Different types of aerobic composting methods such as windrow composting, aerated static pile composting, in-vessel composting and vermicomposting are widely used in India. Apart from the conventional methods of composting, some advanced technologies for composting have been developed like Bangalore method, Indore method and Coimbatore method that changes the reaction phase by varying location, climatic conditions, soil, types of microorganisms/worms, fly species, types of waste, particle size, pH of soil, moisture holding capacity of soil and carbon to nitrogen ratio (Cickova et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2018 ). It was also noted that temperature and pH have significant role for survivals of fly in composting method where 20 °C − 40 °C temperature is optimum for growth of flies though pH less than 4 would not be good for development of fly (Tomberlin et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2018 ). A piece of land either on-site or off-site with proper upholding of aerobic conditions, suitable microorganisms, optimum temperature and moisture for microbes survival, are utmost important factors for composting process. The compost gets ready within 2–4 weeks to few months. It is rich in nutrients and used directly for gardening, horticulture and agricultural activities where it serves as soil conditioner. There are several applications for compost materials such as preventing soil erosion, land and soil reclamation, construction of wetlands and landfill covers. It is noted that composting method is economical and technically viable for its implementation; it helps in reducing the volume of MSW and may turn this waste into a resource. Further, it can be commercialized and able to generate revenue for the country. However, the biggest challenge in this method is for survival of microorganisms with optimum environmental conditions. There are few other environmental issues also associated with composting such as contamination at surface and underground water by leakage of leachate, acidifying the land, odour and health impacts due to consumption of contaminated water. However, if the environmental conditions maintain well then composting can reduce 20–25% of carbon emission from MSW and help in minimizing the landfill disposal.  5.2 Anaerobic digestion/biomethanation Anaerobic digestion (Biomethanation) is a process where organic matter is allowed to decompose in anaerobic conditions to generate carbon dioxide and methane as major by-products. The digestate (solid residue of the process) can be recycled as manure or soil conditioner. It is noted that during this process 55–60% of methane is obtained which can be used as fuel for various industrial and residential purpose. Ahsan (1999)  has estimated that the controlled anaerobic digester can generate 2–4 times more methane from 1 tonne of MSW within 3 weeks as compared to landfills which may take 6–7 years. In India several cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Nagpur, Pune, Lucknow, Indore have adopted this technology for harnessing methane (renewable energy) from MSW (Swachh Survekshan, 2019 ). Further, 75 Indian cities were assessed by Saini et al. (2012)  which generate energy from MSW (includes ≥40% organic fractions, ≥45% moisture and 20–30% Carbon to Nitrogen ratio). The net power generation potential (NPGP) from MSW was calculated by using following equations.[2] NPGP  ( kW  )  = P × Q     [3] P  = X × Y × Z × L × W  1   × 10  3       [4] Q = W  2   × CV × h      Where, X is produced biogas (m3  per kg of volatile solids per day), Y is efficiency of digester (%), Z is total organic fraction (%), L is organic biodegradable fraction (%), W1  is total waste generated everyday in tonnes, h is conversion efficiency (%), W2  is a constant obtained from (860 × 24)−1 , CV is calorific value of MSW (kcal/m3 ). This technology is suitable for Indian MSW where organic solid waste has high potential for methane generation. Moreover, this process does not consume any external energy, no issues of odour and rodents during operation, and later generated methane and CO2  gases can easily store within the tank. Further, these gases are taken out for energy generation and digestate slurry used as soil conditioner.  5.3 Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is also known as the mechanical biological treatment (MBT), most convenient method to utilize the non-biodegradable combustible material such as plastic, paper, labels, and cardboard which cannot be used for recycling purpose (Sharholy et al., 2008 ). It has higher calorific value thus can be used as a feedstock material for waste to energy plant. In India, many metro and urban cities viz., Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Indore, Rajkot are having RDF plant which produces fluffy solid fuels and pallets that can be used as an alternate fuel materials in the industry. This method is technically proven method for the MSW that reduces the environment and land impacts (Sharma and Chandel, 2017 ). The calorific value of the RDF is ranged between 8 and 14 MJ/kg, the produced energy/electricity can be used for district heating system, and industrial purpose. Therefore, RDF is a good substitute for fossil fuel to produce energy in production of steel and kilns of cement (Govani et al., 2019 ). In India, overall 36 RDF facilities are operational and many more RDF facilities are under planning phase to generate segregated combustible fraction (SCF) which utilizes around 10% of the total waste generation. The government of India has made a rule for industries to utilize at least 5%–15% replacement fuel from the RDF. Applications of SCF/RDF are sustainable to the environment, through the diversion the waste amount from the landfill and reduction of GHG emissions (SWM Rules, 2016). In this context, RDF is useful, economic, and convenient tool to optimize the environmental impacts.  5.4 Material recovery facility (MRF) In India, waste segregation at source is not being practiced properly and therefore it necessitates a centralized material recovery facility to segregate the non-biodegradable content from the mixed waste. Further, it can be directly sent to the authorized recyclers for material recovery. Poor waste management facility in India is contributing 11% of the GHGs emissions (Ramachandra et al., 2018 ). In addition, MRF separates and stores hazardous waste before it reaches to landfill with various methods that enable to reduce landfill volume and environmental impacts. Informal sectors of waste management play a significant role to reduce the amount of MSW through the recycling and reusing of waste but it causes several environmental and social issues (Sharma and Chandel, 2017 ). In this context, some organisation like Chintan Environmental Research & Action Group is working on MSW recycling project where unsorted waste from New Delhi railway station is collected. Further it recycled to recover potential materials from waste and reduces the carbon footprints (India Environment Portal, 2009 ). The prime focus of this project is to educate and aware people who are associated with informal waste management sector. The rag-pickers are getting trained for separate collection of the biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste at the collection center where organic waste goes for the composting or anaerobic digestion and non-biodegradable waste for mechanically sorted into several recyclable resources. This MRF facility achieved diversion amount ~21 tonnes of waste from the 3 different landfill sites and gained profits from this work are used for spreading awareness and providing educational facilities to the rag-pickers and their community.   6 Integrated waste management approach for sustainable India and futuristic perspective LCA advocates that the integrated solid waste management system not only reduces the amount of waste but also has the potential to recover material and energy out of it. In this context, contributions of integrated waste management approach for urban areas are important. Herein, waste has been divided in organic and inorganic fractions by highlighting the different scenarios for treating the MSW as presented in Fig. 5  . It is expected that 40% organic waste get treated equally with composting and anaerobic digestion or biogas production. Further, as per India’s 2030 plan 20% inorganic plastic waste can be used as RDF and rest 40% waste goes for the incineration and sanitary landfilling for energy recovery. This estimation would be feasible with successful implementation of six beneficial sub scenarios in solid waste management practices for sustainable India. 6.1 Environmental education in waste management practices Environmental education is a preliminary approach from the government to educate all the individuals of India towards reduction of waste and utilize it as a resource. In this context, primary and secondary education in school and colleges can make significant influence towards sustainable waste management practices in India. Moreover, environmental education not only describes the environmental issues of solid waste but it also gives roadmap to Indian agronomy to proceed towards sustainability whereas processed household waste (compost) can be a good conditioning of the soil and nutrients in agriculture field. Further, huge amount of waste is generated from agricultural field can be utilized in waste to energy plant of India. Thus, educating individuals towards environment may also open the employment opportunity in India.  6.2 Governmental policies and initiatives in MSWM Government of India has made waste management rules and policies to promote the safe management of MSW and protect the public health. In this context, government of India started clean India Mission in 2014 under MSWM rule (2000) . In line with this rule, waste to wealth policies was made where waste generator will take responsibility to segregate their waste in biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. Further, MSW treatment guidelines under SWM rules (2016) states all the organic waste either be used in composting or anaerobic digestion to generate energy. On the other hand, non-recyclable waste with 1500 K/cal/kg should not dispose to landfill rather it should use in energy generation. It is also being recommended that high calorific value waste should go for co-processing in thermal power plant or cement industries. Consequently, government has also made regulations for assessing environmental parameters before establishing waste to energy plant. Therefore, few technologies are shown in Fig. 5  to treat the MSW as mentioned in the following sections.  6.3 Composting techniques in ISWM system India has huge potential to utilize organic solid waste. In this context, government of India has emphasized that all organic waste should be processed for making compost. The ministry of chemical and fertilizers of India has made a policy to ‘make compost, use compost’. Till date 5% of organic waste is being used in making of compost however, for sustainable waste management system it is recommended that 20% of organic waste should be utilized to make compost as shown in Fig. 5 . In addition, to implement composting process in Indian scenario, segregation of solid waste is utmost important. In India, Bangalore and Indore methods are commonly being used to make compost. Further, based on color of compost i.e. dark black or dark brown its function is being decided which would be used for soil conditioning or as soil nutrients. Hence, it is more feasible and fastest method for decomposition of solid waste in aerobic condition.  6.4 Anaerobic digestion for producing energy Remaining 20% of organic solid waste is proposed for anaerobic degradation, refer Fig. 5 . In this method, organic fraction containing municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, agriculture waste are used and further biogas is produced which is clean and renewable energy source. The produced biogas (CH4 :CO2 ) ranges from 0.28 m3  to 2.38 m3 . On the other hand, obtained digested sludge can be used as fertilizer in Indian agronomy. Therefore, Indian solid waste is considered as one of the potential source of renewable energy (biogas).  6.5 Incineration Incineration technology is an easiest method to deal with solid waste in presence of air at 850 °C temperature. However, in this process carbon dioxide is emitted in the atmosphere and non-combustible materials i.e., ash is produced. Various types of incinerators such as moving grate, fixed grate, rotary-kiln, and fluidized bed are developed to deal with solid waste. However, incineration technology is not much recommended by Indian municipal solid waste due to high moisture content (40%–60%) and low calorific value (800–1100 kcal/kg) in MSW. It is reported that an incinerator installed at Timarpur, Delhi capable of generating 3.75 MW power from 300 TPD MSW could not operate successfully due to low net calorific value of MSW. Hence, the plant is lying idle and the investment is wasted.  6.6 Sanitary landfilling Landfilling is final waste disposal method with different liners and has earth cover on top of it. It is the most common and economical disposal method in developing countries. A landfill is a facility which is designed for the safe disposal of solid wastes. The bottom liners and a top cover of the landfill are considered as the most critical components that prevent leachate penetration into the soil. It also produces landfill gases (LFGs) i.e. CH4  which may cause global pollution and leachate which can harm human and natural systems. Landfill gases, LFGs produced when methanogens decompose complex molecules, are primarily methane and carbon dioxide (up to 90%), but also include CO, N2 , alcohols, hydrocarbons, organosulfur compounds, and heavy metals. Leachate can cause surface water and ground water pollution. These gases have been treated and further utilized for energy production. The bioreactor landfill is one of the emerging technologies introduced by several cities of India. It utilizes the LFGs for electricity production. The Kanjurmarg landfill in Mumbai, India has introduced bioreactor first time in India which has 1.9 MW of electricity generation. This technology can save the global warming issues of world and also minimize electricity consumption of waste disposal plant. Henceforth, based on above discussion, a hypothetical sustainability model is proposed for three different case scenarios where population, amount of generated MSW and land requirement are considered utmost important parameters for sustainable management of waste. Amongst three case scenarios, Case-I belongs to the actual scenario which is being observed at present time. Case-II represents the controlled and well-managed waste management system and land required in accordance to achieve the sustainable development goals for 2030. Though, Case-III is the most ideal condition where controlled population and controlled waste generation and management system is hypothesized. Notably, 2001 is considered as the base year in this study per day waste generation is 0.45 million tonnes. The population data has been taken from the census report of India (Census, 2001  & 2011 ) and further geometric mean method is employed to forecast the population until year 2051. With increasing population and changes in the living standard of people, the rate of waste generation is estimated to be increased by ~5% on yearly basis (CPCB, 2016 -17). Thus, the waste generation will get increased from 164 million tonnes/year to 735 million tonnes/year within the year 2001–2051, respectively as shown in Fig. 6  . Owing to this, requirement of landfill space would be increasing to dispose the MSW and it may exceed the carrying capacity of land which leads to sustainability issues as shown in Table 7  . Therefore, it is utmost important to estimate the future requirement of land area that has been calculated by following the MSW guidelines (2000) where density of compacted MSW is kept 500 kg/m3  and height of landfill is assumed 30 m. Different case scenarios of sustainable waste management from 2021 to 2051 is presented in Table 8  , which states that as population is increasing waste generation rate would be more. Therefore, it is highly recommended to minimize the growth of population and waste generation. The case I shows population is tremendously increasing from year 2001–2051 that maximize the waste generation and necessitate large land volume from 32.8 × 107  m3  to 147 × 107  m3  as shown in Fig. 7  a. Case II is anticipated with 60% waste reduction of the total waste generation and further land requirement is calculated accordingly. Reduction of waste amount can be diverted through best waste management scenarios as mentioned in section 5 . Based on the Indian MSW composition, the biodegradable to non-degradable waste ratio is kept 60:40. In this case, 100% waste is assumed to be generated every day where 20% of which directed for composting, 20% for biogas production through anaerobic digestion, 20% will be utilized for the RDF and MRF, and rest 40% waste would have landfilling options. In this view, the quantity of waste to go for landfilling will be reduced; therefore, the resultant land requirement will be reduced as shown in Fig. 7 b. Case III is taken for the most ideal condition, where population is controlled and as per Indian waste composition 80% of MSW can be maximum recycled. Considering that population is balanced up to 1.77 billion with available natural resources after 2025 and the waste treatment is done effectively to reduce the amount of MSW. Thus, reducing the land requirement for waste disposal as presented in Fig. 7 c. These are proposed hypothetical scenario which entails the population must be maintained based on carrying capacity of land where waste should be utilized as a resource and it may lead to zero landfilling. The potential tapping of WtE program by utilizing the source of MSW can be one of the leading pathways to achieve the 10 GW bio energy productions by 2022. Therefore, the applicability of LCA seems to be a good tool for the prior estimation of environmental and economic costs (Gentil et al., 2010 ). It is estimated that segregation of waste by combining with production of biogas and electricity would be the best preferable options for MSW. In this context, composting, biomethanation, MRF, RDF and sanitary landfilling options are preferable for Indian MSW and it may decrease the environmental damages. It is estimated that 1 tonne of organic waste can generate 20–80 m3  of biogas and 474 kWh of energy. Therefore, aforementioned techniques should be employed after determining its associated environmental, social and economic impact. The LCA and LCIA can help in addressing the environmental and social issues of MSWM and can bring sustainability in nation by following the goals of United Nations sustainable development (Rodic and Wilson, 2017 ). It includes various societal and environmental issues such as sanitation, public health, climate change, global warming issues, and life on land and below the water (UNSDG, 2015 ). Out of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) 10 goals are directly or indirectly identified from MSW as shown in Table 9   and can be minimized by adopting LCA as a broader spectrum in integrated MSWM. Henceforth, it is recommended that there should be prerequisite to determine LCA primary data for MSWM in India. Further, MSWM projections can be made based on case scenarios II and III which infers the waste utilizations effectively for sustainable development.   7 Concluding remarks The present review highlights the significance of LCA in Indian MSWM system which provides different scenarios such as composting, anaerobic digestion, incinerations, landfilling. These methods are not only minimizing environmental issues but have enough potential to maximize the economic and technical aspects of waste. It is acclaimed that segregation of waste, combining with electricity and biogas recovery would be the best option for MSWM. Whereas, LCA should be prerequisite in MSWM to fulfill the purpose of solid waste management practices and achieve the environmental targets in minimizing the associated impacts. Moreover, WtE practices avoid the potential materials loss from MSW that increases the environmental and economic impacts. However, incentives and training to formal and informal sectors are highly needed to do segregation at source that minimizes the losses of energy and material. Based on this observation, it is concluded that LCA and WtE practices are key factors of ISWM which helps to bring environment and economic sustainability. In this context, case scenario II and III shows minimization of MSW from 60 to 80% which would reduce required land capacity for MSW from 335.2 million m3  to 167.6 million m3  till year 2031. It can help in minimizing adverse impacts associated with MSW and fulfill the goals of sustainable development introduced by United Nations.
