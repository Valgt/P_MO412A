                  This paper is aimed at examining and analyzing the contribution of palm oil smallholders to the achievement of the SDGs. Another objective is to determine the highest SDGs that contribute to the achievement of SDGs by examining 13 SDGs out of 17 SDGs analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate composite SDGs index. The survey was conducted in 7 provinces in Indonesia which are oil palm centers in Indonesia. Data was obtained from interviews with 3060 smallholder oil palm farmers divided into 3 strata based on the area of oil palm land owned. The results showed that the SDG composite index of smallholders reached 77.57 %, which informed that smallholder oil palm had reached 77.57 % of the 2030 SDGS target. This achievement is greater than the national achievement which reached 70.16 %. Of the 13 SDGs analyzed, SDG17 achieved the weakest followed by SDG5. While the highest achievement was obtained by SDG1 which was followed by SDG6 and SDG8. In the future, more comprehensive cross-sectoral research related to the achievement of SDGs, especially related to the impact of government policy interventions on the achievement of SDGs.

This paper is aimed at examining and analyzing the contribution of palm oil smallholders to the achievement of the SDGs. Another objective is to determine the highest SDGs that contribute to the achievement of SDGs by examining 13 SDGs out of 17 SDGs analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate composite SDGs index. The survey was conducted in 7 provinces in Indonesia which are oil palm centers in Indonesia. Data was obtained from interviews with 3060 smallholder oil palm farmers divided into 3 strata based on the area of oil palm land owned. The results showed that the SDG composite index of smallholders reached 77.57 %, which informed that smallholder oil palm had reached 77.57 % of the 2030 SDGS target. This achievement is greater than the national achievement which reached 70.16 %. Of the 13 SDGs analyzed, SDG17 achieved the weakest followed by SDG5. While the highest achievement was obtained by SDG1 which was followed by SDG6 and SDG8. In the future, more comprehensive cross-sectoral research related to the achievement of SDGs, especially related to the impact of government policy interventions on the achievement of SDGs.

This sector contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), provides employment, and has an important function in providing food security. The contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP remains important even though the share of this sector continues to decline along with economic growth. This decline is natural as it occurs in the process of economic growth and structural transformation of a country's economy. The share of the agricultural sector in national GDP decreased from 30 % in 1975 to 15.3 % in 2010 and to 13.28 % in 2021 [1 ]. In addition, the structural transformation that occurred also led to changes in employment dynamics. The share of the agricultural sector labor force also decreased from 62 % in 1975, to 39 % in 2010, and 29.7 % in 2021 [1 ]. Among the agricultural subsectors, plantation crops are a fairly important subsector. This subsector, as reported by BPS [1 ], contributed 3.94 % in 2021 to the national GDP with a growth of 3.52 %. Palm oil is one of the commodities that has a significant contribution to national development. Suharto et al. [2 ] and [3 ] explained that palm oil heads have a role as drivers of agribusiness development downstream, job providers, and state foreign exchange-earners. The palm oil industry has absorbed 4.20 million direct workers and 12 million indirect workers. Furthermore, the contribution of oil palm plantations in Indonesia's trade balance, namely palm oil exports, reached 13.5 % of the average non-oil and gas exports and 3.5 % of the national gross domestic product (GDP). Indonesia and Malaysia are the largest producers and exporters in the world and these two countries have a 90 % share of world exports. Other studies have also shown the significance of oil palm plantations towards poverty reduction and alleviation in Indonesia, as concluded by TNP2K [4 ]. Although this data shows the significance of oil palm plantations, the question that needs to be answered is how much palm oil contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is important and wise to do because the SDGs are often used by governments to combat extreme poverty without neglecting the sustainability of environmental, economic, and social development [5 ]. Various studies have tried to analyze the contribution of the agricultural sector, including oil palm, to the achievement of the SDGs. However, none of these studies quantitatively analyzed the contribution of the agricultural sector. Terlau et al.. [6 ] research, for example, reviews the role of smallholders in achieving the SDGs, which because of their dual functions, smallholders find it difficult to contribute significantly as drivers of sustainable development. Research in South Africa also shows the importance of agriculture's role in poverty reduction, in addition to economic growth and food security [7 ,8 ]. Palm oil studies on the achievement of SDGs were also widely discussed qualitatively and macro perspective including by Purba & Sipayung [9 ], TNP2K [4 ], Sipayung [10 ] Sembiring [11 ]. However, these studies have not comprehensively revealed the contribution of palm oil to poverty alleviation, let alone to other relevant SDGs. A review conducted by Sukiyono et al., [12 ] concluded that oil palm plantations, especially smallholder oil palm, can contribute to 13 relevant SDGs. Departing from the thoughts of Sukiyono et al., [12 ], a necessary and interesting question to be answered is to what extent smallholder oil palm in Indonesia can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs goals. These studies also have not quantitatively evaluated how much palm oil contributes to the targeted achievement of SDGs, including a study of the achievements of each relevant SDGs. Therefore, research aimed at answering this phenomenon is very important to be carried out, especially for stakeholders in formulating relevant policies and to enrich scientific sphere related to sustainable development.Therefore, this study aims to assess and analyse empirically the achievement of the SDGs by smallholder palm oil in Indonesia.  2 Review literature As a concept, development has been associated with diverse meanings, interpretations, and theories. Peet & Hartwick [13 ]; J.A Du Pisani [14 ]; M.P. Todaro & S.C. Smith [15 ]; and Reyes [16 ] and other researchers have provided definitions and interpretations for development. In general, development is defined as a process of activities carried out in a structured, measurable, and deliberate manner to improve the quality and capacity of a country's population or human resources. In some literature, development is often described as a modernization concept Schumpeter [17–19 ] & Tipps [20 ] dependence Cardoso [21 ]; Frank, [22 ]; and Reyes [16 ]); The World Systems  Theory Petras J [23 ]; and Reyes [16 ]); and The Theory of Globalization [24 ]. Although these development theories have weaknesses, in addition to advantages, these theories have paved the way for the current concepts and paradigms of global development, namely sustainability and sustainable development (SD). The term sustainable development appeared in the late 1970s. Despite the many definitions, the most frequently used definition of sustainable development is the one proposed by the Brundtland Commission [25–28 ]. This discussion came to the fore with the emergence of Malthus's population theory in the early 1800s (Dixon & Fallon [29 ]; Coomer [30 ]). In Malthus's theory, human populations tend to grow following a series of measures, whereas the production of natural resources can only grow in arithmetic sequences. Under these conditions, population growth tends to exceed the capacity of natural resources to support needs. from an increase in population [31 ]. Sustainable development consists of four principles [32 ] including the principles of intergenerational equity, intrageneration equity, Integration, and Sustainable Use. Laoura [33 ] explains that intergenerational equity  is related to the recognition of the balance between the needs of the present generation and the needs of future generations in resource utilization. Meanwhile, according to Islam & Jolley [34 ]; Laoura [33 ], the second  principle is related to equality among generations in the equitable use of global resources (equitable use of natural resources). The Integration Principle  concerns a commitment to integrate environmental considerations into development while still paying attention to environmental protection [32 ]. Voigt [35 ] said that this principle of integration is the backbone of sustainable development. Furthermore, the Principle of Sustainable Use  explains the recognition of the impact of technology and social organizations on the ability of the environment to meet inter- and intragenerational needs and the recognition of the interests of future generations. This is reflected in the sustainable use of natural resources (sustainable), prudent (prudent ), rational, wise, and appropriate [32 ,36 ] In general, there are Three Sustainability Pillars  that are interconnected in sustainable development, namely Social, Economic, and Environmental aspects [37–41 ]. These three pillars are interconnected and when combined and applied in real-world situations, they can create a solid foundation for a sustainable world where natural resources are conserved, the environment is protected, the economy is not harmed and the quality of life of the people is improved or maintained. Sustainable development cannot be separated from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were declared in September 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit. The declaration, which calls for a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty, is the first global strategy with measurable targets agreed upon by all UN member states and the world's leading development agencies. There are eight goals set by the 2015 deadline. In its implementation, uneven results or achievements against the MDGs were reported by the [42 ]. Several studies have also been conducted to assess the achievement of MDGs targets. These studies include Brensson [43 ] on poverty alleviation, Mathbor & Pamela [44 ] on the achievement of MDGs 1 in South Asia; Okaka [45 ] on MDGs 2 in Uganda. The general conclusion obtained from these studies is that the achievement of the MDGs target is still on the fairing scale and many studies are carried out on only one MDGs goal. However, several studies also report the achievement of MDGs as a whole, including by Ritchie H. & Roser, M. [46 ] who concluded that there are only 5 indicators out of 17 MDGs indicators that can be achieved. Apart from this fairly fair achievement, the achievement of the MDGs is not without criticism, as written by Guibou, [47 ], among others regarding the process of development, structure, implementation and enforcement of the MDGs. In 2012, on the twentieth anniversary of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), participants of the Rio+20 conference, in Rio de Janeiro, decided to replace the MDGs with Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) in 2015 [42 ]. The SDGs Sustainable Development Goals consist of seventeen of these goals aimed at creating a balance between three aspects of sustainability: economic, social, and environmental [48 ]. The implementation of sustainable development based on a new approach to how to organize and organize the economy should be an important and natural part of daily practice [49 ,50 ]. Scopelliti et al. [51 ] added that the concept of sustainable development has attracted widespread attention compared to other development concepts. Ji [52 ]; Mensah & Enu-Kwesi [53 ]; Pitelis [54 ] argue that sustainable development ensures the utilization of current resources does not eliminate the social, economic, and environmental benefits for future generations. The characteristics of the twelve sustainable development goals (SDGs), according to Fasoli [55 ] and Tosun & Leininger [56 ], are not stand-alone goals, but interdependent but also interrelated. These goals are interconnected, hinting that achieving one goal will lead to the achievement of another [57 ]. Furthermore, the SDGs aim to eliminate poverty in all its forms by 2030 and improve the welfare of the world's poor [58 ], Boas et al., [59 ]). If examined further, eight objectives of a total of 17 SDGs are directly related to agriculture as stated by FAO [60 ]; Farming First [61 ] This idea provides a strong reason or justification for assessing the impact of oil palm plantations, especially for oil palm farmers who are the main actors in the development of oil palm plantations. Of course, this activity will require evidence of how the oil palm development goals are aligned with the SDGs or how the development of oil palm plantations can be directed towards achieving these goals. Several reviews on the contribution of palm oil in its contribution to the SDGs have also been discussed qualitatively and macro, including by Sembiring [11 ]; Sipayung [10 ]; TNP2K [4 ] and Purba & Sipayung [9 ]. This means that this study has not revealed in detail and comprehensively the contribution of palm oil to poverty alleviation, let alone to other relevant SDGs. Although TNP2K [4 ] research has quantitatively revealed the role of oil palm plantations in reducing inequality and poverty, they did not reveal the role of oil palm plantations in other SDG targets. As TNP2K revealed, oil palm plantations can contribute to the achievement of other SDG targets, such as no hunger and combating climate change. The results of the literature review are difficult to find research that specifically examines the contribution of oil palm plantations to the achievement of the SDGs. The study conducted by Sembiring [11 ]; Sipayung [10 ] revealed more of an outline picture of the role that palm oil can play in achieving the SDGs, including in the absorption of labor and initiating the regional economy. Research conducted by Saragih et.al. [62 ] on the sustainability of oil palm development, has not revealed clearly and in detail the relationship between the dimensions used and the SDGs. However, several studies related to the achievement of the SDGs have also been carried out, including the study of Lecuona et al.. [63 ] on cement companies in Mexico, Msofe [64 ] on gender equality in Ziolo et al. [65 ] on the role of sustainable financial innovation in Europe. Again, these studies examine the sectoral role in achieving any of the SDGs, except for the research of Ziolo et al. [65 ] on more complex goals. This information demonstrates the importance and openness of exploring the role of palm oil in achieving the SDGs comprehensively. This is important, according to Collste el at. [66 ], the SDGs and the effectiveness of the policies implemented to achieve each goal are also interrelated. These studies only examine the contribution of palm oil to some relevant SDGs, mainly only on SDGs related to poverty and farmers' welfare. Or in other words, studies have not discussed comprehensively for each pillar of SDGs. A more detailed review was given by Sukiyono, et al. [12 ]. They explained that there are 13 SDGs relevant to smallholder palm oil, which are divided into three SDGs pillars, namely the economic pillar, the social pillar, and the environmental pillar. However, study Sukiyono et al. [12 ], like Indonesian palm oil researchers, have not quantitatively assessed the contribution of palm oil to achieving the SDGs target.  3 Research methods This research was conducted by surveying in 6 (six) provinces in Sumatra and Kalimantan, including Bengkulu, South Sumatra, Jambi, Riau, D.I. Aceh, West Kalimantan, and Central Kalimantan (Fig. 1  ). For every province, two regencies or districts were selected on the basis of the widest smallholder area, except for Bengkulu Province involving 5 districts. Furthermore, two sub-districts were selected from every selected districts also based on the widest smallholder oil palm plantation area. Respondents of this study were oil palm farmers who selected randomly. The number of samples in this study is determined by following closely Roscoe [67 ] suggestion as cited by Sukiyono [68 ]. According to Roscoe, for all types of research, a minimum sample size of 30 is considered sufficient for each research area selected. On this basis, the number of studies in this study is 3060 samples or which are further classified into 3 strata, based on their land plantation ownership. These strata consist of wide (stratum1), medium (stratum2), and narrow (stratum3) land ownership. 3.1 Data analyze Descriptive analysis, both quantitatively and qualitatively, was carried out with a comparative analysis of each variable SDG's achievement. The process of data analysis is carried out simultaneously and cyclically by positioning itself on four axes, namely data collection, data reduction, data presentation, and drawing or verifying conclusions [69 ]. The main method used to analyze qualitative data is to interpret data and information, to relate information, and to look for patterns between events in the topic domain being studied. In this case, all data and information are grouped into conceptual units (domains) which are the main issues. Thus the qualitative analysis becomes an adequate explanatory description (thick description). To assist the discussion, diagrams and illustrative images are also applied. The preparation of the SDGs composite index, hereinafter abbreviated as ISDGs, closely follows the model developed by Andriati & Fahmi [70 ] and Dhaoui [71 ]. Andriati & Fahmi [70 ] analyze and develop the SDGs composite at the provincial level in Indonesia. Dhaoui [71 ] compiled a Composite Index of SDG Achievement using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to determine the degree of variation in the goals of SDGs in the region to achieve development goals through a series of variables. This PCA approach has also been used by Sukiyono et al. [72 ] to classify household vulnerabilities related to the price volatility of oil palm fresh fruit bunches in Bengkulu Province. The ISDGs are designed starting from the indicators generated from the study of Sukiyono et al. [12 ] related to palm oil smallholder, SDGs and their indicators. Sukiyono et al. [12 ] reveal 13 SDGs in which smallholder palm oil can play a role in achieving these SDGs. These SDGs are further classified into 3 (three) development dimensions or pillars including Social, economic, and Environment. The relevant SDGs targets and indicators also follow the concept developed by Sukiyono et al. [12 ] to assess and examine the contribution of smallholder oil palm plantations to the achievement of the SDGs targets.   4 Result and discussion 4.1 Smallholder palm oil profile The profile of farmers has become an important discussion and discussion concerning the development of industries that are partners and the welfare of farmers and other stakeholders. There is an argument that if the farmer profile is identified comprehensively, interventions and policies can be structured and implemented more targeted, efficient, effective, and inclusive. Nevertheless, this identification is in practice not an easy thing, Peasant households can differ from, and or look like, each other in some way. Some households may have the same land area but differ in starting to plant oil palm, or planting oil palm but on different areas of plantation land. Farmers can also sell or consume different proportions or have other non-agricultural sources of income. Furthermore, differences between farmers can also be examined from the composition of household members and experience, and level of education which in turn will influence farmers' behavior in farming. The profile of smallholder palm oil is examined using simple descriptive statistics based on several important characteristics obtained from survey data. These characteristics include the age of farmers, education, and land ownership as presented in Table 2 . The farmer's age is one of the important factors for the sustainability and success of the oil palm plantation business he manages. Many studies show that the age of farmers is related to their business performance, whereas at a productive age, farmers have a high level of productivity or economic efficiency compared to other age groups [73 ]. Research by [74 ] found that farmers' productivity increases as their age increases and then decreases with the addition of their age. Tauer [75 ] even found that efficiency increased by an average of 4.5 % per group of 10 years of age to the age group of 35 – 44 years, which then decreased at the same rate. Furthermore, Hlouskova & Prasilova [76 ] found that the age of farmers is also related to debt ownership where the older they get the less debt they have. The survey results show that the average age of smallholder oil palm farmers is 47.78 years with the majority being in the age group of 43–54 years. At this age, according to Bakir & Manning [77 ], farmers fall into the category productive age group in developing countries, namely 15–55 years, where in this group they have high productivity and the potential to develop their farming business. In terms of education, the majority of smallholders only have an elementary education level for each stratum. These findings reveal that the formal education of oil palm farmers in Indonesia is still relatively low. The research of Marlaine et al. [78 ] found that education has a statistically positive effect on agricultural modernization. Research conducted by Paltasingh & Goyari [79 ] also found that the level of education also affects the adoption rate of new technologies and rice productivity in India. Therefore, these findings have implications for the importance of efforts to improve the quality of palm oil farmers' resources through non-formal education. With non-formal education, the quality of oil palm farmers in responding to agricultural innovations will be better. Many studies show that in addition to the level of education, the farmers’ experience is often the main factor in the adoption of technologies such as the use of high-yielding varieties, marketing of postharvest processing, and grading, among others [80 ]. A large percentage of oil palm farmers have less than or equal of 12.18 years of farming experience. Based on the survey's findings, it can be noted that farmers have not been engaged in oil palm plantation work for very long. The findings also inform that more farmers have just planted oil palm, where approximately 90 % of oil palm smallholders have never replanted (Table 2 ). There are 5 important reasons farmers choose oil palm plantations as a source of income, as concluded by [81 ]. These five foundations include (1) Easy maintenance, (2) Not susceptible to pests, (3) Cheaper oil palm maintenance costs, (4) Switching occurs due to going with the flow (participating in other farmers), (5) Oil palm harvesting can be done continuously every 2 weeks. One of the important aspects of the sustainability of the oil palm business is the legality of oil palm plantation land owned by farmers. Land legality is one of the important components of obtaining the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) Standards certificate, in addition to other legality aspects. This ISPO certificate is important to ensure the credibility of Indonesian palm oil in the world market, as explained by [82 ]. Survey data shows that only a small part, only 6 %, of land managed by smallholder farmers does not yet have land legality. One of the reasons is that the land may be inherited land from parents. However, still, 30 % of oil palm farmers do not use certified seeds. This finding is also a problem in itself because it is related to productivity and other aspects that follow.  4.2 The SDGs achievement: General findings As discussed above, the SDGs to which palm oil might be contributed involved 13 goals classified into 3 pillars, namely , social, economic, and environment. Examining the social pillar, the research found that more than 98 % of palm oil households have been avoided from poverty. These results show that the goal of no poverty by 2030 has almost been achieved by 2023 for oil palm farmers. This finding also informs that the significance of smallholder oil palm plantations to reduce poverty, because nearly no poverty occurs in palm oil smallholder households. This finding is reasonable because some studies have also found that the existence of oil palm has been able to reduce poverty rates where oil palm plantations exist, including smallholder oil palm plantations (e.g. research by Rahmah et al. [83 ], and Bintariningtyas & Juwita [84 ]. One of the indicators used to measure the achievement of SDG 2 in the social pillar is the Pola Pangan Harapan  or Desirable Dietary Pattern (PPH or DDP). According to Suhardjo [85 ], DDP is a diverse arrangement of foodstuffs based on energy contribution, both in absolute and relative terms to total energy, which can meet the food consumption needs of the population. DDP is also an instrument to evaluate people's food consumption patterns and at the same time as material for planning regional and national food needs. The maximum PPH score, which is 100, is an indicator of nutritional quality and diversity of food consumption (Baliwati [86 ] The DDP was 78.51 nearly the minimum ideal point, i.e., 85 point. Riau Province's DDP was the highest among the provinces surveyed with a DDP score of 80.39 points. This achievement was lower than National DDP Achievement in 2022, i.e., 92.9 [87 ]. Various factors can explain this finding; among others are education level, family size, income per capita, and price of rice see Wijaya et al. [88 ]) Various researchers found a relationship between DDP and food security, such as research by Chakona [89 ]. She concluded that there is a relationship between DDP and food security in which in the areas with low dietary diversity generally there is high levels of food insecurity. In the case of palm oil smallholder households, as presented in Table 2 , the study shows that even though the DDP score achievement is relatively not ideal nearly all smallholder households are classified into food-secure households. This finding is similar to Bhagtani et al. [90 ] concluded that food insecurity prevalence was uncorrelated with dietary patterns. Ninety-five percent of palm oil smallholder households have been covered by health insurance. Their average health expenditure is approximately 10 % of total households’ expenditure. This expenditure is relatively low and they do not have to cut their necessities expenditure, such as food, Clothing, and education expenditure. This means that palm oil smallholder households do not face financial catastrophes as suggested by Xu et al. [91 ] since their health expenditure is less than 40 % of total expenditure. By considering SDG 3 targets, these findings have also informed that SDG 3 targets have been achieved. This conclusion is more convincing by examining the household's accessibility to health facilities in which more than 92 % of households experience uncomplicated to access health facilities, especially for pregnant women and children health facilities (see Table 3 ). Not only easiness to access health facilities, smallholder households have also experienced an uncomplicated to access education facilities, especially formal education. However, smallholder oil palm households only have primary and secondary education levels, as presented in Table 1  . This means that all households already have equal opportunities to access education, as SDG4 targeted, even though in terms of quality each household has a different level of education. SDG 5 is focused on gender equality and seeks to empower all women and girls while achieving gender equality. In this research, gender equality is measured by the percentage of women's participation, Appropriateness of women's labor wages, and land ownership accessibility. In term of women's participation in palm oil plantation, approximately 11 percent of woman participates in palm oil plantation whether in their owned estate or other estates. Women who work in oil palm plantations are often considered non-existent, even though the palm oil production process is greatly influenced by the presence of women who are in charge of spraying or helping the harvest. One argument that can explain this finding is that many types of work in oil palm plantations require physical skills so not many women can enter oil palm plantations. Another reason is that women play more roles in their domestic work than in productive roles, in palm oil , women are involved in fertilization and leaf maintenance activities (Fatchiya et al. [92 ] and Norhadi et al. [93 ]). Additionally, approximately 17 % of women perceive that their labor wages are appropriate compared to men's labor wages. This finding indicates that there is discrimination in labor wages and this finding also exists in other sectors as reported by Hennigusnia (2014). She concluded that the existence of the gender wage gap is still dominated by unexplained factors and is indicated as discrimination. This case has also been found in China [94 ]; Srilangka Gunewardena et al. [95 ]; Thailand [96 ]; and India [97 ]. Regarding land ownership, only six percent of women have access to land ownership. The main explanation of this finding is that the patriarchal culture of the majority Indonesian community in which favoring men as heirs. However, FAO [60 ] also reported that men are significantly advantages to land rights relative to women, whether in terms of land ownership, land management, or land transfer dimension. FAO [60 ] has also reported that the percentage of women as landholders is only 15 % ranging from 5 % in Africa and the Middle East to 18 % in the Caribbean and Latin America. But that does not mean there is no women role in oil palm plantations, research by Wulandri, Sukiyono & Sriyoto [98 ] in Bengkulu Province concludes that women contribute to decision-making related to the management of their oil palm plantations and also contribute to labor. Their research found that wives and husbands are associated with crop maintenance such as determining the time, type, dosage of fertilizers and pesticides, harvesting and marketing. Nevertheless, the wife contribution of labor is still dominated by husbands with an average contribution of 25.19 % of the total labor needs from within the family. The types of work done by women (wife) include cutting shrubs, fertilization, stacking the oil palm fronds, picking loose palm fruit. In the economics pillars, clean and affordable energy (SDG7) always become an environmental and economic issue. Environmental issues are associated with the use of fossils as a source of energy generation and the limited use of renewable resources. Apart from the source of energy generation, more than 94 % of smallholder households have used electricity supplied by the government, that is, the State Electricity Company. The number of electricity users exceeds the prediction made by the Nations [99 ] where the number of electricity users reached 91 % in 2021 from 87 % in 2015. The research also found that the use of LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is also high among smallholder households. On average, the percentage of smallholder households using LPG for cooking reaches 84 % of total palm oil households. This percentage has also exceeded the average number of people using clean energy for cooking, that is, 71 % or 29 % percent of the population relied on polluting and inefficient cooking systems in 2021 as reported by the Nations [99 ] Palm oil Smallholders not only provide work for their families but also for other farmer laborers. The number of workers absorbed correlates to the palm oil area cultivated. The larger the cultivated land, the more labor employed, especially from outside family members. On average, palm oil smallholder employs 0.5 labor per ha or approximately 3 labors per household. The palm oil smallholder function as an employment source, especially in villages, is very important in alleviating poverty and rural unemployment, as expressed by Ishikawa [100 ]. This labor absorption is relatively not as intensive as cash crops, such as paddy, and corn, among others. It should be noted that farm labor is used subject to farm type, structure, and size [101 ]. Other important SDG8 indicators in an economic pillar are accessibility to financial facilities and main roads. The research found that 79.20 % of smallholders feel difficulties in accessing financial institutions, whether due to institution location that is difficult to access or other factors, such as farm size, and experience in credit use from formal sources. Apart from these influencing factors, many studies have also found that many smallholders have difficulty accessing financial institutions, such as research by Lemessa & Gemechu [102 ], Word Bank [103 ], Miller et al. [104 ], and Salami et al., (2009). In fact, oil palm plantations require very high investment and this investment is very important to improve on-farm productivity, post-harvest, processing practices, and marketing. Regarding access to the main road, smallholder households are relatively easy to access. The main road is characterized by paved roads and can be passed by four-wheeled cars. This road surface type and accessibility to four-wheeled cars will accelerate the village's economic transformations [105 ]. Nonfood expenditure is often used as poverty and food security indicators. The higher the nonfood expenditure, the more secure that household's food security status. Research by Sukiyono et al. [106 ]; and Praza & Shamadiyah [107 ] found that food and nonfood expenditures correlate to food security status. On average, nonfood expenditures of palm oil smallholders is more than 62 % implying that all households are classified as food secure households. These discussions imply that SDG8 has been achieved as indicated by all indicators in SDG8, except access to financial institutions in which only short households are easy to access. Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) is a guide on how to cultivate correctly, and environmentally friendly. These practices can increase the quality productivity, income, and welfare of farmers (FAO [108 ]; Shofi et al. [109 ]; Mahyuda et al. [110 ]). The research on palm oil smallholders shows that most smallholders have not implemented GAPs in managing their palm oil estates, especially for narrow stratum. These findings could be caused by the lack of support, experience, knowledge, and resources in the implementation standard of GAP and sustainability, as also concluded by Jelsma et al. [111 ] and Brandi et al. [112 ]. The use of palm oil waste, both for energy and feeding is also limited. Palm oil waste can be utilized as bioenergy, fertilizer, animal feed, and antioxidants which provides more economic value Chin et al. [113 ]; Noerrizki et al. [114 ]. Approximately, 97 % of palm oil smallholders have not handled their palm oil waste whether for bioenergy or feeding. Most smallholders pile, bury, or burn the waste. Many determinant factors could be explained by these findings, among others are distance between plantation and farmer house and harvest productivity as explained by Herdiansyah & Frimawaty [115 ] in their research. Collaboration of oil palm smallholders to economic institutions, extensions, and others related to palm oil either directly or indirectly is important to create a positive social change in addressing commercial and noncommercial challenges. As suggested by Stafford Boas et al. [59 ]; Gupta & Vegelin [116 ]; Stafford-Smith et al. [117 ], collaboration at all levels whether global, regional, national, or local level, both vertically and horizontally as well as across stageholders are necessary in achieving SDGs. However, collaboration between oil palm farmers in farmer groups or other local institutions is still very scarce. The research showed that many farmers were not members of farmer groups, farmer cooperatives, or resembling institutions at the village level. Approximately, only 2 % of farmers become a member of farmer groups, cooperatives, and other social groups. The number of farmers who recognized the existence of farmers' institutions at the village level is only 2.5 % of the total farmers surveyed and 5.8 % are acquainted with the benefits of the farmer groups. These findings are similar to various research, such as Ratu et al. [118 ]; and Saputra et al. [119 ], which concluded that oil palm farmers' understanding of the importance of participation is still relatively low due to the lack of farmer groups and lack of socialization. Oil palm plantations have always been associated with environmental problems. Oil palm plantations are considered to be the cause of climate change because of the methane gas and nitrous oxide produced [120 ]. Palm oil products can also be used as environmentally friendly biofuels. Palm oil smallholders' perceptions on the environmental impact of oil palm plantations reveal that there is no change in temperature around them as expressed by more than 67 % of farmers. Similarly, for their perception of river siltation, approximately 75 % of them deny river siltation, as shown in Table 6 . Related to environmental impact, more than 92 % of smallholders have legal land (table 1 ) implying that their plantation areas are located in nonconservation areas. These findings also counter allegations that oil palm plantations are the cause of climate change and siltation of rivers due to the high water demand from oil palm.  4.3 SDG composite index estimation and discussion The first stage to estimate the SGD Composite Index is Kaiser Mayer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's Test which is intended to examine the partial correlation strength among variables. According to Hair et al. (2010); WK. Hardle & L. Simar [121 ], Constantin [122 ], and Lolli & Girolamo [123 ], KMO values range from 0 to 1 and for PCA, the sample is considered suitable if the KMO index is ≥ 0.5 and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity value is significant at less than 0.05. The estimation results of KMO and Bartlett's Test show that the KMO index is 0.576 and the probability of Sphericity Bartlett's test is 0.000 informing that the data used in this research are sufficient for PCA and a factor analysis will be useful for explaining the data (see Table 7 ). After KMO and Bartlett's Test, the following stage is to examine the commonalities value. By definition, communality is the proportion of each variable's variance that can be explained by the main factor. This value also describes the original indicator variation that can be explained by the factors formed. Andriati & Fahmi [70 ] noted that the greater the indicator that has high communalities values indicates a stronger relation to the factors formed. From Table 8 , the communality value of TIPS1, i.e. 65 %, informs that roughly 65 % of the variation in indicator TIPS is explained by the factor model. The next step is to determine the number of principal factors or components that should be retained in the model by applying the eigenvalue-one criterion. The eigenvalue-one criterion, also known as The Kaiser Rule, is the most common and powerful approach for selecting the number of components [124 ]. This criterion suggests that variables with an eigenvalue of more than 1 will be maintained in the model, and vice versa, [125 ]. For these reasons, the proportion of variance accounted for by every factor and the cumulative percentage of variance could be used in the process of factor selection and the result is presented in Table 9 . Table 9  informs that the first nineteen components have an eigenvalue greater than one with the cumulative percent of variance explained by these factors of 63.212 %. This result is also shown by the Scree Plot, as presented in Fig. 2  . In Fig. 2 , starting from factor 20, the slope of the curve begins to shrink so that starting from factor 20, all factors are excluded or excluded from the model. Note, that the visual method of using the Scree Plot is very subjective. One reason is that the cut-off point of the curve cannot be identified (see Fig. 3  ). After the principal component is obtained, the next step is to form a component matrix consisting of the loading factor of the selected indicator. This loading factor describes how strongly the variables contribute to each major component. Also, the loading factor is a number that shows the magnitude of the correlation between a variable and the factors formed. However, this process is relatively difficult, especially when determining the dominant factor. Therefore, an Orthogonal varimax rotated solution is applied to determine factors that have dominant or significant loading factors. the use of orthogonal rotation results in more and more appropriate variables and the continuity formed in the results of factor analysis. Hatcher [126 ] defined rotations as a linear transformation of the solution to ease interpretation and by using an orthogonal rotation approach, factor loadings are equivalent to correlations between observed factors and components. Factor loading is selected by looking at absolute values between 0 and 1 on each factor and which has the largest loading and will be used as weighting. Using these criteria, the number of indicators selected is 42 indicators with factor loading values varying from 0.3203 to 0.9337 as presented in Table 10 . The final stage is to estimate the SDG composite index. There is no exclusion of indicators by considering the value of commonalities and factor loading as suggested by Andriati & Fahmi [70 ] It should be noted that the indicators produced in this study are the results of surveys conducted for independent oil palm smallholders, regardless of how the targets need to be achieved in each SDGs. The results of the SDGs index estimation are presented in Fig. 4  . The results indicate clear disparities among SDGs, which is reflected in its SDGs index (Fig. 4 ). The overall SDGs index achievement is 77.57 %. This achievement is above the overall Indonesian SDGs Achievement, i.e. 70.16 % (Sachs, et al., 2023 and accessed from https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/map ). This result of SDG achievement can be categorized as a good achievement. This achievement category is based on the SDGs index where the SDGs index is classified into a good achievement if its value is between 68 % and 100 %, fair achievement (34 % – 67 %), and bad achievement (less than 33 %). The SDG index of 77.57 % informs that more than 77.57 % of the SDGs target has been achieved by oil palm smallholders. In other words, oil palm farmers are 77.57 % towards achieving all SDGs targets. This also informs that oil palm farmers still have 7 years to achieve the SDGs target, which is 2030. This finding also proves that oil palm plantations, including smallholder oil palm plantations, have a positive impact on the community both directly and indirectly, which is reflected by the SDGs Index. Research conducted by Ayompe et al. [127 ]; Bennett et al. [128 ]; Córdoba et al. [129 ]; Euler et al. [130 ] concluded that oil palm plantations have direct and positive socioeconomic impacts on communities that lead to the achievement of SDGs, although it does not mention the magnitude of its contribution. In detail, the biggest contribution to SDG is SDG1 (no poverty). This SDG index reached 92.26 %. This finding is reasonable because the survey results also show that 98 % of total palm oil farmers are out of poverty (see discussion above). Copious studies have also confirmed this finding. A study by Santika et al. [131 ], for instance, concluded that rural communities with an oil palm economic base are more prosperous than without oil palm. Alamsyah et al. [132 ] have also concluded that the existence of palm oil has reduced significantly the poverty rate. In 2015, Ryan B. Edwards estimated that expanding the area of oil palm plantations by 10 % would reduce the poverty rate by the same rate, which is 10 %, and reduce the poverty gap. In Kalimantan, ownership of oil palm plantations also reduces poverty where the wider the oil palm owned is, the farther away from poverty [84 ]. In some studies, it is also concluded that the existence of individual or smallholder oil palm plantations and plantation companies has been able to alleviate poverty in rural communities, both through oil palm farm income, job creation, and or infrastructure developments (Dib et al. [133 ]; Edwards [134 ]; and Mosnier et al., (2017)). Hunger and food insecurity are inseparable from poverty. Poverty leads to the inability of households to invest or consume according to their needs which in turn begets hunger. Some studies have also concluded that poverty is a major factor in hunger and food insecurity, due to the inability to buy food, see for example the research of Adato & Bassett [135 ]; Hoyos et al. [136 ]; Mello et al. [137 ]. Therefore, many policies are focused on eradicating poverty, which will eliminate hunger and improve household food security. In the case of palm oil, many studies have also revealed the successful role of oil palm in alleviating poverty, as discussed earlier. This success also has implications for the success of smallholder palm oil in achieving SDG2, namely zero hunger. This is shown by the SDG2 index, which is 81.75 % This achievement is included in the good category. Table 2    also shows that almost 100 % of smallholder households are in the category of food-secured households and with a very good food pattern when viewed from the DDP score. This finding is also supported by several studies, including Ayodele & Eshalomi [138 ]; Budidarsono et al. [139 ]; Khatun et al. [140 ], who concluded that the existence of oil palm can guarantee increased food security and reduced incidence of malnutrition. It is undeniable that the increase in income, as well as the household economy experienced by smallholder oil palm farmers, has made it easier for them to access health and education. Research conducted by Qaim et al. [141 ]; Grepalma [142 ]; Alwarritzi et al. [143 ]; Budidarsono et al. [139 ]; Cramb & Curry [144 ]; Pacheco et al. [145 ], generally concluded that the existence of smallholder oil palm plantations or oil palm companies has been able to improve the economy of the community, especially oil palm farmers, which causes them to have easy access to health and education facilities. Furthermore, the existence of oil palm plantations has also led to the increasing availability of health and education infrastructure, some of which are part of the CSR of large palm oil plantations. Therefore, the achievement of SDG3 (Healthy and prosperous life) and SDG4 (quality education) in this study is very good which is indicated by the size of their SDG index, which is 79.70 % and 81.86 % respectively. The lowest SDG index in the Pillars of Social Development is SDG5, i.e., 63.5 %, and categorized as fair achievement. SDG5 is gender equality and empowerment indicated by 4 indicators, namely the ratio of women's wages to men, women's experience with domestic violence, women's participation in palm oil estate, and wage suitability perception. This result is quite good behind the still occurrence of inequality in women. The index value of 63.5 % provides information that out of 100 % of the target of no inequality, 63.5 % has been achieved. In addition, fair achievement is reasonable because oil palm plantations use more male labor, although there is the possibility of women to contribute in oil palm plantations, such as fertilization activities. LI [146 ] explained that women often become freelance workers who have limited access and have more domestic responsibilities. Further, there are also some inequalities in palm oil in some areas, such as women's labor wages and land accessibility (see Table 4  ) as also mentioned by Elmhirst et al. [147 ]; and LI [146 ] that there is intrahousehold inequality, land ownership and well being. In some cases, the role of women turns out to be quite significant in both smallholder plantations and large oil palm plantations. Study by Heriberta, Wachyunni, & Guspianto, [148 ] shown that women working in smallholder oil palm plantations also contribute to an increase in household income, without abandoning their domestic roles, including maintaining the health of household members. Another study by Nwankwo (2019), Obeth & RAmadiana [149 ] also concluded the positive role of female workers in palm oil processing mills. In the economic Pillar, SDG8 decent work and economic growth is the second highest SDG contribution, i.e. 85.31 %. Smallholder oil palm plantations not only contribute to job creation and income for themselves and their families, but also the surrounding communities, either directly or indirectly through economic spillovers. Some studies also mention that investment in oil palm plantations has been able to positively influence the surrounding area (Budidarsono et al. [139 ]; Syahza [150 ]; and Löffler et al. (2014)). Dib et al. [133 ] also concluded that investment in oil palm plantations has been able to create jobs and other economic benefits, both for oil palm farmers and communities that are not directly involved in oil palm plantations. It should be noted that investment in oil palm plantations has been able to grow new centers of economic growth in the region, in addition to creating jobs [150 ]. The development of these new growth centers encourages infrastructure development, especially main roads for farmers' access, increased non-food expenditure by farmers, and ease of access to financial institutions, as shown by the results of this research survey. High palm oil's contribution to the achievement of SDGs is also shown by SDG 9 and SDG10, contributing 81 % and 85 % respectively. These SDG achievements could be classified as good achievements. SDG9 which is reflected by 3 indicators, namely Good Agricultural Practices, Use of Recommended Fertilizer, and The use of Certificated Seed (see Table 10 ) also shows good performance. More than 90 percent of farmers have practiced GAP, including the use of fertilizers according to recommendations and certified seeds (Table 1 and Table 5       ). The importance of palm oil for the household economy of oil palm farmers encourages them to be able to increase their production and productivity which in turn increases their welfare through the implementation of GAP in managing their oil palm farms. Donough et al. [151 ] explain that managing properly palm oil crops results in higher productivity. However, still 70 % of oil palm farmers use certified seeds. This is certainly a challenge in the future; the distribution of illegal oil palm seeds must be prevented and eliminated. The contribution of smallholder palm oil to inequality (SDG10) is reflected by the involvement of women in economic, social, and cultural institutions and households under poverty. The contribution is estimated at approximately 85 %, mostly due to a relatively small number of smallholder palm oil in poverty. As discussed above, 98 % of total palm oil farmers have been out of poverty implying that only 2 % of them under poverty. There are not many women involved in economic, social, and cultural organizations at the village level. One argument that could explain this finding is that many organizations are directed toward men. Many studies also support this finding, including Pini [152 ]; Shortall [153 ,154 ] who conclude that women are rarely represented in business, they are more in domestic and supporting roles. This result is also reflected by SDG5 index estimation as has been discussed before. The availability of sufficient and affordable energy can not only support the fulfillment of basic needs such as food, health services, and quality education but also can support quality human development [48 ]. Therefore, access to energy is an urgent need and cannot be ignored in this modern era. Dagnachew et al. [155 ] said that integrated energy accessibility, efficiency, and renewable energy policies in Saharan Africa provide significant benefits. Several studies show a positive relationship between energy access and quality of life, for example, Kammen et al. [156 ]; Karezeki et al. [157 ]. Energy supply in Indonesia is regulated in Law No. 30/2009 on Electricity mandating the government and local governments to ensure access to electricity for all people by providing funds for the provision of electricity for underprivileged communities, for electricity development in underdeveloped and border areas, and for rural electricity development. With this policy, it allows oil palm farmers to be able to access electrical energy as shown from the survey results where more than 94 % of smallholders have been able to access electricity provided by the government. Not only electricity, the availability and ease of access to LPG encourage smallholders to use this environmentally friendly energy (see discussion above). Of course, the use of electricity and LPG will not be accessible to smallholders if they are not economically able. The results of this policy enable the achievement of SDG7 targets are quite high, which is reflected by the SDG7 index value which reaches 73.05 %. This result is categorized as a good achievement where 73 % of SDG 7 targets have been achieved. Among the 13 SDGs where smallholder palm oil can contribute, SDG17 achievement is the lowest although it is still classified as fair achievement as reflected by the SDG17 index of 40.58 %. The low index of SDG17 (Partnerships to achieve sustainable development goals) indicates the lack of palm oil smallholders' collaboration in achieving their common goals, through farmer groups or cooperatives that allow them to increase their bargaining power or to solve farmer problems that are unable to solve by farmer individually. This research survey found that about 3 % of smallholder farmers joined oil palm farmer groups. This finding is almost similar to studies in other crop farmer groups see Alif [158 ]; Irawan et al. [159 ]; Putri et al. [160 ]. Allegedly, farmers' reluctance not to participate in farmer groups or cooperatives is caused by the absence of benefits obtained, not too many problems that require joint solutions, and the absence of initiators and motivators related to the importance of farmer collaboration in achieving common goals. Nevertheless, the achievement of the SDG index is relatively good because it cannot be separated from the achievements of other SDG indexes, especially SDG10. Strong and mutually beneficial cooperation is needed for the achievement of SDGs at every stage and all degrees. In the environmental development pillar, consisting of SDG6, SDG13, and SDG15, the overall contribution to the achievement of the SDG index is 81.25 %. This achievement is quite high considering that oil palm plantations have never been separated from environmental issues, although this issue has also been widely discussed, reviewed dan countered among others by Harianja [161 ]; and Sukiyono et al. [12 ]. Among these 3 SDGs, SDG6 has the highest contribution, i.e., 85.49 %. In the case of smallholders, SDG6 emphasizes more on household accessibility to formally managed sources of drinking water, per capita clean water consumption, and sanitary ownership. Many arguments explain that the sustainability of environmental development is related to how farmers can access, manage, and use natural resources, especially water, according to FAO and IFAD, (2019). In addition, the role of the government in providing clean water cannot be denied, especially through the utilization of village funds transferred to villages Bagus Baidhowie [162 ]. Through this policy and with the increasing household economy, oil palm smallholders can easily access clean water and meet their clean water needs. Farmer households, including oil palm farmers, have an important role to play in fighting climate change. Action against climate change conducted by palm oil smallholders includes clearing land without burning, planting cover crops, and implementing environmentally friendly cultivation techniques. These activities certainly have a positive impact on the climate, such as the perception of oil palm farmers in the absence of temperature changes, and also the absence of significant river siltation, as discussed above. Accordingly, the achievement of SDG13 is also relatively high at 82.94 %. On the other hand, oil palm plants themselves also have a positive impact on the environment, for example absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen (Harahap et al., (2005); Härdter & Fairhurst [163 ]); increase biomass as plants age [164 ]; reduce greenhouse gas emissions on peatlands Melling et al. [165 ]; Sabiham [166 ]. The results also show that most independent oil palm farmers have cultivated oil palm with legal land status and proven by Certificates of Land Ownership (SHM) and or Land Certificates (SKT) issued by local government (Table 1 ). Although some researchers state that SKT does not have strong and valid legal legality (Ayompe et al. [127 ]; Hidayat et al. [167 ]), this finding indicates that smallholder oil palm land is in an area classified as Non-Forestry Cultivation Areas (Kawasan Budidaya Non-Kehutanan = KBNK) or Other Use Areas (Areal Penggunaan Lain = APL). This finding led to the SDG15 achievement being relatively high, i.e., 75.35 %, and categorized as a good achievement.   5 Conclusion The analysis in this study focuses on the contribution of smallholder coconut plantations in Indonesia to the achievement of SDGs, as measured by the SDGs index. In general, the achievement of SDGs is relatively high, which is 77.57 % compared to the average achievement of Indonesia's SDGs of 70 %. But this is not without weaknesses, the achievement of each SDGs is uneven. Therefore, the focus on increasing the role and contribution of palm oil in achieving SDGs must be emphasized on achieving the lowest SDG, namely SDG 17, namely Partnerships to achieve sustainable development goals. Cooperation at the smallholder level in the form of farmers’ groups, cooperatives, or other institutional forms needs to be improved. This is important not only to increase their bargaining power but also for learning media for farmers, especially related to the introduction and implementation of good agricultural practices that have not been optimal. In addition to encouraging farmers to institutionalize, formalization of informal farmer institutions should be encouraged to improve social and economic relations and to resolve conflicts among farmers that may occur. No less important is providing capacity building training in order to increase the level of awareness and use of the benefits of cooperation among palm oil producers is highly recommended. The results of the analysis and discussion show that SDG5 (gender Equality) is also relatively weak compared to other SDGs, other than SDG17. This finding shows that there is still discrimination against women workers in community plantations. A key issue with these findings is the notion that female workers are perceived as weak. Whereas on the one hand, working women also have domestic roles that cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is important to make an economic valuation of this domestic role so that it can be used as an indicator of gender equality. No less important is to fulfill the rights of women workers with equal pay or other related rights such as menstruation and maternity leave. Another effort to reduce the gender gap is through empowering women by increasing their capacity and capability through increasing knowledge and skills as well as introducing technology according to their needs. Thus, they can utilize palm oil by-products, such as palm fronds and leaf sticks, by increasing its added value. Furthermore, the achievement of one SDG cannot be separated from another. These SDGs are positively interrelated with each other. Economic development cannot be separated from social and environmental development. Relatively weak environmental development and social development cannot be achieved optimally, and vice versa. This means that increasing the achievement of SDGs must also be carried out simultaneously while still prioritizing the SDGs that have the weakest achievements. This study has tried to measure the contribution of oil palm based on field surveys which certainly cannot be separated from weaknesses, such as not all proposed indicators can be measured. Therefore, determining relevant indicators on each SDG that can be contributed by smallholder oil palm plantations is important to propose and examine. What needs to be realized is that the contribution of smallholder oil palm plantations to the achievement of SDGs is also inseparable from central and local government policies, meaning that there is an interaction of individual efforts of smallholders to improve welfare and government policies that support the achievement of sustainable development goals. However, this study has attempted to document and empirically analyze what smallholder oil palm cultivation can contribute to sustainable development as reflected by 13 SDGs out of 17 sustainable development goals. In the future, more comprehensive research needs to be conducted, for example comparing the contribution of non-palm oil agriculture or certain sectors to the achievement of SDGs, including analyzing the impact of government policy interventions on SDGs achievement. Included in this study in the future is to analyze and examine the overflow of positive trends in the achievement of SDGs for smallholder palm oil in transboundary sectors. No less important is the need and importance of research on stakeholders related to accelerating the achievement of SDGs targets and formulating strategies to accelerate the achievement of SDGs targets, especially those related to smallholder palm oil.
