                  In this commentary, we reflect on progress made in tracking progress towards two targets associated with the education Sustainable Development Goal, namely on global citizenship education (4.7), and on teachers (4c). We highlight that both these targets suffer from problems in their final design, with the global citizenship target becoming a ‘residual target’, and 4c becoming narrowly focused on the supply of teachers. In both cases, the core intention of the targets has become lost in translation into indicators, with a focus on inputs rather than outcomes. Notably, attention to equity, which is at the heart of the goal overall, and key to quality learning, has become missing in this translation. In going forward, we argue for a need for meaningful participation beyond technical experts in the articulation of both targets and indicators simultaneously, and importantly shifting the focus from institutions in the global North.

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0005" view="all">In this commentary, we reflect on progress made in tracking progress towards two targets associated with the education Sustainable Development Goal, namely on global citizenship education (4.7), and on teachers (4c). We highlight that both these targets suffer from problems in their final design, with the global citizenship target becoming a ‘residual target’, and 4c becoming narrowly focused on the supply of teachers. In both cases, the core intention of the targets has become lost in translation into indicators, with a focus on inputs rather than outcomes. Notably, attention to equity, which is at the heart of the goal overall, and key to quality learning, has become missing in this translation. In going forward, we argue for a need for meaningful participation beyond technical experts in the articulation of both targets and indicators simultaneously, and importantly shifting the focus from institutions in the global North.</ce:simple-para>

For the first time equity and protection of the planet and environment have become central to the global development agenda. More than any other previous global agenda, the SDGs have gained traction across both the Global North and South. The interdependence between and within nation states, between rich and poor countries, and between human development and nature, are defining features. This ambition is reflected in the education goal, which displays a more holistic and comprehensive approach to education progress by recognising quality, inclusion, and equity as central to education progress.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0050" view="all">The inclusion of targets on global citizenship education and teachers was subject to much debate during the development of the SDG framework. This was in part the result of the wider engagement of a range of stakeholders when compared with the development of previous global agendas. The development of these targets included non-governmental organisations and teacher union representation, amongst others. However, while their inclusion is notable, they are both listed at the end of the set of targets (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0005" refid="bib11 bib12 bib10">Sayed and Moriarty, 2019; Sayed et al., 2018; Sayed and Ahmed, 2015</ce:cross-refs>). As discussed below, one consequence of this wider engagement was that the framing and precise wording of the targets and their indicators became contested, influencing the attention they received as part of the global framework and the progress made in their achievement (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0010" refid="bib9 bib11">Rose, 2015; Sayed and Moriarty, 2019</ce:cross-refs>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0055" view="all">Drawing on reflections based on our on-going involvement in processes associated with the achievement of SDG 4 on education; our own research into topics related to SDG 4; and our knowledge of the wider literature in this field, we consider the extent to which the targets have become diluted in their translation into indicators used for measuring progress. We highlight the different reasons for this across the two targets. We further examine the challenges of assessing progress for these targets and signal what more robust indicators for them might entail. We conclude by identifying the continued importance of targets on global citizenship education and teachers for future global frameworks. However, we note the need for the development of the next global agenda to recognise that goal, target and indicator setting is both a technical and political process. Ultimately, the agreement of the next education goals, targets and indicators to measure progress need to be conceived together from the outset. Leaving indicator development in the hands of technical experts, as was the case with the current SDGs, risks delegitimating, narrowing, and reducing the key targets set, as we argue in this commentary. This is not to suggest that there is no role for experts in the development of indicators. However, we argue that both expert knowledge and evidence must be part of a participatory political discussion.</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0060" view="all">For the global citizenship education target, there was much debate about what to include as the desirable and valued outcomes of education. Much attention focused on what the Delors report spoke about ‘Learning to Live together’ (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0015" refid="bib13">UNESCO, 1996</ce:cross-ref>). As a result of the wide engagement of different stakeholders who were keen to ensure their agendas were included, this target includes multiple education outcomes. These were expressed in terms with potentially closely related meanings (e.g. human rights, gender equality, and promotion of a culture of peace and nonviolence), as well as those in contradiction with each other (e.g. gender equality and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution). In addition, many other valued outcomes such as sexual and reproductive health rights were excluded in the final formulation. Described as a ‘residual target’ (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0020" refid="bib11">Sayed and Moriarty, 2019</ce:cross-ref>) and to be as inclusive as possible of multiple valued outcomes, the final formulation diluted the logic of the target. This resulted in the more limited attention this target received, as discussed below.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0065" view="all">For the target on teachers, part of the contestation was whether it should be included in the first place or as a ‘means of implementation’ of the other targets (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0015" refid="bib10 bib7">Sayed and Ahmed, 2015; Nakidien et al., 2021</ce:cross-refs>). The teacher target was ultimately included as a means of implementation, which was seen by Education International (the confederation of teacher unions) and others as relegating it to a secondary level of attention. This does seem to be the case. The wording of the target on teachers became increasingly weaker – moving away from the target proposed at the Muscat Global education Forum Meeting in 2014 where it was a phrased as ‘Target 6<ce:bold>:</ce:bold> By 2030, all governments ensure that all learners are taught by qualified, professionally trained, motivated and well-supported teachers’ - to a narrower focus on supply (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0020" refid="bib10 bib2">Sayed and Ahmed, 2015; Bengtsson et al., 2019</ce:cross-refs>). Focus on the supply side, seeing teachers as an input into education, undermined teacher agency, professionalism, and autonomy in the formulation of the target. Various efforts have been made in recent times to pay greater attention to teachers in policy, practice and research. The Transforming the Education Workforce Report was one such landmark (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0025" refid="bib6">Education Commission, 2019</ce:cross-ref>). Yet, while this report is framed in terms of achieving SDG 4 overall, it does not pay direct attention to the SDG target on teachers specifically. The Teacher Taskforce established in 2008, and the High-Level Panel on the Teaching Profession set up in 2023, provide a much-needed focus on teachers. However, to date, limited attention has been paid to the refinements and development of measurable indicators for tracking progress towards the SDG target on teachers.</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0070" view="all">The global citizenship education and teacher targets each include seven indicators, one of which is identified as a ‘global’ indicator, and the other six are ‘thematic’ indicators (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0030" refid="bib17">UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2022</ce:cross-ref>). The global targets and their associated indicators are ones that are given more weight for global tracking of progress. All of these indicators, along with other targets associated with SDG 4, were identified after the SDG framework had been agreed in 2015. Their development built on the proposal of a Technical Advisory Group, led by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, which was included in the Education 2030 Framework. Subsequently, a Technical Cooperation Group on SDG 4–Education 2030 Indicators was established, involving wider consultations with member states, civil society organisations, and international agencies. The outcome of the list of indicators by this Group was endorsed by the United Nations Statistical Commission in March 2017 – almost two years after the establishment of the SDG targets (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0035" refid="bib16">UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2018</ce:cross-ref>). In reflecting on these two targets and their associated indicators there are several key issues which require immediate and future policy attention.</ce:para>

                        <ce:para id="p0075" view="all">Decisions around the identification of indicators largely centred around current or potential availability of data, rather than starting from a conceptual understanding of what needs to be measured to achieve the targets, as well as reach the overall ambition of the SDG 4 goal to ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’. As such, the indicators present the best available proxy of what they are trying to measure. One consequence of this is that the indicators narrowed the target, reducing its scope and intention. This has resulted in the overall ambition of the target being lost.</ce:para>

                        <ce:para id="p0100" view="all">Globally, there has been far greater attention on frameworks and approaches for assessing progress towards global citizenship education when compared with teachers (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0025" refid="bib1 bib3">Anderson and Bhattacharya, 2017; Brockwell et al., 2022</ce:cross-refs>; <ce:cross-ref id="cr0040" refid="bib4">European Commission, n.d.</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="cr0045" refid="bib8">OECD, 2018</ce:cross-ref>). The latest edition of the Global Education Monitoring Report (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0050" refid="bib15">UNESCO, 2023</ce:cross-ref>) notes that it is still seeking to measure the global citizenship target more comprehensively. So far, global monitoring is based on the development of a database of information drawing on official documents and case studies of laws and policies of 70 countries. The Report notes that monitoring of the overarching indicator of the global citizenship target (4.7.1) is only expected to take place every four years, but even then, data availability has been low, ‘preventing a review of progress’ (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0055" refid="bib15">UNESCO, 2023</ce:cross-ref>, p. 277). This has resulted in the indicator being selectively measured, which means it is omitted in the regular tracking of progress.</ce:para>

                        <ce:para id="p0105" view="all">In both targets, the indicators are more of a reflection of the presence (or inputs) rather than of consequences (or outcomes) associated with the targets. For the global citizenship education target, attention in the indicators is placed on whether curricula and policies exist. For example, a country might be seen to achieve the indicator of providing life skills-based HIV and sexuality education (4.7.2), while sexual violence (which is not included as an indicator) remains widespread. Further, questions have been raised about whether <ce:italic>Percentage of students in the final grade of lower secondary education showing proficiency in knowledge of environmental science and geoscience</ce:italic> (4.7.5) provides a real measure of education for sustainable development given the intention of the target. In other words, it is questionable as to whether competence in geo-science translates into understanding of environmental degradation and actions to stop global climate warming. This indicator is thus an example of conflating the measure with the real object.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0110" view="all">For teachers, the global indicator, which measures whether teachers are qualified, is not necessarily the best measure of equitable and quality teaching. Qualifications do not automatically translate into better teaching practices. Further the indicators do not track progress on the conditions in which teachers work. Working conditions influence teacher recruitment, motivation and retention, which are more directly associated with teaching quality and improvements in learning (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0060" refid="bib14">UNESCO, 2014</ce:cross-ref>). Further, all the thematic indicators focusing on for example <ce:italic>Pupil-trained teacher ratio, Pupil-qualified teacher ratio by education level, Teacher attrition rate</ce:italic>, important as they are, do not speak to effective and equitable teaching. Many of these are existing measures, and so no doubt selected largely due to data availability, but with limited effort to develop more robust and meaningful measures of teacher quality and teaching. This is partly a result of the fact that teachers are reduced to being an input in the way the target and indicators are formulated. In addition, the teacher indicators emphasise individual characteristics, rather than whether or not systems are improving. In general, as we argue below, many of the targets and indicators fail to pay adequate attention to education system functioning and governance. Notably, the teacher target highlights the need for greater measures to assess what teachers do, and so pay more attention to teaching practices.</ce:para>

This is in part a result of the focus only on existing data for tracking progress, which for example might allow for disaggregation by male/female but is limited beyond this. Yet it is vital to track progress of intersecting disadvantages, for example those related to gender, poverty, disability, ethnicity, or location (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0065" refid="bib9">Rose, 2015</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0120" view="all">For the global citizenship target, none of the indicators or reporting have any focus on equity in terms of social economic differences between rich and poor learners and schools. Also, as much of the debate about the COP process reveals, there is a lack of attention to inequities in indicators concerning environmental degradation and responsibility for sustainable development between the Global North and South.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0125" view="all">Similarly, for the teacher target, limited attention is paid to equity in relation to the quality, training, deployment and distribution of teachers. For example, equity could be factored into the teacher target by focusing attention on access to initial teacher education by marginalised and disadvantaged groups. Or on training teachers on inclusion, equity and social justice, as well as a focus on the distribution of teachers, and female teacher leadership.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0130" view="all">As noted above, much of the focus of debates since the establishment of the SDGs has been on the technicalities of the indicators – rather than what is missing or, importantly, how they combine to achieve the ultimate ambition of SDG 4. An important lesson in reviewing SDG progress to date is that the development of the overall goal, targets and indicators should go hand-in-hand. This requires meaningful participation by all stakeholders at all levels of the process. As we have identified, the target on global citizenship education has highlighted the challenge of identifying indicators when the target lacks clarity. It has also shown how residual targets risk delegitimating certain priorities in favour of others. The target on teachers illustrates that a target that does not measure what needs to be tracked to achieve the desired aims, may thwart the overall ambition to achieve equitable and quality education for all. While we cannot definitively provide solutions on what should be targeted and measured (as this should be a participatory and consultative process), we offer some tentative propositions for reflection based on our work to date.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0135" view="all">Firstly, for target 4.7 on global citizenship education, we argue that a more concrete framing around the intention of the goal is required. This should focus on developing the knowledge, skills, and disposition for learning to live together and being active, critical, engaged citizens of the nation state and world, as set out in the Delors report (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0070" refid="bib13">UNESCO, 1996</ce:cross-ref>). This necessitates ensuring that students have the knowledge, skills and disposition to navigate the complex, sensitive and fragile connection with the natural and human world. Casting the environment as a global good and right of all citizens, and the protection and preservation of the natural ecosystem, should be central to this goal, as many young people have highlighted in their recent protests. Including an indicator which measures this is critical now and in the future. Such an indicator would, for example, measure both whether schools have a subject that includes Education for Sustainable Development and citizenship, as well as what students learn in such a subject. In this way, the target would measure more than the presence of human rights education and national policy.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0140" view="all">Secondly, we argue that a target on teachers should focus more on teaching quality than the supply of teachers. Tracking progress towards this target could be achieved through appropriate observation of classroom practice. Teacher observation, however, needs to be designed in consultation with teachers, and implemented with their knowledge and consent. Rather than using a colonial model of inspection, the observation should be carried out by trusted peers, with the aim to support the development and improvement of systems in which teachers work. There are an increasing number of tools being used for these purposes. The World Bank Teach tool is one that is frequently used in low- and lower-middle income settings. This tool supports the identification of classroom practices associated with classroom culture, quality of instruction, and support to the development of socio-emotional skills (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0075" refid="bib5">Carter and Rose, 2021</ce:cross-ref>). However, it is too technically challenging to implement at scale by peers and does not currently have a sufficiently strong focus on inclusion and equity, such as being able to identify gender-responsive pedagogy. Ideally, an assessment of progress towards a target for teachers would also adopt a value-added approach, to identify whether improvements in teaching quality benefits those at most risk of being left behind. Generic assessment of teacher effectiveness needs to be calibrated to the background of learners, such as capturing gender-responsiveness in the teaching and learning process.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0145" view="all">Overall, both targets fail to engage with the system level. By focusing at the individual level (e.g. teachers or students), the indicators do not pay attention to conditions under which equitable, quality teaching and learning can take place. For example, having qualified teachers is a necessary condition for meaningful learning only if teachers are deployed to a school or education institution where they are needed. Equitable and quality teaching and learning rely on system level change and support, for example policies that empower teachers, create safe learning environments for teachers and learners, and provide teachers with support in developing inclusive and gender-responsive pedagogy. Effective and well governed education systems, which are resilient, equitable and just, are targets that should be framed and embedded into the SDG 4 targets and indicators. The current targets lack the necessary focus on skills acquisition needed for global citizenship or for teaching and learning in diverse classroom settings.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0150" view="all">While we have focused on the assessment of SDG 4 in relation to the global citizenship and teacher targets, a fuller assessment of progress will need to take into account the extent to which, and the conditions under which, the SDGs have provided catalytic support at the national level for the following: a) equitable and just education, b) protected and prioritised spending on education, and c) raised awareness about the important of investing in education for all (particularly for the marginalised), to mitigate the effect of intergenerational inequities. Such an assessment of progress should also consider the ways in which the SDG process has catalysed and enhanced effective international coordination and collaboration behind government led education reform, galvanised global funding for education alongside increased national expenditure, and provided a more holistic approach to education. This would encourage a shift of the balance in the global education discourse away from an instrumental, narrow, and limiting view of the value and purpose of education.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0155" view="all">Based on our reflections presented in this commentary, we conclude with a concern that the two targets for global citizenship education and teachers will not be achieved – or at least we will not know if they have been achieved. More importantly, we will not know how they have contributed to the overall ambition of SDG4. Some of the reasons for this are similar across the two targets, namely that the indicators track progress on the presence (or input) of factors associated with the targets, rather than the consequences (or outcomes) associated with achieving inclusive and equitable education. The reasons for this differ, however. For global citizenship education, it is in part at least due to the conceptual fuzziness of the target itself. By contrast, the teacher target fails to address issues of teaching quality and how this translates into inclusion and equity in education. We have provided some initial ideas of how this might be redressed. However, as the next period of SDG progress is considered, it is crucial to reflect on whether these and all targets measure what is valued and valuable. Maintaining the current trajectory might not result in the achievement of the goal of equitable, inclusive, and quality education for all.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0160" view="all">An important lesson from the SDG period is that debates around indicators need to happen at the same time as discussions on the framing of goals and targets. This is crucial as the determination of indicators, as well as the goal and targets, are both political and technical processes in terms of what to measure and how to measure them. To date, the focus has mainly been on the technical considerations of what can be measured, related to what is available in existing data systems. There should be immediate attention and investment in data systems for the future in order to widen the scope of what can be measured. This requires broader consultation across stakeholders. Aligning the process of developing targets and indicators will ensure that progress can be made as soon as the goals are agreed, and not delayed as was the case with the SDGs. This will help to ensure that the framework is driven by what needs to be measured to achieve desired outcomes, rather than what is currently measured. These debates can occur through structures that are already in place for teachers, notably the Teacher Task Force and High-Level Panel on the Teaching Profession. The establishment of a similar network for Global Citizenship Education would be beneficial.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0165" view="all">To the extent that a global framework will continue beyond 2030, these discussions should start now to ensure an informed and inclusive debate leading to consensus. Impetus for this process requires a robust research programme which measures progress toward the achievement of the targets in a meaningful and participatory way. Discussion should begin immediately on the need for a future global agenda to have a twin track approach to measuring progress. This would imply having a limited range of global indicators, with a more extensive range of indictors, devolved to, and under the control of, national governments. Such an approach would allow for an education global framework which is tailored to diverse contexts and reflects national priorities and ambition. This requires greater inclusion of institutions in the global South in the design of both targets and indicators. For this to occur, support and investment in building national capacity is essential. This is something that has not happened sufficiently within the current SDG process.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0170" view="all">As the timeline for the SDG education accelerates, there is a need to reflect on progress to date, consider changes to the navigation path for the present framework, while keeping an eye to the future. The main consideration should be on what might and could be done differently to achieve a peaceful, inclusive, and prosperous world.</ce:para>
