                  Achieving energy sustainability is cardinal to align the efforts of any country towards climate actions. Australia being blessed with high renewable energy potential has an energy mix currently dominated by fossil fuels. This projects Australia as an interesting case study to analyse the potential of commercial clean energy technologies to pursue the vision of Sustainable Development Goal 7 in Australia. The proposed study incorporates a hybrid quantitative–qualitative methodology to assess the potential of clean energy technologies and direct the current scenario to achieve energy sustainability. Initially, the prominent commercialised clean energy technologies in Australia are identified which include hydropower, wind energy, solar energy and bioenergy. The evaluation criteria are designed to illustrate the characteristics of energy sustainability from the dimensions of energy transition, geographic, economic, political, social and environmental criteria. A total of 16 sub-criteria are outlined to reflect the energy sustainability vision against which the alternatives are assessed. The weightage to each criterion is determined by using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Shannon’s Entropy models. The potential of clean energy alternatives is assessed and ranked with the aid of 7 multicriteria decision-making models to obtain robust and reliable results. The results imply that solar energy technology has the highest potential to support the energy sustainability vision of Australia with a score of 39.7 % followed by wind energy, hydropower and bioenergy technologies with a score of 29.8 %, 20.6 % and 9.9 %, respectively. Sensitive analysis is performed to analyse the impact of weightage and normalization methods. Spearman’s weighted rank correlation analysis and the rank reversal test has been performed to validate the results. The qualitative assessment is performed to investigate the hindering and supporting factors to promote clean energy technologies in Australia and to frame the strategies to achieve SDG 7. Policies to support rooftop PV and investments towards either grid integration or grid expansion scenarios have a huge role in influencing the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 in Australia.

Clean energy technology  Promotion of clean energy accessibility  Linguistic terms    Hydropower Hydropower has a minimal role in promoting clean energy accessibility owing to its limited resources in Australia [45]  Low  Wind energy Wind energy can support clean energy accessibility in the areas near the coastal lines or in the regions with high-capacity factors in Australia [63] . Most of the population in Australia is also concentrated near coastal lines [64] . High  Solar energy Solar rooftop PV has already been well-penetrated in Australia which extends clean energy accessibility to a larger extent than other alternatives [65,66]  Very high  Bioenergy Bioenergy can promote moderate clean energy accessibility, but it needs a regulated approach to avoid environmental concerns [67]  Moderate     Table 8 Evaluation of social acceptance.     Clean energy technology  Evaluation of social acceptance  Linguistic terms    Hydropower Hydropower stations have social and environmental implications and hinder social acceptance [69] . Low  Wind energy Wind turbines emerge to be a significant concern that strongly correlates with social acceptance [70] . People are not usually willing to reside nearby a wind farm which limits the suitable location [71,72]  High  Solar energy There is a high level of social acceptance for solar farms due to the benefits to broader society [73] . Moreover, Australians are positive about the growth of rooftop PV panels and are even willing to accommodate more solar energy [66] . Very high  Bioenergy Local energy needs, benefits from bioenergy companies and trust plays a crucial role in establishing social acceptance of bioenergy in Australia [74] . However, a lack of awareness lowers the support and acceptance of biogas plants in Australia among consumers [75] . Moderate     Table 9 Evaluation of eco-friendliness.     Clean energy technology  Impact of ecosystem  Eco-friendliness    Hydropower Hydropower has massive environmental menaces triggered by habitat losses; and fragmentation caused by impounded reservoirs. It disrupts river flow, blocks animal migration and is also responsible for methane emission [77] . Hydropower reservoirs make the surrounding area vulnerable to the loss of cultural aspects of geographical regions. Furthermore, circularity in hydropower may limited to turbines and reservoir walls but the lost land and biodiversity is far more impactful. Low  Wind energy Wind power kills 100,000 s of birds and obstructs migration paths. Also, it increases the ambient temperature and induces noise pollution [77] . Regarding circularity of end-of-life management, wind turbine and blades can be recycled at the cost of further industrial processes or/and chemical treatments which adds up emissions in circular economy [78] . High  Solar energy Solar energy impact is poorly known, but the operating area reflects more sunlight, and their manufacturing process is not carbon-free [79] . Solar PV plants also require high water usage to clean the panels periodically. A study has predicted that the cumulative PV waste would account for 1,000,000 tonnes between 2033 and 2042 in Australia [80] . Under defined scenarios, the study claims 100 % circularity of PV end-of-life aluminium, and silver metals can be achieved in 2045 [80] . Very high  Bioenergy Bioenergy emerges to cause the highest threat to biodiversity, and it can be reduced by exerting restrictions for a lower per capita consumption or sustainable way of consumption [81,82] . A wide range of implications on land use, deforestation, pollution, and water use are the major restrictions to limiting bioresource consumption regarding bioenergy usage [67] . Bioenergy can be a part of circular economy to reuse the wastes rather than generating the wastes like other clean energy alternatives [83] . However, the infrastructure to utilize bioenergy as an integral part of circular economy is not tapped in Australia [84] . Very low     Table 10 Estimation of climate action effectiveness.

Graphical abstract       Achieving energy sustainability is cardinal to align the efforts of any country towards climate actions. Australia being blessed with high renewable energy potential has an energy mix currently dominated by fossil fuels. This projects Australia as an interesting case study to analyse the potential of commercial clean energy technologies to pursue the vision of Sustainable Development Goal 7 in Australia. The proposed study incorporates a hybrid quantitative–qualitative methodology to assess the potential of clean energy technologies and direct the current scenario to achieve energy sustainability. Initially, the prominent commercialised clean energy technologies in Australia are identified which include hydropower, wind energy, solar energy and bioenergy. The evaluation criteria are designed to illustrate the characteristics of energy sustainability from the dimensions of energy transition, geographic, economic, political, social and environmental criteria. A total of 16 sub-criteria are outlined to reflect the energy sustainability vision against which the alternatives are assessed. The weightage to each criterion is determined by using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Shannon’s Entropy models. The potential of clean energy alternatives is assessed and ranked with the aid of 7 multicriteria decision-making models to obtain robust and reliable results. The results imply that solar energy technology has the highest potential to support the energy sustainability vision of Australia with a score of 39.7 % followed by wind energy, hydropower and bioenergy technologies with a score of 29.8 %, 20.6 % and 9.9 %, respectively. Sensitive analysis is performed to analyse the impact of weightage and normalization methods. Spearman’s weighted rank correlation analysis and the rank reversal test has been performed to validate the results. The qualitative assessment is performed to investigate the hindering and supporting factors to promote clean energy technologies in Australia and to frame the strategies to achieve SDG 7. Policies to support rooftop PV and investments towards either grid integration or grid expansion scenarios have a huge role in influencing the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 in Australia.

The current situation demands more exigent actions to reduce carbon emissions, and this can be substantiated by shifting the focus to clean energy technologies [1] . With the global concern to build a sustainable world for all, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are proposed to entrench sustainability in harmony with various aspects such as technology, environment, society, and economy. Out of 17 SDGs, SDG 7 is the primary goal to influence the rest of the goals through SDG interaction [2] . SDG 7 emphasize ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This goal acts as the foundation for climate actions and the Paris Agreement. The targets set by the United Nations for SDG 7 up to 2030 are as follows [3] :• Target 7.1: Universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services for all.  • Target 7.2: Increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix significantly.  • Target 7.3: Double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency.  • Target 7.a: Enhance international cooperation to clean energy research and technology and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.  • Target 7.b: Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries.    Target 7.1. appears to be more pertinent to climate goals in terms of clean energy access. Target 7.2 directly aligns with the clean energy penetration in the energy mix. The clean energy penetration indirectly influences target 7.3, i.e., energy intensity. Energy intensity can be perceived as the ratio of energy consumption to GDP. A country completely powered by fossil fuels if replaced by renewables, would yield less energy intensity by means of revamped economic growth. This economic growth is mainly stimulated by extended employment opportunities, modern energy facilities, and less expenditure on environmental degradation on a long-term basis [4] . Meanwhile, targets 7.a and 7.b revolves around an individual country’s potential and priorities, and the availability of energy resources. The role of clean energy technologies in influencing these two targets remains insignificant. Therefore, this study extends the investigation only for targets 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3. Altogether, SDG 7 is designed to achieve energy sustainability via three aspects: energy accessibility, clean energy consumption and energy intensity. In any country, it is utmost to achieve SDG 7 as a gateway for entrenching sustainability in all aspects. In the case of Australia, energy accessibility in terms of access to electricity and clean cooking fuels is well-established [5] . The penetration of renewable energy has witnessed astonishing growth in recent years. Regarding energy intensity, there has been a consistent decrease and in 2020, the energy intensity accounts for 4.4 MJ per 1$ of GDP [5] . Nevertheless, the humongous contribution of fossil fuels in the energy mix and electricity generation, sustained fossil fuel markets aided by policies, and prolific incentive programs for renewables altogether make the scenario for achieving energy sustainability in Australia paradoxical. Furthermore, the coal sector is a significant contributor to Australia’s economy [6] . Therefore, this study considers Australia as an interesting case study to analyse the potential of each major clean energy technology that can propel the country towards energy sustainability. The per capita carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions and energy consumption is the highest concerning factor in Australia. A study suggests that the economic growth of Australia increases the CO2  emissions for both long- and short- terms while the trade and renewable energy consumption decrease it on a short-run basis [7] . Findings of a study suggests that decarbonizing the energy sector can yield an 80 % reduction in carbon emissions [8] . Also, higher energy imports can deter progress in accomplishing emission targets [9] . Fig. 1   illustrates the energy mix in the Australian landscape every five years. On analysing the energy mix in Australia, it can be observed that most energy comes from Oil, Gas and Coal. This gives a tacit acknowledgement that Australia depends primarily on fossil fuels by more than 91.57 % in 2021. Meanwhile, certain studies also indicate that the electricity mix in Australia will primarily rely on fossil fuels accounting for more than 50 % in 2030 and needs novel efforts beyond 2030 [10] . This means Australia requires wide-scale deployment of clean energy technologies to curb emissions [11]  and progress towards achieving SDG 7. To analyse the potentiality of various clean energy technologies in achieving energy sustainability, several factors pertaining to energy sustainability need to be considered. Therefore, the problem can be pictured as a multi-dimensional conundrum and the assessment can be performed by utilizing Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodology. The MCDM method is a renowned branch of Operations Research models that supports complex decision-making problems involving conflicting criteria and high uncertainty [13] . It can be used to rank the various alternatives under various circumstances and assumptions[14] . In the energy domain, the commonly used MCDM methods include Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Best-Worst Method (BWM), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) – I & II, Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE), and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR). Table 1   shows the various studies that utilized the MCDM approach to find the best alternative for energy-related problems. The development of a fuzzy environment adds flexibility in MCDM approaches and fuzzified MCDA methods such as Fuzzy AHP, and Fuzzy TOPSIS are also well-established in the energy field. Studies dealing with Geographic Information System (GIS) based MCDA methods are highly preferred for improving the installed capacity and determination of suitable sites for any clean energy technologies [15] . Neutrosophic-based MCDM methodologies are also emerging to evaluate energy technologies such as sustainability assessment of onshore wind facilities and evaluation of solar PV manufactures for effective decision-making [16,17] . From the literature review, multiple research gap can be inferred. It can be observed that most of the studies utilize single MCDA method despite the uncertainty involved in the mathematical construction of MCDA. Literature review also shows that studies does focus on multiple MCDA methods to provide reliable results with sensitivity analysis. However, the utilization of obtained results are not extrapolated to the pragmatic scenario by formulating strategies and policies to achieve the propounded objective. On the other hand, studies lack robustness in analysing the influence of weightage methods and only few studies have investigated the variations in the results with the usage of objective and subjective weightage methods. It can be also observed that similar criteria or indicators are consistently used across studies, but accomplishing energy transition and energy sustainability require a revamped multi-dimensional analysis that yields a holistic assessment. In this study, the use of MCDM is not limited to a single method since each of the methods has its approach to extracting the optimal decision and its associated limitations. The authors utilize seven MCDM methods which include VIKOR, PROMETHEE II, Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA), TOPSIS, Weighted Sum Model (WSM), Weighted Product Model (WPM), Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) for ranking the clean energy technologies. Also, for determining the weights, two different approaches via Shannon’s Entropy and Fuzzy AHP are incorporated. The purpose of using seven MCDM methods and two weightage determination methods is to extrapolate a robust and reliable result. Specific approaches towards SDG 7 for Australia are framed based on the results from MCDA models. Furthermore, the evaluation criteria used to assess the alternatives are specifically selected or framed to portray the energy sustainability aspects. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no study to comprehensively assess the potentiality of clean energy technologies to support the energy sustainability vision of Australia. The hallmark of this study relies on developing approaches to assess the energy sustainability performance using various MCDM methods and integrating the results of MCDM models to develop strategies that ultimately support the progress towards SDG 7. Therefore, the contribution of the study extends as follows:• Identifying multi-dimensional unique evaluation criteria for assessing energy sustainability performance.  • Curating data for novel evaluation criteria and developing methods to quantify the qualitative criteria.  • Computing robust and reliable results with 7 MCDM and 2 weightage determination models for evaluating the potentiality of clean energy technologies in Australia.  • Framing strategical approach to achieve SDG 7 in the Australian landscape by using the results of MCDA assessment, curated data in various evaluation criteria, and literature review.  • Envisioning solar energy as the key player to achieve SDG 7 in Australia.  • Implying policies to support the SDG 7 vision in Australia with the results obtained from MCDA.    The rest of the work is organised as follows: Section 2   briefs the research methodology. Section 3   presents the various supportive renewable energy technologies in Australia. Section 4   elucidates the evaluation criteria and the method to structuralize them with deep insights. Section 5   elaborates on seven MCDM methods and two weightage determination methods to assess the alternatives and discusses results with comparative analysis. In Section 6  , a strategic approach to achieve SDG 7 in Australia with the key findings is proposed. This is backed up by policy implications in Section 7  . Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 8  .  2 Research methodology The ambitious objective of promoting SDG 7 in any country needs a robust methodology to extract results, frame strategies and investigate the feasibility. The research methodology of this study is briefed graphically in Fig. 2  . Initially, the prominent clean energy technologies that are well-established in Australia are identified and investigated for their potential to achieve energy sustainability. The evaluation criteria are designed through an extensive literature survey to represent energy sustainability. The criteria are further classified into sub-criteria. Since numerous factors and uncertainties are involved in directing the energy sustainability scenario, an MCDM-based analysis is utilized. With the framed evaluation criteria, the alternatives are assessed against each criterion and a quantified score is obtained as output with the inputs obtained either via a literature survey or through developed sophisticated methodology. The weightage of each criterion is enumerated depending on its enabling potential to achieve energy sustainability. The decision analysis is performed using the MCDM engine, and the alternatives are ranked according to the optimal solution. The MCDM models in this study are purposed for three functions: converting linguistic terms to quantified score, weightage determination for the evaluation criteria and assessing the alternatives against the criteria to find the optimum solution and rank the same. The authors preferred Fuzzy AHP to convert the linguistic terms to quantified scores owing to its ability to handle ambiguity in decision-maker opinions. For weightage determination, two MCDM models, such as Fuzzy AHP and Shannon’s Entropy method are utilized. The specifics of using two MCDM models for weightage determination are that the former method allocates the weightage by quantifying the approximated significance derived from the literature review and authors’ insight. Meanwhile, the latter method extrapolates the weightage by using the evaluated scores of alternatives in the decision matrix. For evaluating the optimal solution and ranking the alternatives, seven MCDM models are incorporated, which include VIKOR, MOORA, PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS, WSM, WPM and WASPAS. The results from seven models under two weightage scenarios are subjected to comparative analysis to obtain a cumulative solution. Thus, the estimated solution will be robust and reliable for further analysis. Though the clean energy alternatives have been ranked with the aid of MCDMs, it only depicts the potentiality of the alternatives to contribute towards SDG 7 in Australia. The pragmatic feasibility, hampering and bolstering factors need to be investigated for the respective alternatives to effectively frame the strategies. The resource potential, grid integration, population density, and social acceptance are considered peculiarly to bridge the current scenario to achieve SDG 7. On the other hand, the policy aspects are focused on driving the developments and increasing the penetration of clean energy technologies to grasp the prevailing opportunities as highlighted in the proposed strategies. Therefore, the first part of the study is used to determine the energy sustainability performance of various clean energy alternatives, and the second part of this study is to propose effective strategies to foster the progress of Australia towards energy sustainability. The strategies may not be a derivative of MCDA results, rather they are built upon the data that is used for MCDA analysis. Altogether, this study presents a novel approach to steer the country’s energy sector right in the pathway of energy sustainability as well as create a foundation to achieve the rest of the SDGs.  3 Prominent clean energy technologies in Australia Renewable energy contribution in Australia has witnessed a 215 % increase in the past decade [42] . Fig. 3   illustrates the renewable energy growth in Australia from 1997 to 2022. Among the total renewable electricity generation, hydropower, wind energy, solar and bioenergy constitute about 20.3 %, 34.7 %, 41.3 %, and 3.7 %, respectively. Other clean energy technologies utilizing geothermal and ocean energy resources are still in the early stages of development [43,44] , however, their potential is acknowledged with the progress in research. In this study, clean energy technologies that are commercially scaled are only considered. Therefore, the prominent clean energy technologies in Australia are hydropower, wind energy, solar energy, and bioenergy. 3.1 Hydropower Hydropower technology is a mature electricity-generating technology that can harvest electrical energy from water reservoirs with the aid of turbines. It has the highest net energy ratio and higher energy conversion efficiency than any other type of renewable energy technology. Australia is one of the driest habitats in the world. About 80 % of the landmass receives less than 600 mm of rainfall per year, and 50 % of the landmass receives less than 300 mm of rainfall per year [50] . In 2022, hydropower accounts for 16 % of total renewable capacity [5] . The net electricity generated by hydropower in 2022 is 17,010 GWh [42] . On interpreting the major operating hydroelectric power plants, it can be observed that Western Australia and South Australia have the least hydropower capacity with their respective contributions accounting for 30.1 MW and 4.4 MW [46] . The largest cumulative hydropower capacity is situated in New South Wales (4677.1 MW), which is followed by Tasmania (2315.7 MW), Victoria (803.1 MW) and Queensland (674.4 MW) [46] . The high variability in rainfall, evaporation rates and temperatures are the prime cause for Australia’s limited and variable surface water resources. It is theoretically estimated that Australia’s gross hydropower potential is about 265 TWh per year, but the technical feasibility accounts for only 60 TWh per year. More than 60 % of economically feasible hydroelectric potential has already been harnessed [45] . However, in recent years no significant expansion of hydropower plants has been observed. When analysing the key factors influencing Australia’s hydropower resources, it can be highlighted that most large hydroelectric power plants have already been developed and remain operational for decades. Therefore, refurbishing and replacing advanced equipment with significant expenditure would improve efficiency and decrease the environmental impacts of existing hydropower plants. The future growth of hydropower in Australia depends primarily on small-scale plants rather than limited large-scale hydropower plants [46] . Further developments can be aided with pumped storage facilities.  3.2 Wind energy Wind Energy technology is also considered a mature and clean renewable energy technology with low operating costs. Australian landscape has some of the world’s best wind resources, extending from the south-eastern to the south-western region of the continent. Large-scale topography such as the Great Dividing Range in eastern Australia influences strong steering effects on the winds, channelling them through major valleys or deflecting them from the rest of the areas [47] . The average wind speeds in these areas are high enough to yield more power. In 2022, the cumulative electricity generated from wind energy includes 29,105 GWh [42]  and 22 % of the renewable capacity of Australia is backed up by wind energy technology [5] . In this study, onshore wind energy alone is considered as wind energy for simplification of the analyses. Grid constraints severely affect the growth of wind energy penetration in the Australian electricity mix. Among the several states, South Australia possesses myriad of wind farms while Victoria and Western Australia trail behind it. Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) envisioned achieving a minimum of 33,000 GWh of electricity generated from renewables by 2020 for which wind energy played a pivotal role [46] . The lifecycle emissions of onshore wind energy technology range from 7 to 56 gCO2  eq./kWh and the median value is 11 gCO2 eq./kWh [48] . However, the operational emissions are near zero and the primary emissions arise from infrastructure and supply chain emissions.  3.3 Solar energy Solar energy is the energy harvested from the sun’s radiation either by means of solar thermal systems or solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this study, solar thermal systems and concentrated PV are not considered as their contribution is insignificant in Australia. Therefore, this clean energy technology alternative deals with roof-top solar PV and utility PV technologies. In Australia, solar energy is the largest untapped renewable energy resource. It receives one of the highest average solar radiations per square meter in any other continent in the world [46] . In 2022, the cumulative electricity generated from both utility-scale and rooftop PV accounts for 34,686 GWh [42] . Also, in the same year, solar energy has the highest renewable capacity, about 61 %, with a net capacity addition of 3,922 MW in 2022 alone [5] . This indicates the recent shift in attention towards solar energy in Australia. From 2017 to 2019, investments in solar large-scale PV and wind energy technology have skyrocketed by billions [49] . The annual solar radiation received by Australia is about 58 million petajoules (PJ), more than 9000 times the total energy consumption of Australia [46] . West and central regions of Australia contain huge solar energy resources. However, these are in the areas where access to the national electricity grid is not available. On the other hand, a few reports also suggest that Australia's cumulative solar rooftop PV potential is about 245 TWh per year [50] . It is interesting to note that more than 2.5 million households have solar rooftop PV, which is approximately 23.5 % of the total number of houses in Australia [51] . Further, many policy measures such as the Solar Homes Program, and Home Battery Scheme support the installation of solar rooftop PV. Therefore, solar energy highly promotes modern and clean energy accessibility in Australia.  3.4 Bioenergy Bioenergy is a renewable energy derived from naturally occurring biomass material, especially for heat generation or electricity generation. In Australia, bioenergy contributed to 58 % of the total renewable energy usage (including heat energy) in 2017 which is the highest contribution among other renewable resources [5] . When considering power generation, bioenergy resources are utilized to produce 3,190 GWh of electricity in 2022 [42] . Presently, Bagasse, wood waste, gases from landfills and sewage facilities are the prominent bioenergy resources that are utilized in Australia to produce heat and electricity [46] . Biofuels represent only a minor contribution to the Australian transportation sector. The potential of bioenergy resources in Australia is large and diverse. The unexploited biomass resource primarily revolves around biomass residues and wastes. A feasibility study for locating biomass to bioenergy conversion facilities using spatial information technologies indicates that in Queensland alone, the potential of forest biomass energy extends to 23.09 PJ [52] . Forest bioenergy utilization is highly untapped despite the existence of significant opportunities. One of the major hindrances to forest bioenergy utilization is the lack of public acceptance and support, especially in the case of native forest residues [53] . When the use of bioresources is expanded, a significant consideration of sustainable use of bioresources is required to avoid negative consequences to the ecosystem The consumption of biomass energy offers a huge lifecycle GHG emission relative to other renewable energy resources. For instance, when biomass is cofired, the lifecycle emissions are about 740 gCO2  eq./kWh (median value) and when dedicated bioenergy conversion is considered, a reduced lifecycle emission of about 230 gCO2  eq./kWh (median value) prevails [48] . The Clean Energy Council’s Bioenergy Roadmap indicates that the long-term potential for generating electricity using bioresources is as high as 72,629 GWh/year in 2050 [54] , almost 20 times higher than that of produced in 2019.   4 Evaluation criteria In this section, 6 evaluation criteria including energy transition, geographical, economic, political, social, and environmental criteria as well as 16 sub-criteria are proposed to provide in-depth insights into the clean energy technology that can ultimately support Australia in making immense progress towards energy sustainability in a short span of time. Fig. 4   shows all the evaluation criteria and its sub-criteria. 4.1 Energy transition criteria Transitioning to renewable energy from fossil fuels is the first and foremost progress towards substantiating energy sustainability in any country. This criterion is proposed to evaluate the alternative’s capability to support the rapid energy transition. Energy transition criteria is developed by analysing the current energy mix and future growth which is mapped under three sub-criteria: energy contribution, estimated capacity growth, and estimated energy generation growth. Energy contribution sub-criterion focuses on the present scenario of the energy mix and the evaluation is based on the fraction of energy contribution to the total renewable energy supply. As 2020 is the latest data covering Australia's overall energy balance including heat energy, it is considered for evaluation and the dataset is obtained from the IRENA country statistics profile [5] . It can be observed that bioenergy has the highest renewable contribution with a 43 % share in the renewable energy mix. Estimated capacity growth demonstrates the total installed capacity of energy technologies in the future scenario. The estimated growth of RE technology from 2021 to 2027 is gathered from the IEA data and statistics platform [55] . In Australia, solar PV has the highest estimated capacity growth of 5.3 GW per year and bioenergy has the lowest with 0.017 GW capacity growth per year up to 2027. Similar to the estimated capacity growth, the estimated energy generation growth marks the total annual energy generation from the corresponding energy alternatives in the future scenario. The data is obtained from the IEA data and statistics platform from 2021 to 2027 [55]  and the average per annual estimated energy generation growth is calculated. It can be noticed that the average per annual estimated energy growth is highest for solar energy with 6.13 TWh per year while the lowest value of 0.1 TWh per year corresponds to bioenergy. Table 2   shows the contribution of clean energy technologies under each sub-criteria of energy transition criteria.  4.2 Geographical criteria Geographical attributes and climate factors influence the penetration rate of clean energy technologies. This criterion is categorized into three sub-criteria: energy resource potential, capacity factor, and power density. Australia is blessed with diverse renewable resources such as hydropower, solar, wind and bioenergy. The hydropower resource potential in Australia is about 60 TWh [45] . When considering solar energy, the annual solar radiation is 58 million PJ [46] , far exceeding other available energy resources. The renewable energy potential for wind, solar, and bioenergy is projected to be 3100, 71700, and 108 TWh, respectively, according to the modelling report published by the Australian Energy Market Operator [56,57] . The capacity factor of a power plant is the ratio of electrical energy generated to the maximum electrical energy produced if operated continuously for a given period. The capacity factor is sensitive to the geographical location, for instance, wind flow pattern, solar insolation and many other factors, which varies from region to region. In this study, the average weighted capacity factor of Oceania is considered for the analysis and the data is obtained from the IRENA report [58] . Bioenergy technology has the highest capacity factor with the value of 65 and solar PV has the minimum capacity factor with the value of 18. The power density can be interpreted as the electrical power produced per m2  of horizontal surface area. This prevails as the suitable metric for the extent of land usage by various energy conversion technologies. The power densities of 9 energy types and the required power density data for the considered four clean energy alternatives are extracted from a referenced study [59] . The median value is considered. The power densities of hydropower, wind energy, solar energy and bioenergy alternatives are 0.14, 1.84, 6.63, and 0.08 W/m2 , respectively [59] . Table 3   shows the contribution of clean energy technologies under each sub-criteria of geographical criteria.  4.3 Economic criteria The evaluation of the economic feasibility of various clean energy technologies is of the utmost importance, and it has significant potential to drive investors. Thus, the considered sub-criteria include the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), total installation costs and net energy ratio. LCOE is a vital economic factor for the power plant that illustrates the average net present cost for generating electricity throughout its lifetime. Considering Oceania, the weighted average LCOE of hydropower, wind, solar, and bioenergy alternatives is 0.061, 0.033, 0.049, and 0.061 USD/kWh, respectively. The data is obtained from the IRENA report [58] . Total installation cost marks the capital cost involved in installing an energy project and is expressed in USD/kW. This factor highly influences the LCOE and attracts investors. The total installation cost also varies according to installation location and thus, the weighted average values corresponding to Oceania are considered for the analysis. The data is obtained from the IRENA report [58] . The net energy is expressed as the ratio of the energy produced to the energy invested to produce it. This is called the Net Energy Ratio or Energy Return on Investment. The net energy ratio can vary for the same source depending on geographical and climatic factors and depending on the source of energy [60] . The net energy ratio data is obtained from the study authored by Murphy and Charles [61] . From the data, it can be observed that hydropower has the maximum net energy ratio which is followed by wind, solar and bioenergy. Table 4   shows the contribution of clean energy technologies under each sub-criteria of economic criteria.  4.4 Political criteria Political criteria investigate the amount of support provided by the policies framed in Australia to achieve energy sustainability. The functional policies are filtered from the IEA policies platform [62]  and the policies for the past ten years are heeded for investigation. To quantify the degree of support offered by the policies, a 3-point scale ranking score is considered where 3 indicates the highest score. Scores 1, 2 and 3 represent strategical or general support, moderate support and high-level support, respectively. The investment amount primarily determines the difference between moderate and high-level support. The scrutinized policies are assessed corresponding to the clean energy technologies with the 3-point scale ranking score. If a policy supports all the clean energy technologies, its score is added to all the technologies. The cumulative score is calculated for each alternative and its policy score is obtained through normalization. Therefore, the maximum score is 1. Table 5   shows the scrutinized policies, year of implementation, jurisdiction, and supporting technology while Table 6   details the policy score.  4.5 Social criteria Social criteria revolve around society from different corners, such as the public, investors, market and many other factors. It is a complicated criterion involving lots of uncertainties. In this study, the social criteria are designed to portray accessibility and acceptability characteristics of clean energy alternatives and are composed of three sub-criteria namely, promotion of clean energy accessibility, job creation, and social acceptance. Though Australia has 100 % electricity access and 95 % clean fuel access, electricity generation is mainly produced from polluting resources, especially fossil fuels [5] . In such cases, there is a pressing need to improve clean energy access to the population by means of renewables. Table 7   shows the impact of each clean energy technology in promoting clean energy accessibility. The job created by the installation and maintenance of various clean energy projects is substantial to promote acceptance among the society in addition to supplying the clean energy. The relevant data is obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [68] . The number of jobs created by hydropower, wind energy, solar energy and bioenergy technologies is divided by the energy generated by the same to represent the job creation in terms of the number of jobs per GWh of energy supply. The hydropower, wind energy, solar energy and bioenergy technologies generate 0.192, 0.183, 1.2, and 0.451 jobs per GWh, respectively. Social acceptance is evaluated as the cumulative acceptance from socio-political, market and community aspects. The evaluation of social acceptance from various resources is summarized in Table 8   which aids in categorizing each clean energy technology to a particular linguistic term.  4.6 Environmental criteria It is one of the cardinal criterion, and it shows how green the considered clean energy alternatives are. The environmental criteria are evaluated from the aspects of lifecycle GHG emissions, eco-friendliness, and climate action effectiveness. Lifecycle GHG emissions involve the emissions from manufacturing the equipment, emissions while installing them, operating emissions and even the supply chain emissions [76] . The data is obtained from the report [48] , and the median value is considered for the analysis. It is represented in gCO2  eq./kWh and the lifecycle GHG emission for hydropower, wind energy, solar energy and bioenergy is 24, 11, 48, and 230 gCO2  eq./kWh, respectively. Despite offering numerous advantages towards environmental sustainability, the adverse impact of clean energy technologies on the ecosystem is often overlooked, which has significant environmental consequences. The impact of each clean energy technology on the ecosystem is presented in Table 9  . The eco-friendliness criterion is constructed based on two-dimensional perspective which include ecological impact and potential to contribute to circular economy. The term climate action effectiveness is coined by the authors to indicate the ability of the action to induce more progress in climate change resiliency. Climate action effectiveness shows the efforts in terms of investment in a particular clean energy technology to save one kg of CO2  equivalent. Mathematically, climate action effectiveness is defined as the ratio of emission savings obtained by a given clean energy technology to the levelized cost of energy. The ratio is multiplied by normalized energy resource potential to indicate the presence of resources. Climate action effectiveness is measured in kg CO2  eq. / USD. For improving climate action effectiveness, LCOE should be the least, energy resource potential should be the highest and emission savings should be maximum. The data source of LCOE and energy resource potential is obtained from [58]  and [46,56,57] , respectively. The emission saving is determined by the difference between the lifecycle emissions of Australia’s average fossil fuel emission in the current energy mix and the lifecycle emission of clean energy technology. Australia’s fossil fuel emission is the sum of the product of the energy mix of fossil fuel in % and its lifecycle emission. Australia’s average fossil fuel emission is determined to be 785.11 g CO2  eq./kWh. Table 10   shows the climate action effectiveness for various clean energy technologies.   5 Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Since the conflicting criteria and uncertainties are involved in assessing the energy sustainability performance, the objective can be fulfilled with the aid of MCDA. In this study, the MCDA is utilized for three functions: first, to convert linguistic terms into a quantified score; second, to determine the weightage of each evaluation criterion, third, to obtain the optimal solution and to rank the clean energy alternatives. MCDA methods can be computed using pymcdm and JMcDM library [85,86] , and the authors used excel spreadsheets to compute the analysis in this research. 5.1 Quantification of linguistic terms The linguistic terms correspond to three sub-criteria which include the promotion of clean energy accessibility, eco-friendliness, and social acceptance. In this study, the linguistic terms are converted into quantified terms using the Fuzzy AHP methodology. 5.1.1 Fuzzy AHP Fuzzy AHP is primarily used to handle uncertainties in decision-making problems and reduces the ambiguity in capturing human appraisal. The FAHP can be performed using the following procedure [87] .Step 1: Pairwise comparison matrix    Saaty’s pairwise comparison scale [88]  can be used to develop the pairwise comparison matrix (A ij     ) as shown in Eq. (1) . The built pairwise comparison matrix is fuzzified using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFN). The TFN denotes the corners of the triangle and is written in the format of (a, b, c).(1) A ij   = A 11   A 12   ⋯  A 1 n     A ∼  12  - 1     A 22   ⋯  A 2 n     ⋮   ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   A ∼  n 1  - 1     A ∼  n 2  - 1    ⋯  A nn              where A ij   = ( l i j   , m i j   , u i j   )     and A ∼  ij  - 1   = ( l i j   , m i j   , u i j   )  - 1   = 1 u i j    , 1 m i j    , 1 l i j         , such that l i j   < m i j   < u i j     .Step 2: Aggregated fuzzy decision matrix    All the evaluation criteria are merged to form an aggregated fuzzy decision matrix by using Eq. (2) .(2) r i  = ∏ i = 1  n  A ij    n      where ri  is the aggregated TFN corresponding to criteria i.Step 3: Determine Fuzzy weights    The fuzzy weights can be determined by finding the ratio of aggregated TFN corresponding to a single criterion to the sum of the aggregated TFN of all the criteria. It is expressed in Eq. (3) .(3) w i  = r i  ∑ i = 1  n  r i    = r i  × ∑ i = 1  n  r i     - 1       where wi  is the relative fuzzy weight of decision criteria.Step 4: Defuzzification    Using the Centre of Area method, the defuzzification is performed which Is mathematically expressed in Eq. (4) .(4) C e n t r e  o f  w e i g h t  ( M i  )  = l Å ́  i   ⊕ m Å ́  i   ⊕ u Å ́  i    3      Where Mi  is the non-fuzzy weight of each decision criterion.Step 5: Normalization    Since the weightage obtained does not equal one in most cases, normalization is performed with the aid of Eq. (5) .(5) N i  = Mi  ∑ n = 1  N  M i           where Ni  is the normalized non-fuzzy weight corresponding to decision criteria. Using Fuzzy AHP, the linguistic terms are converted into weightage values for the sub-categories of social acceptance sub-criteria. The score of the social acceptance sub-criteria is then obtained by considering an equal weightage scenario for each sub-category. The linguistic terms and quantified results of clean energy accessibility, eco-friendliness, and social acceptance sub-categories are shown in Table 11  . On quantifying all the criteria, a decision matrix is obtained and is shown in Table 12  .   5.2 Determination of criteria weightage For determining the weightage of each criterion, two MCDM models: Fuzzy AHP and Shannon’s Entropy are considered. For Fuzzy AHP, the criterion’s significance in achieving SDG 7 is determined by authors and corresponding linguistic terms are given as input to obtain a quantified weightage. Meanwhile, the Entropy method calculates the weightage depending on the quantified evaluated score of each clean energy alternative corresponding to each evaluation criterion. 5.2.1 Fuzzy AHP-based weightage determination Fuzzy AHP methodology has already been explained in Section 5.1.1 . The pairwise comparison matrix is shown in Appendix Table A1 – A7 and the Fuzzy AHP weights are shown in Table 13  .  5.2.2 Shannon’s Entropy based weightage determination The following steps are employed to obtain the weights for each evaluation criterion and sub-criteria using Shannon’s entropy methodology [37] .Step 1: Normalization    The decision matrix is subjected to normalization to obtain the normalized value nij  by using Eq. (6) .(6) n ij   = x ij   ∑ i = 1  m  x ij         where m is the number of alternatives, i is the row, and j is the column of the decision matrixStep 2: Entropy calculation    The normalized data is then used for calculating the entropy value, ej  by using Eq. (7) .(7) e j  = - k ∑ i = 1  m  n ij   ln ( n ij   )      Where k = 1/ln(m).Step 3: Evaluate the diversification factor    The diversification factor for each column is evaluated by using Eq. (8) .(8) d j  = 1 - e j      where dj  is the diversification factorStep 4: Compute the weightage    The normalized weight vector can be computed with the diversification factor by utilizing Eq. (9) .(9) W j  = d j  ∑ j = 1  n  d j        where Wj  is the weightage corresponding criteria j. The resulting weightage is obtained directly from the dataset used. Table 14   shows the stepwise results obtained using Shannon’s Entropy method and the resulting weightage for the criteria. The comparison of weightage obtained by using Fuzzy AHP and Shannon’s Entropy method is depicted in Fig. 5  . In Shannon’s Entropy method, more weightage is observed corresponding to the criteria that have higher dispersion in data statistically. In Fuzzy AHP, the weightage is determined by pair-wise comparison with respect to each criterion. As the process of weightage determination is different, the difference in the weightage is resulted.   5.3 Ranking of alternatives For ranking the alternatives, seven MCDM methods that are utilized were briefly explained in this section. 5.3.1 VIKOR VIKOR is commonly used to find the best alternative when conflicting decisions and non-commensurable criteria exist. The optimum alternative is decided based on the measure of closeness to the ideal solution [89] . This MCDM is applied to evaluate renewable energy projects in several studies by taking into consideration the technical, environmental and economic aspects [90,91] . VIKOR is also used in analysing the challenges to renewable energy adoption [92] . The algorithm of the VIKOR method is as follows:Step 1: Determine the positive ideal solution f j  ∗     (PIS) and negative ideal solution f j  -     (NIS)    In the decision matrix, find the best and worst solution associated with beneficial and cost criteria. For beneficial criteria, the maximum value is regarded as PIS (f j  ∗     ) and the minimum value is regarded as NIS (f j  -    ) while it is vice-versa in the case of cost criteria. For beneficial criteria,f j  ∗   = max i  f ij   ; f j  -  = min i  f ij       For cost criteria,f j  ∗   = min i  f ij   ; f j  -  = max i  f ij       Step 2: Compute Si and Ri values    The Si and Ri can be evaluated by using Eq. (10) and (11) .(10) S i  = ∑ j = 1  n  w j  f j  ∗   - f ij      / ( f  j  ∗   - f j  -  )      (11) R i  = max j  w j  f j  ∗   - f ij      / ( f  j  ∗   - f j  -  )         where wj  are the weights of the criteria and m a x   j     represents the maximum value in the criteria j.Step 3: Evaluate Qi value    Qi value is computed using Eq. (12) .(12) Q i  = v S i  - S  ∗    S  -  - S  ∗        + 1 - v    R i  - R  ∗    R  -  - R  ∗            Where S* = min S i    , S  -     = max S i    , R* = min R i    , R  -     = max R i     and v    is the weight for the strategy of maximum group utility, whereas (1-v   ) is the weight of individual regret. Typically, v    can take values from 0 to 1 and is assumed to be 0.5 in this case.Step 4: Rank the alternatives    The alternative with a minimum Qi value is selected as the best alternative. Table 15   shows the resulting ranking of the alternatives. However, the following two conditions are required to be satisfied for validating the ranking using the VIKOR method [93,94] .Condition (1) : Acceptable advantage     The relation in Eq. (13)  should be satisfied to prove the acceptable advantage.(13) Q A  2     - Q ( A  1  )  ≥ 1 n - 1       where A2  and A1  are the alternatives with rank 2 and 1, respectively, and n is the number of alternatives.Condition (2) : Acceptable stability in decision-making     The alternative that is ranked first should be best ranked in either Si or Ri value. If any one of the criteria is not satisfied, then a set of compromise solutions need to be proposed.• Alternatives A1  and A2  can be considered as compromise solutions when only Condition (2)  is not satisfied.  • Alternatives A1 , A2 , …, and AM  can be considered as compromise solutions if only Condition (1)  is not satisfied. AM  can be computed by using Eq. (14) .   (14) Q A  M     - Q ( A  1  )  < 1 n - 1       Condition (1)  is not satisfied in the Fuzzy AHP based weightage scenario while it is satisfied in the Entropy-based weightage scenario. Condition (2)  is satisfied in both weightage scenarios. Also, under the Fuzzy AHP weightage scenario, Q (A3 ) – Q (A1 ) > 1/(n-1) and therefore, only wind energy and solar energy can be considered as compromised solutions. The revised ranking is shown in Table 16  .  5.3.2 MOORA The MOORA method is a decision-making algorithm that can cumulatively provide an optimum solution that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the costs. MOORA can be performed by two methods such as, by using a ratio system and the other by using reference point approaches [95] . The application of MOORA is predominant in material selection [96,97] , thermal application for selecting the best configuration [98] , and supplier evaluation [99] . In this study, MOORA is performed by utilizing a ratio system approach. The steps are detailed as follows:Step 1: Normalization of the decision matrix    In MOORA, the normalization of each alternative value against a criterion is accomplished by using Eq. (15) .(15) x ij  ∗   = x ij   ∑ i = 1  m  x ij  2         where x ij  ∗      is the normalized dimensionless number that ranges between [0,1], and xij  is the score in the decision matrix for ith  alternative and jth  criteria. The normalized decision matrix is shown in Table 17  .Step 2: Weighted normalized decision matrix    The weightage corresponding to each criterion is multiplied by the normalized score as illustrated in Eq. (16) .(16) W ij   = w j  x ij  ∗       where wj  is the weightage of criterion j and Wij  is the weighted normalized score of the ith  alternative corresponding to the jth  criterion.Step 3: Determine the overall performance score    The weighted normalized score corresponding to all beneficial criteria is added and similarly, the weighted normalized score associated with all cost criteria is added. Then the sum of the weighted normalized beneficial score is subtracted from the sum of the weighted normalized cost score. This is mathematically represented in Eq. (17) .(17) y i  = ∑ j = 1  g  W ij   - ∑ j = g + 1  n  W ij       where g and (n-g) are the number of criteria to be maximized (beneficial criteria) and minimized (cost criteria), respectively. yi  value represents the overall performance score.Step 4: Rank the alternatives    The higher the y i     value, the better is the alternative. Thus, the highest-ranking is provided for the highest y i     value. Table 18   represents the overall score and the ranking obtained using the MOORA method.  5.3.3 PROMETHEE II PROMETHEE I yields only a partial ranking while PROMETHEE II provides a complete ranking of alternatives. The PROMETHEE II algorithm works on the basis of a pair-wise comparison of alternatives among each criterion [100] . PROMETHEE II is extended to many applications such as decision-making in energy exploitation projects [101] , ranking market opportunity supporting websites [102] , supplier performance assessment in the petrochemical industry [103] , selection of airport location [104] , alternative fuel consumption [105]  and hybrid power system [106] . The detailed steps for performing PROMETHEE II are presented below [107,108] :Step 1: Normalization of the decision matrix    The decision matrix or the evaluation matrix is normalized using Eq. (18) & (19)  and, depending on the nature of the criteria. For beneficial criteria,(18) N ij   = x ij   - min j  ( x ij   )     max j  ( x ij   )  - min j  ( x ij   )          For cost criteria,(19) N ij   = max j  ( x ij   )  - x ij      max j  ( x ij   )  - min j  ( x ij   )          Where Nij  is the elements of normalized decision matrix.Step 2: Compute the difference between alternatives    For each category, compute the difference in the normalized score of each alternative with respect to the other alternatives.Step 3: Evaluate preference function, Pj (a,b)    When the difference value calculated in the above step yields a negative value, replace it with zero or else retain the obtained positive value. After this modification, the preference function of the ‘a’ alternative with respect to the ‘b’ alternative is the resulted positive difference value. This is mathematically expressed in Eq. (20) . Table 19   depicts the obtained preference function.(20) P j  a , b    = 0 , N aj   - N bj   < 0    N aj   - N bj   , N aj   - N bj   ≥ 0             Where Naj  and Nbj  represents the normalized score corresponding to alternative a and b for the criteria j, respectively.Step 4: Evaluate Aggregated preference function, π a , b          The aggregated preference function includes the weightage for each criterion or in other words, the preference function is multiplied by the weightage of the corresponding criterion and summed for each alternative to obtain the aggregated preference function. However, when the sum of the weightage differs from unity, the actual aggregated preference function is obtained by dividing the sum of the weightage as given in Eq. (21) . The obtained aggregated preference function is shown in Table 19 .(21) π a , b    = ∑ j = 1  m  W j  P j  ( a , b )   ∑ j = 1  m  W j        where Wj  is the weightage corresponding to each criterion.Step 5: Determine the leaving and entering outranking flows    The leaving outranking flow for the ath  alternative is computed using Eq. (22) .(22) ϕ  +  = 1 n - 1   ∑ b = 1  n  π ( a , b )  , a ≠ b     where n is the number of alternatives, and ϕ  +     is the leaving outranking flow. The entering outranking flow, ϕ  -     for the ath  alternative can be computed using Eq. (23) . Table 20   presents the obtained leaving and entering outranking flows.(23) ϕ  -  = 1 n - 1   ∑ b = 1  n  π ( b , a )  , a ≠ b     Step 6: Evaluate net outranking flow    The net outranking flow, ϕ a       for each alternative can be evaluated by taking the difference between leaving and entering outranking flow value of the corresponding alternative. This is expressed in Eq. (24) .(24) ϕ a    = ϕ  +  ( a )  - ϕ  -  ( a )      Step 7: Rank the alternatives    Depending on the value of net outranking flow, ranking of the alternatives is accomplished. The higher is the value of net outranking flow, the higher is the rank. Table 20  represents the net outranking flow and the rank of the alternatives.  5.3.4 TOPSIS TOPSIS, one of the popular MCDM approaches, is propounded by Hwang and Yoon to identify the best alternative [109] . The principle behind the TOPSIS is that the best alternative should have the shortest distance and longest distance from the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solution [89] . Several studies have employed the TOPSIS MCDM method in various applications. For instance, the assessment of offshore wind turbine support structures [110] , and ranking renewable energy sources in Taiwan and Turkey [111,112] . The algorithm of TOPSIS is elaborated as follows [111] :Step 1: Normalization of the decision matrix    The decision matrix is normalized by using Eq. (25) .(25) r ij   = a ij   ∑ i = 1  m  a ij  2         where rij  is the element of the normalized decision matrix, and aij  corresponds to the score of ith  alternative against the jth  criteria.Step 2: Weighted normalized decision matrix    The weightage corresponding to each criterion is multiplied with a normalized score which is represented mathematically in Eq. (26) .(26) v ij   = w j  r ij       where vij  is the element of the weighted normalized decision matrix and wj  is the weightage of criterion j. Table 21   shows the weighted normalized decision matrix.Step 3: Determine positive-ideal solution (PIS) and negative-ideal solution (NIS)    The PIS and NIS are denoted by A* and A- , and are calculated using Eq. (27) and (28) .(27) A  ∗   = max v ij   , f o r  b e n e f i t  c r i t e r i a    min v ij   , f o r  c o s t  c r i t e r i a         = v 1  ∗   , v 2  ∗   , ⋯ , v n  ∗          (28) A  -  = min v ij   , f o r  b e n e f i t  c r i t e r i a    max v ij   , f o r  c o s t  c r i t e r i a         = v 1  -  , v 2  -  , ⋯ , v n  -         where n is the number of alternatives, v j  ∗      is the PIS for each criterion and v j  -     is the NIS for each criterion.Step 4: Compute the distance of each alternative from PIS and NIS    The distance of each alternative from PIS, S i  ∗      can be determined by using Eq. (29) .(29) S i  ∗   = ∑ j = 1  m  ( v ij   - v j  ∗   )  2        where m is the number of criteria. The distance of each alternative from NIS, S i  -     can be determined by using Eq. (30) .(30) S i  -  = ∑ j = 1  m  ( v ij   - v j  -  )  2        Step 5: Evaluate the closeness coefficient, CCi     The closeness coefficient can be determined by using Eq. (31) .(31) CC  i  = S i  -  S i  ∗   + S i  -        where CCi  varies between 0 and 1.Step 6: Ranking of alternatives    The alternatives are ranked based on the closeness coefficient value. The greater the value, the better the alternative. If CCi  is closer to 1, then it is nearer to PIS and if it is closer to 0, then it is nearer to NIS. Table 22   shows the distance of each alternative from PIS and NIS, the closeness coefficient and the rank of alternatives.  5.3.5 WSM, WPM and WASPAS All these three models are simple models to identify the best alternatives. The procedure for all three models is as follows [37] :Step 1: Normalized decision matrix    A linear normalization is performed using Eq. (32) . The normalized decision matrix is shown in Table 23  .(32) N ij   = x ij   max i  x ij     , f o r  b e n e f i t  c r i t e r i a    min i  x ij    x ij    , f o r  c o s t  c r i t e r i a             Where Nij  is the normalized decision matrix elements.Step 2: Weighted normalized decision matrix    For WSM:  The weighted normalized value can be obtained by using Eq. (33) .(33) W ij   = w j  N ij       Where wj  is the weightage of criterion obtained from Fuzzy AHP and Entropy method.  For WPM:  The weighted normalized value can be obtained by using Eq. (34) .(34) W ij   = ( N ij   )  w ij        Step 3: Evaluate preference score, Pi     For WSM:  In WSM, the preference score is the summation of all the weighted normalized scores corresponding to an alternative. This is mathematically expressed in Eq. (35) .(35) P i  = ∑ j = 1  m  W ij       For WPM:  In WPM, the preference score is the product of all the weighted normalized scores corresponding to an alternative. This is mathematically expressed in Eq. (36) .(36) P i  = ∏ j = 1  m  W ij       For WASWAP:  The preference score is calculated with the aid of the preference score obtained in both WSM and WPM. It is mathematically expressed in Eq. (37) .(37) P i  = λ ∑ j = 1  m  w j  N  ij   + ( 1 - λ )  ∏ j = 1  m  ( N  ij   )   w ij        where λ ∈ [ 0 , 1  ]   , is the weightage between WSM and WPM preference score and it is assumed as 0.5 in this study.Step 4: Rank the alternative    The higher the value, the higher the rank in all three methods. Table 24   presents the results of the alternatives obtained by using WSM, WPM and WASPAS methods.   5.4 Consolidation of MCDA results Fig. 6   (a) & (b) present the comparison between the ranks of the clean energy alternatives obtained from seven MCDM models under the Fuzzy AHP and Entropy method-based weightage scenario. Except for VIKOR, all other six MCDA models yield similar results under the Fuzzy AHP based weightage scenario. In the VIKOR model, solar and wind energy emerge to be the compromised solutions under the Fuzzy AHP based weightage scenario. Under an entropy-based weightage scenario, VIKOR, PROMETHEE II, MOORA, WSM, WPM and WASPAS produced the same ranking while TOPSIS indicated a different ranking. However, all the models under both weightage scenarios demonstrated that solar energy technology is the most appropriate clean energy alternative to substantiate SDG 7 in Australia. Wind energy is ranked as second in all the models except for TOPSIS under entropy-based weightage scenario. To obtain the most reliable result, a cumulative ranking is required. Since four alternatives are present, the first rank is provided a score of 4 and the last rank is provided a score of 1. A cumulative score is obtained by summing the score of each alternative corresponding to various models and weightage scenarios. The energy sustainability performance or potentiality score is obtained by normalizing the cumulative score such that the score ranges between 0 and 1. Fig. 7   illustrates the percentage of energy sustainability performance of each clean energy technology. It can be observed that solar energy technology emerges to be first, followed by wind, hydropower and biomass energy technologies.  5.5 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the uncertainties involved in the constructed framework to determine the cumulative energy sustainability performance of clean energy alternatives in Australia. The uncertainties are introduced with the FAHP subjective preferences or linguistic terms, weightage methodology and normalization methods. In this study, we have considered 4 normalization methods and 8 weightage scenarios to determine their influence on the results. The normalization methods include min–max normalization, linear sum normalization, vector normalization, and linear normalization. The formulas of four normalization methods are provided in Appendix B1. The weightage scenarios are constructed to include variations in subjective preferences or linguistic terms as well as weightage methodology. When the FAHP method is considered, the weightage scenarios are created by swapping the weightage values of one criterion in the primary level with the criterion having maximum weightage obtained in the original result. This can lead to six different weightage scenarios and the authors termed them as economic-dominated, energy transition-dominated, geographical-dominated, political-dominated, social-dominated, and environmental-dominated FAHP weightage scenarios. All these six weightage scenarios aid in analysing the influence of subjective preferences in FAHP methodology and the weightage of each primary level criteria is represented in Table 25   for six weightage scenarios. The rest two weightage scenarios correspond to the entropy method and best-worst method of weightage determination. The methodology for the best-worst method is shown in Appendix B2, following the reference [13] . It is noteworthy that all the ranking MCDA methods utilized in this study do not have a common normalization method. In the sensitivity analysis, all the ranking methods used in this study are subjected to one normalization method and one weightage scenario at a time to understand its influence. Altogether, we obtain a total of 32 cases from 4 normalization methods and 8 weightage scenarios. The obtained cumulative energy sustainability performance of four alternatives for 32 cases is represented in Table 26  . It can be observed that solar energy consistently ranks first across all 32 cases in the sensitivity analysis. The cumulative performance percentage is more sensitive to the min–max method of normalization when compared to the other three methods of normalization as a consistent reduction in cumulative performance reduction is observed in solar energy and wind energy alternatives while an opposite effect is observed in hydropower and bioenergy alternatives. FAHP method results are very close to the entropy method of weightage determination under economic-weighted scenarios. Meanwhile, the best-worst method of weightage determination also has a close resemblance to the FAHP method under economic scenarios with a higher cumulative performance percentage in bioenergy alternatives. Only when the geographical criteria are considered as dominant criteria, the cumulative performance percentage shift to a considerable amount such that the bioenergy alternative emerges to be better than the hydropower alternative. However, there is no change in the ranks for the solar and wind energy alternatives. Overall, it can be inferred that weightage methods have more influence on the final score rather than the normalization methods. The difference in cumulative energy performance score is obtained by subtracting the original cumulative percentage from the obtained new cumulative percentage. The difference in the results for 32 cases is shown in Table 27  . It can be observed that bioenergy alternative under min–max normalization experiences changes up to 12.5 % while solar energy experiences only a maximum change of 3 %. Most of the difference in scores in Table 27  is below 2 % and bioenergy alternative is subjected to maximum fluctuations in most of the cases. The correlation analysis aids in understanding how similar the results of two quantities are. In this case, the correlation analysis would be pivotal in determining the similarity between the original ranking and the ranking obtained in each of 32 scenarios. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is the commonly used correlation method, but it only describes whether the differences between two rankings exists or not [113] . In other words, the location in which the variations occur cannot be determined by using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient [114] . Thus, Weighted Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is utilized to account for varying levels of importance to provide importance to the positions at the top of both rankings [114] . The Weighted Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rw ) can be determined by using Eq. (38) .(38) r w  = 1 - 6 ∑ i = 1  N  ( x i  - y i  )  2  ( N - x i  + 1    + N - y i  + 1    )   N  4  + N  3  - N  2  - N       where N is the number of entities in the ranking list, xi  and yi  are the ranks of ith  position entities of the two rankings used for correlation, respectively. xi  is fixed for original rankings and yi  is ranking obtained in each scenario of sensitivity analysis. The ranks are compared for each alternative and the total number of entities is 7, which represents seven MCDA methods. Therefore, 32 rw  can be determined for each alternative. The rw  results are represented in Fig. 8   for each alternative. In hydropower alternative, the min–max normalization method yielded much variation in ranking correlation when compared to rest of the three normalization methods since the rw  value is greater than 0.85 in all cases. Linear sum normalization showed the closest similarity to original ranking. The social dominated FAHP scenario yielded the least correlation. The hydropower alternative appears more sensitive to normalization methods when compared to various weightage scenarios. In wind energy alternative, the min–max normalization method affected the rank similarity significantly and the linear sum normalization and vector normalization yielded the closest similarity. The data corresponding to wind energy alternative is more sensitive to weightage scenarios than the normalization methods. The best-worst method reduced the correlation to lesser than 0.8 irrespective of the utilized normalization methods. In solar energy alternative, all the normalization methods and weightage scenarios does not affect the rank similarity as the correlation is 1. However, there is one exception for geographical weightage scenario where the rw  value drops to 0.971 for all normalization methods, still showcasing high correlation. In bioenergy alternative, the min–max normalization method has huge influence, and it managed to drop the rw  value to below 0.75 almost in all weightage scenarios. This also shows that the bioenergy alternative is more sensitive to normalization methods when compared to weightage scenarios. The variation in linear sum normalization and vector normalization is small. The best-worst weightage method induced the highest drop in rw  score but it also contingent on normalization methods used since a rw  score of > 0.95 is observed for linear max normalization under best-worse weightage.  5.6 Rank reversal test Rank reversal is the tendency of MCDA methods to provide inconsistent and contrary results such that a non-optimal alternative is regarded as optimal alternative due to changes in methods such as normalization methods, weightage methods and with the addition or removal of alternatives. Particularly, methods such as VIKOR, TOPSIS, ELECTRE and PROMETHEE II are prone to rank reversal [114,115] . Since some of the forementioned MCDA methods are utilized in this study, it is necessary to test the framework for rank reversal. The influence of normalization methods and weightage methods are assessed in the previous sub-section of sensitivity analysis and the results showed that proposed framework to consolidate all the rankings contributed to build a robust methodology yielded unwavering results. However, it is utmost to further assess for rank reversal by removal or addition of alternatives. As the proposed research study deals with commercial clean energy technologies in Australia, there are no more mature commercial clean energy technologies to consider and thus, the rank reversal test is performed by removal of alternatives. The goal of the rank reversal test by removing alternatives is that the ranking of the alternatives should follow the same ranking hierarchy as of the original set of alternatives. For instance, in a given set of three alternatives if the resulting ranking is A > B > C from a MCDA method, then the results of MCDA if performed with two alternatives should also yield the ranking as A > B, B > C, and A > C in order to preserve the ranking hierarchy. If the ranking deviates from the original ranking order upon evaluating with two alternatives, then there exists a possibility of rank reversal and the results may not be reliable [116] . In this study, the rank reversal test is performed by two alternatives and three alternatives analysis. Two alternatives analysis is accomplished by considering two out of 4 alternatives at a time and subjected to the designed MCDA framework. Therefore, two alternatives analysis yields 6 possible MCDA results. Three alternatives analysis is accomplished by eliminating one of the 4 alternatives at a time and this yields us 4 possible MCDA results. The resulting rankings of two alternatives and three alternatives analysis is represented in Tables 28 and 29   . From case 1, it can be inferred that the ranking of wind energy > hydropower, and similarly, solar energy > hydropower, hydropower > bioenergy, solar energy > wind energy, wind energy > bioenergy, and solar energy > bioenergy for case 2, case 3, case 4, case 5, and case 6, respectively. Consolidating all the ranking, it can be inferred that the ranking hierarchy is solar energy > wind energy > hydropower > bioenergy which is the same as the original ranking hierarchy. It is interesting to note that only in VIKOR method, there are cases with equal rankings under FAHP (Case 4) and entropy method (Case 3) of weightage determination. However, it does not lead to rank reversal, and it shows the significance of consolidating the ranks of all the MCDA methods. From the two alternatives analysis, it can be concluded that there was no rank reversal, and the original ranking hierarchy is preserved in all cases. Upon interpreting three alternatives analysis, case 7 infers that solar energy > wind energy > hydropower, and similarly, wind energy > hydropower > bioenergy, solar energy > hydropower > bioenergy, and solar energy > wind energy > bioenergy for case 8, case 9, and case 10, respectively. Consolidating all the rankings, it can be inferred that the ranking hierarchy is solar energy > wind energy > hydropower > bioenergy which is again the same as the original ranking hierarchy. There was only one variation in the individual rank where hydropower is ranked 2 and the wind energy is ranked 3 in case 7 under entropy method of weightage determination. This is not a rank reversal as the same ranking hierarchy is obtained in the original analysis of four alternatives under entropy based TOPSIS method (Fig. 6 (b)). From the three alternatives analysis, it can be concluded that there was no rank reversal, and the original ranking hierarchy is preserved in all cases. Therefore, the proposed framework successfully passed the rank reversal test as it maintained the original ranking hierarchy in both two and three alternatives analysis. If the MCDA methods are subjected to rank reversal, this research recommends studies focusing on fuzzy stochastic AHP, R-TOPIS and G-TOPSIS methods, utilization of rank reversal immune normalization methods such as fuzzy normalization, Stochastic Triangular Fuzzy Number (S-TFN) normalization [117–120] .   6 Achieving SDG 7 in Australian landscape The results obtained from MCDA indicate that pursuing to expand solar energy installation and utilization will aid in achieving energy sustainability with minimum efforts in Australia. The second most preferable clean energy technology is wind energy which is then followed by hydropower and bioenergy technologies. Australia needs a dramatic shift towards solar energy as the circumstances for solar energy penetration are more favourable than any other clean energy technologies. This can be emphasized by rapid implementation of rooftop PV. Ensuring solar energy at the core of the energy transition is required to promote clean energy accessibility and increase renewable energy contribution. The Australian continent is a huge landmass with a population density of just 3.3 people per square km [64]  and the population is primarily distributed near the coastlines. As discussed earlier, different regions of Australia are blessed with different potential renewable energy resources. Harnessing and integrating them would be pivotal in achieving SDG 7. The northern territory of Australia has a relatively smaller population and solar energy is the only prominent renewable to depend on, but it demands energy storage systems and an integrated community network. Western Australia has the highest solar potential, but the population is distributed only near the southwestern coastal region and few in the Western coastal region. In both cases, the grid connection is limited within the populated areas and no interconnection to the neighbouring state exists. Western Australia can be self-sustained with solar energy technologies and can even export to neighbouring states if a stable grid connection is established. South Australia can depend on wind energy and requires more wind farms to satisfy the electricity demand. To a certain extent, hydropower and bioenergy can support South Australia and rooftop solar PV can reduce the usage of fossil fuel-based energy generation. Tasmania already witnesses great progress in renewable energy consumption but the connection from south-eastern Australia to Tasmania can be strengthened. Offshore windmills especially in these regions will be of great interest. Victoria and Tasmania can work as a coherent unit to harness most of the wind and hydropower potential within the region and supply to New South Wales to support the demand. The PV power potential is relatively less in these regions. Power density will play a role in the populated regions, especially in New South Wales and Queensland. In such regions, if the capacity factor of solar or wind energy is relatively higher, the implementation of solar or wind farms can be considered. Otherwise, the power from hydropower and bioenergy can play a part since eastern coastal regions are mostly concentrated with hydropower and bioenergy resources. There is a huge opportunity to convert the buildings into energy-efficient infrastructure in the populated regions and implementing rooftop solar PV, especially in commercial buildings would increase the PV penetration as well as it will highly suppress the need for fossil fuel-based energy expansion. The social acceptance of rooftop PV is well entrenched within Australia, but the network workers and grid sector need to train to integrate distributed generation systems. In such a case, a well-defined framework for grid operators and transmission line controllers is to be established to regulate and stabilize the dynamic bidirectional power flow. Specific research on expanding the bi-directional grid between Western Australia to Southern Australia is required to analyse the net economic benefits. If the national grid lines are expanded to interconnect Western and Southern Australia, the peak demand variation corresponding to various time zones occurring between the Eastern and Western regions can be tackled in new aspects with power supply from the Western region and the subsequent curtailment in the Western region can be reduced. The major problem hindering the grid integration with Western Australia is the requirement of huge investment and a high rate of interest. The estimated renewable energy generation and the capacity increase were higher for wind and solar energy, respectively. This increase in the upcoming years would lay a strong foundation for Australia to progress towards energy sustainability. When considering the volatility in energy markets under increased solar energy penetration, the findings of the research study indicate that Australian markets might experience crucial volatility under rich solar penetration [121] . Therefore, a coordinated approach to dilute the volatility is required and the energy storage systems can stabilize the market under such scenarios to a certain extent. The need for massive energy storage will rise and this can be satisfied by implementing pumped hydropower storage technologies and battery energy storage systems. Most of the suitable location for pumped water storage is spread along Eastern Australia and are concentrated in the Eastern coastal regions of Victoria and the South-Eastern regions of New South Wales. Solar PV farms and wind energy farms can be integrated with pumped hydropower storage to reduce the need for an additional new generating unit in peak demand as well as to mitigate the curtailment. Further, hydrogen energy technologies received greater attention from Australian policymakers, and it is expected to make significant investments as well as progress in hydrogen production. Several power-to-X technologies will get proper tempo to showcase their potential when solar and wind energy contributions are higher [122] . This will enhance the stability and open numerous opportunities to substantially turn the industries to manufacture products by consuming clean energy. In the industrial sector, fossil fuel usage can be reduced only if hydrogen production technologies, bioenergy utilization and highly efficient waste-to-energy technologies are prioritized [123] . The clean energy scenario in transportation can be substantiated with the aid of standalone renewables dedicated to hydrogen production and storage [124,125] . On the other hand, attention to other aspects such as managing the solar energy systems waste should be provided. Since there are several technical, economic, and social causes for the removal of solar systems, a coordinated mechanism to manage the waste related to solar systems should be ensured [126] . Energy efficiency is an active area that can be pursued to diminish the stress on expanding the energy capacity in Australia which is hampered by infrastructural and institutional obduracies [127] . Regarding the cost criteria, the LCOE approach will face uncertainties when distributed power generation through solar rooftop PV exists to a large extent. In such a case, a newly refined taxation approach is required and sophisticated grid control technologies are to be implemented. Incentives to total installation cost or at the least, zero-interest loans for rooftop solar PV installation and battery systems would be highly beneficial. On the other hand, the employment opportunities created by solar energy technologies are immense when compared to the rest of the renewable energy technologies. This will coherently contribute to other sustainable indicators such as in SDG 9 and SDG 8. If Australia depends more on solar and wind energy contributions, then the energy emissions will substantially reduce as their life cycle emission is also very low. This not only pivots energy sustainability but also aids in meeting the Paris Agreement as well as SDG 13.  7 Policy implications A significant problem that hampers the renewable energy penetration in Australia is the distribution of population and grid support. To depend on renewable energy throughout the day, a combination of solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy and storage systems such as battery and pumped hydro energy storage systems should work coherently and flexibly. Since various renewable energy potential is high in different geographical locations of Australia, the challenge arises on how the resources can be tapped in the near future. This challenge is also highly intertwined with economic parameters such as capital investment, LCOE and interest rates. On the other hand, the rooftop solar PV if expanded to a large extent (more likely in Australia), grid infrastructure, control systems, and monitoring systems have a pivotal mantle and again the investments should be focused on these wanting technologies. Therefore, two vantage points can be derived: One is emphasized by a seamlessly connected highly flexible grid system that integrates the potential renewable resources from Western Australia, and Southern Australia to Eastern and North-Eastern Australia. When analysing the limitations, this scenario can be presumptuously achieved only with the aid of humongous investment. The consequences of implementing such systems with exhaustive investment may result in increased LCOE and a rise in user electrical prices. However, the entrenched facility can support and revolutionize the renewable energy dependence of Australia. Since the renewable energy potential is enormous, the integrated system can easily tackle the growing energy demand. Further, the future roadmap to renewable hydrogen energy and renewable energy-based electric charging systems can be well-established. This perspective also supports the vision of 100 % renewable energy in Australia [128] . Policy support to increase the flow of public investment and low rates of interest can support the transition. The second perspective can be visualized as a decentralized approach where the solar rooftop dominates other renewables, especially in Eastern Australia. In this scenario, the users also tend to act as an energy supplier and thus, the payment to the customer necessitates a modified framework to monitor the bidirectional energy flow to substantiate procedural and distributive justice in the net energy payment. Feed-in Tariff incentive policy mechanisms need to be framed with a sophisticated proper methodology at the regional and national levels [129] . The policy can be framed in a way to accelerate the transition to rooftop PV by offering incentives for installation costs, discounts on electricity tax and battery systems. Moreover, a study suggests that a large amount of energy is squandered due to the poor efficiency of the inverter and improving them will reduce energy intensity [130] . Policies to support the renting mechanism of the terrace of buildings in populated areas with the acquiescence of interested people for implementing solar PV panels appear promising and can be maintained by grid people. Such policies can aid in hastening solar rooftop projects, especially in households where installation costs appear beyond affordable, and it will also create employment opportunities requiring fewer skills. Besides, this scenario does not guarantee renewable energy usage all day around without centralized energy storage systems or at the least a community-level energy storage system. Without this, the curtailment will prevail. The political and policy approaches in Western Australia already favour decentralized energy generation systems and it needs to work more on management strategies [131] . Further, the emphasis on wind energy utilization will be limited and the fossil fuel role will exist to support the demand. Both scenarios call for research to analyse the optimum scenario that has fewer economic and environmental constraints. The policy aspects can be further extended to industries and companies to revamp their energy consumption with considerable renewable penetration via solar and wind energy technologies. On the other hand, the investors shall change their approach to invest in green technologies to promote environmentalism [132] . Green projects can be provided with special attention and hastened evaluation needs to be considered. Further, power-to-x technologies especially related to hydrogen production need rapid development. With the aid of diffusion models, the interaction between coal, gas and renewables has been mapped and the findings indicate that despite the limited market share of renewables, it influences the fossil fuel market [133] . The defensive policies can keep business as usual and the transition via a decentralized electricity system needs more focused policies. Moreover, the climate policies and energy policies are not aligned in Australia to form coherent modernization measures to envision a low-carbon future, and this led to disjointed outcomes hindering the sustainable energy transition [134] . Less fragmented policies and a unified vision among various judiciaries of Australia are fundamental for transitioning to a sustainable energy sector. Integration of energy-climate policy, decentralizing the power to intermediaries and local as well as urban governance, and attractive incentives on energy storage systems can leverage the penetration of renewable energy systems [135,136] . Tax incentives to the fossil fuel extractive sector should be lowered and it is identified as best practice to limit fossil fuel growth gradually [137] . On the other hand, the policies should be evaluated for their effectiveness and equity issues based on the Australian people’s priority and research methods to evaluate the same is welcomed [138] .  8 Conclusions The proposed research study aims to foster the accomplishment of SDG 7 in Australia by extensively studying the characteristics of clean energy technologies. A hybrid quantitative–qualitative methodology is used to direct the current energy landscape in Australia to achieve its SDG 7 vision. The quantitative approach is used to assess the potentiality of clean energy technologies while strategies and policies are framed with a qualitative approach based on literature review. A total of 6 criteria and 16 sub-criteria are designed to portray the characteristics of SDG 7, wherein sophisticated methods to quantify the sub-criteria are also developed. Two weightage methods based on subjective and objective approaches, i.e., Fuzzy AHP and entropy method are utilized. Seven MCDA models such as VIKOR, MOORA, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE-II, WSM, WPM, and WASPAS are employed to obtain robust and reliable results. The following conclusions can be drawn from this research study:• Levelized cost of energy and estimated capacity growth are considered as highly influencing evaluation criteria according to the Fuzzy AHP weightage method.  • Energy resource potential and climate action effectiveness are rendered to be significant factors corresponding to the entropy method.  • Solar energy ranks first across seven MCDA models and other alternatives witness a variation in results in methods such as VIKOR and TOPSIS.  • Consolidating the results of all seven MCDA methods yields the energy sustainability performance score for solar energy, wind energy, hydropower and bioenergy technologies as 39.7 %, 29.8 %, 20.6 %, and 9.9 %, respectively.  • Sensitivity analysis is performed with 4 normalization methods and 8 weightage scenarios out of which 6 weightage scenarios covers the variations in FAHP methods and 2 weightage scenarios represents best-worst method and entropy method of weightage determination. In all the 32 cases, solar energy ranks the first in cumulative energy sustainability performance. Therefore, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed framework.  • Spearman’s weighted rank correlation coefficient has been used to identify the rank similarities between the rank generated by each scenario in sensitivity analyses and the original ranks. It can be identified that the min–max normalization has the most influence followed by best-worst weightage determination method.  • Rank reversal test has been performed by eliminating one alternative (three alternatives analysis) and two alternatives (two alternatives analysis) to check whether the ranking hierarchy varies from the original ranking hierarchy. It is observed that the ranking hierarchy does not change and thus, rank reversal does not exist.  • Several factors such as energy resource potential, power density, installation cost, policy support, job creation, social acceptance, and eco-friendliness underpin the potential of solar energy to enable energy sustainability in Australia. Therefore, solar energy can be claimed as the game-changer in facilitating energy transition in Australia.  • To tap the potential of solar energy, the authors suggest that the strategies should be accounted for complementing resource availability, population density, and grid integration to bolster the development pace towards SDG 7.  • With current social acceptance and economic conditions, solar rooftop PV penetration could revitalize the energy sustainability approach. Incentives are vital in the case of solar PV systems. Despite the role of solar energy technology, other renewable energy technologies such as wind, hydropower and bioenergy technologies need to play their part to obtain a coordinated objective, i.e., to decimate the fossil fuel contribution progressively.  • On integrating all clean energy resources, the authors envision a branching situation where one scenario can achieve energy sustainability by integrating the clean energy potential from Western to Eastern Australia. Contrastingly, the other scenario marks the solar rooftop PV as the pith of transformation that visions energy sustainability.  • In both scenarios, grid integration should be given prime importance to integrate decentralized energy generation systems. The policy perspectives are established to support the scenarios and to direct the Australian landscape towards SDG 7.    The limitation of this study can be pinpointed to factors such as social acceptance, LCOE and other factors that can vary with time. The prime takeaway of this study would rely on designing the evaluation criteria that help us to understand the lagging and strengthened areas in which more attention and development are required to corroborate the achievement of energy sustainability. Further, the analysis carried out in this study can be extended to any other country and a suitable approach to achieve SDG 7 can be brought into the light.

The decision criteria are required to assess against the best and worst criteria to obtain a score in Saaty’s scale.  2. The criteria scores with respect to best criteria will be the row corresponding to the best criteria in the decision matrix of FAHP used in this study before fuzzification.  3. Similarly, the criteria scores with respect to worst criteria will be the column corresponding to the worst criteria in the decision matrix of FAHP used in this study before fuzzification.  4. The optimal weights are calculated by solving linear programming equations as shown below    w B  - a Bj   w j    ≤ ξ  L    , for all j. w j  - a jW   w W    ≤ ξ  L    , for all j∑ j  w j  = 1     w j  ≥ 0   , for all j where w B     is the optimal weight of best criteria, a Bj      is the criteria scores with respect to best criteria, w W     is the optimal weight of worst criteria, a jW      is the criteria scores with respect to worst criteria, w j     is the optimal weight of criteria, and ξ  L     is the optimal objective value.5. The final score, v i     is obtained by using the optimal weights of the criteria (w j  )     and normalized scores of the alternatives, x ij  norm        v i  = ∑ j = 1  n  w j  x ij  norm       x ij  norm   = x ij   max i  x ij     , f o r  b e n e f i t  c r i t e r i a    1 - x ij   max i  x ij     , f o r  c o s t  c r i t e r i a                  References [1] R.
