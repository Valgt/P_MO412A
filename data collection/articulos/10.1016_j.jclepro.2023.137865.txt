                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were introduced to the world in 2015 to provide a roadmap for development in domains, such as poverty reduction, health, education, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and climate action. Among the domains that must be worked on to reach the SDGs, waste management in the present day Built Environment (BE) is a domain that has been found to be significantly involved in achieving the SDGs and ensuring a sustainable future. Addressing the significance of this observation, the review aims to provide an overview of the current environmental and social factors related to waste management in the BE, identifies how waste management is important in achieving each SDG, and discusses key challenges and opportunities regarding the waste sector along with innovative approaches to waste management. Furthermore, the review presents cooperative game theory as a tool for providing models for the better identification of gaps in the compliance of waste laws and potential predictions of the future behaviour of the generators and handlers of waste to make better policies regarding waste management in the BE by considering SDGs as a guiding tool.

Among the domains that must be worked on to reach the SDGs, waste management in the present day Built Environment (BE) is a domain that has been found to be significantly involved in achieving the SDGs and ensuring a sustainable future. Addressing the significance of this observation, the review aims to provide an overview of the current environmental and social factors related to waste management in the BE, identifies how waste management is important in achieving each SDG, and discusses key challenges and opportunities regarding the waste sector along with innovative approaches to waste management. Furthermore, the review presents cooperative game theory as a tool for providing models for the better identification of gaps in the compliance of waste laws and potential predictions of the future behaviour of the generators and handlers of waste to make better policies regarding waste management in the BE by considering SDGs as a guiding tool.

Presently, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) form the core of the agenda. Sustainable development is a term used to describe the concept of fulfilling the requirements of the present generation without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their own requirements (United Nations, 2023 ). It involves the incorporation of social, economic, and environmental considerations in decision-making processes to ensure that developments around the world do not result in severe damage to the environment in the long-run. It is important that all development be sustainable because it seeks to maintain equilibrium between economic growth and the conservation of natural resources while protecting different ecosystems. It also aims to promote social equity and improve the quality and subsequently, the value of life for all people (United Nations, 2023 ). Achieving sustainable development requires collaboration and coordination across different sectors and stakeholders, as well as a commitment to responsible and ethical decision-making. The SDGs are considered a critical call for action by all developed and developing countries that are presently working with each other as partners. These goals recognize that pressing world issues such as ending poverty and hunger (SDGs 1 and 2 respectively) along with other deprivations of the citizens of each country, must go hand in hand with policies that improve health (SDG 3) and literacy (SDG 4), promote gender equality (SDG 5), sanitation (SDG 6), and clean energy (SDG 7), spur economic growth (SDG 8), promote sustainable infrastructure (SDG 9 and 11), reduce inequality (SDG 10) along with responsible consumption (SDG 12) – all the while dealing with critical issues like climate change (SDG 13), working to preserve the oceans (SDG 14) and forests (SDG 15), and promoting peace and partnerships among nations (SDG 16 and 17). Under each SDG are present Targets and Indicators. The Targets detail the goals and the Indicators present to us the metrics by which the world aims to trackwhether these Targets are being achieved (United Nations, 2023 ). In relation to developments in the modern society, the environment today is faced with several crises, some significant ones among them being the loss of biodiversity, deforestation and land degradation due to the carrying out developmental projects in the Built Environment (BE) (which consists of built-up areas where people could live, engage, and work) along with the pollution that results from the improper management of resources and wastes generated while carrying out these projects. Among the major crises faced, the amount of threat posed by the mismanagement of waste in the BE may be one of the most prominent ones (DISD, 2022 ). It is thus important that the weaknesses in societies around the world that are leading to the present environmental crises related to what ultimately becomes waste be identified, whether that be with respect to the beginning of the life of waste when it is being made into a useful product or the handling of the end stage. Different concepts that have been introduced around the world by governments and international organizations have been found to play a major part in the discussions revolving around development in the BE. Some of the concepts and guidelines that aim to bring development in the BE today and in the future through multilateralism and cooperation include the UN SDGs (Colglazier, 2015 ; United Nations, 2015 ), the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) (Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2008 ), the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (US Department of State, 2021c ), the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction Deal (UNEP, 2023 ), the World Green Building Council's Advancing Net Zero program (World Green Building Council, 2023a ), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Chazournes, 1996 ), the International Energy Agency's Energy Efficiency in Buildings program (International Energy Agency, 2011 , 2020 ), the World Green Building Council's Better Places for People campaign (World Green Building Council, 2023b ), the Building Efficiency Accelerator (WRI-Building Efficiency Accelerator, 2021 ), and the New Urban Agenda (UN-Habitat, 2022 ). It takes a tremendous amount of resources, labour and planning to construct BEs around the world. The different facets of the BE must be addressed when discussing waste management in the purview of sustainable development. Something that is presently lacking in the sector of waste management is the presence of proper guidelines through which all the different aspects related to the proper functioning of the sector can be addressed and which can provide a roadmap for future policies related to each aspect. This holistic addressing of all the intricate interactions, cooperative networks and other aspects related to waste management practices is also something that has been found to be lacking in most waste policies of the BE. This is where the SDGs have been found to be potentially of great use. Each of the SDGs can be linked to waste management (Fig. 1  ) - a fact that plays an important role in determining the future of the quality of life in BEs- is something that has been highlighted in the paper. Sustainable management of waste such as municipal solid waste (MSW), E-waste, hazardous waste, construction & demolition (C & D) waste, and biomedical waste can have a significant impact on achieving global SDGs for 2030 (Rautela et al., 2021 ). Since waste management is a topic of concern because of the serious implications, improper management of the same has for public health (Nzediegwu and Chang, 2020 ; Yang et al., 2018 ), environmental sustainability (Ayilara et al., 2020 ), resource conservation (Kareem et al., 2015 ; Kovacs and Klucsik, 1976 ), and climate change (Chinasho, 2015 ; Sharma et al., 2018 ), among various other factors, there is a need today for progressive policies, proper implementation and regular amendments to said policies in order to properly maintain the waste generated by this generation where there is an increasing prevalence of consumerism. In order to create progressive policies of tomorrow with regards to waste management in the BE, it is important that policymakers view waste along with the social and environmental aspects associated with it, as a domain that is vital in reaching the SDGs. However, there presently remains a significant gap in the literature with respect to the study of how numerous factors associated with waste management practices in the BE can affect and contribute towards the successful attainment of each of the 17 SDGs. The present review has aimed at addressing the gap by showing how policies addressing global issues, when viewed through an SDG lens, can be better perceived as contributors toward a sustainable future. The review has further aimed at showing how each SDG can be directly or indirectly affected by waste management practices in the BE, which is expected to further highlight the significance of bringing forth more development in the sector of waste management on local and national scales to progress towards a more sustainable future globally.  2 The SDG lens Almost every recently introduced international policy and law regarding development and its associated domains has been found to discuss aspects that each coincide with quite a few SDGs. This observation has been found through the literature review of UN yearly reports published by the Department of Inclusive Social Development (DISD) after 2015. It brings to us the notion that each law and policy that is being introduced in the recent years is viewing the prospects related to the development of the BE while maintaining the goal of being conducive to the attainment of the SDGs. An example to demonstrate how policies can be viewed through an “SDG lens” will explain this better. If the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) are observed along with the domains it encompasses, the coinciding of the same with quite a few SDGs can be observed. The SDOHs are basically conditions in the environment where people are born and where they age that affect an extensive list of issues related to health, quality-of-life outcomes, functioning, and risks (Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2008 ). They can be grouped into 5 domains (Fig. 2  ): economic stability (which coincides with SDG 8), education access and quality (which coincides with SDGs 4 and 10), health care access and quality (which coincides with SDG 3), neighbourhood and BE (which coincides with SDGs 9 and 11), along with SDOH in the social and community context (which coincides with SDGs 16 and 17). The significance of pointing out this correlation is that after finding correlations between the several policies in the BE and SDGs, one can further aim to specifically study a particular aspect of the BE. In this paper, that aspect has been chosen to be waste management.  3 Sustainable development goals and the built environment Encompassing the places where individuals work and reside in, alongside influencing the way they commute from one place to another each day, the BE has a huge part in the everyday lives of individuals residing in the same environment in several ways. The quality of life of a nation's residents in the years to come is decided for the greater part by the environmental, economical, and social development in every sector of a country and the degree of the same thereof (Cusack, 2019 ). The BE is a domain that must approach development by taking into consideration all of the aforementioned parameters. With respect to the BE, it is important that each of the three areas of development mentioned, i.e., the three pillars of sustainable development, are given equal importance during planning and implementation of the different stages of infrastructure development plans. The BE plays a crucial role in influencing practices related to waste management because it influences the generation, transport, collection, and disposal of waste (Ezugwu et al., 2019 ). The introduction of the SDGs is especially significant with regards to the BE because the approach of different nations towards a more sustainable and energy efficient future can now be compared on a global basis. The best practices adopted by a nation, whether developed or developing, or individual organizations, with regards to incorporating sustainability into their plans of infrastructure development, can be taken as standards of sustainability incorporation by other nations or organizations. In the following sections, the review discusses the significance of SDGs in the BE with special reference to the sector of waste management.  4 Waste management in the built environment Waste can be viewed as both an environmental problem and a resource. The patterns of production and consumption in the BE today lead to the generation of waste in large quantities. If improvements are not made in the waste sector then, apart from solid waste itself, emissions related to solid waste have been projected to increase to 2.38 billion tonnes of CO2 -equivalent per year by the year 2050 (Kaza et al., 2018 ). Conscious changes in the management of waste and reduction of the amount of waste generated thus become priorities if the present generation wants to proceed towards a sustainable future. There are varied waste articles that circulate in society today, many of which are energy-intensive to produce and contain substances that are present in restricted quantities in nature like gold, neodymium, and indium that are found in a variety of electronic devices in small quantities (Thiébaud et al., 2018 ; Dutta et al., 2022 ). It is therefore the need of the moment that joint resources are managed with a long-term goal of achieving sustainable practices in society. The study of all the stages of the life cycle of a commercial process, product, or service in the BE (as represented in Fig. 3  ) is essential for understanding the patterns of waste production for that process, product or service and taking active steps towards the adoption of sustainable practices related to the generated waste for the same. Innovative approaches such as the Eco-Cycle strategy in Sweden - linked to the country's environmental objectives - have the potential to play an active part in bringing forth sustainable development in the waste management sector (UNCSD Secretariat, 2010 ). The most efficient ways of obtaining sustainable life cycles of products in the BE includebetter preventative measures towards the generation of waste and ensuring that a greater share of the generated waste can be recycled and reused (David et al., 2019 ; Zanni et al., 2019 ). These ways have the potential to save both materials and energy, alongside reducing environmental problems and the utilization of hazardous chemicals in waste management.  5 Waste management in the built environment with reference to the sustainable development goals The aim of discussing waste management in conjunction with the SDGs is to present the fact that waste management will be playing a major role in attaining the goal of creation of a sustainable BE in the coming years. When highlighting the importance of SDGs in discussions pertaining to waste management, it is found that when the latter is viewed through the SDG lens (as demonstrated earlier), a very holistic outlook of waste management is obtained. This is due to the fact that a multi-faceted view of waste management in the BE, and the attributes related to it (such as economic condition of workers alongside important environmental aspects), is perceived when seeing the same through the lens of each SDG (Casier, 2015 ). The following sections provide a representation of how SDGs can be used as guidelines in the present-day BEs around the world while dealing with waste management (Fig. 4  ). 5.1 SDG 1: waste and waste workers The targets under SDG 1 are related to the access of every human being to basic services, to building their resilience, and to reducing the susceptibility of citizens to extreme climate-related events (along with any other economic, social, and environmental events that may be considered extreme) (United Nations, 2015-a ).A well-operating waste management system contributes towards the attainment of SDG 1 by reducing poverty and improving the quality of life for individuals and their communities. To move forward towards attaining SDG 1, it is especially important that policy makers and government officials who are responsible for framing policies and laws regarding waste management make it a priority to improve the livelihoods and working conditions of the waste workers (ILO, 2012 ). Waste workers play a significant role in the coproduction of many of the city's services and thus, they play a vital part in addressing several SDGs, SDG 1 being one of the most significant among them and addressing their needs leads to a more efficient waste management system. According to International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates, there are approximately 15–20 million informal waste workers around the world, most of who have often been found to be living below the poverty line with low incomes (Gutberlet, J., 2019 ). A significant percentage of waste pickers around the world have been found to work under unhealthy and unsafe conditions (Binion and Gutberlet, 2012 ; Gutberlet and Uddin, 2018 ; Gutberlet, 2021 ; Omotoso, 2017 ) and suffer from the stigma that comes with informal work alongside facing a lack of recognition for the services that they provide. It is a very concerning fact that the earnings of these workers fluctuate, depending on the intermediaries who determine the prices along with global price variations (Ezeah et al., 2013 ; Wilson et al., 2012 ). Waste workers have also often been found to live in close proximity to waste disposal sites and are subjected to unhygienic conditions that they cannot themselves improve due to economic constraints (Singh et al., 2023 ).What is often lacking in the development plans of the BE are holistic policies that take into account both waste management and the workers responsible for the same. Sufficient investments in the BE, which allow for more job generation in the waste sector and contribution towards the economic growth, are also found to be lacking in several parts of the world due to high risks in the political and financial sectors, weak governance, and limited capacity of people to avail the sanitation services through monetary means (Thacker et al., 2019 ). The development of a sustainable BE requires investing in waste management infrastructure, which includes recycling facilities, and renewable energy systems. The development initiatives demand skilled labour and this demand creates employment opportunities in the sectors of waste collection and sorting, construction, recycling, maintenance, and operation of waste treatment facilities. The development initiatives and the subsequent demands it generates thus lead to job creation in the waste sector, which can help alleviate poverty by providing stable employment and generate income for communities. Stimulating investment (Ngoc and Schnitzer, 2009 ) and fostering of innovation and entrepreneurship in the waste sector are also promoted as a result of this development (Nidumolu et al., 2009 ). It is the duty of municipal corporations and governments as a whole to incorporate residential areas for them in town plans of developing areas and to make new plans regarding them in developed areas. The improvement in the living and working conditions of waste workers and ensuring that no human rights of any worker is infringed upon must be a priority when discussing the sustainable development of any BE. Also, it ensures the efficient functioning of different residential and corporate entities in that environment, alongside maintaining the hygiene of the city/town/village as a whole, thus ensuring that a nation progresses towards the attainment of SDG 1.  5.2 SDG 2: waste, food security and sustainable agriculture The targets under SDG 2 indicate the importance of rethinking how individuals grow, distribute and eat food (United Nations, 2015-b ). Reducing food waste is a key approach for resource conservation - a sign that market incentives are insufficient. Discussions pertaining to food wastes address concerns of intergenerational and intragenerational equity and also align with the broader objective of sustainable development (Ethridge, 1973 ; Some et al., 2022 ). To achieve the goal of food security, optimizing the usage of raw foods (which includes parts that are prevalently considered as “waste”), processed foods, and all other types of substances that different societies consider to be “food” is essential (Nicastro and Carillo, 2021 ). This ensures that there is less wastage of food and that policies are framed encouraging the food manufacturing industries as well as common citizens to take a step towards the sustainable usage of food materials. Waste can be found to achieve food security in a number of ways alongside also having the potential to be used as fuel to generate energy, which can be used as a power source for food production processes such as irrigation, processing, and packaging (Otles et al., 2015 ). This can reduce the cost of energy for farmers and food producers, making it easier for them to produce and distribute food. Waste can also be used to produce biochar, a type of charcoal that is often used in agriculture to improve soil fertility and structure (Abrol and Sharma, 2019 ). Biochar can be used as a measure for amendment of soil to increase crop yields and improve the nutritional content of crops which can boost food production and contribute towards ensuring food security. One of the other ways in which waste can be utilized and can be used to make an effective contribution towards ensuring food security is if it is converted into organic fertilizers, which can be used to improve soil fertility and increase crop yields (Allohverdi et al., 2021 ). It also reduces the usage of chemical fertilizers, which can be harmful and expensive to the environment. Edible/food waste can also be converted into animal feed, which can be used to feed livestock that reduce the cost of commercially available animal feed, making it easier for farmers to raise animals and produce agricultural products (Dou et al., 2017 ). Ensuring food security also requires the wise use of materials that come under the category of agricultural products, including the products that are of use and those that are traditionally not included in the purview of “useable agricultural products” (e.g., different types of uses of corn husks) - a concept that coincides with the definition of sustainable agriculture (Farooq et al., 2019 ). Sustainable agriculture requires a precise balance in order to increase crop output, maintain economic stability, encourage the conservation of finite natural resources, and minimize the damaging environmental consequences of agricultural activities. So, there is a need to encourage the usage of renewable energy systems for sustainable agriculture (Kodirov et al., 2020 ). Modern agricultural practices can encourage innovation in agriculture by promoting the adoption of new technologies and practices that can improve agricultural productivity and cause a cutback in the environmental impact of agriculture alongside addressing the major issue of agricultural and food waste. Modern agricultural practices in the BE include the practice of building smart farms and helping ensure the creation of more efficient, productive, and profitable farming enterprises (Balducci et al., 2018 ). An important aspect of ensuring food security is also the proper management of food waste. It has been found that if wasted food around the world could be adequately managed, it could aid the reduction of the hunger crisis (World Bank Group, 2023 ). Reducing food waste plays a vital role in ensuring sustainability in the sector of food in an age where the global population is steadily increasing and innovation in this area is being attempted through improvements in handling processes and technological advancements. Several technologically advanced practices that can be employed to address the issue of food waste. For example, as suggested by Ma and Liu (2019) , instead of dumping food in landfills, an innovative integrated biological approach can be used to transform the same into energy or gasoline. Using radical approaches, food waste can also be recycled to create fertilizers and other agricultural products (Bennbaia et al., 2018 ; Owamah et al., 2014 ). Converting food waste into hair care and beauty products is also being presently researched (Martin-Rios et al., 2018 ), and has been predicted to be a game-changer in food waste management industry since it will see the generation of a whole new chain for a circular economy. Therefore, food waste reduction along with food management and innovation are critical to analyzing opportunities and challenges related to food security (Otles et al., 2015 ) in the BE.  5.3 SDG 3: Waste and health Good health and well-being are essential to ensuring sustainable development. Under SDG 3, Target 3.8 is found to specifically focus on the access of citizens to essential healthcare services of acceptable quality (United Nations, 2015-c ). In order to ensure this access and that there is efficiency in getting said access, the development of health centres and hospitals in urban and rural areas and their proper maintenance is significant. Health, in the case of a BE, in any developing or developed society is of significance to the growth and prosperity of that society. The provisions with regards to health in the BE can be directly correlated to the quality of life in that environment and consequently, the amount of development. Without a healthy population, irrespective of age, and without the provision of basic health services to the population, there cannot be any significant quantifiable progress in a society. Proper management of waste is also essential for maintaining the health and safety of communities, especially those living in close proximity to waste disposal sites in the BE (Hofmann, 2013 ).  During urban planning, transportation routes for waste must be considered an important part because they directly affect the city's premises. Waste transport routes can be optimized to make solid waste collection as efficient as possible through a process known as “route optimization”, where miles driven to complete a route of waste collection addresses are cut down upon. This is significant in reducing carbon emissions as well as reducing costs for businesses (Apaydin and Gonullu, 2013 ; Ogwueleke, 2010 ; Tobin, 2022 ). SDG 3's target 3.9, which aims to significantly reduce the number of deaths and diseases caused by hazardous chemicals and pollution and contamination in air, water, and soil by 2030, may be stated to be indirectly impacted by better transportation, energy, water, and waste services(United Nations, 2015-c ). Services related to sanitation in the BE through the availability of clean water and sound waste management systems can aid in preventing the transmission of diseases, which is especially significant with respect to the tropical diseases that are on the WHO's list of diseases that need to be eliminated. Also, these services significantly lower the incidence of new-born, maternal, and child death by limiting the transmission of water-borne infections (Fink et al, 2011 ). The proper treatment for sewage is essential to attaining good health and well-being under the SDG 3. However, most sewage treatment processes rely on an electricity supply that is constant and reliable - a luxury that a lot of developing countries cannot afford (UNEP, 2019a ). Utilization of local natural resources and multi-sectoral partnerships for development of infrastructure ultimately becomes necessary to treat waste and is essential to ensure the attainment of SDG 3 in the long run.  5.4 SDG 4: waste and quality education The correlation between development in the education sector, waste management, and the BE is complex and multi-faceted. SDG 4 puts forth the goal of achieving equitable and inclusive education alongside ensuring the availability of a lifetime of opportunities for all. Quality education is one of the major requirements for the holistic development of any society. In terms of development in the education sector, a strong emphasis on sustainability and environmental awareness can lead a society towards improved waste management practices. When individuals are educated about the effects of improper management of waste on the environment, they are more likely to implement good waste segregation and disposal practices in their own lives (Kumar & Kumar, 2020 ). These actions can have a constructive impact on the BE by reducing the amount of waste in landfills and reducing the harmful effect of waste on local ecosystems. For the development of the BE, it is essential that the next generation be educated (Cortese, 2003 ). There must also be a concern for developing the education infrastructure in countries so as to provide students of all ages the opportunity to enhance their skills that would later benefit them in a professional environment (as referenced in target 4.A, which mentions the construction and upgrading of learning facilities) (Žalėnienė and Pereira, 2021 ). Effective waste management practices can foster community engagement by involving students, teachers, and other stakeholders in the process—something that plays a crucial role in the success of waste management practices (Kalra, 2020 ). This can help create a sense of ownership and responsibility for the environment, which can lead to long-term behaviour change. It has also been observed that wherever access to proper sanitation facilities is not available in the BE, such as in rural communities, transportation networks are key to the provision of services related to public health (Johnson et al., 2011 ; United Nations, 2015-d ). There are presently robust recycling programmes along with workshops implemented in several schools and colleges, to teach students about waste and it's sorting into several categories, such as paper, plastic, glass, and organic waste in a hands-on manner. These programmes teach the necessity of recycling and how it reduces the quantity of waste in the BE has been demonstrated to everyone. Through these programs, students have been found to acquire a sense of responsibility towards environmental (Desa et al., 2012 ; Williams, 2011 ).  5.5 SDG 5: waste and gender SDG 5 explains how equality among the sexes is fundamental to the attainment of a peaceful and sustainable world. Among the targets set by SDG 5, Target 5.4 points out the need for the provision of infrastructure and public services for the social protection of domestic work and care work (that is mostly unpaid) (United Nations, 2015-e ). Gender can play a major role in waste management practices. Studies have shown that traditional gender roles and cultural norms can influence waste management behaviour, with women often being more involved in household waste management than men (Buckingham et al., 2005 ). The gendered division of labour in certain communities can result in women having more responsibility for waste management and disposal (Chalin et al., 2003 ). By considering the home as an indivisible entity, as is the case in many municipal plans, it has been seen that women and men who reside there have distinct levels of authority and access to resources (Khabeer, 1994 ; Scheinberg et al., 1999 ). Rag picking is a popular activity for poor women and children in India and other developing countries. Women who work as waste pickers are frequently reported to have chronic malnutrition and considerably increased buccal cell abnormalities; these conditions have been linked to their regular exposure to hazardous wastes in dumpsite locations (Fulwani et al., 2020 ).Long-term exposure to these pollutants may result in harmful effects on health, such as increased oxidative damage and genotoxicity (Fulwani et al., 2020 ). Women and men (alongside children) have been found to have differing knowledge base of waste disposal sites in their neighbourhoods. Literature also draws attention to the possibility that people's perceptions of the many wastes that can be found in a region may differ. For instance, a separate-sex waste collection mapping exercise on Szentendre Island in Hungary revealed that the maps created by the female group revealed more sites for disposing of household wastes, while the male group's maps revealed more sites with scrap metal from abandoned cars, tyres, and farm equipment, as well as more sites with building and construction wastes. Also, several of the places that the men's group had mapped were not depicted in the drawings made by the women's group (Scheinberg et al., 1999 ). This often leads to waste management systems that are less efficient than what they potentially could have been if there had been equal knowledge sharing among the genders. The waste industry is gradually adapting to promote gender equality through various initiatives and actions. The issue of women's uncompensated work in the domain of waste management is being recognized by several countries around the world. Many waste management companies are actively working to recruit and hire more women in various roles, including management positions, technical positions, and frontline jobs. This is being done through targeted recruitment campaigns, partnerships with organizations promoting gender diversity, and inclusive hiring practices (Rosengren, 2020 ). Training and skill development programs are being implemented to bridge any skills gaps and provide women with equal opportunities for advancement. These programs are meant to focus on technical and leadership skills, along with managerial training to equip women with the knowledge and capabilities necessary for career progression in the waste industry. An example of this can be seen in case of Garbage Recycling and Segregation Programme, which is an effort by the adult education department of SNDT Women's University ( part of the Pune Municipal Corporation, India), has put considerable effort to help women waste pickers who collect segregated waste from households and commercial establishment (Scheinberg et al., 1999 ).Initiatives are being undertaken to raise awareness and educate both the industry and the general public about the importance of gender equality in waste management.  5.6 SDG 6: waste and wastewater treatment SDG 6 focuses on the availability of water, access to water, and sustainable water management (United Nations, 2015-f ). There is a strong correlation between the sustainable management of water and sanitation services and their accessibility, which can in turn be linked to waste management. Adequate water and sanitation facilities in the BE are essential for public health, and their availability and maintenance are critical for reducing the spread of waterborne diseases (Ersel, 2015 ). Proper waste management helps to prevent contamination of water sources, reduces the risk of disease transmission, and improves overall environmental health. Conversely, poor waste management practices can contaminate water sources, causing health problems and reducing access to clean water (Vakula and Kolli, 2017 ). This can lead to the spread of diseases and increase the burden on already limited sanitation facilities. Effective waste management in the BE is also crucial for conserving water resources, as it helps to reduce the amount of waste that is disposed of in bodies of water and reduces the need for traditional water treatment processes to remove pollutants (Joensuu et al., 2020 ). Long-term fulfilment of SDG 6 (as well as SDG 3) depends on adequate sewage treatment (UNEP, 2019a ). Water infrastructure plays a significant role in achieving this goal and has been found to be one of the strongest direct influences on all SDG objectives since it comprises wastewater and sanitation services, infrastructure systems to prevent floods, as well as water supply (Thacker et al., 2019 ). Sanitation and waste management have to care for maintaining and improving the fertile topsoil. There have also been instances of starvation due to inappropriate or missing sanitation in difficult climates which can even turn the land population into refugees. Sanitation being one of the major concerns in the domain of waste management in the BE, technological advances in the sector of sanitation is crucial. One of the instances of technological advances in the sector of sanitation is the study conducted by Badri Narayan et al. (2019)  where they designed a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to treat the wastewater or leachate produced from landfills in the Czech Republic. The purpose of their research was to develop an effective and sustainable solution for managing the leachate, which is a complex and pollutant-rich liquid that can pose significant environmental risks if not properly treated.  5.7 SDG 7: waste and energy Modern green energy generation from waste is an important strategy for reducing GHG emissions and promoting sustainable development. By converting waste into a valuable resource, industries that do the same can contribute to establishing a circular economy and reduce their dependence on fossil fuels (Sherwood, 2020 ). SDG 7 provides a framework for promoting sustainable energy practices, such as increasing the use of renewable energy sources, reducing the wastage of energy, and improving energy efficiency (United Nations, 2015-g ). These practices can help reduce the overall energy consumption in the BE, which in turn can lead to less waste generation (United Nations, 2015-g ). Fuels obtained from biomass are usually seen as sustainable energy sources. Through technologies that convert waste to energy, these fuelsare converted into useful energy forms like bioethanol, hydrogen (biohydrogen), biogas, among others. The significance of renewable energy sources has often been noted because these sources have been observed to be of prime importance in reducing carbon emissions (Jewell et al., 2014 ). Developments that are linked to climate change have also been assessed within the framework of policies in the domain of energy (Bang, 2010 ). Another way of ensuring affordable energy for all is through the optimization of the present energy available to us through the modernization of transport routes of waste and improvement of building plans, keeping in mind the local conditions of an area (Offenhuber, 2019 ). Proper waste management practices in energy-efficient buildings can contribute to increasing said efficiency. For example, proper recycling practices in building complexes can reduce the amount of waste that needs to be transported and processed, which can save energy and reduce GHG emissions (US EPA, 2023b ). Modern waste management practices and waste-to-energy initiatives can lead societies forward towards the attainment of SDG 7. Waste management practices, such as incineration and anaerobic digestion can generate energy from waste (US EPA, 2023b ) and contribute to renewable energy production alongside resulting in the reduction of dependence on non-renewable energy sources, such as fossil fuels. Waste-to-energy projects can convert waste into energy through various technologies, including gasification and pyrolysis (US EPA, 2023b ). These projects can help meet the energy needs of communities and contribute to the development of a more efficient energy system. Waste management practices can also be integrated into sustainable urban development plans to promote the reduction of GHG emissions along with the utilization of renewable energy sources. This can contribute towards the development of low-carbon and sustainable cities (Joensuu et al., 2020 ; Liu et al., 2018 ).  5.8 SDG 8: waste and sustainable economic growth SDG 8 targets the attainment of decent work conditions and economic growth, where the SDG directly links to the BE while designing future infrastructure that will enable efficient communication and transportation (United Nations, 2015-h ). SDG 8 also plays an important role in bringing forth the importance of creating job opportunities and supporting local economic growth. The construction, maintenance and retrofitting of buildings, infrastructure, and other physical assets can generate employment and stimulate economic activity. Waste management is an important aspect of the BE in terms of economic growth, as it can aid in the creation of jobs and support economic growth through the promotion of a circular economy. By reducing, reusing, and recycling waste, communities can conserve resources, reduce environmental impacts, and create green jobs in areas such as waste collection, sorting, and processing (Padilla-Rivera et al., 2020 ).For the development of sustainable and habitable communities, waste management is crucial, yet it is still difficult in many developing nations and cities. As per the data by World Bank, the waste management plays a crucial role in waste handling, but the rates of waste collection differ significantly based on income levels. Upper, middle- and high-income countries have achieved nearly universal waste collection, whereas low-income countries only manage to collect approximately 48% of waste in urban areas, with a sharp decline to 26% in rural areas. In terms of regional disparities, Sub-Saharan Africa collects approximately 44% of waste, while Europe and Central Asia, as well as North America, achieve collection rates of at least 90% (Kaza et al., 2018 ).The cost of sustainable waste management often accounts for 20%–50% of municipal budgets (The World Bank, 2018 , 2023 ).Also, the operating costs for integrated waste management, encompassing collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal, typically surpass $100 per tonne in high-income countries. In contrast, lower-income countries allocate comparatively lower amounts, around $35 per tonne or even higher, towards waste operations. However, these countries face significant challenges in cost recovery (Kaza et al., 2018 ).Thus, there is a need for establishment of a system that will bring about lesser discrepancies between figures related to waste systems in high-income and comparatively lower income countries. In literature, economic growth has been found to be conventionally sought in ways which tend to put a dent on sustainability (by a lack of accountability that is seen in the industrial sector). Sustainability, on the other hand, is traditionally sought in ways which tend to challenge economic growth (Meadows, 1999 ).Addressing environmental and social predicaments with a focus on resource recovery is still a subject of discussion that is widely dismissed despite the fact that organized recycling cooperatives can provide a number of services to cities, such as environmental education/awareness towards waste, street sweeping, support for other local businesses and initiatives, in addition to the door-to-door collection of organic household waste and recyclables in a selective manner. The possibility of redistributing alongside generating income among the urban poor is one of the most important aspects of resource recovery (an important part of waste management) (Gutberlet, 2010 ). In low-income neighbourhoods that lack basic public services, organized recycling cooperatives that play an important part in waste management in the BE through resource recovery contribute significantly to maintaining the urban environment by collecting what would otherwise contaminate public spaces like roads, parks, beaches, river banks (and rivers), among others (Gutberlet, 2010 ). By focusing on sustainable development and promoting economic growth, communities can create an efficient cycle of growth, job creation, and environmental protection and thus, when waste management in the BE is viewed through the lens of SDG 8, roadmaps for national and international policies for a better and sustainable future can be achieved, in which the promotion of “inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all” will be seen.  5.9 SDG 9: waste and infrastructure development SDG 9, which aims to “Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable and inclusive industrialization and foster innovation,” is directly linked to the BE in terms of infrastructure development, efficiency in the usage of energy, and waste management (United Nations, 2015-i ). The goal sets the target for nations to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, build resilient infrastructure, alongside fostering innovation (United Nations, 2015-i ). One of the key areas that this goal addresses is the BE, which includes buildings, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. In the modern BE, environmentally conscious infrastructure development is essential for numerous reasons, including minimizing human impact on the environment, enabling people to live in urban environments, by providing sanitation services like collection of wastewater and treatment of waste along with systems of recovery and disposal. In the present age, growing interest of the conscious masses in more environmentally conscious practices is seen, including practices of opting for ‘green infrastructure’ instead of ‘grey infrastructure’ (Thacker et al., 2019 ), which includes practices like using reed beds and ponds for treating sewage (Scholz and Lee, 2005 ), finding ways for the utilization of wetlands for recharging groundwater aquifers (Van der Kamp and Hayashi, 1998 ) and practicing afforestation as a natural substitute for flood protection practices(Dadson et al., 2017 ). Infrastructure in the BE is an essential factor in building resilience in societies around the world, as well as building resilience for public service delivery in the sectors of education and healthcare along with access to water and energy (Casier, 2015 ). It indicates that there is a need for significant investment in rural infrastructure, which in turn illustrates the significance of investments in the infrastructure of metropolitan and rural BEs (Casier, 2015 ). A sustainable BE must consider waste management practices as part of its design and operation. For example, advancing ideas like Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) puts forth principles dealing with the primary utilization and recycling along with reuse of materials in a way that will be most productive and sustainable over the materials’ whole life cycles. In the BE, promoting ideas like SMM has the potential for minimizing the environmental impacts of the materials used, bringing about a reduction in the amount of waste generated, conservation of resources, and enhancing resiliency to man-made and natural disasters. SDG 9 also aims to “upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes'', which can also be linked to waste management in the BE (United Nations, 2015-i ). The analysis of interdependencies between different sectors of the infrastructure development industry aids the development of comprehensible investments and policies that contribute towards reaching the targets set by SDG 9. Infrastructure is often called a ‘system-of-systems’ where different infrastructure sectors act in unison to deliver sustainable services. Approaches, such as simulations and system-of-systems modelling can be used in order to test the performance trade-offs for a range of possible interventions and policies from sectors that have traditionally been analyzed in isolation (Hall et al., 2017 ; Thacker et al., 2019 ). One recent example of this type of analysis was carried out for the Government of Curaçao. In the analysis, imminent challenges for the reliability of energy supplies were revealed to be driven, in part, by a tourism industry that was found to be growing, an increase in the use of water desalinization, and the potential involvement that better waste management practices could have in the sustainability of the island (Adshead et al., 2019 ). Strides towards increasing proficiency across several aspects of infrastructure systems are needed to address the multifaceted and pressing challenges that decision-makers presently face with regards to waste management along with other sectors related to infrastructure in the BE (Thacker et al., 2019 ).  5.10 SDG 10: waste and equality SDG 10, which aims to “reduce inequalities” (United Nations, 2015-j ), is closely linked to the BE and waste management. The way in which the BE functions, which includes functioning of buildings, infrastructure, and urban spaces, can contribute to reducing socio-spatial inequalities by providing access to safe, reasonable, and sustainable housing, along with affordable public transportation, and other services to all people, regardless of their income or background, while keeping special focus on the economically and socially vulnerable population (Mouratidis, 2021 ; Sharma et al., 2021 ). This way of functioning refers to the incorporation of inclusivity in all the aforementioned areas and lesser to no discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, sexual orientation, or economic background, along with taking into consideration and addressing any other factor that might lead to any discriminatory circumstances regarding access to any built infrastructure. MSW management systems are presently progressing towards a more sustainable route in many regions around the world. Future efforts to continue improving MSW systems, which lead to the reduction of air pollutants and GHG emissions, are similar across scenarios called Maximum Technically Feasible Reduction (MFR) scenarios-an ideal scenario where circular MSW management systems are implemented internationally, thus reducing inequalities. These scenarios can be achieved through the proper disposal of waste and promotion of sustainable waste management practices that minimize negative impacts on different communities as well as the environment. In the MFR scenarios, where inequalities continue to persist, the sluggish adoption of circular MSW management systems has also been found to result in high emissions of GHG and several other pollutants in the atmosphere over the years (Gómez-Sanabria et al., 2022 ). In cases such as these, vulnerable communities with lower socio-economic status may be disproportionately impacted by waste management practices, which can result in environmental degradation or exposure to toxic waste that affects their health and well-being (Gelormino et al., 2015 ). Sustainable waste management practices that aid in reducing inequalities can also be attributed to the creation of new job opportunities, especially in the recycling and waste management industries, which can contribute to reducing income inequalities and promoting economic growth (Gutberlet, 2010 ; Sharma et al., 2021 ). This, in turn, can have a positive impact on reducing inequalities in accessing essential services and improving the overall value of life. Therefore, it can be concluded that the BE and waste management play an essential role in achieving SDG 10 and reducing inequalities. By promoting sustainable practices and equitable access to essential services, these sectors can contribute to creating a more equal world for all.  5.11 SDG 11: waste and sustainable cities In SDG 11, target 11.6 specifically deals with reducing the environmental impacts of cities, under which Indicator 11.6.1 is the “proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge out of the total urban solid waste generated, by cities”. This SDG plays a great role in providing instructions to policymakers of different BEs regarding the measurement of the share of MSW collected on a regular basis and with sufficient ultimate discharge out of total solid waste generated (United Nations, 2015-k ). It is also found that SDG 11 can be said to build upon SDG 9 and sets the target of building sustainable communities. Waste management in the BE plays a crucial role in attaining SDG 11, which aims at making human settlements sustainable, safe, resilient, and inclusive. Also, the way in which waste is produced, collected, treated, and disposed of can have significant impacts on public health, the environment, and overall sustainability of the BE (Khoiron et al., 2020 ). To achieve SDG 11, it is important that the incorporation of sustainable practices when dealing with waste in the BE, such as reducing, reusing, and recycling waste, be ensured. This can be done through the design of buildings that promote waste reduction, the utilization of sustainable materials, and the implementation of effective waste management systems (United Nations, 2015-k) . The design of buildings can also influence the amount of waste generated, as buildings that are designed to promote energy efficiency, use sustainable materials, and have effective waste management systems in place will generate less waste. Similarly, the use of green infrastructure, such as green roofs, can also help promote energy efficient infrastructure development, with photovoltaic (PV)-green roofs having been deemed a successful strategy for producing clean energy on the building scale (Shafique et al., 2020 ).  5.12 SDG 12: waste and consumption and production patterns Waste management in the BE plays a crucial role in attaining patterns of sustainable consumption and production, (one of the key objectives of SDG 12). This goal is directly linked to the BE in terms of resource use, waste generation, and waste management. With regards to the BE, SDG 12 (which highlights the ensuring of sustainable consumption patterns), can be said to further ensure the implementation of SDG 6 and SDG 15 with respect to the sustainable use of water and responsible use of land resources, respectively, while dealing with development in the BE. Specifically, Target 12.7 under this SDG refers to the execution of sustainable procurement practices and policies that will have to be reflected in the acquisition of infrastructure projects as well (United Nations, 2015-l ). Around 2.24 billion tonnes of solid waste was generated globally in 2020 and by 2050, and that number is projected to rise to about 3.88 billion tonnes. In developing countries, around 90% of solid waste was regulated informally or dumped in open areas (The World Bank, 2018 , 2022 ). Waste management is an imperative aspect of the BE, as it is one of the main indicators of the consumption patterns in society. Proper waste management can raise consciousness about the impact of consumption patterns and promote more sustainable choices among individuals and organizations. It is vital to ensure that by 2030, efficient utilization and sustainable management of natural resources be incorporated into sustainable waste management practices in the BE to achieve SDG 12 (Target 12.2). The design of buildings can also influence the amount of waste generated in the BE, as buildings that are designed to promote energy efficiency, use sustainable materials, and have effective waste management systems in place, will generate less waste (Sharma et al., 2021 ). Similarly, the use of green infrastructure, such as green roofs, can also help reduce waste by reducing the need for landfill space (Kabisch and Haase, 2014 ). The BE and waste management being closely linked, sustainable waste management practices can play an important function in achieving SDG 12 and the other related SDGs. By incorporating sustainable waste management practices into the BE, societies around the world can move towards a more sustainable future through the adoption of sustainable production and consumption patterns.  5.13 SDG 13: waste and climate SDG 13 aims to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts” (United Nations, 2015-m ). This goal is directly linked to the BE in terms of consumption of energy, emissions, and waste management which can be attributed to causing climate change. The way in which waste is produced, collected, treated, and disposed of can have significant impacts on the environment, public health, and overall sustainability. To achieve SDG 13, ensuring that the BE incorporates sustainable waste management practices, such as reducing, reusing, and recycling waste, becomes important. This can be done through the design of buildings that promote waste reduction and the implementation of effective waste management systems. The use of green infrastructure, such as green roofs, can also help reduce waste by reducing the need for landfill space (Kabisch and Hasse, 2014 ), whose significance lies in the fact that landfills are a key source of GHG emissions, including methane which is a potent contributor to climate change (US EPA, 2023a ). To curb the growing amounts of waste and reduce the environmental impacts that result from the same as the world observes increasing amounts of development in the BE, food waste reduction has been said to be an important aspect of international political agenda, together with GHG emission targets and ambitious material recycling (De Sadeleer et al., 2020 ).Alongside the impacts of the treatment of disposed waste, food waste has been found to indirectly cause negative impacts to the environment, as a result of which it has been found to give rise to socio-economic and ethical concerns (Eberle and Fels, 2016 ; Salhofer et al., 2008 ; UNEP, 2016a ). After comparing emissions that were avoided due to the prevention of generation of food waste with ones avoided through improved waste management systems, the results obtained were found to offer notable insights in understanding the environmental potential of downstream versus upstream mitigation strategies related to climate change. Recycling strategies were clearly found to result in lesser benefits than prevention strategies. However, food waste management strategy has been observed to be the most valuable when recycling and prevention strategies are used simultaneously (De Sadeleer et al., 2020 ). It is thus important that waste streams of food be assessed along the whole supply chain, with a particular focus on the wastage-related environmental impacts in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP), land use and wastewater. By reducing the amount of generated waste and properly managing the waste that is produced in the BE, GHG emissions can be reduced, which can help mitigate climate change.  5.14 SDG 14: waste and aquatic ecosystems SDG 14, also known as “life below water,” aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. The BE and waste management are both closely linked to this goal (United Nations, 2015-n ). In the BE, the design and construction of buildings and other infrastructure can be in ways that minimize the negative impact on marine and coastal ecosystems. This can include measures such as reducing runoff into the oceans, protecting coastal habitats, and reducing the quantity of waste that is produced and disposed of in coastal areas (UNEP, 2019b ). Waste management is also a key aspect of SDG 14 as the improper disposal of waste can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems, including the introduction of pollutants into the ocean and the entanglement of marine life in plastic debris (UNEP, 2016b ). Various anthropogenic activities, such as the construction of dams, flyovers, and railway tracks over rivers, can generate huge amounts of waste that can pollute the aquatic ecosystem (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Some other sources from which anthropogenic waste generated in the BE can result in aquatic systems include households, offices and recreational centres. The effect of these wastes reaching aquatic systems has often found to be far-reaching and capable of causing harm to both flora and fauna in and near an aquatic system. Eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) is one of those far-reaching consequences (Hargrave, 1991 ). Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharges have been observed to be an important source of release for small (meso, micro, and nano) plastic particles to the terrestrial environment (Gies et al., 2018 ; Napper and Thompson, 2016 ). Accidental or often intentional releases of chemicals into rivers, freshwater and marine oil spills and dumping of wastes in the ocean are also some of the examples of how anthropogenic waste reaches aquatic systems. There have been several reports on the often adverse effects of these wastes on aquatic flora and fauna, one of the most prominent among them being the Minamata Tragedy of 1953 (Harada, 1995 ) to recently discovered effects of microplastics ingested by aquatic organisms (Jovanović, 2017 ). Effective waste management practices with respect to the aquatic systems including reducing, reusing, and recycling waste alongside keeping a track of proper disposal methods can help to minimize these impacts and protect the health of the ocean and its inhabitants. The waste management practices in the BE thus play a critical role in achieving the goals of SDG 14 and ensuring the sustainability of aquatic resources. By taking steps to minimize the impact of human activities on the ocean, this vital resource can be conserved for future generations.  5.15 SDG 15: waste and terrestrial ecosystems SDG 15, also known as “life on land,” aims to attain the protection, restoration, and promotion of sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, and drylands, as well as the halt of biodiversity loss and land degradation (United Nations, 2015-o ). In the BE, infrastructure can be designed and constructed in ways that minimize the negative impact on terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. This can include measures to preserve and restore ecosystems by reducing the amount of waste generated and disposed of in these areas, reducing the use of land for construction purposes and proper treatment of waste before disposal (UNEP, 2019b ). Waste management is also an important aspect of SDG 15 as the improper disposal of waste can have significant impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, including the introduction of pollutants into the environment and the destruction of habitats. Improper management and disposal of MSW causes pollution in the domains of air, soil, and water. Unsystematic dumping of wastes has been found to contaminate ground and surface water supplies. In urban areas, MSW causes clogging of drains, creating stagnant water that acts as a breeding ground for insects and results floods during rainy seasons. Uncontrolled burning of MSW and improper incineration contributes significantly to urban air pollution. GHGs are generated from the decomposition of organic wastes in landfills, and untreated leachate pollutes surrounding soil and water bodies. Health and safety issues can also arise if MSW is not managed properly. There also arises the issue of insect and rodent vectors being attracted to waste that is not disposed of properly and the latter can then spread diseases such as cholera and dengue fever (Alam and Ahmade, 2013 ). Thus, waste management in the BE play a crucial role in achieving the goals of SDG 15 and ensure the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems in the long run.  5.16 SDG 16: waste and peace SDG 16, which deals with “peace, justice and strong institutions,” aims to provide access to justice for all, promote inclusive and peaceful societies for sustainable development, and build institutions that are effective in spreading knowledge and incorporate inclusivity at all levels (United Nations, 2015-p ). In the BE, the design and construction of buildings and infrastructure can contribute to promoting peace and security by providing safe and secure living spaces for communities. This can include measures such as designing buildings to withstand natural disasters and providing infrastructure that supports emergency services and disaster response (Mead, L., 2022 ).Waste management can also be said to be linked to SDG 16 since community conflicts may be observed when waste is poorly managed. This can have serious consequences, including intra-community hostility and in some cases, even violent scenarios. Thus, it can be said that the attention of the community to waste may actually have a vital part to play in restoring social harmony, as much as it does on improving health (Scheinberg et al., 1999 ). Effective waste management practices, such as reducing, reusing, and recycling waste, can help to minimize these risks and contribute to creating a more peaceful and secure environment. Poor waste management practices can lead to environmental degradation and health risks, which can in turn contribute to social unrest and conflict (Said, 2021 ). The concept contends that proper waste management can contribute to SDG 16 by promoting peace and security. Nations that are already in strife can benefit from the comprehensive regional environmental management programmes that steer their communities towards more sustainable practices in the waste sector. For example, given the prevailing level of friction between Israel and Palestine along with the scale of environmental challenges, and the interdependence of Israeli-Palestinian ecosystems, an efficient paradigm for trans-boundary environmental management becomes a significant necessity (Alleson et al., 2013 ). By creating safe and secure living spaces, reducing environmental risks, and promoting peace and security, policy-makers and governments around the world can help to create a more peaceful world for future generations.  5.17 SDG 17: waste and partnerships SDG 17 sets the goal to further approach relevant global partnerships to aid the incorporation of sustainability in built infrastructure-something that is extremely important in bringing forth collective progress of nations towards a more sustainable future (United Nations, 2015-q ). The BE of cities has a major part in influencing the way people work and live, and given its relatively long lifespan, its impact is bound to stay around for a long time (Elgendy, 2012 ). The buildings, transportation routes, along with many other aspects of the BE that connect individuals living there, determine a large part of the energy they spend daily during work as well as commute (US EPA, 2023a ). Several aspects of the BE, like transportation routes, also plays a great role in the efficiency with which waste is collected in these environments. Thus, it is significant to the well-being of individuals that sustainability in infrastructure design be included in discussions regarding waste management in the BE and that there be an aim for global partnerships whenever issues related to waste in a nation become too big to handle. Today, positive developments are increasingly being observed regarding the incorporation of sustainability when dealing with waste in the BE, indicating that the tide is turning towards a more sustainable future for several countries around the world. The waste management rules laid out under international agreements like the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal (1989) (US Department of State, 2021a ), the Rotterdam Convention (1998) (US Department of State, 2021b ) and many other policies related to waste that call for global partnership to tackle pollution and waste generated by the BEs in several countries around the world are being executed successfully in most cases. These policies show how proper waste management and cooperation in waste management practices have been put forth to the global community long before the Paris Agreement (United Nations, 2015 ) that introduced the SDGs and how the former plays a major role in achieving SDG 17. Thus, policies related to waste management in the BE play a vital role in bringing forth the execution of SDG 17.   6 Cooperative game theory and waste management Cooperation is a significant attribute when considering the success of waste management practices in the BE, as these practices involve real individuals who handle the whole process of management. To better understand successful waste management in the BE, cooperative game theory (CGT) may be used to better present the intricacies of the interactions between the actual people who handle the waste. CGT illustrates how different agents cooperate and compete as coalitions in interactions that are unstructured in nature to create and capture value (Chatain, 2014 ). The framework of CGT is often used to study cooperative games that focus on making predictions about the joint actions that groups will take, which coalitions will form, and the resulting collective payoffs. CGT and waste management have been found to have certain specific correlations, as both involve the distribution and management of resources. However, the particular nature of the correlation would depend on the particular areas of waste management being considered (Chatain, 2014 ). Game theoretic research has also earlier been used to explain the occurrence of cooperation in human society (Zhang and Pei, 2021 ).It can be potentially used now to understand the dilemma regarding cooperation and non-cooperation in society regarding basic waste management norms like whether the segregation of waste should be at its source, i.e., households, or in primary waste collection units like garbage trucks. CGT aids waste management objectives through various ways (as pointed out in Fig. 5  ). One potential areas of correlation between CGT and waste management in the BE is the allocation of resources and costs among different stakeholders involved in waste management. CGT provides a framework for analyzing how different players can work together to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, which could be relevant for waste management where multiple parties may have different goals and interests regarding the processing of waste. For example, in the case of MSW, the municipality, waste collection companies, recycling facilities, and residents may all have different objectives and responsibilities regarding the waste. CGT could be used to analyze how these players can work together to minimize waste and maximize resource recovery while sharing the costs and benefits fairly. Another potential area of correlation is in the analysis of waste reduction and recycling programs. CGT can be used to evaluate the potential benefits and costs of different waste reduction strategies, and to analyze the incentives that can motivate different players to adopt more sustainable practices. For example, a cooperative game model could be used to examine how the costs and benefits of implementing a kerbside recycling program would be distributed among different stakeholders, and how this could impact their decisions to participate in the program. This could help to identify the most effective strategies for promoting recycling and reducing waste. CGT has also been used in the past to provide a model that considers voluntary recycling without government intervention or enforcement (Cohen et al., 2021 ). CGT is found to mention accountability restrictions or external enforcement of cooperative behaviour. This is an important point from an environmental policy perspective since the concept of accountability is not observed in most cases related to environmental pollution. Accountability can be found in policies like “polluter pays principle” but no such policies are seen for defaulters of waste segregation. Without accountability restrictions, it will be hard to maintain waste processing and management practices, as also put forth by the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) Game, where defection is found to dominate cooperation in most cases since defectors always benefit from co-operators (Rapoport, 1989 ). Obtaining an understanding of CGT is also important since by investigating this concept in detail, incentivizing people to cooperate with waste management laws can be better learned. While there are potential areas of correlation between CGT and waste management, the specific nature of the relationship would depend on the particular aspects of waste management being considered. Thus, CGT can be said to have the possibility of playing a major role in the future of waste management policies (Zhang and Pei, 2021 ) and in helping ensure a sustainable future.  7 Conclusion and way forward SDGs form an essential part of the future of the Anthropocene. The extremely detailed goals of providing guidance to policymakers while they make policies and subsequent laws that will decide the future of the environment. Implementation of the SDGs into policy is essential because it can help ensure that local and national governments, businesses, and other organizations are collectively working towards globally agreed-upon goals for sustainable development. Furthermore, implementing the SDGs into policy can help increase accountability and transparency, as governments and organizations will be held accountable for their progress toward achieving the common goals. This can help to build the trust of the public and ensure that sustainable development remains a priority for all stakeholders. The BE forms one of the most important parts of discussions related to the present-day society. One of the major aspects of sustainability being the management of waste, the paper has aimed to provide the correlation between the BE, waste management, and how SDGs can guide us towards a better and more sustainably developed society. The process of achieving sustainability in the BE's waste management practices can only proceed towards success when all the generators, collectors, and treatment personnel of the waste are taken into consideration. Thus, cooperation is very important in carrying out sustainable waste management practices and game theory of cooperation gives researchers and policymakers the tools to put forth models that will help effectively understand cooperation in society and frame future policies and laws that will have fewer chances of being myopic in nature. Various models may be put forth by researchers specifically related to waste management through which there may be a more effective understanding of what could be done when there is non-cooperation with regards to sustainable waste management practices and how to better understand cooperation between those involved. Some recommendations with regards to the way forward in the discussions regarding waste management in the BE in the context of SDGs are as follows:• Recognizing the importance of both technical advancements as well as social awareness in the modern waste sector of BE around the world.  • Promoting inclusivity in all communities that are involved in waste management practices of a BE in terms of gender, caste, creed, religion and socio-economic status so as to build an efficient waste management system.  • Modern tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms can be the future of waste management practices as it provides more sustainable methods such as AI-based waste sorting, smart waste bins, AI-based bin monitoring systems, machine learning algorithm-based predictive analytics and demand for casting along with optimization of waste treatment facilities.    Attention towards waste production and its effective management in the BE are crucial factors in achieving the SDGs and ensuring a sustainable future. The challenges and opportunities in waste management require a coordinated and integrated approach that involves stakeholders from various sectors, including government, industry, and civil society. Effective regulations and policies must be developed and implemented to support sustainable waste management practices and encourage innovation and investment in waste management technologies. The potential benefits of effective waste management practices, including environmental sustainability, public health, and economic development, make it an essential component of development in the BE. It is essential that the nexus between waste management in the BE and sustainable development be recognized and waste management be prioritized as a critical issue so that the world can move closer to achieving the SDGs, thus creating a more sustainable future for all.
