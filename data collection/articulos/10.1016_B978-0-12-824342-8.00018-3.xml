               The definition of sustainability has always been discussed by experts. In 1972, definitions stressed restrictions on ecological systems, carrying out functions such as absorption and recycling of waste of anthropogenic activities, with the concomitant problems of improving social, educational, health, and employment. In 1987, sustainable development was defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” In 2019, it was defined as satisfying the needs of current and future generations, depending on appropriate circumstances of human, natural, and economic capital to provide for human welfare.
               The concept of sustainable development has become a widely recognized goal for human society in the 21st century. The idea of sustainable development came to light in 1987 with the publication of “Our Common Future,” which firmly established sustainable development as a critical component of international development. Because inequalities that had been anomalies were increasing within and among nations, increasing poverty, especially in developing countries, depleting the ozone layer and causing global warming, depleting natural resources and endangering some species of animals and plants, and causing water and air pollution, and so forth, sustainable development came about as an effort to change the way of thinking about the planet. Behind this lies the reason for why the concept of development is now preferred instead of growth. Growth is believed to reflect only a quantitative aspect of countries without considering other qualitative items such as education, health, and equality. The argument is that growth is a quantitative increase in physical scale whereas development is qualitative improvement or the unfolding of potentialities. This research analyzes why and how the concept of sustainable development has emerged, how it should be conceptualized, and what should be done to achieve it.
               In addition, the idea of sustainable development was first thought to be a strategy to against ecological disaster resulting from the extreme commercial exploitation of sources and the deterioration of the environment. The main awareness was to maintain an exceptional environment. Today the idea has been extended. It is has first-rate economic and social complexity. The evaluation of financial techniques in many countries has proven that fast financial growth precipitated critical issues from the viewpoint of sustainable development consisting of social, economic and environmental sustainability.

               <ce:simple-para id="abspara0010" view="all">The definition of sustainability has always been discussed by experts. In 1972, definitions stressed restrictions on ecological systems, carrying out functions such as absorption and recycling of waste of anthropogenic activities, with the concomitant problems of improving social, educational, health, and employment. In 1987, sustainable development was defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” In 2019, it was defined as satisfying the needs of current and future generations, depending on appropriate circumstances of human, natural, and economic capital to provide for human welfare.</ce:simple-para>
               <ce:simple-para id="abspara0015" view="all">The concept of sustainable development has become a widely recognized goal for human society in the 21st century. The idea of sustainable development came to light in 1987 with the publication of “Our Common Future,” which firmly established sustainable development as a critical component of international development. Because inequalities that had been anomalies were increasing within and among nations, increasing poverty, especially in developing countries, depleting the ozone layer and causing global warming, depleting natural resources and endangering some species of animals and plants, and causing water and air pollution, and so forth, sustainable development came about as an effort to change the way of thinking about the planet. Behind this lies the reason for why the concept of development is now preferred instead of growth. Growth is believed to reflect only a quantitative aspect of countries without considering other qualitative items such as education, health, and equality. The argument is that growth is a quantitative increase in physical scale whereas development is qualitative improvement or the unfolding of potentialities. This research analyzes why and how the concept of sustainable development has emerged, how it should be conceptualized, and what should be done to achieve it.</ce:simple-para>
               <ce:simple-para id="abspara0020" view="all">In addition, the idea of sustainable development was first thought to be a strategy to against ecological disaster resulting from the extreme commercial exploitation of sources and the deterioration of the environment. The main awareness was to maintain an exceptional environment. Today the idea has been extended. It is has first-rate economic and social complexity. The evaluation of financial techniques in many countries has proven that fast financial growth precipitated critical issues from the viewpoint of sustainable development consisting of social, economic and environmental sustainability.</ce:simple-para>

               <ce:para id="p0010" view="all">The notion of sustainable development shaped the foundation of the Environment and Development Conference held by the United Nations (UN) in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. The conference manifest the first worldwide effort to design strategies and action plans to a form development that is environmentally friendly and more sustainable. Almost all countries of the world sent delegates to the conference, more than 100 of which were leaders of their countries. Besides the delegates of countries, some international organizations representing civil societies sent representatives to the summit. In 1987, in its report “Our Common Future” the Brundtland Commission stated that the key to solving environmental problems was sustainable development.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0015" view="all">The Brundtland Report considered the various serious problems regarding environmental degradation in previous decades: explicitly, that human activity had intense negative influences on the earth, and that development and growth would not be sustainable if the process of environment exploitation continued. Important tasks focusing this philosophy involved Rachel Carson's <ce:italic>Silent Spring</ce:italic> (1962), Garret Hardin's <ce:italic>Tragedy of the Commons</ce:italic> (1968), the ecologist magazine <ce:italic>Blueprint for Survival</ce:italic> (1972), and the report of Club of Rome's <ce:italic>The Limits to Growth</ce:italic> (1972).</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0020" view="all">At the Conference of UN on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972, experts presented a unique recognition of sustainable development for the first time. Sustainable development was referred to as development that considers environment conservation especially for future generations.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0025" view="all">Fifteen years later, the term “sustainable development” was disseminated in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, entitled “Our Common Future” which involved the classic definition of sustainable development: “the development which guarantees meeting the needs of the present generation without reducing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” Nevertheless, it was not considered to be the main global problem until the main leaders of <ce:anchor id="p2"/>the world identified sustainable development as the most important challenge of humanity.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0030" view="all">In 2002, 191 countries and international institutions attended the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, which had three important consequences: a political statement, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, and a variety of partnership creativities. The main promises made in the summit involved those sustainability in production and consumption, energy, and water.</ce:para>

               <ce:section-title id="cesectitle0025">The concept of sustainable development</ce:section-title>
               <ce:para id="p0035" view="all">Sustainable development is a notion that at its center is groundbreaking, yet extremely hard to describe practically. The history behind sustainable development is not long. Pressures that may exist within the notion of sustainable development are various, extending from its unclear and imprecise description to the failure to reach a worldwide practical and functional context. The big problem the concept of sustainable development encounters is the needy to teach it to society and express it in words that individuals will understand. The definition of sustainable development is one that debatably is multifield, complicated, and regular; yet, describing the notion is undoubtedly an important challenge. The term “sustainable development” was invented in 1980, when the concept of the notion was purely rudimentary. It was at the World Conservation Strategy, an association between three leading environmental organizations the international union for conservation of nature (IUCN), world wide fund for nature (WWF), and the united nations environment programme (UNEP), where sustainable development was defined as “preserving the world's natural resources” (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0020" refid="bib23">World Conservation Strategy, 2011</ce:cross-ref>). What the World Conservation Strategy had comprehended is that many countries increasingly exploit natural resources to achieve higher economic growth. The unique goal of the World Conservation Strategy was to ask countries to refuse to deplete natural resources because it was harming the environment. Therefore, sustainable development was considered only in general, not in detail, at the time it was invented; even after a<ce:hsp sp="0.25"/>decade, the definition remained almost the same. In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development published a paper entitled “Our Common Future” The article presented a commonly recited definition of sustainable development: development that guarantees meeting the needs of the current generation without reducing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Many worldwide organizations, institutions, and nongovernmental organizations have since applied the paper, repeatedly identified as the Brundtland Report, that became the first manuscript to support sustainable development as a multidisciplinary field, because it clarified that the economy, society, and the environment were vital to sustainable development. In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development planned a program named Agenda 21, which supposedly was the primary design for sustainability in the 21st century. The UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) observed countries that gave their agreement to Agenda 21. This commission is responsible for revising advancement in the enactment of Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The commission also provides policy guidance for applying the Johannesburg Plan of <ce:anchor id="p3"/>Implementation at the domestic, local, and worldwide levels. Both Agenda 21 and the Brundtland Report are broadly used bases for countries, institutions, and organizations in current times, yet a perfect description still is not evident even though they are acknowledged.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0040" view="all">The major problem with sustainable development is the lack of a perfect explanation of it. Although the Brundtland Report's definition is frequently used, one can see precisely where it fails. When looking again at the sentence defining sustainable development, two clear subjects come to mind. First, the definition of “needs” is not clear. There is a large difference between the needs of people living in an underdeveloped country and those of the residents of developed countries. Second, there is no type of time period in the definition, so “generations” is not clear. Because there are many undefined terms in the definition of sustainable development, it is hard to understand. An interesting way to look at subjects available with sustainable development is to observe the next quotation, which expresses a mixture of uncertainty about what to do and a sense of guilt about what is not being completed. In the other words, many individuals appear to be frightened to show what they feel is a lack of recognition of sustainable development. Thus, it is always easier to say that there is no need to talk about it. It is obvious that because of the ambiguous definition of sustainable development, governments and people seem to perform it differently. So far, for those who agree on a definition, the problem of application arises.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0045" view="all">Nations that have made a conscious attempt to recognize sustainable development and are eager to make some changes, both countrywide and worldwide, encounter the challenge of fulfilling policies linked to sustainable development. Agenda 21 is a document that provides a framework for sustainable development; however, there is no enforcement of the document. In the other words, nations may pretend that they know about sustainable development and agree to change their policies, but no one really puts them into action. As the Brundtland report stated, our failure to endorse public attention in sustainable development is often the result of overlooking economic and social fairness within and among countries, which demonstrates another important subject in sustainable development: something more than a simple definition of sustainable development. The difficulty with putting into action policies related to sustainable development is that countries that need them the most have no motive to observe the policies. Because a gap between developing and developed countries undoubtedly exists, developed countries principally are telling underdeveloped ones an appropriate way to develop. This evidently proper way of telling what underdeveloped countries should do has roots in the dominant nature of western countries, but is also focuses on common benefits between both developing and developed countries. At the institutional level, the interreliant targets of economic growth, social development, and environmental preservation are achieved by organizations that are inclined to be disjointed and independent. Sustainable development concentrates on the reputation of organizations that are ready to participate in economic, social, and environmental tasks at the levels of both decision-making and policy development.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0050" view="all">It is in the nature of sustainable development to outline the issues that not only a nation has with its own policies, but also the world has with its environmental problems. <ce:anchor id="p4"/>Therefore, sustainable development is a notion that is groundbreaking yet imperfect within the scope of its perceiver.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0055" view="all">Sustainable development has the capacity to be a revolutionary notion that can transform the methods that countries apply on a countrywide level, and further so on a worldwide level. However, because of its multidisciplinary nature, desirable targets, and pliable clarifications, an obvious explanation of the notion has yet to be realized. Furthermore, its imprecise explanation and uncertainty further enhance the strains found within this concept, because any nation could express that it is obeying policies of sustainable development. The difficulty is first to present a succinct definition and then to be able to apply it to any country practically across the world. Because sustainable development can divide the dialogue between developed and developing countries, any nation should make the required changes to its own policies to offer a cleaner, harmless, and more effective environment, economy, and society. What sustainable development really demands is transparency and collaborative countries that are enthusiastic to work together to improve the world. Perhaps for this single reason, sustainable development is hard to explain, because each country has a different viewpoint of what a better world may be.</ce:para>

               <ce:para id="p0060" view="all">Sustainable development is a notion that almost everyone has heard of but few recognize. That so many individuals are familiar with the concept of sustainable development is noteworthy considering that it was practically unidentified until the issue of the Brundtland Report by the <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0025" refid="bib21">World Commission on Environment and Development (1987)</ce:cross-ref>. Certainly, it was not until the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and the worldwide extension of Agenda 21 of the UN that sustainable development became definitely founded as an acceptable policy goal (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0030" refid="bib20">UN, 1993</ce:cross-ref>). Since that time, many governments have presented a variety of new policy criteria in an effort to direct their economies to a more sustainable path. This seems to be a positive trend. However, we should clarify upon which conditions we can call a country successful in taking steps to achieve the goals of sustainable development. Maybe we have concentrated too deeply on policy criteria and have neglected to focus on tools for attaining sustainable development with an appropriate range of measures to evaluate sustainable development performance in a country. Or perhaps we do not have appropriate sustainable development measures. <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0035" refid="bib5">Costanza (1987)</ce:cross-ref> calls this situation a “social trap” because of a dependance on confusing signs or a failure to notice alarming signals exposed by currently developed measures.</ce:para>

               <ce:para id="p0065" view="all">The notion of sustainable development has become an extensively known purpose for human civilization in the 21st century. The concept of sustainable development was <ce:anchor id="p5"/>invented in 1987 with the publication of “Our Common Future,” which definitely recognized sustainable development as a vital section of global development. Because irregularities were causing inequalities within and among countries, growing poverty, especially in underdeveloped countries; depleting the ozone layer; causing global warming; depleting natural resources and endangering species of animals and plants; polluting water and air pollution, and so forth, sustainable development was proposed as an attempt to revolutionize the way of thinking about the globe. Behind this was the reason for why today the idea of development is favored instead of growth. Growth is alleged to reflect only a quantifiable feature of nations without considering some other qualitative items such as equality, health, and education.</ce:para>

               <ce:para id="p0070" view="all">The term “sustainable development” was used in 1980 by IUCN for the first time, yet the Brundtland Commission Report entitled “Our Common Future” made it important. The definition presented by the commission is still the most frequently used description across the globe. It describes sustainable development as that which meets the needs of the current generation without conciliating the needs of future generations (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0040" refid="bib22">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</ce:cross-ref>). According to Gro Harlen Brundtland, sustainability can be guaranteed only when it stresses (a) the mitigation of deprivation and poverty; (b) the protection and improvement of the resources base, which alone can guarantee the permanent alleviation of poverty; (c) expansion of the idea of development, so that it covers economic growth as well as cultural and social development; and (d) a consideration of both economics and ecology in making decisions at all levels (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0045" refid="bib15">Pearce et al., 1989</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0075" view="all">The commission report emphasized considering policy-makers as well as organizers in both developed and developing countries. Environmental preservation institutes have been established in many countries and have the legal authority to inspect developmental plans on various sustainability scopes before approving or disapproving them. In 1992, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was shown to be revolutionary in this way; a complex of 27 principles were assumed to lead nations in attaining sustainable development for both present and future generations. Besides recognition of the right and need of the current generation for development, it stressed its responsibility to protect the public environment to guarantee intragenerational and intergenerational equity. Since then, sustainable development as an issue has become popular across the world (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0050" refid="bib11">Mebratu, 1998</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0055" refid="bib10">Kori and Gondo, 2012</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0080" view="all">Sustainable development is a multidisciplinary subject with three main dimensions: social, economic, and environmental (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref9060" refid="bib24">Goodland and Daly, 1996</ce:cross-ref>). Social sustainability considers alleviating poverty; economic sustainability is related to the long-run sustainability of both renewable and nonrenewable resources so that they are put into the system of production and make long-run economic revenue; and environmental sustainability is linked to the protection and conservation of life forms existing on earth (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0060" refid="bib8">Goodland, 1995</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0065" refid="bib19">Sutton, 2004</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0070" refid="bib10">Kori and Gondo, 2012</ce:cross-ref>). Sustainable <ce:anchor id="p6"/>development has become a major question of discussion among environment specialists and economists (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0075" refid="bib3">AtKisson, 2006</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0080" refid="bib1">Ayres et al., 2001</ce:cross-ref>) and is widely evaluated in weak and strong terms. A weak definition of sustainability is based on neoclassical capital theory and economic value principles, and is human-centric in the natural environment. It investigates the capital value of natural resources but totally overlooks their value in terms of the natural goods and services it delivers. In addition, strong definitions of sustainability are based on biophysical principles and consider certain functions that the environment does for humans (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0085" refid="bib9">Hediger, 2006</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0090" refid="bib12">Nourry, 2008</ce:cross-ref>). For instance, a weak sustainability model may state that the value of a jungle is equal only to the total number of trees cut and the value it produces to make equipment or paper. Nevertheless, a strong sustainability index will evaluate the financial aids of a jungle not only in terms of the economic value of the trees but also according to its environmental and social value. Trees produce food and shelter for animals and humans, help them by its rainfall, act as carbon sinks, and provide fresh air, all of which are considered in the weak index. Therefore, weak sustainability indexes are based on the viewpoint that man-made capital is more important than natural capital, which can be replaced by its manmade counterpart. In contrast, a strong sustainability index allots importance to natural and also human capital in contrast to man-made capital. Strong sustainability indexes represent the tendency to regulate resource consumption to the use of advanced technologies, and conserves natural capital for future generations (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref9095" refid="bib25">Pearce and Atkinson, 1993</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0095" refid="bib13">Neumayer, 2003</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0100" refid="bib17">Roberts, 2004</ce:cross-ref>; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0105" refid="bib4">Barr, 2008</ce:cross-ref> as citied in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0110" refid="bib7">Davies, 2013</ce:cross-ref>). Thus, weak and strong sustainability indices are different from each other in terms of morality and logical standpoints.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0085" view="all">Based on the strong sustainability concept model, the Brundtland Commission report recommended countries across the globe to pursue a development route calculated in terms of economic growth, but it also considered environmental and social features; therefore, all features should be measured and unified (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0115" refid="bib16">Pope et al., 2004</ce:cross-ref>). Many governments pledged to take steps in sustainability in development by the early years of the third millennium. Agenda 21 at the Earth Summit in 1992, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (2002), and the CSD at its 11th (2003) and 13th (2005) meetings declared the need to develop and account for indicators that can describe sustainable development advancement by nations.</ce:para>

               <ce:para id="p0090" view="all">Indicators use frameworks to offer a communal language and standpoint on the question and its answer. This simplifies indicator development, chiefly when several performers are playing their part. The method in which subjects are outlined becomes significant in the clarification and profounder studies of the consequences, because the frameworks have assumptions for rationales on which the indicator is founded and must be made available to those willing to understand the indicators. Comprehending these assumptions and frameworks is vital to compare and deliberate indicators from various institutes because they may be based on different frameworks. For most users, <ce:anchor id="p7"/>nevertheless, presentation of the frameworks, or their classes, would only augment a needless degree of intricacy that may distract them from the outcomes. Institutes, working on sustainable development, must have a part in the policies of problem definition, responsive to matters of proper contribution and representation. Such institutes also should have their own role in science and technology, responsive to matters of quality control and expertise. Clark states that perhaps the most important message of the Johannesburg conference was that the research communities need to have a historic role in recognizing problems of sustainability with a larger tendency to link to other organizations in finding applied answers to those problems, and that institutes that spend most of their time doing pure science or pure politics are not expected to be as prosperous as those providing applied solutions that tend to be more effective than other organizations in generating information that can effect policy-making. The three measures of credibility, legitimacy, and salience are main features for depicting the effectiveness of sustainable development indicators in which credibility is related to the scientific and technical adequacy of the measurement system, legitimacy is related to the process of reasonable coping with the conflicting values and beliefs of stakeholders, and salience is related to the application of the indicator to decision-makers. The process of developing indicator guarantees at least the first two of these measures. Resources differ considerably between developing and developed countries. Socioeconomic, environmental, and knowledge contrasts between the two halves may be worsened by resource distribution. Finding ways to cover this resource gap is crucial for equitable representation, both geographically and in terms of identifying and bordering important subjects. Equitable representation raises the question of legitimacy and credibility of both the process and the final product. A capacity for activating and using science and technology is also a vital element of strategies endorsing sustainable development. Making scientific capacity and official support acceptable in developing countries is principally vital to improve resilience in regions that are vulnerable to numerous tensions arising from rapid, simultaneous changes in social and environmental systems.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0095" view="all">Nevertheless, scientific capacity alone is inadequate for the goals of creating reliable sustainable development indicators. Instead, building capacity is required, with stress on supporting the broader processes that certify legitimacy and credibility of the process of developing indicators. Effective capacity building stresses the main elements of communication, translation, and mediation. Preparing for sufficient communication between stakeholders is necessary, as is confirming that common understanding is possible. Communication is often stuck by misunderstanding, experience differences, and beliefs about the basis of a convincing discussion. Mediation additionally increases transparency of the process by considering all viewpoints, defining the laws of behavior and process, and founding the criteria of decision-making.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0100" view="all">An important pledge by institutes for managing the frontiers between expertise and decision making will help connect knowledge to action. Founding culpability to important actors across the frontier and using combined outputs to grow unity and pledge to the process are also useful in evolving capacity for sustainable development. Indicator legitimacy and acceptability depend on identifying the multiplicity of <ce:anchor id="p8"/>legitimate standpoints. Where there are complicated subjects, the excellence of the process of decision-making is itself vital, and processes planned to encourage the discourse between stakeholders rather than weakening the authority of science are important to making a comprehensive base of consensus. The role of indicators is to serve as contributors to this discourse and decision-making process. The value of a special indicator set diverges between users and situations. Users should be able to have an impact on selecting the indicators they will have to use. Sometimes this regional selection will lead to a lack of comparability as various groups and processes elect to use various indicators. This can be suitable when the key goal of indicators is to advance effective decision-making. On the other hand, when the key goal is comparability, more emphasis should be given to standardization. It is not usually probable to have both.</ce:para>

               <ce:para id="p0105" view="all">The standard definition of sustainable development from Bruntland uses a three-pivot method to state, briefly, the connections among economic activity, quality of life, and the endlessness of ecosystems and natural resources. A society without operative life support systems cannot prosper; lack of supportive social constructions and institutes avoid economies from thriving. Furthermore, sustainable development has often been understood as social and economic development that should be sustainable from the environmental viewpoint as well. After the Bruntland definition was presented, it was gradually accepted that environmental sustainability has its own advantages. Goodland declares that environmental sustainability tends to advance human welfare by preserving the sources of raw materials used for human needs and guaranteeing that the volume of human waste will not be increased, to avoid damage to humans. This notion identifies that environmental sustainability worries about the insertion of restrictions on resource consumption, which is also a chief principle of the ecological economics framework of restrictions to growth. Moreover, Goodland describes environmental sustainability as the enforcement of constrictions on four key actions influencing the scale of the human economy: the use of renewable and nonrenewable resources on one side, and waste and pollution of resources on the other. Moldan, Janouskova, and Hak argue that the Organization of Monetary Cooperation and Development (OECD) similarly improves the idea of environmental sustainability within their environmental strategy for the first decade of the 21st century, published in 2001. The OECD's strategy defined four precise standards for environmental sustainability: (1) Regeneration: renewable assets will be used efficiently and their use should not be approved to exceed long-term quotes of natural regeneration. (2) Substitutability: nonrenewable resources will be used efficaciously and their use should be limited to ranges that may be offset through substitution with renewable assets or different sorts of capital. (3) Assimilation: release of unsafe or polluting materials into the environment should no longer exceed their waste assimilative capability. (4) The avoidance of irreversibility. The OECD used these four criteria for environmental <ce:anchor id="p9"/>sustainability as a way to consider five interrelated targets for advancing environmental policies in a sustainable development context (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0120" refid="bib14">OECD, 2001</ce:cross-ref>):<ce:list id="olist0010">

Daily discusses “nature's services” to be produced from a worldwide life-assist structure (for example the climate system or hydrological cycle), items supplied via the geosphere (which includes mineral sources), and open space (inclusive of land on the surface of the earth, plus the distance above and beneath it). In meeting the OECD's five objectives for environmental sustainability, human welfare is preserved or enhanced. On this basis, ecosystem services can be considered a fundamental element of human welfare (<ce:cross-ref id="optjZM0bFJVDs" refid="bib6">Chaudhery et al., 2019</ce:cross-ref>).

                  <ce:para id="p0250" view="all">There are numerous procedures for sustainability. The primary, which postulates a trio of environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, and social sustainability, is the most broadly accepted as a model for addressing sustainability. The idea of “social sustainability” in this method includes subjects such as social equity, livability, health equity, community development, social capital, social support, human rights, labor rights, place-making, social responsibility, social justice, cultural competence, community resilience, and human adaptation.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0255" view="all">A second, newer one is the method suggesting that all fields of sustainability are social, consisting of ecological, economic, political, and cultural sustainability. Those fields of social sustainability are based on the connection between the social and the natural, with the ecological field defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these items, social sustainability includes all human activities (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0130" refid="bib2">Atkinson et al., 2003</ce:cross-ref>).

Since the second world war, the concentration on economic development policy has changed through different paradigms up to the idea of sustainable development. The Keynesian concept of the postwar 1970s, in which economic policy was built on sturdy governmental interventions, to the monetarist thought of the 1980s, when initiatives were taken to reduce social disparities by including deprived groups into the mainstream economic system. In the late 1980s to 1990s, the emphasis of <ce:anchor id="p12"/>economic development policy shifted to a rationalist concept and projects to enhance the environmental and total quality of life with absorbing particularly talented individuals and enterprises started.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0265" view="all">The simple standards of the UN specify sustainable development to be considered as the principal goal of the economic system from the current point of view. Economic growth calculated by increase in GDP represents a rise in economic activity and correlates with well-being. Rapid economic growth is rarely sustainable. There are some countries, particularly developing countries, in which excessive discrepancy exists between the level of economic activity and the people's well-being: precisely, high growth with low development. Development is broader than economic growth. Well-being cannot be best measured with financial phrases. Economic growth is an external notion, whereas development is a broader inner one that includes an enhancement in the standards of living and poverty reduction. Economic growth may also bring about an enhancement in the standards of living related to a small share of the population whereas most people are yet poor. It is the distribution of economic growth among the population as an index determining the level of economic development. Economic growth is measured through the growth of GDP, whereas economic development is an extra complex procedure that needs a couple of indicators.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0270" view="all">The analysis of economic procedures in many nations indicates that fast economic growth has precipitated extreme issues from the point of view of sustainable development, such as social and local inequality, lack of adequate infrastructure and rural environment, lack of national capital, and many others. Sustainable development is an instant enhancement in well-being for all populations, not compromising the well-being within the near of far future. Economic growth is essential, but it is not enough for development.</ce:para>

The SDGs and objectives are incorporated and inseparatable, worldwide in nature, and universally appropriate, considering various national realities, capacities, and levels of development and respecting countrywide regulations and priorities. Targets are described as ambitious and worldwide, with every government placing its own countrywide targets directed by the global level of ambition but thinking of countrywide circumstances. Each government may even determine how those ambitious and worldwide purposes ought to be included in national plans, tactics, policies, and strategies. It is crucial to understand the connection between sustainable development and other relevant ongoing tactics within the economic, social, and environmental fields. In determining these desires and goals, we realize that every country encounters special demanding situations to achieve sustainable development, and we underestimate the special difficulties fronting the vulnerable countries, especially African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing states, as well as particular difficulties fronting middle-income countries. Countries in conditions of battle also require specific attention. We realize that baseline data for numerous targets are unavailable, and we require increased aid for strengthening data collection and capacity building in Member States (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0140" refid="bib18">Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2020</ce:cross-ref>).<ce:anchor id="p22"/>

               <ce:para id="p0445" view="all">Sustainable development notion was primarily believed to be a resolution for ecological disaster arised from vast industrial exploitation of resources and deterioration of the environment and the initiative concentration was to maintain environmental quality. Nowadays, the idea of sustainable development has extended by considering quality of life in its intricacy, environmentally, economically and socially. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were emerged at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The aim was supplying a set of global goals that met urgent environmental, political, and economic problems encountering our world. Sustainability has three main dimensions: economic, social and environmental aspects. The analysis of economic progression in many countries has indicated that the rapid economic growth led to severe difficulties from the viewpoint of sustainable development. It is the distribution of economic growth among the population as an index determining the level of economic development. Economic growth is measured through the growth of GDP, whereas economic development is an extra complex procedure that needs a couple of indicators. Economics is defined as the science of allocation of scarce resources to satisfy the unrestricted needs of the people of a given society so there is the need about new directions for economic policy if sustainable development is to be achieved including: difference between developing and developed countries, and justice in the international economy, and participatory development. Sustainable development is a continuous improvement of welfare for all people, without reducing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. So, in order to satisfy the idea of sustainable development, it should be studied the best possible use of all available economic resources for producing maximum feasible output of goods and services that are required for the society now and in the future and the fair distribution of this output. Although economic sustainability is very important, it is essential to consider environmental and social sustainability as well. It is crucial to understand the connection between sustainable development and other relevant ongoing tactics within the economic, social, and environmental fields. Nowadays, the idea is extended in its intricacy, environmentally, economically and socially. The evaluation of the economic sustainability in many countries has proven that economic growth, without considering other aspects of development, precipitated critical issues from the point of view of sustainable development consisting of social, and environmental sustainability. The standard definition of sustainable development from Bruntland uses a three-pivot method to state, briefly, the connections among economic activity, quality of life, and the endlessness of ecosystems and natural resources. A society without operative life support systems cannot prosper; lack of supportive social constructions and institutes avoid economies from thriving. Furthermore, sustainable development has often been understood as social and economic development that should be sustainable from the environmental viewpoint as well. Environmental sustainability tends to improve human welfare by preserving the sources used for human needs and guaranteeing that the volume of human waste will not be increased, to avoid damage to <ce:anchor id="p23"/>humans. This notion identifies that environmental sustainability worries about the insertion of restrictions on resource consumption, which is also a chief principle of the ecological economics framework of restrictions to growth. Social sustainability is the least determined and least apprehended of the various methods of achieving sustainability and sustainable development. Social sustainability has had significantly less interest in public discourse than economic and environmental sustainability. There are numerous procedures for sustainability. The primary, which postulates a trio of environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, and social sustainability, is the most broadly accepted as a model for addressing sustainability. The idea of “social sustainability” in this method includes subjects such as social equity, livability, health equity, community development, social capital, social support, human rights, labor rights, place-making, social responsibility, social justice, cultural competence, community resilience, and human adaptation. A second, newer one is the method suggesting that all fields of sustainability are social, consisting of ecological, economic, political, and cultural sustainability. Those fields of social sustainability are based on the connection between the social and the natural, with the ecological field defined as human embeddedness in the environment. In these items, social sustainability includes all human activities. It is not just relevant to the focused intersection of economics, the environment, and the social.</ce:para>
