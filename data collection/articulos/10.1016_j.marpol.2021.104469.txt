                  Seaweeds are primary producers and among the important marine ecosystem engineers capable of modifying their surrounding abiotic and biotic environments. The southern coast of Bangladesh has an excellent prospect for seaweeds farming due to favorable environmental conditions and natural availability of commercially important species. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the present study determines potential contribution of seaweeds toward achieving several targets of United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the blue economic development in Bangladesh. There are 300 households engaged in seaweeds farming, primarily along the southeast coast, producing 390 tonnes wet weight (= 97.5 tonnes dry weight) of seaweeds per annum with potential applications in food, feed, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals sectors. And the current seaweeds production can be increased yearly at ~50% rate, which is 50 million tonnes (dry weight) from ~5,000 km2 farming area when extrapolated to the year 2050. This may bring a positive change to issues regarding food security, gender equality, economic growth, nutrients removal, carbon sequestration, employment and aquatic environmental health. Overall, the benefits of seaweeds farming could reflect on 26 targets of 8 SDGs and potentially contribute US$0.7 million to the blue economy in Bangladesh.

Seaweeds are primary producers and among the important marine ecosystem engineers capable of modifying their surrounding abiotic and biotic environments. The southern coast of Bangladesh has an excellent prospect for seaweeds farming due to favorable environmental conditions and natural availability of commercially important species. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the present study determines potential contribution of seaweeds toward achieving several targets of United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the blue economic development in Bangladesh. There are 300 households engaged in seaweeds farming, primarily along the southeast coast, producing 390 tonnes wet weight (= 97.5 tonnes dry weight) of seaweeds per annum with potential applications in food, feed, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals sectors. And the current seaweeds production can be increased yearly at ~50% rate, which is 50 million tonnes (dry weight) from ~5,000 km2  farming area when extrapolated to the year 2050. This may bring a positive change to issues regarding food security, gender equality, economic growth, nutrients removal, carbon sequestration, employment and aquatic environmental health. Overall, the benefits of seaweeds farming could reflect on 26 targets of 8 SDGs and potentially contribute US$0.7 million to the blue economy in Bangladesh.   Keywords Seaweed  Ecosystem health  Food security  Resilience  SDGs  Economic growth    1 Introduction Seaweeds are marine plants contributing significantly to the society, economy and environment. Worldwide suitable seaweeds farming areas cover approximately 48 million km2  across 132 countries, although about 37–44 countries are active in production with only 0.001% of suitable area [20] . Seaweeds farming is one of the fast-growing sectors in the world with an annual production of ~32.4 million tonnes (wet weight) in 2018 valued at US$ 11.8 billion, which is expected to rise US$ 22.13 billion by 2024 [13,18,22] . Compare to land-based crop production using expensive fertilizers and harmful pesticides, seaweeds extract nutrients from the water, purify surrounding water and maintain ecosystem health, thereby sustaining a viable habitat for marine organisms [24] . For instance, seaweeds aquaculture in China annually removes about 75,000 tons of nitrogen and 9500 tons of phosphorus that can significantly mitigate coastal eutrophication [68] . Seaweeds remove organic pollutants, heavy metals and pathogens [38] , and thus used for cleaning the environment [52]  and bioremediation [33] . Moreover, the symbiotic system of seaweeds and bacteria constitutes an ecological basis for natural treatment of running waters [32] . Additionally, seaweeds are characterized by a rapid increase in biomass and contributes to climate change adaptation by protecting seashore from erosion, elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the aquatic ecosystem, and thus locally reducing ocean acidification and deoxygenation effects [12,15,19,34] . The use of seaweeds as carbon dioxide scavengers contributes mitigation of atmospheric CO2  and in turn, reducing the effect of global greenhouse [20,35,51] . The book entitled “the blue economy: 10 years, 100 innovations, 100 million jobs” was the first proposal on blue economy formulation [41]  and the concept came out of the Rio+ 20 conference in 2012 that focused on sustainable development including ocean-based economies [56] . The term ‘blue economy’ is analogous to ‘green economy’ [40] , where ‘ocean economy’ is used by some circles such as in the European Union [21] . The blue economy principles are widely accepted [57,62,67] , though definitions can be varied [21,25,62] . According to Hossain et al. [25] , blue economy utilizes ocean resources for increasing food security, improving nutrition and health, alleviating poverty, creating new jobs, generating alternative energy, lifting seaborne trade and industrial profiles by protecting ecosystem health and biodiversity. The vision of blue economy reflects economic development and ocean health as compatible propositions [65] . Winder and Dix [63]  mentioned that blue economy proposes trading the environment that allows the mobilization of environments for economic purposes. Blue economy voices low carbon with resource efficiency, which offers diversified opportunities for sustainable, clean and equitable progress in traditional and emerging sectors [56] . The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals has been set for a better world by 2030 that backed up by 169 targets and 231 unique indicators [54,55] . SDGs include economic, social and ecological aspects, where development are seen as separate parts. However, the ‘wedding cake’ model focused a new way of looking at SDGs, i.e. food originates from the biosphere/environment and consumed by the society that involves partnership to run the economy [40,45] . The global human population is expected to reach 10.9 billion by 2100 [58]  that will increase pressure on the food production sectors to meet the additional demand of food and nutrition in a changing environmental condition. Seaweeds have been consumed for centuries in many societies, but the recent versatile applications in industries including food, feed, biofuel, chemical, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics as well as environmental bioremediation have helped increase global seaweeds production [8,48] . Accordingly, seaweeds farming can play a pivotal role to overcome the anticipated challenges of food scarcity for the everincreasing world population. In this context, developing seaweeds aquaculture for diverse uses require adequate knowledge concerning the possible challenges and opportunities involved in setting up a production unit and market chain. Therefore, seaweeds farming requires consideration of social, economic, cultural, political and environmental viability to promote the activity for generating employment, income and food sustainably [43] . The expansion of coastal and marine aquaculture can increase seafood production towards the sustainable blue economic development in Bangladesh [1] . Hence, the Government of Bangladesh is actively pursuing the blue economy agenda [49,64] . Bangladesh has 24,077 km2  coastal waters within 0–10 m depth [10]  that may be suitable for seaweeds production to achieve socioeconomic benefits. The objective of this study is to understand seaweeds production and its potentials role in achieving sustainable development goals and blue economic development in Bangladesh.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The study was carried out in the coastal zone of Bangladesh ( Fig. 1 ) that extends over 47,000 km2  land area [5] . The geographical location and climatic condition made this coastal zone as one of the commercially active places. The area is subjected to a multitude of uses including navigation and communication, fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and recreation, provision of mineral and energy resources, infrastructure and habitation [25] . The coastal zone features a tropical climate and is largely affected by the southwest monsoon (April–October), with winds from southwestern direction and the northeast monsoon (November–March), with winds from the northeast direction [11] .  2.2 Data collection and analyses The research team reviewed the relevant literature including journal articles, government reports, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data/records and academic research to identify detailed aspects of seaweeds production related to SDGs targets and blue economy in Bangladesh. Data were collected, both in quantitative and qualitative forms, through questionnaire survey, focus group discussion (FGD), key informants interview (KII), information exchange meeting (IEM), participatory field investigation and consultation workshop [16,29] . The data were collected from 11 coastal sites of Bangladesh (Fig. 1 ). Following Voyer et al. [60] , a number of unstructured interviews were used where common questions were asked about the respondent’s opinion about the contribution of seaweeds to the local community and environment. In general, people in the coastal villages are poor, marginalized and highly dependent on coastal natural resources for their livelihoods [27] .  Table 1  summarizes the number of participants engaged in survey activities and workshops by gender. The questionnaire survey was conducted among the stakeholders and beneficiaries including academia, researcher, government official, extension manager, NGOs, entrepreneur, farmer, processor and trader. The questionnaire included a set of closed- and open-ended questions associated to each topic following Mariño et al. [36] . The questionnaire had multiple parts focusing present status, challenges, value addition and future expansions of seaweeds farming in Bangladesh (Supplementary Table S1 ). For example, questionnaires on the present status of seaweeds assessed abundant and cultivable seaweeds species, their culture methods and production, processing techniques; and questionnaires on future expansions of seaweeds examined potential interventions along with their affects to ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, local economic growth, community resilience, and overall contribution to SDGs and the blue economy. The qualitative interviews supplemented these findings, particularly in SDGs that were difficult to quantify, as well as providing comprehensive information on the contribution of seaweeds. In this study, the discussion of results was focused on seaweeds production and its role on SDGs and the blue economy. KII was conducted one-on-one interviews with a variety of stakeholders including beneficiary leaders, farmer heads, health workers, youth club and women activist’s representatives. IEM was convened with key organizations including government departments, research organizations, NGOs and development partners to obtain additional background on seaweeds activities as followed by Dutton et al. [16] . Following Nor et al. [39] , FGD was conducted with specific beneficiary groups (6–10 people group balanced by gender and age) to enable open discussion to gather semi-structured qualitative data. These sessions were encouraged free-flowing discussion about seaweeds production and importance. Informal meetings and observations were conducted (30–60 min) to obtain relevant insights into the different issues affecting community livelihoods. The social interviews were not designed to be statistically representative but rather tried to cover the broader insights of seaweeds beneficiaries from a diverse range of involvements, genders and types of trading. The research team visited seaweeds farming areas, farmer’s house and local markets and spent 4 weeks with the respondents to develop a sense of intimacy and trust, and especially to learn about beneficiary’s customs and attitudes. Field observations and participation with the farmers for seedling on-rope, on-field surveillance, homestead drying and selling at local market were the most useful and meaningful way to know the production and marketing of seaweeds, and to know about beneficiaries livelihoods, work practices, vulnerabilities and their indigenous knowledge in a social setting [14,26] . Field notes were taken [2]  to acquire social knowledge. The team revisited key informants and resource persons (e.g. academia, researchers, entrepreneurs and community leaders) to validate information obtained. Three workshops (i.e. inception, local level validation, and national level validation) were also arranged involving wider stakeholders of government agencies, academia, researcher, NGOs, development partners, entrepreneurs and beneficiaries. The study methodology, questionnaire and work plan were shared in the inception workshop (held on 9 February 2020) for suggestions and remarks from the experts that helped to finalize the questionnaire before field data collection. The findings were shared among local beneficiaries in the first validation workshop on 14 June 2020 to confirm the findings and emphasized stakeholder’s voice as a major strength for potential interventions of seaweed production for improving community livelihoods and employment opportunities. Consequently, thoughts of national, regional and global experts’ were exemplified in the wider level validation workshop on 29 June 2020 and discussed potential opportunities of seaweed farming to leverage in food security, community resilience, climate change adaptation and blue economic development in Bangladesh. Seaweeds production in 2020 was extrapolated to 2050 by assuming (a) most increasing phase 2021–2030, (b) moderate increasing phase 2031–2040 and (c) least increasing phase 2041–2050, similar scenario was explained by the World Bank Group [66] . The most increasing phase of seaweeds is considered double production in every successive year, while production increase half of the previous year represents the moderate increasing phase and the least increasing phase denotes one-fourth proliferation of the previous year, although FAO [18]  reported global seaweed production more than tripled, from 10.6 million tonnes in 2000–32.4 million tonnes in 2018. For instance, seaweed farming increased in Indonesia from less than 4 million tonnes in 2010 to over 11 million tonnes in 2015 [18] . The present study assumes annual average productivity of 10 kg per m2  dry seaweeds given that appropriate culture technique and necessary farm management skills are ensured. However, daily growth rate for Hypnea  sp. was reported 1.06 cm [69]  and 3.2% with biomass yield 3.8 kg/m2 [30] , while Hossain et al. [28]  reported daily growth rate 6% (annual productivity ~ 5 kg dry seaweeds per m2 ) in the coastal waters of Bangladesh. The dry-matter composition of seaweeds ranged from 12% to 13% protein and 2–3% lipid [31]  and 50–70% carbohydrate [61] . Sugar released over 30% by hydrolysis of dry seaweeds and 0.41 g ethanol/g total sugars produced [61] . Seaweeds biomass contained 30–39% carbon and 2–3% nitrogen [46]  and 0.3% phosphorous [44] . Assuming an average composition of the constituents for further estimation. Taking an average of two employments (i.e. direct and indirect) for 10 tons dry seaweeds production and distribution [66] . Thus, the quantity of seaweeds in 2050 could be extrapolated by using the present value (PV) theory of the compound interest rule as suggested by Mishkin [37] , Pournara [42]  and Carrasa et al. [9] . The compound interest of k periods and (1 +r)k  are focused in evolutionary ecology through (1 + r /k )k  (where r  is the interest rate and k  is the amount of deposit interest added to the principal), which is more relevant to individual growth [23] . The compound factor model considers present growth rate and predicts future value such as,(1) Q F V  n   = Q P V  2020   ( 1 + r )  n       Here, QFV n   = Quantity of seaweed production in period n (i.e. 2050), QPV 2020   = Quantity of seaweed production in 2020, r = growth rate of seaweed production, n = number of years, and (1 +r) is the compound factor. By adopting Eq. (1)  for extrapolating the production of seaweeds with 3 different increasing rates from 2020 to 2050, the compound term stands;(2) F V  2030   = P V  2020   ( 1 + r  1   )  10    w h e n  m o s t  i n c r e a  sin  g  p h a s e  o f  p r o d u c t i o n  r a t e     (3) F V  2040   = F V  2030   ( 1 + r  2   )  10    w h e n  mod  e r a t e  i n c r e a  sin  g  p h a s e  o f  p r o d u c t i o n  r a t e     (4) F V  2050   = F V  2040   ( 1 + r  3   )  10    w h e n  l e a s t  i n c r e a  sin  g  p h a s e  o f  p r o d u c t i o n  r a t e      Thus, incorporating all three phases (i.e. Eqs. (2)–(4) ), the output at the year 2050 stands,(5)  F V  2050   = F V  2040   ( 1 + r  3   )  10   = F V  2030   ( 1 + r  2   )  10   ( 1 + r  3   )  10      = P V  2020   ( 1 + r  1   )  10   ( 1 + r  2   )  10   ( 1 + r  3   )  10          Here, PV  2020     indicates seaweeds production in 2020. Following the documentation of seaweeds contribution, the ideas of respondents were subsequently checked with SDGs targets. The open-ended questions were coded as suggested by Bryman [7] . The quantitative data obtained from the surveys were processed and analyzed as descriptive statistics using Microsoft Excel. ArcGIS was used to prepare the coastal environment map of Bangladesh with bathymetry and data collection sites. Adobe Illustrator was used to develop necessary figures and illustrations of the manuscript.   3 Results 3.1 Seaweeds production Approximately 250 species of seaweeds are found in Bangladesh. The present study had identified 32 species of seaweeds, of which 8 species belong to the phylum Chlorophyta, 12 to Ochrophyta and 12 to Rhodophyta are abundant in the coastal waters of Bangladesh (Supplementary Table S2 ). There are 14 potentially cultivable species belonging to Chlorophyta (4 species) and Rhodophyta (10 species) (Supplementary Table S3 ). Among those Gracilaria  and Ulva  species adapted well in the coastal brackishwater environments of Nuniarchara, Bakhkhali estuary and Moheshkhali channel at Cox’s Bazar. The months of November-April are favorable for seaweeds farming, while the other months are unfavorable due to high-energy conditions along the coasts, precipitation, upstream runoff, sedimentation and suboptimum water quality. The farmers collect seeds (i.e. thalli of seaweeds) from the nearby natural habitats. About 50 g seeds are placed after 25 cm intervals in 30 m long twisted rope to maintain the density of 120 plants (= 6 kg seeds) per rope. Poles are made of wood or bamboo with a length of 1.5 m and placed at 1 m intervals to demarcate and hold the ropes. Seaweed attached in ropes are tied up with poles during low tides to keep them submerged, 50–100 cm below the surface water at high tide ( Fig. 2 ). A farmer in Cox’s Bazar coast can manage 10 ropes of 30 m each. Average daily growth rate of seaweeds was 6% producing 1.08 kg of biomass m−1  per month. The farmers are able to run 4–6 production cycles in favorable season. Seaweeds are harvested every 4–6 weeks intervals depending on the growth of biomass. A farmer can harvest ~1300 kg (wet weight) of seaweeds in a season. Therefore, 300 farmers can produce 390 tonnes of seaweeds annually equalling to 97.5 tonnes dry weight from the coasts of Bangladesh ( Table 2 ). The farmed species include Gracilaria tenuistipitata , Ulva intestinalis , Ulva lactuca  and Hypnea musciformis . After harvesting, seaweeds are sun-dried in open areas, while air drying are done in homestead premises during cloudy or rainy weather. On a limited scale solar dryer is used following proper hygienic and sanitation measures. The solar dryer reduces impurities and maintains quality that fetch a better price of seaweeds. Depending on sunshine hours and weather condition, the duration of sun drying is 2–3 days to keep moisture content within 20–30%. The dryer keeps different seaweeds (e.g. Gracilaria , Ulva , Hypnea ) separately so that the best price for each type can be ensured.  3.2 Extrapolation of seaweeds production for 2050 Globally, there is a positive production trend of seaweeds resulting from their diversified utilization patterns. Thus, extrapolation of present production with a growth rate of double, half and one-fourth in every successive year can produce over 50 million tonnes dry weight by 2050 using about 5000 km2  ocean’s surface area that equals approximately 20% of the coastal waters of Bangladesh. Thus, establishment of seaweed seed bank is necessary for propagation of seaweeds through tissue culture. This will ensure high quality and uniform propagules from selected parental lines with higher yields. The increased production can contribute about 25% of food to the coastal community, 5 million tonnes of protein, 1.5 million tonnes of oil and 125 million megawatt-hours of bioenergy. Moreover, the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous, and carbon sequestration from the environment can be 1 million ton, 0.1 million tonnes and 15 million tonnes, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). Potential direct and indirect employment of 100,000 jobs could be created. Thus, seaweeds production could represent a transformational changes in the food, feed and energy security equations.  3.3 Contribution of seaweeds in SDGs The respondents focused on multiple benefits of seaweeds farming related to environment, employment, food security, gender equality and economic growth. Thus, seaweeds farming play a key role in UN SDGs by addressing 26 targets and 8 goals (Supplementary Table S4 ). Investment in eco-friendly seaweeds farming can ensure access of poor and vulnerable people to productive resources, women’s participation in food production and consumption, self-entrepreneurship in decent job creation for women and men, local economic growth, and resilience of coastal poor and vulnerable community, which are included in SDG 1: No poverty (e.g. targets 1.4, 1.5), SDG 5: Gender equality (e.g. targets 5.1, 5.5) and SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth (e.g. targets 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5). Seaweeds can be integrated in a multi-trophic production model (e.g. fish, mollusc and seaweeds) without using pesticides and fertilizers to achieve SDG 2: Zero hunger (e.g. targets 2.1, 2.2) and SDG 17: Partnerships (e.g. target 17.7). In addition, seaweeds encourage capacity-building of local community and institutions, public-private and civil society partnerships, as well as contribute to gross domestic product of the country towards SDG 17 (e.g. targets 17.9, 17.17, 17.19) and SDG 13: Climate action (e.g. targets 13.2, 13.3). Beyond food production, seaweeds farming can promote efficient use of marine natural resources, combat carbon sequestration and ocean acidification, reduce nutrients pollution of coastal water, restoration of ecosystem health and biodiversity enhancement, and reduce fishing efforts through time-sharing of fishers in seaweeds farming to achieve progress towards SDG 12: Sustainable consumption and production (e.g. targets 12.2, 12.8), and SDG 14: Life below water (e.g. targets 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.7). These contributions of seaweeds reflect on 26 targets of SDGs (i.e. total 169 targets) in eradicating food insecurity and contributing to the other targets of SDGs. Among the respondents of academia, researcher, government official, extension manager, NGOs, and entrepreneur, 16% believe that seaweeds contribute in SDG 1 (i.e. No poverty), followed by 15% in SDG 2 (i.e. Zero hunger) ( Fig. 4 ). Other SDGs such as Life below water (i.e. SDG 14), Sustainable consumption and production (i.e. SDG 12), Climate action (i.e. SDG 13), Gender equality (i.e. SDG 5), Decent work and economic growth (i.e. SDG 8) and Partnerships for the goals (i.e. SDG 17) were weighed 14%, 13%, 12%, 12%, 11% and 7%, respectively. Among the respondents, 34% believe that seaweeds play a vital role in carbon sequestration accounting 29.25 tonnes C year−1  through the production of 390 tonnes seaweeds (= 97.5 tonnes dry weight; 30% carbon in dry seaweeds) in Bangladesh (Table 2 ). Similarly, 32% respondents considered that seaweeds farming can improve the ecosystem health, while 30% responded suggested that it can ensure the food and nutrition security of the coastal people ( Fig. 5 ). Moreover, respondents believe that seaweeds farming has an indirect role to protect seashore against coastal erosion by damping wave energy and can provide alternative income generating option for the underprivileged coastal community. Seaweeds serve as the base of marine food webs and are a direct food source for fishes, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, crustaceans and molluscs as noted during field observations. Though spatial extent of natural seaweeds bed needs to determine, the respondent perceived that seaweeds support a range of local biodiversity including fishes, shrimps, crabs and lobsters in the shallow coastal waters. Moreover, 30% respondents believe that seaweeds function as spawning ground for many fish and invertebrates, whereas 28%, 25% and 18% respondents considered seaweeds as nursery ground, feeding ground and shelter zone for many marine lives ( Fig. 6 ). Thus, it is necessary to conserve and restore seaweeds ecosystem in the nearshore waters for the conservation of biodiversity, ultimately promoting marine fisheries resources that can enhance food security, employment opportunity and resilience of the dependent coastal fishing communities.  3.4 Contribution to the blue economy The cost involved in seaweeds farming depends on farming techniques and size of facilities. Capital investment to establish seaweed farm includes pole, rope, weight, float, seed and labour ( Table 3 ). Farmers also need to invest in procuring different accessories such as plastic buckets, plastic crates, knifes, scales and drying facilities that are essential to operate and manage the farm. Economic value of seaweeds starts from the farm gate to the potential end-users for human food, feed and manure, biofuel, cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors that eventually leverage the blue economic development in Bangladesh ( Fig. 7 ). Farm gate price of 390 tonnes fresh seaweeds at Tk 60 per kg can fetch Tk 23.4 million, while the price of dried seaweeds varied depending on utilization patterns. For example, dried seaweeds for food and feed formulation sold at Tk 300 per kg, while the price increased to Tk 1000 for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals uses. However, drying in solar dryer by ensuring quality, cleanliness and vacuum packaging is necessary for a higher price. Seaweeds demand for human consumption were ranked by 49% respondents, followed by the pharmaceutical industry with 25%. Seaweed demand in the cosmetic industry and animal feed formulation was rated 13% and 12%, respectively, by the respondents. The estimated amount of seaweeds utilization in food, feed and manure, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals sectors are 47,775 kg, 11,700 kg, 13,650 kg and 24,375 kg, respectively, which could potentially contribute US$666,667 (Tk 55.87 million) to the blue economy. The initiative of seaweeds-based biofuel production is not visible in the country till now.   4 Discussion Seaweeds farming is producing 390 tonnes biomass (wet weight) from the coastal waters of Bangladesh, equaling to 97.5 tonnes dry weight. Sarker [47]  reported annual harvesting of about 1500 tonnes seaweeds from their main natural habitat located in the St. Martin’s Island. Although, wild harvest of seaweeds have been prohibited from the St. Martin’s Island by the declaration of Ecologically Critical Area in 1999 under the Environmental Conservation Act intended for ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation. Several seaweeds species including Gracilaria tenuistipitata , Ulva intestinalis , Ulva lactuca  and Hypnea musciformis  are farmed in Bangladesh for human consumption, yet in far smaller amounts. In contrary, global aquaculture production of seaweeds reached 32.4 million tonnes (wet weight) in 2018 that equal about 5 million tonnes dry weight with a yearly growth rate of 9% [18] . Globally there are over 15,000 species of seaweeds, of which 34 species are suitable for aquaculture [17] , 145 species for human consumption and 101 for hydrocolloids extraction [53,70] . Among the countries with suitable seaweed farming areas, 77 countries have constraint of acidic waters, 27 report hypoxic and eutrophic waters, while multiple constraints of eutrophic, hypoxic and acidic waters in 24 countries [20] . Seaweeds can mitigate the stresses and improve water quality by increasing oxygen content and reducing nutrient loads [3,6,8] . Seaweeds along with coral reefs are the dominant benthic organisms whose relative abundance is often used as an indicator of ecosystem health [4] . Extrapolation of seaweeds production with growth rate of double, half and one-fourth in every successive year can produce over 50 million tonnes seaweeds (dry weight) by 2050 from ~5000 km2  farming area in Bangladesh. The current consumption trends of the ever-increasing population at national and global levels indicate the necessity to produce more food by 2050, though facing the challenges of increasing droughts, floods, disease outbreaks and poor soil fertility. Thus, ocean ecosystem can be the alternative source of future food supply. In Bangladesh, achieving UN SDGs has become an integral part of the strategy that outlines necessary programs, policies and measurable indicators for sustainable development [50] . Thus, seaweeds production can play a significant role in the present efforts to catalyze sustainable development in the country. It can be argued that substantial employment generation (especially for the women) can play an important role in ongoing efforts to meet SDG 2, 5 and 8. However, such employment trade-offs need further investigation at local level for better understanding the outcomes of seaweed interventions in meeting the progress of SDGs. Moreover, seaweeds farming, processing and value-added products development can have important interactions with several SDGs including SDG 12, 13 and 14. Further studies need to explore specific interface between SDGs with underlying targets and indicators to clarify whether, how and to what extent seaweeds farming can catalyze sustainable development in Bangladesh. However, seaweed farmers need input supports that can help them to scale up their farming operations into a considerable size to sustain with production cost. For instance, an Indonesian farmer tending 10,000 m of lines with an average annual productivity of 1.10 kg/m of line and produce 33,000 kg of dry seaweeds per year [59] . Assuming a selling price of USD 0.85/kg and a production cost of USD 0.27/kg, that farmer attains an income level (net returns to operator’s labour and management) of USD 19,140, which far exceeds the per capita GDP in the country (estimated at USD 4144 in 2009). In contrast, a farmer in Bangladesh coast managing 10 lines, each having 30 m rope (i.e. 10 × 30 m rope) with an average daily growth rate 6% (production period 4 months in a year) and produces 1300 kg of seaweeds per year. Assuming a selling price of USD 1/kg and a production cost of USD 0.10/kg, that farmer can generate only USD 1170, which falls short of the 2020 per capita GDP of US$ 5453 (as per 2020 estimated for nominal). Assuming the similar cost rate discussed in Table 2 , the farmer of Bangladesh could generate an income level of USD 5850 (i.e. GDP and production costs), if the farmer use 50 lines instead of 10 lines for culture plots. Seaweeds farming in Bangladesh is in a rudimentary stage, therefore, such an increase in production levels would require substantial improvements in farm management and technological skills.
