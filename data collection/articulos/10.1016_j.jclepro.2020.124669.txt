                  Rapid urbanization, exponentially growing human count and industrial expansion has made it problematic to manage the municipal solid wastes throughout the globe. In developing countries like India, decentralized waste management systems have induced difficult scenario. The total solid wastes generated in the country, due to various cultural, social and religious activities, are about 40%–50%organic in nature and contributing in the environmental pollution (air, water and soil) as well as human health troubles. It is also significant to manage the organic flower waste, as it is being discarded after single use in many religious rituals, social celebrations etc. and amounts to approximately 4.74 × 106 t/d, in the country. Flower waste can be managed by converting it into consumable herbal products such as incense sticks, perfumes, interior decorative items, natural colors for cotton & silk products, composts, bio-gas etc. Some researchers have developed ecofriendly bio-sorbents to remove toxic dyes and heavy metals (using flower petals) from the aqueous solutions. In addition, properly managed disposal of floral waste will help in reduction of the environmental pollution as well as in achieving about 60% sustainable development goals suggested by United Nations.

Handling Editor: Prof. Jiri Jaromir Klemeš Rapid urbanization, exponentially growing human count and industrial expansion has made it problematic to manage the municipal solid wastes throughout the globe. In developing countries like India, decentralized waste management systems have induced difficult scenario. The total solid wastes generated in the country, due to various cultural, social and religious activities, are about 40%–50%organic in nature and contributing in the environmental pollution (air, water and soil) as well as human health troubles. It is also significant to manage the organic flower waste, as it is being discarded after single use in many religious rituals, social celebrations etc. and amounts to approximately 4.74 × 106  t/d, in the country. Flower waste can be managed by converting it into consumable herbal products such as incense sticks, perfumes, interior decorative items, natural colors for cotton & silk products, composts, bio-gas etc. Some researchers have developed ecofriendly bio-sorbents to remove toxic dyes and heavy metals (using flower petals) from the aqueous solutions. In addition, properly managed disposal of floral waste will help in reduction of the environmental pollution as well as in achieving about 60% sustainable development goals suggested by United Nations.

Improper waste management practices have contaminated the environmental systems along with adverse effects on the living creatures (including humans) and also causes economical crisis (Ferronato and Torretta, 2019 ). Hence, its management has become a global concern. Generally, solid wastes can be divided into five main categories such as MSW, debris from construction and demolition, electrical waste, sludge and food waste. This challenge of increasing MSW magnitude seems to be inevitable as it is a byproduct of human activities which is growing alarmingly faster rate than that of urbanization (Paul et al., 2019 ). To make it more clear we can consider an example of the food waste that globally consumes of more than 1/4th of the total freshwater and about 0.3 × 109  barrels of oil annually (Pirani and Arafat, 2014 ). According to the FAO (2020) , each EU citizen generates approximately 280 kgs of food waste annually. Of this, about 34% is generated by households and rest in the processes involved from production to retail. Thus, the large contribution to the food waste is from households. According to earlier studies, the fraction of food waste in Sweden is about 38% (Schott and Andersson, 2015) while in Brazil it is found to be within 50–70% (Mahler et al., 2002 ), in case of Denmark and Turkey its ranges from 41% to 43% (Schott and Andersson, 2015). Since past few decades, not only the heavy metals present in MSW (Long et al., 2011 ), is managed but also global efforts were made to manage the electrical waste (Cui and Zhang 2008 ) and sludge (Pathak et al., 2009 ). Moreover, due to inappropriate methods of waste management, most of the people are not benefited by complete decentralized management systems as observed in developed countries. Regardless of all the restrictions, reasonable estimation of the potential of waste materials for energy recovery in association with Municipal Waste Management can be considered (Iyer, 2016 ). In MSW, even due to major fraction of recyclable material, either incineration or illegal dumping is in practice due to limited land availability for new landfill constructions (Hasan et al., 2019 ). Therefore, it is demand of time to develop some appropriate strategies by inviting all the stakeholders responsible for waste management. Now days many developing countries are putting in their best efforts to improve their solid waste management systems (Yang et al., 2012 ). But, due to varying nature, it is hard to manage the solid wastes for developing nations like the 2nd most populous nation, India (Waghmode et al., 2016 ). An annual growth rate of waste generation, in India, is about 5%, where each person contributes less than 2% in this growth (Ghatak 2016 ). Fig. 1   shows the possible stakeholders in India which could lead in the proper waste management efforts. The root cause for massive solid waste generation is the high growth rate of population as well as various industrial and agricultural processes and is growing as at an alarming rate i.e. about 1.34 × 105  t/d, in India (Yadav and Garg 2011 ). In most of the countries, solid wastes are being dumped into the landfill sites. However, this will lead the risks of economical loss along with environmental pollution (Azevedo et al., 2020 ). Further, pulp and paper industries also generate waste materials in the form of sludge (35% waste) which can be categorized as primary, secondary or tertiary based the presence of contamination and their treatment (Azevedo et al., 2018 ). Apart from some other constituents it contains kaolin and cellulose in significant proportions (Azevedo et al., 2018 ). Sludge wastes of pulp and paper industry can be utilized into mortars for construction purpose and therefore, it gives a way of environmental sustainability through the recycling of wastes (Azevedo et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, recycling of the industrial wastes is considered as good for the industries itself to achieve the norms of safe environment prescribed by the government authorities. Moreover, some of the industrial waste like sludge of pulp and paper waste can be used in the development of building materials (Azevedo et al., 2019 ). These types of recycling practices of the waste materials are necessary for the safety of environment as well as the public health. Primary organic waste generation is from food, excreta of living beings, flower, sewage, leaf, paper and agriculture. Such wastes are incinerated or discarded on open land that adversely affects the soil, air and water bodies and results in health disorders of living being (Ansari et al., 2019 ). In the findings of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India, it has been observed that the developing countries have about 40% of organic waste in its MSWs and if are abandoned on the open land, specific green house gas i.e. methane will be released from these and will also account for the microbial contamination of aquatic environment (Gupta and Garg, 2017 ). Moreover, a wide gap can be observed between the waste management systems of developing and developed countries, e.g. China, the major developing country, has a long way to go to deal with its waste in terms of its process of recycle as well as its technological and strategically managed treatment, in comparison to developed nations like The USA, Germany, Japan and Sweden (Yuan et al., 2006). In future, even Beijing City will require some integrated, realistic and scientific-environmental assessment based waste management alternatives (Huang et al., 2007 ). In India, about 70–80% solid waste is organic waste due to variation in eating habits as well as cultural, social and religious activities. Moreover, diversified range of the wastes produced; need particular ways of disposal and handling (Gupta et al., 2015 ). One of the considerable fraction of solid wastes are flowers, which have been discarded after single use from the various places like religious premises (temples, gurudwaras, churches ), banquets, marriage halls, societal celebrations, hotels etc. can also be a valuable organic waste material. It has been observed that the countries like Kenya and China are converting floral waste into compost, while in USA and Europe organic wastes are being incinerated that contributes in air pollution (Waghmode et al., 2016 ). Open dumping of flower waste (or any kind of organic waste) can cause many environmental problems, as its decomposition will promote the genesis of pathogens. On other side, its proper management can produce many helpful resources such as biochar, fragrance, compost, natural colors etc. and will also reduce the pressure on the environment. However, at global level, flower waste management has not been addressed properly by the researchers and so limited research literature is available for the purpose of effective floral waste management. Hence, extensive research is the need of time to deal with the opportunities and challenges to implement the sustainable management of floral waste, in various regions of the world and India as well. With this objective, this is being presented to the scientific community for the extraction of valuable products from the floral waste.  2 Composition of municipal solid waste Organic waste (fruits, flowers, vegetable, kitchen waste, tree leaves) is largest contributor (about 70%) of MSW (Potdar et al., 2016 ). Also, Biswas et al. (2015)  observed that MSW contains considerable amount of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose ranged from 3 to 28%, 5–22% and 21–64%, respectively. Further, some valuable products like bio fuel, biogas, biodiesel, glycerol, methanol and compost can be generated from lignocellulosic biomass like MSW, food waste, kitchen waste and floral waste. Boldrin et al. (2011)  reported that in Denmark, non toxic categories of MSW like organic garden waste (grass clippings, wood, branches and flowers) and inorganic garden waste have very less portion in comparison to others. To improve the outline of environment of the garden waste management, incineration of wood is a nice practice. Even from environmental point of view and to increase its composting capacity, it is suitable to incinerate 35% and compost 18% of the waste generated from garden (Boldrin and Christensen, 2010 ). Moreover, energy derivation is another good alternate to consume organic waste by adopting scientific concepts like biomethanation, incineration etc. (Arena 2012 ). Further, Alwaeli (2015)  presented solid management system in Poland. In his study, it was observed that Poland was not having better waste management system as compared to other European countries. In 2014, only 84% of total waste was collected in Poland and out of which 53% was dumped in to land fill and only 7% was used to produce energy. 11% waste was organic in nature and the MSW generation rate was 293 kg/capita in one year. Recycling of paper, plastics, glass and metallic wastes (∼37%) are common in Poland. In Developing countries, according to Mohee and Bundhoo (2015) , ∼57.8% of total wastes materials are in biodegradable nature and 28.7% are reusable wastes including glass, paper, cardboard, metals etc. However, in developed countries reusable wastes are 49.4% followed by organic wastes (34%). Similarly, Kumar and Samadder (2017)  gave an average estimate of organic waste production in developed and developing countries. Organic waste production rate of developed countries were 28% and in developing nations it was 64%. In case of Ghana (a developing country), Asase et al. (2009)  found that financial crisis, lack of strict laws, poor public attitudes, lack of environmental education among the community, lack of technical resources or infrastructure are the major obstacles of effective solid waste management in the developing nations. Owolabi et al. (2016)  stated that waste management in developing countries including Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Philippines is being carried out by the municipal corporations. Alwaeli (2015)  and Mohee and Bundhoo (2015)  reported waste generation rate of many developed countries such as Australia (2.23 kg/capita/day), Poland (0.8 kg/capita/day), Germany & Ireland (1.22–1.91 kg/capita/day), Italy, France & Austria (1.36–1.64 kg/capita/day), United Kingdom (1.26–1.64 kg/capita/day). Similarly, Pujara et al. (2019)  mentioned that the rate of waste generation in India is 0.5 kg/capita/day. A huge gap can be observed in the waste generation rate of developed countries and developing countries. Developed countries have managed their wastes very well by adopting advance technologies and scientific concepts. Also, they do not have financial constraints for investment in this area. However, developing countries have several challenges in to carry out proper waste management which includes money, lack of awareness and improper planning as well as ineffective practices of collection, transport, recycling, processing etc. (Owolabi et al., 2016 ). Indian wastes have 60% organic waste contents and rests 40% are non-biodegradable in nature and about 40% wastes are being dumped in landfill sites. Roughly, 20% proportions of wastes are used for composting and biogas generation. Both, Refused Derived Fuel and Material Recovery facility are in practice for 20% of the total Indian wastes (Pujara et al., 2019 ). Alwaeli (2015)  identified major challenges of effective solid waste management including proper segregation at source and efficient collection of the MSW. Organic wastes should go for composting along with maximum recycling of waste materials. Owing to toxic gaseous release (including green house gases) in energy production from the wastes, public protest is a significant obstacle to make it fully operational (Zhao et al., 2016 ). Four major challenges of solid waste management were identified as need of huge finance, lack of appropriate technologies, improper education and inappropriate policies (ADB, 2011 ). In addition to these, in developing countries, inefficient leadership, improper collection of the wastes, lack of knowledge about the drawbacks of waste mismanagement, deficiency of recycling schemes etc. are very common (Owolabi et al., 2016 ). However, in developed countries these things are very strong and most importantly citizens of developed countries are aware about their responsibilities towards environmental protection. Narayana (2009)  reported that Indian wastes (also other developing countries) has low calorific value, therefore, combustion of the wastes cannot be economical. Moreover, it generates lots of toxic gases in the atmosphere which will reduce the air quality index at the particular place of installation. Hence, these issues should be resolved before using or installing the waste management facilities.  3 Environmental problems due to inappropriate waste disposal Polluted ground water and soil are the challenging problems throughout world where the sites of approximately 494 × 106  acres have been polluted by the presence of heavy metal and about 123 × 106  such sites require adequate and rapid remediation (Wuana and Okieimen, 2011 ). Poor construction and unregulated landfills of MSW have become a big source of pollution (Ye et al., 2019 ). It can be well understood by Fig. 2   depicting the health as well as environmental problems due to unmanaged disposal of MSW. Incineration should not be a preferred technique for the waste materials as it may emit several types of toxic gases as described by Zhao et al. (2011)  during the burning process implemented for MSW in Beijing city (Fig. 3  ). Similarly, improper disposal of floral waste, mostly dumped open, causes serious threat to the environment as it decreases recreational efficiency of water bodies and also being nutrient rich and created discharge, it contaminate soil (Singh et al., 2013 ). The problem of floral disposal in several pilgrimage sites and cities like Varanasi, India is troublesome. A firm action is required to properly implement the floral waste management systems, in such regions (Singh et al., 2018 ). In India, the flowers, after religious or decoration use, are discarded either in water bodies or dumped openly, which ultimately pollute the environment. Composting is the best alternate to manage flower waste but it has been observed that food waste and related categories have been studied by many researchers, while composting studies of floral waste has drawn the attention of only few researchers. Keeping the increasing floral waste and its environmental affects in view, it is necessary to conduct the related composting studies (Sharma et al., 2018b ). Liu et al. (2018)  observed that landfill sites are significant contributor of the environmental pollution because of their unscientific designs and the decomposition process of municipal solid waste in these unregulated waste landfill sites may promote the growth of vectors and pathogens. Leachate generation, one the most common problems of landfill sites, will contaminate the water and atmosphere along with adjacent soils due to possible presence of toxic elements (including heavy metals) in the waste materials. According to Ye et al. (2019) , presence of these toxicants in our surrounding environment may pose severe risks to human health (sometimes even carcinogenic, leukemic, or premature birth), farming products and to the various aquatic & terrestrial ecosystems after prolonged exposure. In further sections, various scientific approaches, to extract many value added products, have been discussed.  4 Floral waste management Pujara et al. (2019)  reported a generalized framework which can be used to manage the solid wastes effectively as shown in Fig. 4  . This method could be helpful to extract many products like composts, energy etc. from the municipal waste materials through integrated solid waste management practices. Therefore, it can be seen that organic wastes are useful to derive energy and organic manures. However, floral waste has more scope of extracting many valuable products as discussed in following sections. In comparison to other wastes, floral waste saves the time and cost as it does not require segregation and can be collected separately from its source of generation i.e. religious places (e.g. temple, gurudwara , mosque and church), religious/wedding ceremonies and regions of festivals. Approximately 300 tons of flower waste are being collected in India daily (Sharma and Yadav 2017 ). In India, among large portions of the flowers, which are discarded improperly at many religious places, banquet halls or any other celebrations, include marigold, roses, carnations etc. (Waghmode et al., 2016 ). About 8 × 106  tons of flowers annually, that are being offered in temples, are dumped in rivers (due to its holy consideration) or in open landfills, causing a threat to the environment. The algal growth promoted by the organic content of decaying flowers is risky to watery organisms as it reduces the oxygen level in such particular water reservoirs. Roadside dumped flowers (by flower traders or else), attract vectors (Insam et al., 1996 ) and can be a reason of spreading diseases along with air quality deterioration as their decomposition emits green house gases such as CO2  and CH4  (Sharma et al., 2018a ). Further, environment becomes worse especially during monsoon time when breeding of mosquitoes and flies are common on these wastes. Mainly, the leachate produced from the flower waste, may create health disorders if mixed with water bodies (Waghmode et al., 2016 ). As on another side, this floral waste can also be useful in creating value added products or compost by using some modern scientific approaches, like for industrial use, flower waste can be used to produce biochar, vermicompost, natural dye, biogas etc. (Singh et al., 2017 ). Scientific research have demonstrated antioxidant property of some flowers due to the presence of essential plant sources like phenolic compounds as well as carotenoids (Serrano-Díaz et al., 2012 ), which can also be favorably used in the treatments of skin diseases as well as anti-aging agents (Adhikari et al., 2019 ). Some studies have observed that at some places, parts of flowers are being used as feedstock for food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetic industries because of their antioxidant and medicinal properties (Ulbricht et al., 2011 ). One of the best biotechnological processes for managing floral waste is vermicomposting in which soil microorganism and earthworms degrade the organic waste into useful fertilizer (Singh et al., 2013 ). But, the presence of phenolic compounds dominated lignin and cellulose of complex structure, in composting mixture and other environmental factors can delay the process of vermicomposting (Buswell et al., 1987 ). Hence, some other adequate methods of procuring valuable products from the floral waste disposal are also in demand (Singh et al., 2018 ). Iyer, 2016  reported some successful case studies of effective solid waste management practices of individual citizen of Mumbai (India) and some organizations as well like University of Mumbai, Godrej etc. At these places the success rate of waste management was observed in the range from 80 to 98%.Thus, considerable waste generated by ritual offerings in India, like variety of flowers, different types of tree leaves, milk and its products etc. need adequate management for its proper disposal (Singh et al., 2017 ). Main constituent of floral waste from Indian cities are, carotenoid and flavonoids pigments rich as well as yellow to red colored marigold flowers (Bhardwaj et al., 1980 ). A general methodology of extracting value added products is depicted in Fig. 5  . Fig. 5  shows the various types possible product generation and their methodologies, which are possible by management of the flower wastes, along with the details have discussed below: 4.1 Compost production By converting the floral waste, enriched in nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and potassium like macronutrients as well as iron, magnesium, zinc and copper like micronutrients, into compost, will be a useful product to agriculture sector (Sharma et al., 2017 ). Among various composting methods, (rotary drum, windrow pile or agitated pile and aerated pile), rotary method is an effective technique. Rotary drum and aeration techniques result in properly mixed, secure and developed compost. Moreover, it can be easily placed in any required location of organic or flower waste. This technique is also preferred to generate compost from sludge waste as well as waste generated from wine and olive mills (Fernández et al., 2010), organic wastes (tree leaves, vegetable waste) (Kalamdhad et al., 2009 ) and the domestic wastes (Wang et al., 2014 ). Purposefully, diversified agents (rice shell, out layers of wheat, sawdust and dead leaves) have been used in rotary drum organic waste composting, but there are only a few evidences of the use of this technique for floral waste (Sharma et al., 2018a ). Evaluation of growth of microbes, available final compost nutrients and quality as well as maturity of organic compost can be done by another crucial factor C:N ratio (Gao et al., 2010 ). Maturity of flower waste can be verified by the range of NH4 + -N, which should be, less than 400 mg per kg as reported by Awasthi et al. (2015) . Usually, flower wastes are found to be rich in Phosphorous (about 3.18 g/kg) which promotes the maturity of crops, production of seeds as well as growth of the plants (Sharma et al., 2018b ). Thus, agitated pile composting is appropriate for composting of floral waste, in India. To get the compost with optimum nutrient concentrations for the better growth of plants, desired mixture can be obtained by sawdust, floral and cattle dung of amount 10 kgs, 65 kgs and 25 kgs respectively, which results in compost with 14 Carbon to Nitrogen ratio, 7.1 pH, about 32.98% total organic carbon and electrical conductivity of 3.31 μS/cm (Sharma et al., 2018b ).  4.2 Vermicompost production At the religious places like Varanasi, Haridwar etc. due to unawareness, residential used to dispose tons of offered flowers in the river Ganga that enhance the growth of disease causing microorganisms and the stinky banks. As a solution, adverse environmental effects can be controlled by converting the floral wastes into the nutrients and humus rich organic compost by aerobic composting (Singh and Sharma, 2002). Vermicompost generation, one the best disposal alternatives of organic waste, can be safely accelerated in mesophilic conditions by microorganisms and earthworms (Domfnguez, 2004 ). Because of homogeneous nutrient presence, least contamination and greater water holding tendency, vermicompost has been considered as a useful product without any environmental impact (Muthunarayanan et al., 2016 ). Apart from the presence of essential hormones for plant growth, vermicompost is also a good source of suppressive microbes, enzymes as well as macro and micro-nutrients that are useful for growing plants (Kale and Karmegam, 2010 ) with everlasting capacity to hold nutrients for the agriculture friendly microbial population (Ndegwa and Thompson, 2001). Cytokinins, gibberellins and auxins are other essential plant growth materials found in vermicompost (Krishnamoorthy and Vajranabhaiah, 1986 ) and also contain plant growth enhancing, humic acids that are responsible for the good production of various crops (Atiyeh et al., 2002 ). The microbes like fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria also account for the plant growing factors (Edwards, 1998). Further, earthworms grow at high rate in highly porous, drained, with good water capacity and aerated region (Suthar, 2009 ) and provide multitude micro-sites to retain high nutrients as well as activities of microbes (Shi-Wei and Fu-Zhen, 1991 ). Other sources of vermicompost include the organic waste from agro-industrial waste (Bernal et al., 1998 ), sewage sludge (Gomez-Brandon et al., 2011 ) and animal compost (Suthar et al., 2012 ). For rapid degradation of the flower waste, Jadhav et al. (2013)  isolated microbial consortium to create NPK enriched biofertilizers. These biofertilizers enhance the crop yield in a desirable way without soil erosion, salinity and alkalinity etc. by the processes like dissolution of P present in the soil and fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. Makhania and Upadhyay (2015)  analysed the physico-chemical parameters like electrical conductivity, temperature, pH, volatile solid samples and moisture contentduring the conversion of floral waste, collected from various temples of Surat city, into compost. Also, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin present in organic waste can be degraded rapidly by using extremophiles like Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus subtilis  (Pan et al., 2011 ), which reduces the duration of different phases of composting like Psychrophilic phase (>15 °C), Mesophile phase (15-45 °C), Thermophile phase (45-80 °C) and Hyper thermophile phase (>80 °C). Extremophiles present in the floral waste shorts the duration of reaching in thermophilic phase of systematic decomposition of organic wastes (Rathinam and Sani, 2018 ).  4.3 Production of natural coloring agents Generally, Tagetuserecta (marigold) flowers, from Asteraceae family, have a big fraction in flower waste in Indian temples. Its petals containing carotenoid-lutein and flavonoid-patuletin produces natural dye for textile Industries. On pretreatment with 5% of plant extract and 1–2%metal mordant has resulted strong dye for silk, wool and cotton. Ethanol with novel solvent removal of dry flowers of marigold allows selective extraction of carotenoids and flavonoids. Ethanol solvent can also be recovered in this process of extraction (Vankar 2009 ). Safflower (Carthamustinctorius L.) is used to extract natural colors to be mixed in food items as taste enhancer and it can also provide vegetable edible oils (Zohary et al., 2012 ). In 2018, 627,653 tonnes of safflower was produced around the world and Kazakhstan, USA and Indian are the leading producers of it, respectively (FAOSTAT, 2019 ). According to Ravishankar et al. (2014) , rose, jasmine, marigolds, chrysanthemum, hyacinth, roselle and polianthestuberosa are the mostly wasted flowers among the 1450 tons of flowers that are offered in Indian temples. They suggested the extraction of essential oils and dyes from such waste to overcome the problem of its disposal. To extract dyes, hexane, ethanol and methanol solvents are used to dissolve dried and grinded flowers, while oils are obtained through distillation, using soxhelt apparatus, of heated fresh flowers with appropriate solvent. Extracted dyes can be satisfactorily used on clothes (Yadav et al., 2015 ). The floral waste residues, after extraction of natural colorants by thermo-chemical disintegration, can be converted into an effective absorbent for water treatment or into biochar for soil quality improver (Singh et al., 2018 ).  4.4 Biogas generation Ranjitha et al. (2014)  used cow dung as inoculum in 1 L capacity of anaerobic digester to generate biogas from the floral waste (Peltophorumafricanum, Hibiscus sabdariffa, Markhamialutea, Albiziajulibrissin, Chrysothemispulchella and Jasminum ) and vegetable waste (carrot, ladies finger, brinjal, cabbage etc.). Biogas generated from flowers with less digestion period was 16.7 g/kg while that of vegetable waste was lesser to 9.1 g/kg. Moreover, in India, the most abundant flowers are good source of biogas and even it will support the sustainable concept of wealth from waste (Yadav et al., 2015 ). According to Ranjitha et al. (2014) , biogas (biofuel for electricity generation) can be generated using different types of flowers that each species of flower could provide different biogas amount as represented in Fig. 6  . Hashemi et al. (2019) reported biogas production using safflower based lignocellulosic waste. It is claimed as less costly and also found suitable for biogas generation through anaerobic digestion, using organic waste. Besides it, anaerobic digestion provides a compost of superior quality as well as it may decrease the risk of air and water quality deterioration (Divya et al., 2015 ). Similarly, Sołowski et al. (2020)  produced biofuels like methane and hydrogen using different types of lignocellulose waste materials. However, hydrogen energy production was expensive as compared to methane using such types of wastes. According to Diaz et al. (2018)  these wastes are abundantly available in the agriculture and some other types of industries in huge quantity and it would be a great resource to generate bioenergy. Similarly, Mishra et al. (2020)  examined the capacity of generating renewable biofuel from the flowers of dahlia. These flower plants may be used to generate good amount of bioenergy as the study was supported by applying four kinetic models. Therefore, it can been seen that flowers of silk tree mimosa and African wattle has relatively better capacity to produce biological fuels as compared to others flowers. However, this study indicates that waste flowers can also be used to generate electricity for its better application.  4.5 Ecofriendly biosorbents Some researchers have derived ecofriendly biosorbents from floral waste to remove toxic colorants as well as heavy metals present in aqueous medium (Waghmode et al., 2016 ). Khoshsang and Ghaffarinejad (2018)  have eliminated lead present in aqueous solutions by using the saffron flower’s waste as green bio-adsorbent. The stability in adsorption process, with the capacity of about 36.97 mg/g, was reached within 9 min. Lignocellulosic biomass, along with environmental management, on thermo-chemical conversion can produce bio-oil, biochar and syngas (Singh et al., 2015 ). Potential adsorbents have also been developed that can remove of toxic colorants and metals such as methylene blue (Singh et al., 2018 ), acid blue 9 (also known as Food blue 2) (Echavarria-Alvarez and Hormaza-Anaguano, 2014 ), chromium (VI) (Vankar et al., 2010 ), lead & cobalt (Bhatti et al., 2011 ), chromium (III and VI) (Elangovan et al., 2008 ) and nickel (Chergui et al., 2014 ) from water. Recently, Singh et al. (2018)  developed biochar from the waste flowers for the removal of a dye i.e. methylene blue from the aqueous medium. Approximately 42% and 36% biochar adsorbents were obtained at 350 °C and 500 °C, respectively. Hence, it is possible to convert floral refuse in to biochar by pyrolysis process, that further can be used as an efficient adsorbent that can remove pollutants like heavy metals, synthetic dye and other organic pollutants from waste water (Singh et al., 2018 ) and soil quality improver as well (Singh et al., 2015 ). Biochar, a highly carbon carbonaceous and soil ameliorant, have high external area along with micro as well as macro-nutrients on the surface is a nutrient retention enhancer and also mitigate global climate change (Mohan et al., 2018 ). Fig. 7   shows an approximate percentage value of various types of nutrients for soil health improvement present in biochar developed at 500 °C. From Fig. 7 , it is noticeable that carbon was observed ∼50% and whereas nitrogen was 40% and carbon and nitrogen are very important nutrients for the soil health maintenance (Dawud et al., 2016 ). Thus, researchers have proven that flowers ingredients can also be used to remove water contamination as well as it can improve soil health.  4.6 Miscellaneous products generation from the flowers Serrano-Diaz et al. (2013)  reported that in the various parts of the saffron flowers have Calcium, Potassium, Manganese, Phosphorus, Iron as well as considerable contents of proteins and fibers. The dried and 1% sterile powder, made up of the flower waste after the collection from the different temples, was added in the minimal carbonless medium. The various combinations of soil isolates (stripe inoculated on this agar medium of flower waste) with considerable growth were further used for associated development (Jadhavet al., 2013). Jadouali et al. (2019)  extracted some valuable chemical compounds (antioxidants) form the waste floral parts of saffron flowers in Morocco. Authors studied that 167,000 flowers are need to be trimmed to obtained 1 kg dried saffron and once saffron is procured these flowers parts become useless. Using this waste residue, some kind of minerals, proteins, soluble sugar and lipid were extracted. Some natural phenols were also extracted having rich medicinal properties. The results enhanced the development of unexplored value added production from the saffron flower’s waste along with the management to clean the country. Bachheti et al. (2020)  reported that many flowers can be used to extract herbal nanoparticles for their extensive application the field of modern medical sciences (used in the treatment of breast cancer, gastric problems, pancreas disorders etc.) as these nanoparticles do have anti-bacterial as well as antifungal properties. Punica granatum  L. has been widely used in the traditional medical sciences including Ayurveda, Chinese and Unani against different human ailments such as diabetes, baldness etc. (Sivarajan and Balachandran, 1994 ). Similarly, Li et al. (2020)  also procured biochar from the flower of Cotinus coggygria  L. (commonly known as European smoke tree) by carbonization process followed by chemical stimulation. The procured biochar was used as supercapacitors to improve the functions of an electrode.   5 Significance of flower waste management for India With the second position after China, India generates approximately 4.74 × 106  t/d of flower wastes (National Horticulture Board of India, 2013 ). Only in Sri Lanka and India, about 2/5th of the flowers of the daily production are left unsold and hence wasted (Jadhav et al., 2013 ; Masure and Patil, 2014 ). For example, Varanasi (India) even being one of the holy city, has no well managed process to dispose the large amount of wastes. About 3500–4000 kgs per day of material is wasted in this holy city (Mishra, 2013 ). According to the estimation of Varanasi Nagar Nigam (VNN) 1000 kgs flowers are wasted daily, only in area of temples. Majorspeciesof flowers that are wasted includes Hibiscus rosasinensis , marigold with rose and Calotropis gigantean from the famous temples like Durgakund, Varanasi includes (Gudhal), Vishwanath temple and shiv temple Mrityujayamahadev, Visheshwarganj, Varanasi (Waghmode et al., 2016 ). Similarly, Ramghat near the bank of river Mandakini and Lord Kamtanathji are two main temples of Chitrakoot, where devotees offer a lot of flowers and generate around 5000–7000 kgs floral waste annually (Waghmode et al., 2016 ). Some researchers reported production of vermicompost using flower wastes which is very useful in the promotion of organic farming (Sailaja et al., 2013 ). In India, worship is the essential part of human life and people offer various flowers, eatables and wearables, out of which flowers are most common. Jasmine, hibiscus, rose and marigold are some common types of offered flowers. Due to huge amount of offered flowers, floral waste is generated which can be utilized in various ways to produce valuable and consumable products by vermicomposting, extracting colorants and essential oils, producing environment friendly holi  colors (Indian color festival) as well as bio-gas generation. Moreover, it will help in controlling the pollutants that occurred due to improper dispose of floral waste and will consequently save the environment. Flower waste can also be used for handmade papermaking and for making incense sticks (Yadav et al., 2015 ). In India, sister laboratories of CSIR (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), IIT-Kanpur and some academic institutes of Maharashtra have developed scientific procedures for the extraction of many valuable products from the flowers including natural colors, sticks, hawansamagri  (for religious purpose), interior decorative items, ecofriendly manures etc. Normally, the waste generation should be regulated from the source of generation. For example, at industry level it can be reduced after modification in the packaging steps, reduce the extra derivatives during production and increasing technical feasibility. However, local public can contribute in the waste management by adopting responsible behaviors like use of more ecofriendly and reusable products which would not be harmful for the environment and human health. Demand of raw food materials is more in developing nations and packaged food materials are high in demand among developed countries. Therefore, municipal solid waste management systems of both developed and developed countries cannot be same because of a big difference in their waste compositions (Mohee and Bundhoo, 2015 ). Further, Mohee et al. (2015)  stated that integrated municipal solid waste management system can be achieved through waste reduction at their sources by using effective ways of separation, collection & transport, processing of recyclable waste materials, composting and energy generation. Developed countries are better in solid waste management because they are capable to collect 100% wastes as compared to only ∼74.1% (average of a range from 18% to 100%) in developing nations (Mohee and Bundhoo, 2015 ). Similarly, Asase et al. (2009)  reported London was having 30% of organic waste materials and Kumasi (Ghana) generated 64% of organic wastes in 2008. Low financial input, poor infrastructure and lack of responsibility among the citizens are the major obstacles of effective solid waste management in the developing nations. It has been observed that waste materials can be an inexhaustible resource to produce energy in addition to proper solid waste management. Moreover, it will help to grow the economy (Kalyani and Pandey, 2014 ). However, for the developing countries, high installation cost of the techniques is a major factor to achieve energy from the waste materials (Kumar and Samadder, 2017 ). Combustion of waste comprising plastic, papers or else can kill the infectious organisms present in it. However, it produces toxic dioxins which are very harmful for ecological systems and health (both human and animals) (Narayana, 2009 ). Therefore, recycling of the wastes and extraction of value added products from the waste materials may be beneficial for the country and its people.  6 Flower waste management and sustainable development goals This well managed effort will be a forward step to achieve the goal of sustainable development, ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ’ and most importantly chemical free products to the society with clean environment. With the motive of reduction in environmental pollution and poverty as well as to improve social equality and city livability, 17 objectives were introduced within the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to improve in sustainable global waste management, the goals are; safe, adequate and affordable solid waste collection services by 2020, controlled opened dumping and burning, environmentally sound and sustainable management of even hazardous, waste by the year 2030 (Wilson and Velis, 2015 ). Moreover, waste minimization (through integrated approach) any region/country can be helpful to achieve the partial objectives of 10 SDGs (out of total 17 SDGs) as suggested by United Nations (Fig. 8  ) (UNSDG, 2015 ; Pujara et al., 2019 ). Therefore, it would be advantageous for whole world as expected by the United Nations during the release of these 17 SGDs. From Fig. 8 , it can be seen that either complete or partial objectives of 10 SDGs are well aligned with the practices of integrated waste management as waste management efforts may directly or indirectly improve the circumstances of the people. Integrated municipal solid waste management system can be a better option for every nation to generate the value added products along with appropriate waste management. It includes reduction of waste materials at the source of their generation, separation at source, effective collection & transport, processing of recyclable waste materials, compost and energy production before their dumping in the landfill (Mohee and Bundhoo, 2015 ). In this regard, Government of India has also taken initiatives for the management of MSWs in a better way. Provisions of segregation of biodegradable wastes from the non-biodegradable wastes were included in Municipal Solid Waste Management Rule passed in the year of 2000. In the 2016, according to the provisions of revised solid waste management rules, biodegradable wastes should be used for the generation of bio-fertilizers and/or energy. Moreover, the wastes materials which cannot reuse and have 1500 K/cal/kg of calorific value can be used for energy generation. It was observed that waste segregation, biogas generation and composting could be the best alternatives of solid waste management in India (Pujara et al., 2019 ). According to Narayana (2009) , in developing countries, 80–85% of the wastes are biodegradable in nature which can be an asset to produce good quality of compost. Therefore, composting can be recommended to the developing countries including India for a better option of waste management along with generating some valued added products as discussed from the flower wastes.  7 Concluding remarks Mismanagement of solid wastes has become a global concern. Solid waste includes mainly five major classes such as MSW, Debris (construction as well as demolition), e-wastes, industrial sludge and hospitality wastes. Because of modern life style of humans, MSWs are growing alarmingly especially in the urban areas. However, around half proportion of the whole solid wastes are organic in nature. Flower waste is also a type valuable organic waste which can be used to derive valuable products including natural coloring agents, manures, biofuel as well as bioadsorbents for water treatment. Moreover, some essential nutrients are also extracted using saffron flowers in Morocco. Therefore, it has been established that proper flower waste management can give us many valuable products. Further, medicinal properties of the flowers should also be explored in near future. However, it is imperative to include all the stakeholders such as academia, NGOs, scientists, ministries, local public etc. to put in the best efforts for the improvement of the process of waste management as well as to improve the financial status of the local residents. Furthermore, waste management practices can be helpful to achieve the fractional objectives of 9–10 sustainable development goals which are given by United Nations. Finally, it can be concluded that every waste can give valuable product, if managed properly.
