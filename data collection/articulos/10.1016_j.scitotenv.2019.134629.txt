                  Human vulnerability represents an open field of study that allows us, through the use of indicators, to measure a territory’s weakness and potential for dealing with negative climate impacts. This kind of assessment is important within the scope of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially as a tool that is able to direct the strategies and planning in countries in the context of regional climate change (SDG 13.2). The aim of this work is to demonstrate the application of a method that uses a software created for the Brazilian context (SISVUCLIMA) to evaluate human vulnerability to climate change in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. Via an assessment of socioeconomics, demographics, climate, epidemiological, and environmental aspects compiled to develop a municipal vulnerability index, it was clear that the central and western mesoregions of Maranhão are more fragile regarding exposure, sensitivity, and adaptative capacities. These locations may be the most affected by rising temperatures and reduced rainfall that is projected for the next 20 years in the region. It is believed that the results obtained in this study may contribute indirectly to the adoption of effective actions directed at SDG 13 and other SDGs in the country. By considering the socio-ecological and health determinants that define the vulnerability profile of the municipalities of Maranhão, it will be possible to suggest specific actions to reduce the fragility of the local population to climate impacts. Through a spatial and multi-dimensional view of the problem, the proposed indicators can act as an effective instrument for overall environmental management from a sustainable perspective.

Graphical abstract       Human vulnerability represents an open field of study that allows us, through the use of indicators, to measure a territory’s weakness and potential for dealing with negative climate impacts. This kind of assessment is important within the scope of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially as a tool that is able to direct the strategies and planning in countries in the context of regional climate change (SDG 13.2). The aim of this work is to demonstrate the application of a method that uses a software created for the Brazilian context (SISVUCLIMA ) to evaluate human vulnerability to climate change in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. Via an assessment of socioeconomics, demographics, climate, epidemiological, and environmental aspects compiled to develop a municipal vulnerability index, it was clear that the central and western mesoregions of Maranhão are more fragile regarding exposure, sensitivity, and adaptative capacities. These locations may be the most affected by rising temperatures and reduced rainfall that is projected for the next 20 years in the region. It is believed that the results obtained in this study may contribute indirectly to the adoption of effective actions directed at SDG 13 and other SDGs in the country. By considering the socio-ecological and health determinants that define the vulnerability profile of the municipalities of Maranhão, it will be possible to suggest specific actions to reduce the fragility of the local population to climate impacts. Through a spatial and multi-dimensional view of the problem, the proposed indicators can act as an effective instrument for overall environmental management from a sustainable perspective.   Keywords Population vulnerability  Climate change  Public health  Index  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction Climate scenarios and historical measurements point to the risk of climate change, which is an additional aggravating factor to the urban environment and its population, given the potential impacts on human health, social dynamics, and the natural and built environments (Rosenzweig et al., 2011 ). The severity of impacts is related to the climatic phenomenon and the vulnerability of the system, which translates into its propensity to be adversely affected (IPCC, 2014 ). There is a consensus among scientists that the assessment of the vulnerability of social-ecological systems to climate change can contribute to the planning of effective adaptation strategies and the reduction of potential impacts of climate (Adger, 2004 ). Characteristics of a socio-ecological system can be grouped according to its exposure, sensitivity, and/or adaptive capacity (IPCC, 2007 ). These attributes contribute to the evaluation of populations and territories that are vulnerable to climate change to a certain extent and comprise one of the adopted strategies in the quantification of the characteristics of the system and its aggregation into composite indicators. Both in Brazil and worldwide, studies have used indicators to allow the comparative assessment of the vulnerability of populations or territories defined in their scope: urban areas, biomes, socio-ecological systems, development regions, municipalities, and many others (Abson et al., 2012; Menezes et al., 2018; Xenarios et al., 2016; Barata et al., 2015; Quintão, 2017; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Santos, 2019 ). This approach allows spatial planning of a territory and the implementation of adaptation actions for climate change. In a recent review by Sherbinin et al., 2019 , state of the art mapping of vulnerability to climate change was addressed. The authors observe that many studies have not translated into effective adaptation strategies, although some successful cases are highlighted. Hallegate, 2010 , in studying the economic impacts of floods in Mumbai, identified that simple measures such as expanding insurance penetration and improving the drainage system could drastically reduce the effects of the disaster, especially on the marginalized population. Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2016  moved beyond hotspot mapping—while combining the vulnerability analysis with expected climate change impacts—to identify appropriate policies in sub-Saharan Africa regarding food insecurity. The authors identified that targeted policies are necessary for East Africa regions, because vulnerable groups showed remarkable differences when compared to the study area in general, and the population would not benefit from generic policies. In Brazil, previous studies adopted the strategy of cross-information to enable the spatial identification of populations with higher vulnerability, with the overall aim of enhancing the climate adaptative capacity of the population of Pintadas, Bahia (Simões et al., 2010, Obermaier et al., 2014 ). In this sense, adaptation is the process of reducing a system’s vulnerability to climate change. In human systems, adaptation generally entails understanding, planning, and managing systems to respond to, or prepare for, perceived or anticipated changes. Recognizing and exploring city complexity can help elucidate the most effective management strategies, and may highlight knowledge gaps that can be filled through modeling, targeted learning, and other strategies (Barata et al., 2018 ). From this perspective, Brazilian research projects have been carried out to implement actions adhering to the National Policy on Climate Change (NPCC). In 2016, researchers at Fiocruz in partnership with professionals from the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment started the project “Construction of Indicators for Municipal Assessment of Human Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil”  (Confalonieri et al, 2016 ). The project aimed to develop an instrument to evaluate the vulnerability of the population to climate change, through the use of indicators that help to measure and compare the reality of municipalities in six states of the country (Confalonieri et al, 2016 ). The spatialization of indicators provides knowledge of the most vulnerable aspects and locations, thus facilitating the planning of strategies, actions, and resources for climate adaptation (Quintão, 2017 ). This viewpoint aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global agenda adopted by the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in 2015, which consists of 17 goals and 169 targets that address actions related to the social, environmental, economic, and institutional dimensions until 2030 (United Nations, 2015 ). More specifically, the project “Construction of Indicators for Municipal Assessment of Human Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil”, as well as the present study that derived from it, converge to achieve SDG 13, which consists of “taking urgent measures to combat climate change and its impacts” (United Nations, 2015 ). In fact, climate literature and science have been progressively increasing their scope from a purely physical focus to a growing interest in the human dimensions of the climate problem, so that the issue of population vulnerability has been gaining ground in recent years (Robinson et al., 2006 ). In this context, commitment to SDGs by setting goals focused on human dignity and sustainable development, contributes to reducing local vulnerabilities and thus to strengthening and accelerating the process of adaptation of countries and societies to climate impacts (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; UNEP, 2018 ). The relevance and overlapping aspects of SDGs stem from the extension of the development agenda proposed by the United Nations, which allows their use in various fields, at the international level (e.g., gaps in adaptation for health (UNEP, 2018 ), conservation and management of cultural heritage (Xiao et al., 2018 ), and urban development (Caprotti et al., 2017 )) as well as at the national level (e.g., public policies for sustainable development (FGV, 2018 ), and performance of the goals of chronic non-communicable diseases in Brazil (Malta et al., 2018 ). Considering the local level, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the vulnerability to climate change in the municipalities of the state of Maranhão, Brazil, from the fundamental components of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, coupled with climate projections. The mains drivers were identified, allowing to analyze their combination in each municipality, their distribution throughout the region and the implications for adaptation. Also, we presented the application of a vulnerability assessment tool (SISVUCLIMA ) to mitigate the potential impacts expected from climate change and discussed the possible contributions of our assessment tool to SDG 13, in particular targets 13.1 (“Strengthening resilience and capacity of adaptation to climate and natural disasters risks in all countries” ) and 13.2 (“Integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and plans” )..  2 Methods 2.1 Study Area: Maranhão The state of Maranhão is in Northeast Brazil (Fig. 1  ) and comprises 217 municipalities, that cover an area of ~ 331,936,955 km2 . It represents the eighth largest Brazilian state in territorial extension, and had a total population of 6,954,036 in 2016 (IBGE. Cidades e Estados - Maranhão ). Notably, regarding the variability in the distribution of the population in the state, 35% of the residents are concentrated in nine municipalities that have >100,000 inhabitants, while 23% reside in 127 municipalities with populations of less than 20,000 inhabitants (Fig. 1 b) (FIOCRUZ, 2018a, 2018b ). The population profile of the state is considered young: 51% of people are less than 25 years old, and about 74% are less than 40 years old (IBGE, 2010 ). Among other socioeconomic aspects, it is worth noting that the state of Maranhão has the lowest per capita household income in the country among the 27 states of the federation, with a value below US$ 200.00 per household (IBGE, 2010 ). The socio-economic Human Development Index (HDI) for Maranhão in 2010 was 0.639, which ranked as the penultimate (26th) of all Brazilian states for this indicator (PNUD, 2010 ). The state of Maranhão contains the Amazon, Cerrado, and Caatinga biomes, which gives it a great environmental diversity. In terms of territorial extension, the Cerrado biome is the most extensive and covers 64% of the state surface area. This is followed by the Amazon with 35% coverage, whereas the Caatinga covers only 1% (Maranhão, 2013 ). The eastern part of the state, to the west of the 44° W meridian, is part of the Brazilian Legal Amazon region, which encompasses nine Brazilian states either totally or partially. Almost 80% of the Maranhão territory lies within this region, and covers an area of ~ 264,000 km2 , of which ~ 34% is the Amazon Biome and ~ 45% is the Cerrado (PPCD-MA, 2011 ). Both of these biomes suffer great anthropic pressure, mainly due to the expansion of agricultural activities. This unique distribution of biomes allows the state of Maranhão to be divided into five geographic mesoregions: central, northern, eastern, western, and southern mesoregions (Fig. 1 a). An Equatorial climate predominates in the region, which does not allow for significant climatic seasonal variation. The annual thermal amplitude of the interior region is larger than that of continental regions. Average monthly temperatures are relatively high, and the average annual temperature ranges from 17.5 °C to 29.5 °C. There are dry and rainy seasons that are typical of a tropical climate, with the rainy season being from December to February in summer (Maranhão, 2013 ).  2.2 Methods used in the construction of the MVI 2.2.1 Conceptual model of the MVI The municipal vulnerability index (MVI) that was applied in this research derives from previous studies that were carried out in other Brazilian locations (Barata, 2011 ; Menezes et al., 2018; Confalonieri et al., 2015; Confalonieri et al., 2016; Quintão, 2017 ), and is based on the same conceptual model presented in Menezes et al. (2018)  and Santos et al.  (2019). Conceptually, the MVI considers that multiple processes—based on human, social, environmental, and economic development conditions—occur in each municipality, and that these contribute to the vulnerability profile of a municipality (Menezes et al., 2018 ). According to Adger (2006) , this profile can be characterized by three basic dimensions of vulnerability:• Exposure: the nature and intensity of environmental (biophysical and climatic) or socio-political stress experienced by a system (e.g., a population or territory). The characteristics of such stress include its magnitude, frequency, duration, and the extent of the hazard area.  • Sensitivity: the intensity to which a system can suffer damages, or be affected by disturbances, as determined by the intrinsic susceptibilities to the system.  • Adaptive capacity: the ability of a system to change (or introduce changes) to accommodate environmental stresses or policy changes, and the ability to best manage any consequences, thus expanding the range of variability with which it can cope.    In this context, this study considers that climate change acts as an external influence that can modify the profile of vulnerability in each municipality; a hazard that may make resident populations vulnerable to their impacts.  2.2.2 SisVuClima software for vulnerability analysis One of the aims of the project “Construction of Indicators for Municipal Assessment of Human Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil” was that the vulnerability analysis could be of wide use among the decision-makers, technicians, and academics from the states in which the evaluation was applied. Calculation of the indices can be challenging, and the software SisVuClima was developed by Fiocruz to calculate the indices as well as produce thematic maps using the cartographic basis of the municipalities (Quintão, 2017 ). The system makes use of raw data collected in a variety of official public databases: the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the National Civil Defense, the Department of Information and Technology of SUS (DATASUS), the Brazilian Atlas of Human Development, the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), the National Water Agency (ANA), the Mineral Resources Research Company (CPRM), the Ecological-Economic Macro-zoning of the State of Maranhão (Maranhão, 2013 ), the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA ), and FIRJAN . These databases are periodically updated with new data, both automatically and manually. The input data for SisVuClima are converted into indicators and aggregated in sub-indices and indices using “R” statistical language. The indices and sub-indices may be spatially represented as thematic maps through the geographic information system ArcGIS desktop, version 10.3 (Fiocruz, 2016 ). The system uses some other free tools including SQlite (an embedded database that allows for PC and notebook users), Python programing language, Django (a Python web framework), and an Apache HTTP Server. In December 2018, SisVuClima received a certificate of registration as a computer program (process number: BR1201805214-9), which was issued by the National Institute of Industrial Property of the Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade and Services of Brazil. The software allows comparisons to be made between municipalities for living environments, health, demographics, income, adaptative capacity, and climate (i.e., precipitation and temperature). To date, the software has been applied in seven Brazilian states: Amazonas, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Maranhão, Minas Gerais, Paraná, and Pernambuco. Some results can be found in Menezes et al., 2018; Quintão, 2017 , and Santos et al.  (2019), with specific modifications made according to the characteristics of each state. The state of Espírito Santo has, for example, used the software within health departments to monitor the variation of indices over time. Other examples includes Paraná, a state in the southern region of the country, which is completing an update of the data in the software to reassess the vulnerability of coastal municipalities, and Recife, the capital of the state of Pernambuco, where the conceptual model that is based on the software has been used to formulate their municipal adaptation plan.  2.2.3 Indices and sub-indices The method used in this study combines synthetic indices that provide a measure of vulnerability in different aspects that are defined between the dimensions of exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and their association to climatic hazards (Table 1   and Fig. 2  ). Using SisVuClima, information is statistically analyzed for each municipality and a MVI is calculated in relation to climate change from both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 (see later). Data selection was based on i) data availability, ii) the conceptual framework established by previous research and developed by Fiocruz (Barata et al., 2015, Confalonieri et al., 2015, 2016 ), and iii) scientific literature on the quantification and evaluation of vulnerability (Adger, 2004; Brooks et al., 2005; SabelliScale Counts, 2011; Moss et al., 2001; Sabelli, 2011 ). The vulnerability index (VI) represents the current conditions of the municipalities of Maranhão and is related to the sub-indices of exposure (EI), sensitivity (SI), and adaptive capacity (ACI). The climate scenario index (CSI) is constructed from climatic anomalies generated by the absolute difference between the projected climate (2041–2070) and the baseline climatological observations (1961–1990) (Quintão, 2017 ). Temperature and precipitation data from the ETA/HadGEM2 model were used; these have been regionalized for South America. (Chou et al., 2014 ) The adopted families of scenarios refer to RCPs that have been used by the Climate Panel (IPCC, 2014 ). RCPs are part of the third generation of climate change scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These scenarios represent a consensual point for a variety of studies carried out in several countries, and in the present study, two RCPs, 4.5 and 8.5, were selected for analysis. RCP 4.5 corresponds to a stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the year 2100, and RCP 8.5 corresponds to an increase in GHG emissions for the year 2100. The indicators used in the CSI 4.5 and CSI 8.5 scenarios were based on temperature and precipitation anomalies in absolute values. The temperature anomaly (TA) is the anomaly between the projected climate and the baseline climatological observations for temperature indicators: maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin), and the precipitation anomaly (PA) is the anomaly between the projected climate and the baseline climatological observations, based on the total annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), the maximum cumulative precipitation in 5 days (Rx5day), the annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation amount on a wet day > 95th percentile(R95p), and the maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD) per year. The MVI is the aggregation of VI and either CSI 4.5 or CSI 8.5 obtained for each municipality, thus representing synthetically the relationship between the present vulnerability and the future scenarios under climate change. Two visualization are therefore possible: i) MVI 4.5 that considers the VI and CSI 4.5, and ii) MVI 8.5 that considers the VI and CSI 8.5. The selection and development of the indicators was undertaken with the participation of local stakeholders from the public and scientific sectors. The results were presented and discussed with these local stakeholders, and local public officials were trained to use the software in order to assist in the better planning of adaptation for climate change strategies. The tool allows multiple analyses in order to evaluate and plan strategies to reduce the vulnerability of the municipal population to climate change. Nevertheless, it carries uncertainties that are inherent in its components. The climate system involves interactions between various moving parts, with uncertainties appearing both in the structuring of climate models and in the evaluation of their parameters and connections (NRC, 2010; Trenberth, 2011 ). A similar process occurs with components that influence population vulnerability. However, the intensification of climatic extreme events, with their consequential environmental, social, and economic impacts, demonstrates the need, despite the uncertainties, to take preventive action in order to avoid the risks associated with climate change (PBMC, 2014 ). Through the multiple analyses using SisVuClima, the possible outcomes of different adaptation strategies can be evaluated (Quintão, 2018).  2.2.4 Standardization and calculation The calculation of the indices involved three distinct steps: 1) assignment of scores, 2) arithmetic mean and standardization, and 3) combination of indices (Quintão, 2017 ; Menezes et al., 2018 ; Santos et al ., 2019). The variables, by municipality, were grouped through the K-means method into five clusters so that weights ranging from 0 to 4 (0 represents the least vulnerable and 4 the most vulnerable) could be assigned to each cluster. Later, these scores were aggregated by the arithmetic mean to form the sub-indices. All the sub-indices were standardized so that they present the same range (from 0 to 1). To build the main indices (EI, SI, ACI, VI, CSI 4.5, CSI 8.5, MVI 4.5, and MVI 8.5) the sub-indices of each index were combined by the arithmetic mean and then standardized, thus generating values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 is the least vulnerable and 1 the most vulnerable. Fig. 2  illustrates the procedure for calculation and standardization of the indices. For the construction of CSI 4.5 and CSI 8.5, a single standardization step was used, in which the TA and PA obtained for each municipality were scored (values ranging from 0 to 4) and then grouped and standardized together, considering the entire range of anomalies obtained from ETA-HADGEM2-ES RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. All the procedures were performed using the SisVuClima software. A scale for all indices was used as a measure of vulnerability, with values standardized to be between 0 and 1 using the formula: δ = (X  – Xmin  ) / (Xmax  – Xmin  ), where δ is the standardized value, X  is the original variable, and Xmin  and Xmax  are the lowest and the highest values of the variable, respectively. The values of the indices were categorized as follows: 0 (minimum), 0.001–0.250 (low), 0.251 –0.500 (moderate), 0.501–0.750 (high), 0.751–0.999 (very high), and 1 (maximum). It should be noted that this is a comparative index, and a zero score does not indicate the absence of vulnerability, and a score of 1 does not mean complete vulnerability. Rather the scores indicate the degree of vulnerability of a given municipality in relation to the other municipalities in the state (Santos, 2016 ).  2.2.5 Data spatialization The indicators were mapped in consideration of the municipal databases and illustrated using official administrative layers (e.g., mesoregions and boundaries of the Brazilian states and territory) in shape files through the ArcGIS desktop (version 10.3).    3 Results By applying the outlined methods, it is possible to observe the relative vulnerability of the various populations of the municipalities within Maranhão, and to identify the most and least vulnerable as well as the dimensions that most influenced the vulnerabilities. Additionally, we hypothesize on how climate change could impact the populations of the municipalities of Maranhão. We focus on the spatial distribution of the main indices by municipality, and demonstrate, for some locations, the capacity for interdimensional analysis of the MVI. All values of the main indexes, by municipality, are available in the supplementary material  (S1). 3.1 Vulnerability index The VI is the result of the indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity observed in Maranhão. The understanding is that vulnerability can be synthesized into these different dimensions to give a general idea of the fragilities and capacities of each municipality. The spatial distribution of the VI by municipality is presented in Fig. 3  . This shows that there is a concentration of high values (i.e., >0.50) for all mesoregions with the exception of the south (less than0.50). Maximum number of municipalities with very high VI scores (i.e., 0.76–0.99) are concentrated in the northern and western mesoregions, and are characterized by a predominance of equatorial forests and low urbanization rates. The more homogeneous distribution of the EI and the SI by the state can help in the understanding of the profile of spatial vulnerability reflected in the VI (Fig. 3 ). Higher EI values in areas in the western and central mesoregions can be attributed to low vegetation cover in the interior of the state and a history of hydrometeorological events, as measured by natural disaster events registered in the Natural Disasters Index (NDI). Although the SI shows a greater concentration of high values in the central mesoregion of the state, there is a greater dispersion of high sensitivity municipalities in the west and east, and also to the coast in the northern mesoregion. The distribution of both indices presented in the southern mesoregion suggests that this location is characterized by lower values of EI and SI, which is reflected in the lowest VI and the relatively low vulnerability of this population. The ACI showed a greater dispersion among municipalities. Its distribution was heterogeneous, whereby municipalities with high values (i.e., low adaptive capacity) being scattered throughout the mesoregions of Maranhão. This demonstrates the need to promote actions to improve infrastructure, services, and socio-political and institutional organization throughout the territory to reduce the vulnerability of the state population. Municipalities with a high VI value generally have high indices for all dimensions. Municipalities located in the western and central mesoregions present a combined high values for the three main dimensions of vulnerability – EI, Si and ACI. However, they did not present any extreme values individually. This indicates all vulnerability factors contribute to these regions being in a situation requiring more attention than others. Nevertheless, the separate analyses of each component of the VI can still be useful for the definition of adaptation strategies, and these are therefore considered subsequently. 3.1.1 Exposure index As mentioned in Section 3.1 , low vegetation cover present in the interior of the state and a history of hydrometeorological events, result higher EI of the west and central mesoregions. The southern mesoregion is characterized by relatively low EIs (Fig. 4  ). The relatively high EI values in some parts of the central and eastern mesoregions indicate the fragility of the natural environment in these areas. The vegetation cover index (VCI) indicated that of 23 out of the 63 municipalities with a value of 1.00 were from the western mesoregion and 23 were from the central mesoregion; thus, 73% of the municipalities with the greatest fragility in terms of vegetation cover lie in the western and central mesoregions. With regard to the coastal areas, 80% of the 36 municipalities of the northern mesoregion show fragility in terms of EI.Fig. 5.  Fig. 6.  Fig. 7.    3.1.2 Sensitivity index Areas with higher SI values are concentrated in the central mesoregion, and a greater dispersion of high sensitivity municipalities is observed in the western and eastern regions, as well as the coastal zone of the northern mesoregion (Fig. 4 ). The results of the sub-indices of the SI reflect the relevance of the population size of the municipality. In this context, diseases associated with climate index (DACI), which measures the epidemiological situation of the municipality in relation to some relevant diseases in the state, is observed in situations of greater attention, especially in large urban centers. Of the nine cities in the state that have>100,000 inhabitants (according to the 2010 Census), eight have a DACI > 0.50. Only Paço do Lumiar in north Maranhense obtained less than 0.50 (0.37) for this index. Additionally, the poverty index (PI), which synthesizes indicators related to the monetary and non-monetary dimensions of poverty, reveals the opposite logic; the 12 most fragile municipalities in relation to this index are locations with a population of approximately 30,000 inhabitants. In the same logic of the PI, the sociodemographic sensitivity index (SSI), which encompasses more vulnerable population groups, shows a strong concentration of high indices in less populated municipalities, where the 19 most sensitive municipalities in terms of socio-demographic aspects are cities with up to 30,000 inhabitants.  3.1.3 Adaptive capacity index The ACI shows a greater dispersion of results among municipalities, demonstrating the importance of the improvement of infrastructure, services, institutions, and the presence of socio-political organization throughout the state. Interpretation of the indicators in relation to reality can be made according to the capacities of management, infrastructure, and municipal organizations. When applying an integrated analysis of the results of ACI and SI, it can be observed that municipalities that have low adaptive capacity, also presents high values in the sub-indices of PI and SSI that are included in the overall SI. The socioeconomic structures index (SEI) is based on the structure and generation of employment and income, and education and health. The results indicate that sixteen municipalities with SEI values equal to 1.00 are those with a population up to 40,000 inhabitants, whereas among the nine municipalities with>100,000 inhabitants, seven obtained a SEI of zero. The institutions, services, and infrastructure for adaptation index (ADApI) regarding the availability of safety institutions, risk management, health care, and Socio-political Organization Index (SOI) have a direct relationship with larger and more structured municipalities.   3.2 Climate scenarios index: CSI 4.5 and CSI 8.5 The CSI demonstrates the projected future climate conditions. There is a systematic increases the future vulnerabilities because both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 indicate, in general, a decrease in annual precipitation, increase in temperature, and increase in extreme hydrometeorological events (e.g., drought and torrential rains). Both scenarios point to a greater anomaly projected for the western mesoregion, which is a region dominated by the Amazon Biome and the CSI may therefore indicate detrimental consequences for the maintenance of this ecosystem. Specifically, CSI 8.5 predicts gradual increases in mean and maximum average temperatures, which can reach up to 5 °C in the western mesoregion. CSI 8.5 also forecasts a decrease in rainfall, for example, by an average of 30% in the western mesoregion. Similarly, CSI 4.5 also predicts significant modifications, with greater anomalies observed in the western meso -region, where an increase of up to 3.4 °C in the maximum temperature is forecast, and a reduction of > 18% in the average rainfall. It should be noted that for both scenarios, but especially for CSI 8.5, strong change is predicted for the southern, central, and western mesoregions. Interestingly, the southern meso -region is that with the lowest overall VI values, which therefore places the climatic factor as a predominate influence in this regions vulnerability.  3.3 Municipal vulnerability index The association of the VI with CSI 4.5 and CSI 8.5 generated the final MVI 4.5 and MVI 8.5, respectively. The municipalities located in the central mesoregion presented the greatest MVI 4.5 and MVI 8.5. The regions with lowest MVI in both scenarios were concentrated bordering the state, especially in the east and far south. This shows that the overlap of the evaluated vulnerabilities is specific to each mesoregion. The aspects evaluated in the VI, especially the SI and the ACI, appear to operate jointly with the CSI, thereby putting the municipalities of the central and western mesoregions in the highest categories with respect to both MVI 4.5 and MVI 8.5. On the other hand, some municipalities in the southern mesoregion fall in a higher category of climate vulnerability only in the MVI, demonstrating that the CSI is fundamental for defining the vulnerability profile of this region. The MVI was observed to be associated with the highest VI values (Fig. 8  ), which are mostly concentrated in the most vulnerable municipalities between the western and northern mesoregions, where 80% of municipalities have VI values of between 0.75 and 1 (eight municipalities in the west and eight in the north). CSI values tend to show the same pattern, whereby there appears to be a higher climate vulnerability to the west. These regions have a high MVI. The central mesoregion also stands out, especially in CSI 8.5. As this value is obtained via a single standardization for both climate scenarios, MVI 8.5 tends to exhibit the highest values in comparison to MVI 4.5. In total, 41 municipalities presented MVI 8.5 values > 0.75, 16 (39%) of which are in the western mesoregion, 14 (34%) are in the central mesoregion, and 9 (22%) are in the northern mesoregion. These regions are already vulnerable as indicated by VI analysis, and should therefore be a priority for actions to reduce vulnerability and for mitigation against climate change in order to protect their biodiversity and environmental balance.  3.4 A detailed municipal analysis - reasons for vulnerability Understanding the distributions of the indicators is fundamental for identifying the determinants of municipal vulnerabilities. To achieve this, the analysis of each sub-index, composed of the dimensions and their indicators at various levels of analysis can be taken into account to search for concrete actions, considering that specific decisions must be made for each variable. The municipalities of Santa Luzia in the western mesoregion, and Loreto in the southern mesoregion, are used as examples. Santa Luzia had the highest VI of all 217 municipalities of Maranhão, and more effort is required to reduce fragilities in social, economic, environmental, and epidemiological terms in this municipality. Loreto presents the inverse situation with lowest overall VI values. Among the vulnerability determinants of Santa Luzia, special attention was given to sensitivity; the municipality attained a SI of 0.89. Within the sensitivity matrix, the poverty index (PoI) is responsible for the aspects that define poverty; it receives greater prominence with a value of 0.80. Variables such as illiterate population over 25 years old, probability of dying before age 40, and infant mortality up to 5 years old emerged as serious issues faced by this municipality when considering the other issues encompassed by the PI – inadequate sanitation and per capita income (Figure 9). Direct and priority action on these factors would contribute considerably to the reduction of poverty and consequently the overall vulnerability of the area. This aspect is essential because poverty may act as a proxy for other issues that may increase the vulnerability of specific groups of a population (e.g., those at higher risk of food insecurity or with limited abilities to adapt to future variability and climate change). The opposite situation for the VI value is evident for Loreto (Figure 10), in which exposure and sensitivity had results very close to the low VI. This municipality had one of the lowest EI values (0.04) and a low fragility in the SI (0.13). Adaptive capacity, although somewhat higher (0.34), does not compromise the general situation of vulnerability captured by the VI, but suggests that efforts in adaptation to climate change might be given greater priority.   4 Discussion The results of this study show that climate change is an aggravating factor for socio-economic and demographic vulnerability in Maranhão. The VI can portray several general aspects, from fragility components and municipal socio-ecological vulnerability, to those resulting from environmental, health, socioeconomic, and municipal governance aspects. The MVI presented here in associates these with two expected scenarios of climate change, and highlights the population that will potentially be more affected by the selected climate change scenarios. The MVI assessment contributes to the planning and prioritization of climate adaptation strategies, and thus, the requirements of SDG 13.1. In 2018, based on the results of Confalonieri et al . (2018), the Climate Change Secretariat of the Ministry of the Environment of Brazil held two meetings to plan adaptation strategies to aid the most vulnerable municipalities in the States of Maranhão and of Pernambuco. Based on the results of the two meetings, it was identified, that the financing of adaptation strategies that improve municipal sanitation would reduce the vulnerability of the population in certain municipalities. Several variables related to sanitation, living and health conditions were encompassed in a sensitivity index (e.g., infant mortality from diarrhea, houses with inadequate sanitation, and cases of leptospirosis), which indicated that the central part of the state was the most sensitive in this regard. This demonstrates the applicability of the method we use and the use of SisVuClima to identify and monitor weaknesses within the territories. Brazilian states, as a whole, present similar realities regarding the high values observed for vulnerability indicators, as provided by common determinants. The adaptive capacity of municipalities, for example, is a limiting aspect observed in several other Brazilian states (Menezes et al. 2018 ; Santos et al ., 2019). The results show, in a general overview, a need for investment in Brazilian municipalities with regards to infrastructure sectors, and to increase resilience to climate change hazards. In indices related to poverty and climate-sensitive diseases, there are similarities between what was observed in the present study for Maranhão and another state in North Brazil, Amazonas, for which the PI and DACI were identified as the main drivers of the municipal vulnerability (Menezes et al. 2018 ). It should be noted that these two states share a similar socioeconomic reality, which evidences an emergency situation in terms of socio-environmental vulnerability in the context of the climate change, and not only for the population, but also for the loss of biodiversity and the pressure on the Amazon biome. For the southeast region of the country, in the state of Espírito Santo, Santos et al . (2019) observed that the sociodemographic aspect may be considered an aggravation to the sensitivity of the population, since socially marginalized populations (e.g., the elderly, children, and the handicapped) have greater difficulty in adapting to climate change. This aspect is similar to that found in Maranhão, where the SI made a strong contribution to the VI configuration in the central and eastern mesoregions. Sensitivity, which is very diffuse in the sense of capturing different fragilities in a single dimension, demonstrates that in general, the state of Maranhão is especially sensitive to climate change, especially with regards to poverty and socio-demographic development. Municipalities in the central and eastern mesoregions, which have many municipalities that are among the highest SI values in the state, comprise regions of greater population, especially rural settlements and small towns that have precarious infrastructures and socioeconomic development. The socioeconomic vulnerability of the state can be illustrated by the HDI values (Fig. 1 b), which are generally low. The state of Maranhão had an HDI of 0.639 in 2010, which was ranked in the penultimate place among the Brazilian states, and is comparable to countries like Bolivia and Iraq at that time (HDI 0.649 in 2010) (UNDP, 2018 ). Within the state, analysis of the municipal HDI reveals that smaller municipalities often have lower HDIs (Fig. 2 ). In 158 municipalities the HDI was considered low or very low (i.e., HDI less than 0.600), with five of these municipalities having been less than 0.500 (i.e., very low), which is comparable to countries such as Haiti (0.470 in 2010) and Afghanistan (0.463) (UNDP, 2018 ). Even with higher HDIs in comparison to other municipalities, the capital of São Luís is only ranked 15th (0.768) among the 27 national capitals, which is comparable to Venezuela (0.759) (UNDP, 2018 ). The DACI is characterized by high values, and indicates that the contributors to this index are a problem throughout the state. High values affect small municipalities with low quality of health service, to large cities that have better conditions but are pressured by the demand of the population. It is also worth highlighting the difficulties of working with some Brazilian databases, as is the case with infectious disease data. The database of the National Public Health Information System (DATASUS) exemplifies the challenge of interpreting some results. In many cases there is a concentration of number of injuries and deaths, especially in the more populated municipalities that have a better infrastructure, whereas in many municipalities that have a precarious situation, there is a lack of, or inefficiency in, data reporting. This aspect is considered to be a critical challenge in many low- and middle-income countries, since data availability on the number of cases of non-reportable infectious diseases, such as dengue fever or diarrheal disease, is limited (UNEP 2018 ). In addition to factors related to the health infrastructure, climate change itself poses an additional challenge for epidemiology of climate-related diseases, as it may lead to alterations in patterns of distribution of vectors and etiological agents. In a review by Ebi and Kristie, 2018  on the health risks due to an increase of temperature of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, the heterogeneous behavior of vector diseases in the different scenarios was evident. Leishmaniasis disease showed an increased tendency in susceptible areas in Colombia (visceral form), whereas a reduction of the climate suitability area to cutaneous vectors was projected for Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Uruguay. For Chagas disease, a reduction in vulnerability to the disease is expected, as well as in areas considered high to moderate transmission in Venezuela and Argentina, respectively. For malaria, a disease of importance in the Amazonian biome, the projections point to a 35% increase in the area favoring the transmission of the disease in South America, whereas a reduction in the areas and burden of disease in places such as China and Africa is forecast (Ebi and Kristie, 2018 ). The adaptive capacity also brings mixed results, since each group of municipalities or mesoregion has different traits in their capacity to adapt and in their formation of resilience. We observe a greater adaptation capacity in more populated municipalities, that tend to have better accessibility, infrastructure, and a more developed economy in relation to lesser populated municipalities. Cities such as São Luís, Imperatriz, Timon, and Caxias have an ACI of less than 0.2. Therefore, more than being due to a spatial characteristic of the ACI, one can perceive the importance of institutional organizations, infrastructure, and the formation of social capital to face climate changes. It is understood that these factors can contribute to the satisfaction of popular demands in various areas that directly impact the well-being, health, and social protection, thus fomenting the resilience of territories. For Maranhão, the sub-indices of socioeconomic structure (SEI) or the sub-index of institutions, services, and infrastructure for adaptation (ADApI) were observed as being more important for constituting the spatial results exhibited in the ACI. A similar result was observed in other Brazilian states, for which similar methodology was applied and where the ACI was a bottleneck for adaptation. In the states of Amazonas and Espírito Santo, for example, the structure of employment generation, income, and education in the municipalities was one of the worst performing points among the evaluated indices (Menezes et al., 2018 ; Santos et al ., 2019). The climatic scenarios—through the interpretation of the observed anomalies—make a worrying prediction for the state, especially towards the west, which is a region dominated by the Amazon Biome. Estimates of both scenarios point to an increase in temperature (between 3 °C and 5 °C) and reduction of precipitation (between 18% and 30%) for the state, mainly from the central part to the west. Associated with this projection is the fact that the region suffers intense anthropic pressure from farming activities from the border states to the south and west of the areas. The Amazon biodiversity plays a key role in the climate balance, both at regional and global levels (Menezes et al., 2018 ). Estimates suggest that the combination of deforestation with global climate change could increase the occurrence of fires in the Amazon by up to 50% by 2050, thus generating a cycle of degradation and biodiversity loss (Silvestrini et al., 2011 ). It should be noted that despite the more pronounced behavior of the anomalies towards the western mesoregion and surrounding areas, projected climate changes should alert the entire state since losses may occur in less catastrophic scenarios. Larger cities such as São Luís, which have large populations, face great challenges to plan urban space and create conditions of resilience for its inhabitants. This is because the climate already represents a great hazard in terms of the maintenance of urban services in general, for example, water supply, electricity, sewage, public transportation, and housing. Other important ecosystems can undergo alterations with sensitive changes, such as the Lençóis Maranhenses, which is a place that might suffer damage in terms of ecosystem maintenance. This would result in both environmental and economic damages because it is currently the largest exponent of tourism in Maranhão. The MVI, when added to results of the climate scenarios, acts as an alarm in terms of the potential to aggravate of existing situations. Both indices point to an overall increase in vulnerability in the western mesoregion of Maranhão. The potential pressure of the forecast climate change in the domain of the Amazonian biome could have serious consequences. Besides protecting and guaranteeing biodiversity in the fauna and flora of the Amazon, biota conservation is important because it relies on the maintenance of services for the anthropic environment. These services can act in the climate regime and in the hydrological cycle, directly impacting the economics and its diverse sectors, such as extractivism, mining, fishing, and the use of water resources, which in the face of climate change scenarios will tend to change their structure against scarce resources that are vital to human activities. In fact, this analysis of the indices in terms of biomes in Maranhão, in terms of detriment on a municipal scale, produces interesting perceptions. The central mesoregion stands out due to higher EI values, and highlights the situation of municipalities in the Cerrado biome. This area already suffers from anthropogenic pressure and has fragilities in natural aspects, which are aggravated by the precariousness of population resilience and of governance itself. In addition to high susceptibility indices, the occurrence of extreme events is also observed in the calculated indicators. The southern mesoregion, which did not obtain high EI values, is current experiencing a large expansion of the agricultural frontier that has intensified in the last 10 years. This is known as MATOPIBA and was formed by areas in the south of Maranhão, the entire Tocantins territory, south of Piauí, and west of Bahia. This area represents the country's newest agricultural frontier, where>10% of the national soybeans are produced even though its cultivated area has only recently been occupied (SEPLAN, 2011 ). Although the Caatinga biome represents a small portion of the state, the municipalities in this biome (extreme east) exhibit a set of adverse conditions due to the climate and vegetation variants, are were determined as being of intermediate vulnerability in the VI. This relationship between population vulnerability, lower socioeconomic power, disorderly occupation, and lack of continuous policies, especially for populations exposed to drought, has already been evidenced for Brazil by Santos et al.  (2019) and Freitas et al.  (2014). From the results obtained in this study, it is evident that the state of Maranhão, and Brazil as a whole, still need to evolve in order to accomplish the SDGs agreed for 2030, and thus contribute to reducing the vulnerability of the population. For some goals, the country has already produced the indicators needed to monitor progress. For example, mortality rate attributed to unsafe water sources, unsafe sanitation, and lack of hygiene for SDG 3 (good health and well-being), and the share of renewable energies in the domestic energy supply in SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) (IBGE, 2018 ). However, with regards to SDG 13, only two indicators have so far been produced in Brazil to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning. Most of the other indicators do not appear to present a methodology that is based on the guidelines of the SDG itself. The achievement of SDG 13 has been a constant challenge for international governments. Thus, in terms of international politics, in addition to hosting Rio + 20, where important discussions were established that expanded on the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), in 2015 Brazil was present in the discussion of the SDGs in Agenda 2030, with Latin American offering important leadership in this field. Regarding internal policy, progress has been underway in Brazil since 2009 through the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC, instituted by Law 12, 187 of 2009), which officialized Brazil's voluntary agreement to reduce GHG emissions by 36.1% and 38.9% of projected emissions by 2020 (Segunda Comunicação, 2010 ). In 2016, the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) was promulgated a result of debates and studies among members of the federal government and states, private sector, and society (MMA, 2016 ). SisVuClima aims to contribute a tool that presents scenarios where the partnership of local managers becomes an important means for assisting decision making and SDG achievement. By enabling the acknowledgment and updating of the component variables, the software allows the vulnerability of the municipalities to be monitored using the updated data, and also allows technical staff and academics to use the software as a means of enabling its improvement and adaptation for better use. SisVuClima allows vulnerability to climate change in Brazilian municipalities to be analyzed, thereby aiding the managers to cope with vulnerability situations as revealed by the proposed indicators. It also contributes to the studies and adaptation plans regarding vulnerability amelioration at local and regional levels. The use of SisVuClima by academicians and technical staff allows the appropriation of the methodology used in the study, and demonstrates the indices generated from the variables, making the software available for consultation use. In conjunction with the transparency of the system, it also allows indicators to be updated through the input of new data obtained from government institution databases. Thus, in addition to continuously updated vulnerability calculations, the system allows for data appropriation by the scientific community in order to encourage future modifications and improvements in the system and methodology.  5 Conclusions The present study shows the feasibility of building municipal indicators of the population’s vulnerability to climate change for the state of Maranhão, using secondary data and considering local socio-ecological and health conditions that contribute to vulnerability. The development of the indicators was achieved through the engagement of local stakeholders and the use of a technological tool, SisVuClima, which facilitates the storage and updating of official data via a scientifically robust methodology. SisVuClima allows results to be presented in different ways that enable multiple analyses, and has proved to be a useful instrument for planning strategies for adapting to climate change, that contribute to reducing the vulnerability of the population and consequently increase their resilience and adaptive capacity to climate hazards (SDG 13.1). In addition, it was observed throughout the development of the tool, that the process of engagement of national and state stakeholders involved from the planning stage effectively contributes to attracting them to the process (SDG 13.2). Actions developed at the national and state levels benefit the populations of municipalities, many of them urban, through improvements in service infrastructure, such as sanitation, health, and education. The assessment of the results of this study, and of planning of strategies that contribute to reaching SDGs 13.1 and 13.2, are relevant for the municipalities of Maranhão. Given the fragile socioeconomic conditions of the population of Maranhão, efforts to reduce vulnerability in all aspects presented in this study will challenge current and future management. In addition to population vulnerability, an environmental concern exists with regard to parts of three of the great Brazilian biomes being located in Maranhão. These biomes have experienced increasing anthropic pressure, including that related to mineral resources, water, land use, and other economic activities that put at risk the integrity of ecosystems if not correctly managed. We recognize that there is a time restriction on the official country and state databases, which makes it difficult to update the indicators. However, such limitations do not invalidate the analysis, rather they encourage discussion about the data used, the quality and availability of databases, and the national and local institutions. This in turn plays a key role in determining the accuracy and measurement of the problem being studied. In this context, the role of public management is fundamental from the outset; management can create more effective database and improve existing databases to allow for an improved accuracy in results. Furthermore, by elaborating the existing tools, it will be possible to improve the general framework of population vulnerability assessment.
