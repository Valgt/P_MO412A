                  Producing enough food of sufficient quality to feed an ever increasing population faces many challenges. This will require higher yields from agricultural production to meet the demands of changing population demographics using the limited natural resources available. Crop protection chemicals, developed by the agrochemical industry, are used by growers to ensure that consistently high yields are obtained, provide ease and reliability of harvest and to maintain excellent quality of produce from the crops they grow. This article details the importance of crop protection chemicals, the process from invention to registration and how green and sustainable chemistry is applicable at each stage of their development.

Table 1   Entry Green Chemistry Principle (GCP)   1 It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed.  2 Synthetic methods should be designed to maximise the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product.  3 Wherever practicable, synthetic methodologies should be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity to human health and the environment.  4 Chemical products should be designed to preserve efficacy of function while reducing toxicity.  5 The use of auxiliary substances (e.g. solvents, separation agents, etc.) should be made unnecessary wherever possible and innocuous when used.  6 Energy requirements should be recognised for their environmental and economic impacts and should be minimised. Synthetic methods should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure.  7 A raw material or feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting wherever technically and economically practicable.  8 Reduce derivatives – Unnecessary derivatization (blocking group, protection/deprotection, temporary modification) should be avoided whenever possible.  9 Catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) are superior to stoichiometric reagents.  10 Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their function they do not persist in the environment and break down into innocuous degradation products.  11 Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to allow for real-time, in-process monitoring and control prior to the formation of hazardous substances.  12 Substances and the form of a substance used in a chemical process should be chosen to minimise potential for chemical accidents, including releases, explosions, and fires.

This will require higher yields from agricultural production to meet the demands of changing population demographics using the limited natural resources available. Crop protection chemicals, developed by the agrochemical industry, are used by growers to ensure that consistently high yields are obtained, provide ease and reliability of harvest and to maintain excellent quality of produce from the crops they grow. This article details the importance of crop protection chemicals, the process from invention to registration and how green and sustainable chemistry is applicable at each stage of their development.    Introduction The population of the world is predicted to rise to over nine billion by 2050 with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) projecting that global food production will need to grow by 60% from 2005/7 levels to support increased demand [1] . The challenges associated with increased agricultural output for food production are numerous including land use and management, availability and security of water supplies, climate change, demand for biofuels and pest pressure on crop yields. Sustainably increasing the average yield of the world's major crops without placing additional burdens on limited resources, such as land and water, will be an important contributor to meeting the target of zero hunger by 2030, the second of the seventeen UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [2] . Improved agricultural practices may help to realise additional SDGs with initiatives by Syngenta [3]  and others [4–8]  highlighting the contribution of the agrochemical industry in achieving the ambitious targets proposed by the UN. This article will focus on the discovery and development of crop protection (CP) chemicals which are used to combat pests, examples of green chemistry principles (GCPs) [9]  in their innovation and a perspective on the future contribution of the agrochemical industry to the SDGs. Crop protection chemicals Estimating reductions in crop yield caused by weeds, insect pests and fungal pathogens is challenging with reports suggesting average potential losses can vary from 50% in wheat to over 80% in cotton [10,11] . These losses can be mitigated, in part, by effective crop protection strategies (Figure 1  ) the foremost of which is the application of CP chemicals. The sales of these CP chemicals alone contributed global revenues of $49.9bn to the $92bn agribusiness in 2016 [12] . The need for new CP chemicals is continuous as re-registration programmes and instances of biological resistance reduce the number of CP chemicals available to growers. The development of new CP chemicals with novel modes of action and sustainable environmental profiles will be key to addressing these issues [13] . The process of bringing a new CP chemical to market begins with the design and synthesis of novel chemical compounds which are tested for their biological efficacy. Safe, scalable routes for the manufacture of potential CP chemicals are developed and optimised formulation mixtures are determined. Each new CP chemical must be registered for use requiring extensive testing to ensure it has an acceptable safety profile. This article will address each of the stages in the development of a CP chemical and provide examples of how green and sustainable chemistry (Table 1  ) contribute to the process.  Chemical research The primary focus for research programmes is to rapidly identify a candidate molecule which fits the holistic profile required of a CP chemical (Figure 2  ) to enter development. The combined R&D process may take over ten years and $260m to complete with the agrochemical industry spending an estimated $2.9bn in 2016 on CP chemical R&D [14] . Key to this effort is the design and synthesis of novel chemicals during which as many as 140,000 compounds may need to be assessed for each final compound that is registered for use. The nature of the target pests allows for direct phenotypic in vivo  screening of research chemicals. Modern biological screens for the front end of research are now miniaturised to generate maximum biological data from minimal sample sizes so that <2 mg can be used to screen across all indications as a primary efficacy filter thus reducing waste in chemical synthesis (GCP 1). Before synthetic efforts begin, sophisticated in silico  methods are used to aid compound design, predict physical and chemical properties or assess pesticide “likeness” [15]  avoiding unnecessary synthesis as well as improving the quality of compounds for screening (GCP 1). The design of new compounds is multidimensional as CP chemicals must be biologically efficacious, degrade in the environment and be safe to non-target organisms (GCPs 4 and 10). A recent example which illustrates these points is the discovery of the synthetic auxin herbicide Halauxifen-methyl (Table 2  ). The first commercial pyridine-carboxylic acid auxin herbicide Picloram was serendipitously discovered in the late 1950s as a soil metabolite of experimental nitrification inhibitors [16] . Electrochemical reduction of Picloram led to the discovery of Aminopyralid which exhibited significantly greater herbicidal activity against many key dicotyledonous weeds than Picloram. Further synthesis showed that replacing the 6-chloro substituent in Aminopyralid with halogenated phenyl moieties provided compounds with increased herbicidal potency but unacceptable persistence in soil. By incorporating a methoxy group [17]  Halauxifen-methyl was discovered which has a reduced soil half-life of 10–25 days, is active at low application rates and has been registered globally for use in a number of crops [18] . Speed is an essential factor in exploratory research projects and the focus is rapidly exploring as much chemical space as is necessary to deliver project goals. At times, foregoing atom economy, the use of protecting groups or derivatives (GCPs 2 and 8) is justified in order to rapidly produce novel compounds for screening. However, extensive use of catalytic methods (GCP 9) such as metal-catalysed cross coupling reactions [19] , C-H activation chemistry [20] , photochemistry [21] , electrochemistry [22]  and biocatalysis [23]  is made whenever possible. Indeed recent reports from Syngenta have described the use of iridium-catalysed C–H borylation followed by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling [24]  as well as C-H arylation chemistry [25]  in the synthesis of herbicidally relevant chemical scaffolds.  Analytical chemistry The GCPs can be adapted for analytical chemistry [26]  which plays a crucial role in CP chemical R&D (GCP 11). Modern analytical techniques use more benign derivatizing agents, faster and miniaturised methods requiring less solvent (GCP 5) and significantly less sample material allowing for more experiments per run, all of which reduce waste (GCP 1). The use of experimental design [27]  further reduces the chemical input required to obtain the maximum amount of data when developing new analytical methods. The effort to replace existing solvent mixtures with more sustainable alternatives [28]  was recently exemplified in the extraction and analysis of RNA, a biological macromolecule with potential for use as a CP chemical [29] . Previous methods for RNA extraction from cell cultures utilised combinations of guanidinium isothiocyanate, phenol or chloroform and it was found that sodium chloride in combination with sodium dodecyl sulfate could be used in their place to provide RNA in good yield and high quality [30] .  Manufacture Safe, scalable and cost effective manufacturing routes to CP chemicals must be developed to meet the commercial volumes required, typically 100–1000 tonnes per annum , with E  factors [31]  therefore between 5 and 50. Key to the success of any manufacturing route is efficient, ideally convergent, syntheses and the optimisation of chemical yield for each transformation thereby reducing the volume and toxicity of waste produced (GCPs 1 and 2). Operating at these scales necessitates process integration, maximum volume productivity, the recycling of solvents and catalysts, avoiding protecting groups (GCP 8) as well as minimising the energy input required to run a manufacturing process. This can produce innovative chemistry as described in a recent report on the synthetic routes to recently registered CP chemicals [32] . Notable examples of CP chemical manufacture include the world's largest application by annual production volume of a Suzuki–Miyaura reaction in the synthesis of Boscalid by BASF [33]  and the world's largest catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation process in the synthesis of S-metolachlor by Syngenta (GCP 9) [34] . Where the biological activity of a chiral CP chemical is expressed by a particular stereoisomer(s) it is clearly desirable from both a commercial and environmental point of view to manufacture only this active species [35] . By producing the more active (S )-isomers of metolachlor [36]  a lower application rate is achieved, reducing the amount of CP chemical applied to the environment as well as levels of packaging material and the amount of energy required to produce, ship and store the product. The future of CP chemical manufacturing will involve continued innovation to reduce the amount of waste produced by introducing new methodologies such as continuous processing [37] , oxidations with benign reagents [38]  and renewable bio-derived feedstocks [39]  where appropriate (GCPs 1 and 7).  Formulation Most CP chemicals are applied to the environment as formulated mixtures in order to ensure optimum biological performance. Optimised formulations may provide further advantages to the grower such as improved operator safety, ease of application and increased storage time (GCPs 3 and 4). Over sixty different types of formulation exist and the exact formulation mixture and type for each CP chemical needs to be determined to meet expected levels of performance. This task is made more difficult as most modern agrochemical products contain more than one CP chemical. As with the CP chemical contained in the mixture all other formulants must have a favourable environmental profile and strict regulatory requirements must be met before new components are introduced. Where a solvent is required to generate a CP chemical concentrate, water or inert organic solvents are used. Recently some regulatory bodies have restricted the use of certain organic solvents (e.g. DMF and NMP) necessitating their replacement. A notable example of a novel solvent is dimethyl lactamide [40]  which has a favourable environmental and regulatory profile in addition to its useful solvent properties. The incorporation of adjuvants in formulations provides benefits such as improved uptake, systemicity or lower operator exposure since overall bioavailability is increased and the amount of CP chemical required to give the desired biological effect is reduced (GCP 4). There are numerous examples of improved performance through the use of adjuvants such as those for the natural product insecticide Abamectin [41]  and the selective herbicide Pinoxaden [42] . Other formulation components are designed to improve other operations such as spray performance or leaf wetting and may be derived from renewable plant-based feedstocks including dispersants [43]  and polysaccharide hydrophiles in electrolyte-tolerant surfactants (GCPs 7) [44] . Additionally formulations consisting of co-crystals [45]  of a CP chemical and a suitable coformer molecule may lead to modified physical properties, such as water solubility [46] , which could lead to reduced loss of the CP chemical to the environment (GCPs 4 and 10).  Product safety Before a CP chemical is registered for use, extensive studies are conducted to ensure that its application has an acceptable safety profile in the environment, non-target organisms, agricultural operators (SDG 3) and the consumers of the food that will eventually be produced (GCPs 4 and 10). This is achieved by generating detailed risk assessments of the CP chemical and its degradation products in plants, soil and water in addition to elucidating their distribution and rate of movement in these environments. Increasingly this can be predicted using in silico [47]  and in vitro  model studies before in vivo  studies are conducted to satisfy the stringent and specific regulatory requirements throughout the world.  Future outlook As the world population and demand for agricultural products continues to increase so too will the output from growers to meet the projected augmented production requirements. The use of CP chemicals will continue to bring benefits to the grower including those described above and ensure that catastrophic crop failures, like the Irish potato famine of the 1840s, remain historical events. Current innovations in agricultural practices such as digital farming and precision agriculture [48]  may allow for the sustainable application of next generation CP chemicals at the specific time, in the right place and correct amount with greater accuracy than before. Novel CP chemicals will undoubtedly be required for the foreseeable future to combat biological resistance to existing products, to address changing pest pressures, new regulatory demands and to fulfil the requirement for still higher yields in the future. This article has outlined, in discrete sections, how CP chemicals are discovered and brought to the market. Presently this is a multi-parallel process where the holistic profile of a CP chemical is considered at the early stages of an R&D programme. Chemistries which can never be successful are discarded early, thereby improving productivity in the industry. Innovative chemical and non-chemical solutions will also be required to combat abiotic stresses [49]  on crop yield brought about by heat, drought and soil salinity as well as combating losses in arable land (SDG 15). Despite the recent consolidation in the agrochemical sector, investment in agrochemical R&D will continue, ensuring that CP chemicals will play a key role in making crops more efficient to help meet the target of zero hunger by 2030 (SDG 2).
