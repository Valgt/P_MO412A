Introduction Around 22 millions years ago, a monkey abandoned the relative safety of the trees of the tropical forest in East Africa to start an amazing adventure crossing the millennia. Seizing the new opportunities of nourishment offered by the savanna and learning to survive the threats to life, in a process extremely rapid in evolutionary terms, this monkey went forward our biped ancestors. From first appearance, its primary goal was securing food to its community and its descendants. For most of the following ages, its diet of consisted only of grasses, of fruits collected from prairie trees and of small animals hunted, and of insects. Things changed 200.000 years ago, with the coming of Homo sapiens . This new species started to develop what we would have called technology. They also learnt to spare part of the preys captured in order to secure milk and meat through breeding; to store a sufficient portion of the seeds collected for planting, thereby setting agriculture. Birth of agriculture ensured enough food for mankind survival and led to the rise of the first civilizations in India and Middle East. Despite this progress, a succession of abundance and famine periods still marked the rise and fall of empires and nations along centuries, spreading conflicts and welfare disparities among and within populations. Until just two centuries ago, modern scientific discoveries enabled man to disengage from dynamic cycles of nature through the development of techniques of plant cultivation and pest control, as well as of food sanitation, storage, transport and packaging. For industrial Western countries, this meant food security to most people, although the benefits were less than partial in the rest of the world, with severe social and political inequalities still persistent today. Most importantly, the tremendous advances in science and technology gathered in the last century have been unbalanced by the accurate evaluation of the impact of the human activity on nature, environment and the human society itself. As a consequence, the delicate balance between human progress and exhausting of world resources appears today to be broken. One of the sectors where these outcomes are more dramatically apparent is the food production system, which is currently experiencing increasing pressure both on the demand side (from growing population and consumer demands) and on the supply side (from greater competition for inputs and from climate change). Despite the commendable but isolated efforts, announcements and even signed agreements of governments, international organizations and agencies, effective and coordinated initiatives aimed at improving food sustainability and security remained at an early stage until now.  The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations On September 2015 the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in New York established the 2030 global agenda for sustainable development and defined a new list of objectives on which to focus commitments for the next fifteen years. The SDGs, in their aim replace and broaden the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) expiring last year with a less than satisfactory balance: about 1 billion people still live under the threshold for poverty set by the World Bank, and almost the same number do not have enough food for themselves. In 2012 it was already indubitable that the MDGs would not be achieved. Therefore, during the Conference of Rio in 2013, it was decided to launch the UN Open Group, which last year unveiled the new master plan development for the planet. Unlike the MDGs, which were produced by a handful of experts of the UN, to define the SDGs, UN launched the largest consultation program of its history to probe the most largely accepted opinion on what the SDGs were to include. The biggest difference is that while the MDGs were considered development goals for the least developed countries, to be achieved thanks to the efforts of the “wealthiest” Member States, this time, each country is expected to work to comply with it. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) expressed by the Summit - with 169 related targets - are the result of a work of public consultation and multi-stakeholder involvement lasted two years. The vision placed into them is that of a world inclusive, equitable and ecologically friendly. Thus, the SDGs intend to represent a new set of goals, targets and indicators that all  UN Member States will be required to pursue to frame their political agendas over the next 15 years. In fact, as declaimed at item 28, nations commit themselves ‘to making fundamental changes in the way that our societies produce and consume goods and services’. Each SDGs reflects and identify a main area of development, from fighting poverty to action on climate, from woman empowerment to decent work and economic growth for the planet. Also agricultural production and health have been among the mainstay sectors at the SDGs. The SDGs are an important vision, and may eventually assist to move the world to a sustainable path (Sachs, 2012 ). However, in the path between now and 2030, this perspective needs to be substantiated with contents that for me should be focused on two aspects: i) defining global priorities through objective quantitative evaluation measurement studies, and allocating on these priorities active worldwide public participation policies; and ii) careful evaluation of the shortcomings of previous programs (such as MDGs) to effect the necessary corrections by the maximum inclusive discussion and debate. If SDGs will be (not merely formally) accepted by a large part of countries and will be made applicable at global scale by coordinated (international policies, they will have the capacity to trace for humanity the new route to achieve a real sustainable progress respectful of the world's priorities. The first steps in this direction (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org ) are encouraging but still need to be implemented. In my opinion, three are the main issues that SDGs must imperatively address: i) access to food and health to everyone; ii) sustainable production, and iii) adaptation to global changes. First, concerted food policies, to be undertaken not only by industrialized countries but including developing nations, will be fundamental in designing not only more secure access to food, but also a more peaceful world, and this underlines the primary importance of achieving the SDGs. Regarding the second issue, modern intensive agriculture and industry are not sustainable and have major global environmental impacts: land clearing and habitat fragmentation that threaten biodiversity (Dirzo and Raven, 2003 ), greenhouse gas emissions and use of fertilizers (Burney et al., 2010 ), depletion of world's natural energy reservoir (oil, carbon, natural gas). To further stress this endangered system, global changes (not only regarding climate, but also political and social changes if we consider the many violent local conflicts) are continuing to degrade ecosystem and agricultural landscape, further undermining their future productive capacity. This scenario will have severe economic and social consequences. Those above are also the topic the substantiate the Section on Food Sustainability, Security and Effects of Global Change (Ferranti, 2016 ) of the Reference Module in Food Science launched by Elsevier last year. This Section deals with the new and dramatic scenarios facing food science in this century and is a synopsis of the path modern society is currently taking with respect to securing food in a sustainable manner for a growing population, all in an environment of unprecedented global change (climate, social, economic). Man, like at his beginning as a species, is approaching a new turning point in his long way to keep on existence. As indicated by SDGs, food sustainability and security are the milestones of this path, in addressing the topical issues of, for example, the impact of climate change on food resources, biodiversity and global food security. Solving these challenges will not be easy and will rely on integration of political actions and advance of knowledge from different disciplines in order to strengthen the capacity to generate and share research data, not only within the scientific community but also within the industrial world and society in general. The development, optimization, validation and application of novel technologies for food production and manufacture are a fine example and will be critical in securing nutrition to the whole mankind in a sustainable way. The SDGs shows that developed countries have neither the ability nor the right to direct the development policies on behalf of the developing ones, but these decisions and solutions must necessarily be shared by the greatest number of the political subjects. A potential ‘game-changer’ in the scenario is the rising economic power of China and India. Both these countries are considered developing nations, but they're increasingly influencing global food trade and policy, not the least of which because they house a large proportion of the world's population (Chen and Ravallion, 2008 ). The SDGs also underline that importance of game payers such as international organizations, whose role has been often criticized for their static, irrelevant, and politicized positions.  The Roadmap to Future World The tools available to the smart monkey today are much more advanced than in the past, but also more sharp and dangerous, even without thinking to war weapons. Today, we have the ability to change dramatically, for the better or worse, the environment and the ecosystems in which we live. Limiting ourselves to nutrition, it is now clear for example that our current consumption of animal meat is not sustainable from the energy and environmental viewpoint. Novel technologies offer now the opportunity to replace meat (however I hope we will still enjoy a succulent steak from time to time to time) with other protein sources such as new legumes resilient to drought and salinity stress or to climatic change. Another promising source is – can you believe? – from insects, almost closing a circle in the human diet habits tracing back to far ages. Other options are based on organic farming with lower environmental impact. All these opportunities are of course in line with the objectives of the 17 SDGs. However they are also introducing new challenges, for instance from the nutritional point of view: will the new legumes be as much productive as sustainable? Will insect proteins in the diet be a source a novel and unknown food allergens? The road to food security and sustainability is still long and windy, but the direction appear to be traced.
