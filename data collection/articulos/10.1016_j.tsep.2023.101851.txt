                  Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) have shown great potential to replace conventional heating and cooling systems in many regions. They also have a significant contribution to the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper aims to investigate the advancements, applications, research trends related to GSHPs, and the challenges and barriers that face their development based on a bibliometric analysis. The results show that in recent years, a considerable growth in GSHP’s research has been recognized, with a focus on heating more than cooling, which is due to the fact that GSHP is more suitable for cold regions. The major part of the research done on GSHPs in relation to the SDGs focused on SDG 7, followed by SDG 13. This is mainly due to the direct relation between GSHPs and the environment. However, it was also found that GSHPs have a crucial contribution to the other SDGs, but there was insufficient work dedicated to investigating such relations. Based on the interpretation of the bibliometric analysis, it was deduced that most of the challenges and barriers to GSHPs are related to the capital cost, groundwater contamination, regulations, subsidies, and incentives.

They also have a significant contribution to the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper aims to investigate the advancements, applications, research trends related to GSHPs, and the challenges and barriers that face their development based on a bibliometric analysis. The results show that in recent years, a considerable growth in GSHP’s research has been recognized, with a focus on heating more than cooling, which is due to the fact that GSHP is more suitable for cold regions. The major part of the research done on GSHPs in relation to the SDGs focused on SDG 7, followed by SDG 13. This is mainly due to the direct relation between GSHPs and the environment. However, it was also found that GSHPs have a crucial contribution to the other SDGs, but there was insufficient work dedicated to investigating such relations. Based on the interpretation of the bibliometric analysis, it was deduced that most of the challenges and barriers to GSHPs are related to the capital cost, groundwater contamination, regulations, subsidies, and incentives.

Various strategies have been considered to control the global warming such as improving the efficiency of the current energy conversion process via waste heat recovery [4–6] ; using efficient energy conversion devices with low or no environmental impacts such as fuel cells [7–9]  that powered with environmentally friendly fuels, i.e., hydrogen [10] , methanol [11–14] , ethanol [15–18] , urea [19–21] , and wastewater [22–24] ; and rely on renewable energy sources [25,26]  such as solar energy [27–29] , biomass energy [30–33] , wind energy [34–36] , ocean energy [37,38] , and geothermal energy [39,40] . Geothermal energy has the merit that is could be continuously used if proper used. The United Nations adopted the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, which includes 17 goals and 169 targets. The SDGs seek to eradicate poverty, protect the environment, and ensure that all people live in peace and prosperity [41–44] . These goals are universal, integrated, and indivisible, which means that they apply to all countries and stakeholders, acknowledge that actions in one area affect outcomes in others, and must be achieved in an integrated and indivisible manner. The SDGs are a call to action for all countries and stakeholders to work together to create a more sustainable future. That no one should be left behind and that economic growth should be both inclusive and sustainable is a foundational tenet of the SDGs [45,46] . Linking business and industry to the SDGs is vital for various reasons [47–49] , including addressing global challenges, creating long-term value, improving reputation and brand value, risk mitigation, facilitating stakeholders’ involvement, meeting regulatory requirements, and creating new chances for innovation. The SDGs seek to address some of the most serious global challenges, such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation [50] . Companies can play an important role in tackling these difficulties and contributing to a more sustainable future by tying business and industry to the SDGs. Companies that connect their operations and strategy with the SDGs may generate long-term value for their businesses by positioning themselves to benefit from the rising demand for sustainable goods and services [51] . Companies that relate their company to the SDGs may boost their reputation and brand value by showing a commitment to sustainable development and social responsibility [52] . This may enable stakeholder engagement by offering a shared framework for communication and cooperation with stakeholders such as consumers, suppliers, investors, and communities. By tying business and industry to the SDGs, organizations may manage risks connected with environmental, social, and governance challenges that may damage their operations and reputation. Many countries are establishing legislation and policies to support the SDGs; hence, firms may be better prepared to satisfy these legal needs and avoid possible fines. This can also allow for generating new opportunities for innovation, such as producing new goods and services that meet community and environmental needs. Overall, connecting business and industry to the SDGs may help organizations produce long-term value, minimize risks, enhance reputation, satisfy regulatory obligations, and provide chances for innovation while contributing to a more sustainable future [53] . The recent focus on the achievement of the SDGs has elevated the interest in developing several technologies, including energy storage [54–56] , waste heat recovery [57–59] , and renewable energy-based systems [60–62] . The current development in the energy sector has shown great potential for contributing to the SDGs [63,64] . This is mainly due to the significant economic and environmental effects of energy-related systems. One of these technologies that has shown superior performance compared to traditional systems is the ground source heat pump (GSHP), which uses shallow ground layers to heat and cool buildings, working as an air conditioner. It transfers heat to or from the ground using a loop of fluid-filled pipes buried underground, which is known as the ground loop. GSHPs are highly efficient; they can deliver up to four times more energy than they consume, making them a cost-effective way for heating and cooling. They are also known for their low environmental impact and durability as they don't emit pollutants or greenhouse gases. They have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease dependency on fossil fuels, which is beneficial for the environment and tackling climate change [65] . GSHPs are versatile and can be used for a wide range of building types and sizes, including single-family homes, apartment buildings, commercial buildings, and industrial facilities. Ground loops used for GSHPs can be installed using a variety of techniques, depending on the site conditions, such as horizontal trenches, vertical boreholes, and pond or lake loops. GSHPs require less maintenance than other heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and they have a long service life of up to 25 years or more [66,67] . In this study, bibliometric analysis was used as a tool to investigate various aspects related to GSHPs. This includes the associated developments, applications, challenges, barriers, and contributions to the SDGs. The paper is divided into seven main sections, including this introduction. The next section shows a detailed background on GSHPs, including their different types. The methodology used in this study is described in section 3 . The results and discussions that are based on the bibliometric analysis are shown in section 4 . Section 5  presents the recommendations for future research studies and investigations. The conclusions and main outcomes of this research are presented in section 6 .  2 Background A ground source heat pump (GSHP) operates based on the same refrigeration cycle as a traditional air source heat pump (ASHP) [68,69] . The evaporator, compressor, condenser, and expansion valve are its four primary parts. A schematic diagram of the typical GSHP is shown in Fig. 1  . A standard heat exchanger can be utilized to directly heat or cool the conditioned space using the heat rejected from the condenser or the heat absorbed by the evaporator. Traditional heat pumps and underfloor heating are two examples of the various HVAC systems in which GSHPs have been used. Similar to the ASHP, it can be used to deliver heating and cooling by managing the flowing direction of the working fluid through the various refrigeration cycle components using the directional control valve. In the case of heating, for example, the indoor and outdoor heat exchangers are referred to as the condenser and evaporator, respectively. The main distinction between GSHP and ASHP is that the former uses the earth as a heating/cooling source rather than air [70] . Because the temperature of the ground is nearly constant compared to that of the air, this gives it more stability and higher performance. The temperatures and pressures of the cycle may be selected more precisely to run under ideal circumstances, allowing for the best possible coefficient of performance (COP). Furthermore, the ground source is better suited for both heating and cooling applications because during the day, the temperature of the earth is often lower than that of the surrounding air, but it is higher at night. Additionally, it is more ecologically friendly, especially when compared to other heating systems that rely on the combustion of fuels. The high capital installation cost of GSHP is its main drawback when compared to traditional cooling and heating systems. From this perspective, open loop and horizontal ground heat exchanger (GHE) systems are favorable compared to vertical GHE systems. There are three main types of GSHPs: ground-water heat pump (GWHP), surface water heat pump (SWHP), and ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP). 2.1 Ground-water heat pump (GWHP) Deep and shallow GE systems employ open loops to take subsurface water, use it, and then inject it back into the earth [71] . Ponds and wells are the two primary sources of groundwater that can be employed in heating and cooling applications. To extract or inject heat from/into the well, GWHPs typically use open ground loop systems. In addition to having an acceptable initial cost, GWHPs perform the best among GSHPs. However, they have a few downsides, such as thermal short circuit and water pollution. They are also less frequently built than closed loop systems since they need a significant volume of groundwater to function normally. The thermal short circuit, which reflects the impact of injection on extraction, is one of the fundamental drawbacks of open loops. This mainly occurs in the standing column well (SCW) system, which is depicted in Fig. 2  b. Without a separator between the two lines, water is produced and injected into the same well [72,73] . This is the basic setup of the SCW system; however, it may occasionally be advised to reinject some of the water into another nearby well to improve groundwater flow. Efforts have been made to identify a few potential solutions to reduce the impact of thermal short circuit, such as the use of two wells or one well with two screens. The latter strategy might be seen as more desirable because of its reasonable cost. In a two-well system, the rejection well is separated from the extraction well, as seen in Fig. 2 a. This separation is often carried out to prevent interference between the injected and extracted water. By injecting the water at a distance from the extraction well to promote greater groundwater flow, the performance of the GWHP may be further improved. Another method to reduce the effect of thermal short circuit without the need for two wells is to use a packer to separate the injection and production sections. For the proper circulation of working fluid, both pipes must be perforated, as seen in Fig. 2 c. The term used to define this technique is “open loop geothermal system” (OLGS). However, the thickness of the geothermal reservoir has a considerable impact on the performance of vertical well OLGS. As a result, horizontal well OLGS may be used in a wider range of situations, particularly where there are thin geothermal reservoirs (see Fig. 2 d) [74,75] . In both OLGSs, it is essential to surround the production pipe with insulation to reduce the heat transfer with the injected water.  2.2 Surface-water heat pump (SWHP) The SWHP is another type of water source heat pumps that also requires the presence of groundwater, but this system relies on other kinds of water sources, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and seas [76] . Unlike GWHPs, SWHPs are available as both open and closed loop systems (see Fig. 3  ) [77] . Water is pushed from the water supply to the heat pump and then returned far from the extraction point in the open loop design (see Fig. 3 a). A heat exchanger is utilized in the closed loop SWHP to allow heat transfer between the heat pump and the groundwater. As opposed to an open loop, the closed loop arrangement uses less pumping power, which results in cheaper operational costs. Coiled GHEs are frequently used in closed loop SWHPs, as seen in Fig. 3 b. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is mostly used as the pipe material for such heat exchangers. Given its flexibility and excellent thermal characteristics, HDPE is a good choice for these applications.  2.3 Ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) The closed loop GSHPs category includes GCHPs, which operate similarly to closed loop SWHPs. The key distinction is that the GCHP uses the earth as a heat source or sink instead of water. Heat is transferred between the ground and heat pump using a GHE. Vertical, horizontal, and coiled GHEs are the three basic varieties that might be applied in a GCHP. The type of GHE has a significant impact on the system's cost and performance. According to Fig. 4  , GCHPs may be broadly divided into direct expansion GCHPs [78]  and secondary loop GCHPs [79] . The evaporator and condenser of a GCHP can be put directly into the ground; this type of GCHP is known as a “direct exchange” or “direct expansion” GCHP (see Fig. 4 b). In this arrangement, the GHE, which is typically constructed of copper tubes, receives the refrigerant directly. However, as shown in Fig. 4 a, the majority of GCHPs use an intermediary loop between the ground and the heat pump. The GHE used in the secondary loop GCHP, which is typically made of HDPE pipes, is employed to allow the circulation of water or antifreeze fluid. Since just one heat exchanger is used, the direct exchange GCHP often performs better than the secondary loop GCHP. However, the usage of direct exchange GCHP is limited to small units because of the pressure drop effect, which might negatively affect its performance in applications where large GHEs are required.  2.4 Ground heat exchangers (GHEs) The GHE is an essential component of a closed loop GSHP in which the fluid circulates to exchange heat with the ground [80] . The fluid that is moving might be water, antifreeze, refrigerant, or a combination of these. The vertical, horizontal, and coiled types of GHEs are covered in this section [81] . To achieve the geothermal system's optimum performance, choosing the right GHE design is crucial [82,83] . The design of an appropriate GHE involves a number of factors, such as ground thermal characteristics, borehole thermal resistance, load, etc. A vertical ground heat exchanger (VGHE) typically has a depth between 50 and 150 m. Since installing VGHEs requires extensive drilling, they are quite costly. It is frequently referred to as a borehole heat exchanger (BHE), and less commonly as a downhole heat exchanger (DHE). BHEs are very effective because, as depth increases, the ground temperature rises during the heating season and falls during the cooling season in relation to ambient air temperature [84,85] . There are several different VGHE setups, which are primarily categorized as coaxial and U-tube [86] . In the coaxial configuration, one pipe or more are placed inside a large pipe. The fluid can enter either the inner or outer pipe(s) in one of the two distinct flow directions. Usually, in VGHEs, the pipes are encased with backfilled material, also known as grout. The BHE's performance highly depends on the grout material in several ways. It keeps the GHE pipes in their installed form and guards against damage. The grout material must possess the best possible mechanical and thermal characteristics. One of the factors that has huge impact on the performance of the GHE is the grout's thermal conductivity [87,88] . Traditionally, the most popular forms of grout materials were bentonite and cement. However, the most modern varieties of grout are constructed from combinations of several materials that also incorporate supplementary additives intended to improve the overall rate of heat transmission. The two most widely utilized forms of additives are sand and graphite. The mixing ratio, which should be based on a balance between both the mechanical and thermal characteristics of the grout mix, is one of the most crucial factors in this respect. The grout can also function as a storage medium in specific applications. Phase change materials (PCM), which have higher heat capabilities than other materials [89] , are therefore regarded as the most modern varieties of grout. Because they experience fewer temperature variations than soil, PCM can help lower fluid temperature fluctuations [90–92] . On the other hand, a significant problem that might have a detrimental impact on the performance of the GHE is the poor thermal conductivity of the majority of PCM. The use of highly thermally conductive additives such as nanoparticles [93,94]  and foam [95]  has led to the adoption of a number of sophisticated forms of PCM to increase the rate of heat transmission. The typical installation depth for horizontal ground heat exchangers (HGHEs) is around 2 m. The use of such a heat exchanger is encouraged by the fact that HGHEs are less expensive to drill and install than VGHEs [96] . However, it necessitates occupying a sizable land area, which might result in increased costs. Additionally, as it requires longer loops due to its low performance, the cost of pipes is also higher than that of the VGHE. Even though, the HGHE still has a lower capital cost than the VGHE, which is mostly attributable to the difference in drilling costs. As a result, the usage of HGHEs is expanding since they are very affordable and do not have as many concerns as VGHEs. Series, parallel, and trench connections are the three basic forms of HGHEs [81] . Slinky and spiral/helical GHEs are the two primary forms of coiled GHEs [97–99] . Both forms of coiled GHEs are categorized by some researchers as VGHEs or HGHEs depending on how they are installed, either vertically or horizontally. The fact that coiled GHEs require less land area and are shallower than standard HGHEs and VGHEs, respectively, is one of their most alluring benefits.   3 Methodology In order to accomplish the objectives stated previously, standard bibliometric methods were used to conduct a quantitative study of the quantity of scientific output included in the GSHPs literature. This was complemented by text mining, which provided a qualitative outlook on the research patterns of GSHP, thematic fields, top keywords, publication trends, and publication distribution around the world. The methodology and analysis were based on a number of other bibliometric studies that had been presented in previous publications [100,101] . The bibliographic database on GSHP’s research was pulled from the Scopus platform on January 28, 2023. Scopus was employed since it is an all-inclusive database of source-neutral abstracts and citations, including over 25,100 titles from over 5,000 worldwide publishers (https://www.elsevier.com ) in a variety of research topics. The methodology followed in this research study is divided into three main steps: data collection, data cleaning, and data analysis. This methodology is summarized in Fig. 5  . This figure demonstrates the query string that was used to collect the relevant literature, including all of the possible spellings of GSHP as well as its various types. The scope of the research was restricted to publications that were originally published in English. At this point in the search, the results came back with a total of 5,292 publications. The query string presented in Fig. 5  was used to conduct the basic bibliometric analysis; however, some keywords were added to perform further analyses based on each specific study, such as to investigate the contribution of GSHPs to the SDGs. 3.1 Data management and statistical analysis Because the purpose of the manuscript is to conduct a bibliometric study on GSHPs, analyze their contribution to the SDGs, and investigate the various challenges and barriers that GSHPs face, the data that was extracted at an earlier stage was analyzed in three different paths to ensure that the desired results will be obtained. Whereby the first path focuses on the analysis of overall publication trends, the second path focuses on GSHP’s contribution to the SDGs, and the third path focuses on challenges and barriers. To determine the SDGs publications, the predefined Scopus query string was used [102] . On the other hand, to investigate the various challenges and barriers that GSHPs face, we used a list of challenges and barriers presented in Olabi and Abdelkareem [103] , with a particular focus on GSHP. After extracting the bibliographic data from each path, we used Biblioshiny and VOSviewer to extract the relevant information.  3.2 Data analysis and data visualization tools Biblioshiny: It is a software written in R that is used to do quantitative studies on data taken from academic publications. It provides a wide range of metrics and visualization tools for performing bibliometric analysis on massive collections of bibliographic data, such as articles, journals, and authors. Biblioshiny’s features include the import and processing of data from multiple sources (including Scopus and Web of Science), as well as the execution of research on the data (including co-citation and co-word analysis, mapping of scientific topics, and collaboration networks) [104] . VOSviewer: It is a software application that was developed by Leiden University and is used for the purpose of generating and showing bibliometric networks and maps. With its help, large volumes of bibliographic data, such as articles, journals, and authors, can be evaluated, and the findings can be shown via the formation of co-citation networks, co-word networks, and maps of scientific domains. With the assistance of VOSviewer, users are able to construct representations of bibliometric data by mapping the links that exist between publications, authors, journals, institutions, and keywords. These associations may then be used as the basis for generating the representations. Users are also provided with the capability to conduct various other types of cluster analysis, which can be used to locate comparable groups of publications, authors, journals, and so on. In addition to this, it gives users the ability to carry out several types of cluster analysis, which may be used to find connected groups of publications, authors, journals, and other such things. It can perform bibliometric analysis on a number of data sources, such as Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, and it is openly available to anybody who is interested in making use of it [105,106] . From the two tools mentioned above, the authors were able to extract and visualize the following information:1. GSHP’s top keywords.  2. GSHP’s publication trends.  3. GSHP’s publications world map.  4. GSHP’s publications thematic clusters.  5. Determine publications GSHPs related to recent progress, applications, challenges, and barriers.  6. Determine GSHP’s related SDGs publications.      4 Results and discussion 4.1 Research trend As can be seen in Fig. 6  , in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of research publications that focus on GSHP as a result of the rising interest in the technology as a method of heating and cooling that is both environmentally friendly and efficient in terms of energy use. As the climate change and the energy crisis continue to worsen, there is an increasing need for further research in the areas of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Additionally, as a result of the developments in shallow geothermal energy systems [107–110] , such systems have grown more efficient, cost-effective, and dependable. This has further contributed to the rise in popularity of these systems as an alternative to conventional methods of heating and cooling. In addition, the laws, regulations, and incentives implemented by the government have all contributed to the expansion of GSHP research. As a consequence of this, researchers, engineers, and practitioners have been driven to carry out studies and publish their results, which has resulted in a rise in the number of GSHP research publications. GSHPs take advantage of the year-round stability of ground temperature to provide heating and cooling. Considering average values, in the winter, the ground temperature is higher than the air temperature, while in the summer, the ground temperature is lower than the air temperature. This makes the ground a suitable heat source/sink for heat pump systems. Fig. 6  shows the cumulative trend of top ten keywords. It is clear that there is a growing interest in researching the application of GSHP in heating rather than cooling. Whereby several studies have found that GSHP systems are very useful in colder areas. This enables the device to offer warmth even in extreme cold weather. They operate at a higher level of efficiency in cooler surroundings, so GSHPs are used in colder regions more often than they are in warmer ones. This is due to the fact that heat is continuously gained from solar radiation during both hot and cold periods, whereas heat is transferred from the ground to the air only when the air temperature is lower than that of the ground. Furthermore, GSHP systems are effective in supporting the supply of domestic hot water [111,112] . The results presented in Fig. 6  also reveal that there is an increasing trend in the analysis of thermal conductivity. In the GSHP, thermal conductivity refers to the heat transfer rate that can be provided by the soil or rock. The ground's thermal conductivity varies based on the type of soil or rock available. In general, materials with greater thermal conductivity will transmit heat more effectively than those with lower thermal conductivity. This is an essential consideration when constructing a GSHP system since it affects heat exchange efficiency and overall system performance. This makes the choice of grout material very critical since it is the intermediate medium between the GHE’s pipes and the ground. Therefore, high thermal conductivity is one of the most required specifications of such materials [87,88] . Another related research area that is currently gaining interest is the incorporation of PCM, which allows for increasing the capacity of the grout and helping the heat exchanger provide consistent performance [90,113] .   4.2 Research hot spot Fig. 7   shows that the index words for GSHP research appeared to be clustered into four clusters: heating (red cluster), ground heat exchangers (green cluster), groundwater (blue cluster), and heat pumps (yellow cluster). Heating.  GSHP’s heating research covers various topics, including optimization, energy storage, hybridization, integration with the smart grid, artificial intelligence, etc. Researchers are now working on creating ways to optimize the design and operation of ground loops in GSHPs in order to enhance the thermal performance of these systems and bring down their associated costs. Additionally, they are investigating the use of seasonal thermal energy storage in GSHPs to increase performance and save costs, particularly during peak load times. One of the recommended techniques that can enhance energy efficiency and save costs is the usage of ground-coupled air-source heat pumps, which combine the advantages of both GSHPs and air-source heat pumps [114,115] . Further attractive integrations were reported, aiming to increase the overall energy efficiency of GSHPs by integrating them with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. This would result in greater overall energy efficiency. It has also been found that grid-scale solar thermal power GSHPs can be connected with smart grid systems in order to increase the overall flexibility, dependability, and performance of GSHPs. Scientists are attempting to improve the efficiency and management of GSHPs by implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms [116] . GSHPs have the ability to considerably enhance building efficiencies and save expenses. This involves studying building-integrated GSHP systems and their application with other building systems like insulation and ventilation. Ground heat exchangers.  The design, installation, and performance of GHE in GSHPs have always been an interesting subject of research [117] . This includes research on the relative benefits and drawbacks of various GHE types, such as horizontal, vertical, and slinky GHEs. In addition, research is conducted on the thermal performance of GHEs, including the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of various soil and rock types and the effect of soil moisture content on the thermal performance of GHEs. Additionally, research focuses on the long-term durability of GHEs, including the possibility of corrosion, clogging, and other types of damage. This research is essential for enhancing the efficiency and durability of GSHPs and reducing their environmental impact. Groundwater.  As a source of heating and cooling, groundwater is an important resource for specific types of GSHPs (GWHPs and SWHPs). It includes research on the effects of pumping groundwater on aquifers and the potential of GSHPs to contaminate groundwater [118] . In addition, research is conducted on the most effective methods for drilling and maintaining GSHP wells and the optimal techniques for using groundwater in GSHPs. This involves research on the thermal properties of various aquifer types, and optimal depth and spacing of GSHP wells. Heat pumps.  Heat pumps are considered to be one of the most efficient heating and cooling technologies available. They are a more environmentally friendly option compared to traditional systems that burn fossil fuels. While heat pumps can have a higher upfront cost than conventional systems, they can provide significant cost savings over their lifetime due to their high energy efficiency. Research on heat pumps can help identify ways to reduce the initial cost of installing a heat pump system, improve the technology and efficiency, and reduce their environmental impact. This would make them more accessible to homeowners and businesses, reliable and effective, and attractive for residential and commercial use. Beside the use of GSHP for direct heating and cooling of buildings, several reports showed that it can also be employed in other industrial operations, including food and textile manufacturing, such as food drying [119,120] . Life cycle evaluation is also considered a hot research area related to GSHPs. In this regard, researchers are now evaluating the environmental effects of GSHP in terms of energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental aspects throughout the life cycle of GSHPs in order to carry out a life cycle assessment and fairly compare it with traditional systems [67] . One of the most important comparative parameters that is always taken into account is the coefficient of performance (COP), which represents the heat pump's efficiency. The COP of a heat pump can be described as the ratio of the amount of heat it produces to the amount of electrical energy it consumes. The COP of a heat pump can be used to measure how efficient it is. The COP of a GSHP is affected by a variety of parameters, including the temperature of the ground, the layout and dimensions of the ground loop, as well as the effectiveness of the heat exchanger. It can differ significantly from one application to another and from one set of operating conditions to another, but in general, they fall in the range of 3 to 5 [121–125] , which is relatively higher than the COP of conventional heating and cooling systems under the same ambient conditions. This indicates that a GSHP is capable of producing three to five units of heat energy for every unit of electrical energy that it consumes. Researchers working in the area of GSHP are always looking for new ways to boost the system’s COP. Increasing the heat exchanger's effectiveness, establishing innovative control techniques for GSHP systems, and optimizing the design and operation of the ground loop are some of the ways that are included in this category. In addition, research on the integration of GSHP systems with renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, as well as enhanced control mechanisms, can also boost the COP of GSHP systems [126] . Based on the collected data, it can be noticed that most hybrid GSHP systems incorporate solar energy [127] . Researchers have frequently investigated the use of solar energy to aid GSHPs in order to enhance the performance of these systems and minimize the associated expenses. This can be accomplished by using solar thermal collectors, which are used to warm the fluid that is utilized in the GSHP; alternatively, this can be accomplished by employing photovoltaic panels, which are used to produce electrical energy for the GSHP system. Such hybridizations take advantage of both energy sources (ground and solar). The GSHP can perform as a solar thermal energy storage system, where it allows for the storage of surplus solar heat during the summer months for use during the winter months. Similar to the earlier mentioned point, researchers are experimenting with applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to enhance the performance and operation of GSHP systems that combine solar energy [128] . 4.3 Sustainable development goals In a variety of different ways, GSHPs can contribute to the accomplishment of many of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. In Fig. 8  , the number of publications related to GSHPs has been counted for each SDG. For example, there are 45 publications related to GSHPs that contribute to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being and 2,463 publications that contribute to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. This figure can be used to understand how GSHPs contribute to different SDGs and to identify areas where more research is needed. As it can be noticed, most of the research was related to SDG 7. This finding could be explained by the fact that the GSHP’s most significant contribution and application is improving the energy efficiency of cooling and heating systems, which is directly related to SDG 7. On the other hand, the smaller number of publications related to other SDGs, such as SDG 1, SDG 2, and SDG 4, suggests that more research is needed to understand how GSHPs can contribute to these goals. As mentioned previously, the predefined Scopus query string was used to determine the publications related to the SDGs. For example, the query string used for SDG 7 is shown below: TITLE-ABS-KEY (({energy efficiency} OR {energy consumption} OR {energy transition} OR {clean energy technology} OR {energy equity} OR {energy justice} OR {energy poverty} OR {energy policy} OR renewable* OR {2000 Watt society} OR {smart micro-grid} OR {smart grid} OR {smart microgrid} OR {smart micro-grids} OR {smart grids} OR {smart microgrids} OR {smart meter} OR {smart meters} OR {affordable electricity} OR {electricity consumption} OR {reliable electricity} OR {clean fuel} OR {clean cooking fuel} OR {fuel poverty} OR energiewende OR {life-cycle assessment} OR {life cycle assessment} OR {life-cycle assessments} OR {life cycle assessments} OR ({photochemistry} AND {renewable energy}) OR photovoltaic OR {photocatalytic water splitting} OR {hydrogen production} OR {water splitting} OR {lithium-ion batteries} OR {lithium-ion battery} OR {heat network} OR {district heat} OR {district heating} OR {residential energy consumption} OR {domestic energy consumption} OR {energy security} OR {rural electrification} OR {energy ladder} OR {energy access} OR {energy conservation} OR {low-carbon society} OR {hybrid renewable energy system} OR {hybrid renewable energy systems} OR {fuel switching} OR ({foreign development aid} AND {renewable energy}) OR {energy governance} OR ({official development assistance} AND {electricity}) OR ({energy development} AND {developing countries})) AND NOT ({wireless sensor network} OR {wireless sensor networks})). The following are some of the primary ways in which GSHPs can contribute to the SDGs, with special focus on SDG 7 and SDG 13: SDG 1 and SDG 2: No Poverty and Zero Hunger.  GSHPs can contribute to achieving SDG 1 and SDG 2 by providing a cost-effective and sustainable source of energy for heating and cooling buildings and infrastructure. By offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly source of energy [129,130] , GSHPs can help reduce energy bills for households and businesses, freeing up funds for other necessities like food, clothes, and healthcare. Consequently, this can alleviate energy poverty, support economic development, and promote sustainable agriculture. Those with lower incomes, both personally and professionally, often spend a larger amount of their funds on energy bills; therefore, this has a disproportionately positive effect on them. GSHPs also contribute to these SDGs by offering chances for employment in the installation, development, maintenance, and repair of GSHP systems, which in turn helps foster economic development and decrease poverty. Furthermore, GSHPs positively affect poverty reduction by increasing energy availability in underserved regions and providing a steady and long-lasting energy supply to back up the economic activities that help pull people out of poverty. In the context of SDG 2, GSHPs have a direct positive impact since they can be used for heating and cooling greenhouses efficiently and sustainably, which can boost agricultural yields and minimize waste [131,132] . GSHPs offer energy-efficient refrigeration and temperature control, decreasing food deterioration and waste. GSHPs also aid by heating and cooling food storage facilities, warehouses, and other infrastructure, keeping items in ideal conditions for longer durations. GSHPs can reduce energy costs for farmers and food processors, allowing them to spend more on inputs, increase output, and invest in new equipment and technology. SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being.  Improving indoor air quality is one way that GSHPs contribute to this SDG. GSHPs lower the occurrence of respiratory diseases and allergies by controlling humidity levels and removing air contaminants. Another way in which GSHPs might contribute to SDG 3 is by maintaining a suitable interior climate. GSHPs help keep buildings warm in the winter and cool in the summer, reducing the likelihood of heat-related diseases and hypothermia. In addition, the decrease in energy expenditures for families and businesses that occurs from the usage of GSHPs contributes to an improvement in general health and well-being by freeing up funds for other basic necessities such as food, clothes, and medical treatment. SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.  The use of GSHPs to heat and cool buildings with renewable energy from the ground contributes to this SDG by reducing the demand for fossil fuels and thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions [133] . By lowering the amount of pollution brought on by the extraction and use of fossil fuels, this aids in the protection of water supplies. GSHPs also contribute to SDG 6 by encouraging water conservation measures such as improved building energy efficiency. Reduced energy consumption during water treatment and distribution is another way in which GSHPs improve the system's efficiency and longevity. By eliminating the need for cooling towers and other water-intensive cooling systems, GSHPs contribute to sustainable water management and the conservation of water supplies. It is worth mentioning here that the contribution to SDG 6 is more related to GCHPs and not to GWHPs and SWHPs. This is because these two systems can affect the quality of ground/surface water, as mentioned previously. SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.  GSHPs have the potential to make a substantial contribution toward the achievement of SDG 7. GSHPs can help reduce the use of fossil fuels, which in turn leads to lower greenhouse gas emissions and a cleaner energy system. Furthermore, the potential of a GSHP to increase the building's energy efficiency is one of the most important contributions it can make. GSHPs have the potential to dramatically cut down on the amount of energy that buildings consume, which in turn helps to decrease monthly energy costs and make energy more accessible for homes and companies, especially those with lower incomes. GSHPs also have a minimal effect on the environment and low running costs, which makes them an affordable and clean energy solution for a broad variety of buildings and businesses. These benefits combine to make GSHPs an attractive choice. The results of the bibliometric analysis showed that several studies were carried out to examine the contribution of GSHPs to SDG 7, including energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, hybridization, and cost effectiveness. Calculating the energy efficiency of GSHPs is one technique to assess their contribution to SDG 7. This may be determined by contrasting the GSHP system's operational energy requirements with its output. GSHPs are very efficient because they may generate more usable energy from the ground than they use [134,135] . GSHPs were also evaluated based on how much of an impact they have on the usage of renewable energy, which is one of the targets of SDG 7. Another way in which GSHPs might help minimize the effects of climate change is by lowering emissions of greenhouse gases. Several papers quantify the decrease in emissions attributable to GSHPs by comparing them to conventional heating systems in a life cycle assessment [67,133] . There are various studies that measure the cost effectiveness of GSHPs [124,136] , whereby the GSHPs might be beneficial in the long term due to their cheap operating cost and their ability to drastically cut power usage, both of which are crucial to the success of SDG 7. GSHPs may be integrated with other forms of renewable energy, such as solar panels, to provide an energy system that is more robust and environmentally friendly. Assuring universal access to low-cost, dependable, sustainable, and modern energy sources is a key part of attaining SDG 7. Fig. 9   shows the thematic clusters of the top keywords in SDG 7 related to GSHPs. It might be challenging to offer concrete data or statistics about the contribution of GSHPs to the fulfillment of SDG 7, since it is dependent on a variety of variables such as location, climate, building type, and the design of the system. Researchers have frequently investigated the amount of energy savings associated with the deployment of energy systems incorporating GSHPs. As shown in Table 1  , there is a huge difference between the ranges of energy savings from one study to another, which is mainly due to the different characteristics and baseline systems. Cruz-Peragón et al. [66]  compared GSHP to a conventional heat pump system to demonstrate the potential of GSHP in reducing energy consumption. In their study, the GHE was able to deliver 89% of the total building load, which resulted in an energy savings of 33.12%. The GHE was built with 18 boreholes of 120 m depth (arranged in a rectangular pattern). Han et al. [137]  compared a baseline HVAC system and GSHP across seven climatic zones in China. The findings show that the energy-saving advantages of a GSHP system vary greatly by climatic zone, ranging from 19% to 45%, which was associated with significant cost savings on utilities of between 21% and 40% and a decrease in CO2  emissions of between 25% and 36%. As mentioned previously, integrating GSHPs into hybrid systems can further improve their overall efficiency, resulting in energy consumption reductions [138–140] . Compared with the GSHP alone, the hybrid system comprising solar PV/T, absorption heat pump, and GSHP was able to achieve energy savings of 32%, as reported by Chen et al. [141] . This was achieved at the best integrated performance point, which also resulted in a 23% decrease in emissions and a 9% yearly cost savings. The importance of hybridization can be further observed from the study carried out by Wang et al. [142] , where the authors compared the hybrid combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system with the separate production system. According to their results, the hybrid system saved 13.7% of primary energy and cut CO2  emissions by 8%. Another CCHP system was investigated by Wen et al. [143]  and compared to the gas boiler and electric chiller. The CCHP was based on a distributed energy system that includes PV, GSHP, absorption chiller, gas turbine, and gas boiler. Two different scenarios for the distributed energy system were examined. In the first scenario, the building cooling demand was first met by absorption chillers, whereas the GSHP was used in the second. The findings showed that the primary energy savings ratio for the first scenario was from 5.51% to 13.47%, whereas it was from 16.75% to 26.83% for the second. Hu et al. [144]  compared three hybrid systems in terms of energy consumption; two of these systems incorporated GSHPs. According to their results, the proposed system, which integrated the heat source tower and GSHP, outperformed the two other systems: (1) the boiler and split air conditioner; and (2) the air source heat compensator integrated with GSHP. The corresponding energy savings of the proposed system were 47.6% and 31.2%, respectively. Based on the real situation of a small district in Spain (Leganés, Madrid), Calise et al. [145]  designed and modeled a fifth generation bidirectional heating and cooling network to address the thermal energy demand of the building sector and reduce its environmental impact. The network, which was connected to GSHPs, water-to-water heat pumps, and a solar field, was intended to cover the energy needs of a district of 50 buildings. The entire system was modeled in TRNSYS 18. The solar field could only supply 30% of the district's power needs with the suggested design. In comparison to the existing situation, the proposed network was able to lower CO2  emissions by 76% while achieving a main energy savings index of 64%. SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.  GSHPs contribute to this SDG by providing jobs in installation, maintenance, development, and repair, which can encourage economic growth by diversifying the energy industry. These vocations, from technical expertise to sales and administrative roles, provide respectable employment and income in many locations. GSHPs also contribute to SDG 8 by decreasing energy costs for individuals and companies, which can stimulate economic development by freeing up resources for increasing production, recruiting more personnel, and investing in new equipment. Additionally, GSHPs boost innovation and research in shallow geothermal energy and heat pump technologies, which can promote sustainable industrialization and enhance global market competitiveness. SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.  GSHPs contribute to the achievement of SDG 9 in numerous ways, such as job creation, energy security, and industry expansion. Because the GSHP is a fast-developing sector, the installation, maintenance, and repair of these systems provide opportunities for skilled laborers, engineers, and technicians. Their development and implementation spur innovation in allied sectors such as materials science, electronics, and control systems. GSHPs can be incorporated into existing infrastructure, such as houses and buildings, to help decrease total demand for fossil fuels, which can benefit the environment and public health, especially because they can be driven by renewable energy systems [146] . By lowering reliance on fossil fuels, which are prone to price swings and supply interruptions, GSHPs assist in enhancing energy security. As more GSHPs are implemented, there will be a greater demand for GSHP components and equipment, such as heat exchangers, resulting in the expansion of GSHP-related enterprises. SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.  GSHPs can help a lot to reach SDG 11 by making it easier and more efficient to heat and cool buildings in cities in a way that doesn't harm the environment. GSHPs can help buildings save a lot of money and energy by getting heat from the ground, which is often more energy-efficient than traditional heating systems. They can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by cutting down on the need for heating systems that use fossil fuels. This can help cities meet their goals for lowering their emissions and lessen the effects of climate change. GSHPs can help improve indoor air quality by giving people cleaner and healthier ways to heat and cool their homes. This can be good for public health and well-being. GSHP systems can be put in places with limited space, like multi-unit buildings in cities. This helps save land and reduces the urban heat island effect. In the long run, GSHPs can be a cost-effective solution because they cut down on the energy costs of buildings and help tenants, landlords, and the community save money [147] . SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.  GSHPs are able to contribute significantly to the achievement of SDG 12 in a number of different ways. GSHPs can help reduce energy consumption and costs by extracting heat from the ground, a process that is potentially more energy-efficient than conventional heating systems. This can result in a decrease in the overall demand for fossil fuels, which in turn can lead to a reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted [133] . By relying on renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy, GSHPs can help reduce the consumption of natural resources such as fossil fuels. This contributes to increased resource efficiency. GSHP systems have a long life-span, typically more than 25 years with proper maintenance [66,67] . This can reduce the need for frequent replacements, which ultimately helps to decrease the environmental impact of the production and disposal of heating and cooling systems. When they reach the end of their useful lives, many of the components of GSHP systems can be recycled or repurposed, which helps to reduce the negative impact that their disposal has on the environment. Increasing education and awareness about the benefits and correct use of GSHPs can promote responsible consumption and production by encouraging more sustainable choices in the heating and cooling sector. This can help promote responsible consumption and production. GSHPs can be incorporated into green building design, and they can assist buildings in achieving certifications such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method). Because GSHPs are often made locally and installation involves specialized work, they will help the local economy while also reducing the environmental impact of transportation. The purpose of a circular economy is to keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting as much value as possible before recovering and recreating them. GSHPs play an important part in the circular economy by offering a sustainable and efficient method to heat and cool buildings while conserving scarce resources like fossil fuels and decreasing waste and pollution. SDG 13: Climate Action.  GSHPs can help achieve SDG 13 by heating and cooling buildings more sustainably and efficiently while lowering greenhouse gas emissions [148] . GSHPs decrease greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel heating systems. GSHPs lower energy expenses by collecting heat from the ground, which is more energy-efficient than typical heating systems. GSHPs increase indoor air quality by offering cleaner and healthier heating and cooling alternatives, which is good for public health. Due to the fact that both GSHPs and ASHPs rely on the same refrigeration cycle, which uses electricity, they have nearly equal environmental effects. However, because GSHPs use less power than ASHPs do, their use has a lower impact on the environment. To determine the benefits of using GSHPs instead of traditional systems and to identify the most important variables, several research studies were carried out. The CO2  emissions of GSHPs and natural gas boilers used for space heating in Europe were compared by Carvalho et al. [149] . The findings indicated that GSHPs can reduce CO2  emissions in the European Union by 90% in 2050. When Portugal is used as a case study, the decrease in CO2  emissions is more apparent, reaching a value of 97%. According to Islam et al. [150] , GSHPs have the ability to lower noxious gas emissions in addition to saving on CO2  emissions. In their research, they found that using GSHP in a pig house reduced emissions of NH3 , H2 S, and SO2  by 57%, 48%, and 18%, respectively, compared to using traditional electric heating. Sivasakthivel et al.  [151]  assessed the reductions in CO2  emissions when GSHPs were used to replace electric heaters, using the northern region of India as a case study. As shown in Fig. 10  , the CO2  produced by the electric heater is almost double that produced by the GSHP, which has a COP of 2. Additionally, a significant relation can be observed between the CO2  reductions and the COP of the GSHP since the amount of CO2  produced by the electric heater is nearly five times higher than that produced by the GSHP with a COP of 5. SDG 14 and SDG 15: Life Below Water and Life on Land.  By encouraging the use of renewable energy sources, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and minimizing the adverse effects of resource extraction on maritime and terrestrial environments, GSHPs can make a substantial contribution to the accomplishment of SDGs 14 and 15. GSHPs can contribute to the creation of a more sustainable and equitable future by promoting sustainable development and decreasing the detrimental effects that human actions have on ecosystems and natural resources. SDG 14 is to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources for economic and social development. Since increasing sea levels, acidification of the ocean, and higher temperatures can lead to habitat devastation and species loss, climate change poses a serious danger to aquatic habitats and resources. One of the main causes of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels, therefore, lowering greenhouse gas pollution is essential for minimizing its effects. GSHPs are a clean energy option since they take advantage of the ground’s temperature and thus, reduce energy consumption. The use of GSHPs helps decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are emitted into the environment, which in turn can help reduce the amount of fossil fuels that are burned. This has the potential to help alleviate the consequences of climate change [82] , which are a big issue for the marine ecosystem and the resources found there. SDG 15 also seeks to preserve and encourage the healthy use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, wetlands, and other areas for wildlife. Reducing the effects of resource exploitation is essential to achieving SDG 15 because it plays a major role in habitat devastation and biodiversity loss. In addition, the use of fossil fuels for generating electricity is a major contributor to habitat loss and species decline because it can degrade ecosystems, pollute the air and water, and destroy habitats. Therefore, GSHPs have the potential to help achieve SDG 15 by reducing energy resource extraction and its impact on land ecosystems, as well as assisting in the protection, restoration, and promotion of sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, wetlands, and other biodiversity habitats. This can be accomplished through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of clean energy sources, and reduction of the negative impact of resource extraction on land ecosystems.  4.4 Challenges and barriers Challenges are usually classified into five categories: financial and economic, technical, environmental and social, policies and regulations, and administrative and institutional. The general challenges related to these categories are presented in Table 2   while highlighting the specific challenges of GSHPs. 4.4.1 Financial and economic challenges Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (“ground source heat pump*“ OR ”geothermal heat pump*“ OR ”ground coupled heat pump*“ OR ”ground water heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater source heat pump*“ OR ”ground water source heat pump*“ OR ”surface water heat pump*“ OR (”water source heat pump*“ ANDNOT ”waste“)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (cost* OR finance* OR economic*). Based on Fig. 11  , the implementation of GSHP systems is associated with a number of complex financial and economic issues, including high capital expenses, maintenance costs, incentives and subsidies, and a long payback period. The significant capital cost of GSHP systems is considered one of their primary issues [152] . The up-front costs are especially high when it comes to the price of drilling or digging the ground for installing the ground loop [153] . Due to these expenditures, GSHP systems cannot be as financially appealing to certain building owners and homeowners. Additionally, heat pumps need regular maintenance and servicing, which can be expensive over the course of the system's lifetime [154,155] . Getting funding for GSHP systems might be difficult since these systems could not be covered by conventional financing channels like mortgages. In the GSHP business, there is a lack of standardization, which can make it difficult for building owners to evaluate the prices and advantages of various systems. This can be a problem since building owners want to be sure they are getting the best deal possible. The availability of financial subsidies and incentives for GSHP systems varies from nation, area or state to another. As a result, it can be challenging for building owners to get access to these resources. In some cases, the payback period of GSHP systems can be difficult to calculate because it is affected by too many variables [156,157] . These include ground temperature, ground loop design and size, heat exchanger efficiency, electricity and natural gas rates, and maintenance costs.  4.4.2 Technical challenges Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (“ground source heat pump*“ OR ”geothermal heat pump*“ OR ”ground coupled heat pump*“ OR ”ground water heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater source heat pump*“ OR ”ground water source heat pump*“ OR ”surface water heat pump*“ OR (”water source heat pump*“ ANDNOT ”waste“)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Technical*” OR “performance*”). From Fig. 12  , the GSHP systems face a number of technical challenges: design and installation, sizing, optimization, maintenance, integration, etc. The design and installation of the ground loop, which is used to transmit heat to and from the ground, is one of the most significant technical issues presented by GSHP systems. This can be a difficult and expensive operation, especially if the ground is difficult to access or if the soil conditions are not ideal for the installation of a ground loop. GSHP systems can be difficult to size properly since the size of the system has to be matched to the heating and cooling demand of the building [158–160] . An incorrectly sized system can lead to poor performance as well as greater expenditures for the use of energy. The process of optimizing the performance of GSHPs can be difficult since the performance of the system is influenced by a number of parameters, including the temperature of the ground, the design and size of the ground loop, and the effectiveness of the heat exchanger [161] . GSHP systems need to be serviced and maintained on a regular basis, yet repairs can be difficult and expensive. GSHPs need integration with other building systems such as insulation, ventilation, and air conditioning, which can be a difficult process. In addition to the above-mentioned technical issues, there are several safety challenges that need to be considered when working with GSHP systems. These include electrical safety, ground loop safety, refrigerant safety, indoor air quality, system maintenance, and safety training.  4.4.3 Environmental and social challenges Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (“ground source heat pump*“ OR ”geothermal heat pump*“ OR ”ground coupled heat pump*“ OR ”ground water heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater source heat pump*“ OR ”ground water source heat pump*“ OR ”surface water heat pump*“ OR (”water source heat pump*“ ANDNOT ”waste“)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (Environment* OR emission*). As can be seen in Fig. 13  , the GSHP installations present a number of environmental and social concerns. The installation of the ground loop, which is used to transmit heat to and from the ground, can have an ecological impact. This includes the possibility of the erosion of soil, the destruction of natural ecosystems, and the contamination of subterranean water supplies. GSHP systems need a wide surface area for the installation of the ground loop. This might be an issue in highly populated metropolitan areas or in locations where there is a limited supply of land. GSHPs have the potential to cause noise pollution, similar to a conventional heat pump, which can have a negative impact on the quality of life of individuals who live or work in close proximity to the system [162] . GSHPs can be seen as aesthetically unpleasant, and they can run into opposition from local communities owing to the ground loop installation and the noise they can cause. GSHP systems continue to use energy, despite the fact that they are regarded as a low-carbon technology. They also have an environmental effect linked to the generation and delivery of electricity [151] . GSHPs that employ water-source heat pumps (GWHP and SWHP) can have an influence on water resources, especially in water-stressed locations [163,164] . GSHPs can be more expensive to install, which can make them harder for households and communities with low incomes to use.  4.4.4 Policies and regulations challenges Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (“ground source heat pump*“ OR ”geothermal heat pump*“ OR ”ground coupled heat pump*“ OR ”ground water heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater source heat pump*“ OR ”ground water source heat pump*“ OR ”surface water heat pump*“ OR (”water source heat pump*“ ANDNOT ”waste“)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (Policy OR Policies OR Policymaker* OR regulation*). As can be seen in Fig. 14  , there are several issues that GSHP systems face in relation to rules and regulations, including lack of national standards, different incentives and subsidies, net metering, interconnection, and building regulations. There is a lack of national standards and regulations for GSHP systems, which can make it difficult for building owners to evaluate the costs and advantages of various systems and for the industry to have a uniform set of rules to follow [165,166] . The types and amounts of financial incentives and subsidies for GSHP systems vary by location and can change over time, which can make it hard for building owners to get these resources and plan for the long term [167–169] . Because certain nations and areas lack clear legislation regulating the usage of net metering for GSHP systems, building owners find it difficult to sell surplus energy back to the grid. Some nations and areas do not have clear legislation addressing the interconnection of GSHP systems with the grid. This can make it difficult for building owners to connect their systems to the grid and receive the full advantages of GSHP systems. Because they might range significantly across jurisdictions, it can be challenging for building owners to install GSHP systems that abide by local standards and regulations.  4.4.5 Administrative and institutional Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (“ground source heat pump*“ OR ”geothermal heat pump*“ OR ”ground coupled heat pump*“ OR ”ground water heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater heat pump*“ OR ”groundwater source heat pump*“ OR ”ground water source heat pump*“ OR ”surface water heat pump*“ OR (”water source heat pump*“ ANDNOT ”waste“)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Administrative*” OR Institutional*”). According to Fig. 15  , there are several administrative and institutional hurdles that must be overcome for GSHP installations to be fully functional [170] . The GSHP business suffers from a lack of trained personnel, making it difficult for building owners to locate competent specialists to design, install, and maintain GSHP systems. Building owners and policymakers cannot have easy access to information about GSHP systems. This can make it hard for them to make well-informed decisions about whether or not to adopt and use these systems. Building owners can find it challenging to install and use GSHP systems due to bureaucratic obstacles, including drawn-out permitting procedures. Inadequate cooperation among government agencies might make it difficult to execute rules and regulations pertaining to GSHP systems. In order to support research and development, as well as the deployment and maintenance of GSHPs, enough funding is required. This can be challenging to get, particularly during periods of economic stagnation. Many administrators and decision-makers cannot comprehend GSHPs and their potential advantages, making it difficult to advocate for their implementation. Because there is limited data available on the performance and cost-effectiveness of GSHP systems, it might be difficult for decision-makers to assess the potential advantages of these systems. This could make it more difficult for GSHPs to become widespread. Stakeholder participation in GSHPs ensures that the systems are planned, implemented, and managed to meet community and stakeholder demands [171] . Stakeholder participation can also raise understanding and acceptability of GSHP systems, which is essential for their deployment.    5 Recommendations According to the presented bibliometric analysis, it has been clearly noticed that there are remarkable gaps in the research on GSHPs. This was mainly observed in the role of GSHPs in achieving the SDGs, especially because these systems have significant contributions but need to be more highlighted. Thus, it would be highly recommended to investigate the direct effect of GSHPs on each SDG. This would be immensely helpful and could encourage people to rely more on these systems instead of conventional methods. Furthermore, highlighting these contributions can draw more attention to the critical issues that GSHPs face, which may help find further solutions. In addition, shedding light on the role of GSHPs in achieving the SDGs can elevate subsidies and incentives, which are essential requirements that these systems lack. Consequently, this will reduce the costs associated with these systems. From this point of view, it is recommended to find further solutions for decreasing the capital cost of GSHPs, which is one of their major challenges, such as using new types of pipe and grout materials. Even though the results showed that most of the publications were on SDG 7, it is still highly recommended that researchers conduct research on the impact of GSHPs on the other SDGs, especially SDG 1 and SDG 2.  6 Conclusions Based on the bibliometric analysis that was conducted in this study, it can be seen that the research that has been done in the field of GSHP technology has concentrated on a broad variety of subjects, including design, modeling, performance analysis, optimization, control, and testing. In addition, a large amount of research has been done on the environmental and economic advantages of GSHP systems, as well as the challenges to their more widespread adoption. In recent years, research on GSHP technology has increasingly concentrated on producing systems that are more effective in terms of both efficiency and cost, as well as on enhancing the performance of these systems under a variety of operating situations. In addition, there has been a growing interest in the integration of GSHPs with other renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to create hybrid systems that can provide heating and cooling with high energy efficiency and a low environmental impact. The needs of the industry and policymakers for sustainability and energy efficiency are also driving research on GSHPs. As a direct consequence of this, there has been a rise in the number of publications that discuss the legal and regulatory aspects of GSHPs. It was also observed that GSHPs have a significant role to play in achieving the SDGs. SDG 7 and SDG 13 were the two SDGs that received the most attention in the research on GSHPs in connection to the SDGs. This is primarily because GSHPs and the environment are directly related. It is important to point out that GSHP systems are highly sophisticated, and as a result, installation, maintenance, and repair of these systems need the assistance of trained professionals. It was noticed that GSHPs created several jobs: engineers and designers for system design and installation, technicians for system installation and maintenance, sales and marketing personnel to promote GSHPs, researchers and scientists to develop the technology, and project managers to oversee the installation and commissioning. Recent advancements in GSHPs are focusing on the development of new materials and designs to increase the efficiency of heat transfer from/to the ground/heat pump. This can lead to smaller and more compact GSHP systems that use less energy and are more cost-effective. Additionally, remarkable progress has been recognized regarding the development of smart control systems. Advancements in IoT, sensing, and control systems make it possible to monitor, control, and optimize the performance of GSHP systems. It is expected that such developments will remain consistent in the foreseen future since they can have significant effects on the energy efficiency and maintenance cost of the GSHP.
