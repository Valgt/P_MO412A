From this perspective, the SDGs entice multinational enterprises (MNEs) to release themselves from national regulations as the primary parameters within which to develop sustainability strategies in favor of corporate initiatives that address global standards. This research examines this engagement, especially with respect to how MNEs are proactively devising greenhouse gas mitigation strategies to meet the aspirations of the SDGs rather than conforming to myriad national and regional regulations. Indeed, this study finds that in striving to meet the goals for clean and renewable energy (RE) and climate action, MNEs are renegotiating regulations to propagate RE. The escalation of clean energy aspirations is most dramatic among MNEs of the cloud industry, most emphatically the so-called ‘frightful’ five (Manjoo 2017 )—Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. All have committed to one hundred percent RE sourcing and have substantially achieved this target for their global operations (Wilson 2019 ). This paper seeks to explain these achievements by first describing how cloud companies have procured RE for data center (DC) operations that make up their global networks and, second, explaining the consequences of their climate initiatives for theoretical understandings of MNE responses to environmental pressures. The second goal is important to draw general lessons from cloud companies’ experiences and better understand how the SDGs can be advanced. Conceptually, the analysis builds on Rugman and Verbeke’s (1998a ; 1998b)  use of the firm-specific advantage—the country-specific advantage (FSA-CSA) framework—to explain how firms respond to national environmental regulations. Several studies have explored this framework (Abuzeinab et al., 2017 ; Ambec et al., 2013 ; Aquilera-Caracuel 2012 ; Aragón-Correa et al., 2016 ; Buysse and Verbeke 2003 ; Damert et al., 2017 ; Dechezlepretre and Sato 2017 ; Delgado-Marquez and Pedauga 2017 ; Dunning and Lundan 2008 ; Kolk and Pinske 2012 ; Pinske and Kolk 2010 , 2012 ; Ritala et al., 2018 ; Singh et al., 2014 ). This paper contributes to this evolution by focusing on a leading economic sector and analyzing the distinctive ways in which cloud companies have developed environmentally driven firm-specific advantages through institutional innovation and how they are diffusing such advantages as they expand on a global scale. A comparative examination of the behavior of cloud companies in this context is important not only due to their size and influence but also because they demonstrate a distinct pathway to the global diffusion of RE. Green FSAs are institutional innovations that cloud companies developed in the US to break through embedded utility and regulatory barriers by matching data center development with RE. They rely on the same FSAs to link data centers with RE as they rush to develop global data center networks. The sourcing and negotiation of overseas RE depend on matching these FSAs with country-specific advantages such as RE sources, infrastructure and the institutional conditions that enable cloud companies to ensure RE flows into the grid that they can obtain at acceptable prices. This cloud company example allows for an examination of the (greening) processes that occur within FSA-CSA relations while incorporating the interdependencies between both home and host country-specific advantages in terms of FSAs. Moreover, the case reveals differences within a sector and across nations. Hitherto, examinations of the FSA-CSA relation have not examined these processes in a sector-specific, cross-country comparison or in the mixed qualitative-quantitative manner pursued by this study and thus fail to reveal how firms actually develop and exploit their environmental FSAs. The paper begins with a synopsis of the FSA-CSA framework in relation to environmental issues to recognize the increasingly proactive role of MNEs in environmental behavior and develop a set of propositions. Next, the methods and materials used are presented. The results are divided into sections on the development of FSAs in the US, the diffusion of DCs coupled with RE, and the corporate-host country interactions that develop country-specific advantages. The discussion addresses the propositions and considers counterfactuals. The conclusion addresses implications for the FSA-CSA framework and for MNE support of the SDGs. 1.1 FSA-CSA: an evolving framework for MNE responses to environmental change The FSA-CSA relationship forms the foundation of Rugman’s (1981)  well-known theory of MNEs and Rugman and Verbeke’s (1998a ; 1998b)  framework for normatively exploring MNE strategic behavior in relation to global variations in environmental regulations. Within this framework, the firm is positioned within home and host countries, drawing on home country-specific advantages (Home-CSAs) such as resources, institutions, knowledge, etc., to build firm-specific advantages (FSAs) (unique controlled/proprietary capacities in management, production, marketing technologies, etc.) that can be used for trade or foreign direct investment purposes in a host country. The host country may possess institutional, market, resource and other conditions that make it more or less amenable to FSAs, with and without local adaptations. The key issue explored by Rugman and Verbeke’s (1998a)  analysis is whether, under pressures to combine environmental and economic performance, MNEs should develop global FSAs or adapt to host country regulations. The authors argue that large country regulations (1998a) and international environmental standards (1998b) predominate and they discount both the attractiveness of pollution havens (countries with weak regulations) and, contrastingly, the ability for small countries to pursue the Porter hypothesis (introducing advanced regulations in the hope of developing or attracting MNEs) (Ambec et al., 2013 ; Porter and van der Linde 1995 ). This explicit linking of FSAs with environmental regulations has in turn led to an ongoing debate as to whether MNEs choose to build green FSAs that can be applied globally or adapt or develop FSAs for specific countries. Kolk and Pinske (2008 ; 2012)  elaborate on environmental FSA-CSA relationships in several papers, pursuing Rugman and Verbeke’s view that MNEs will develop green FSAs if they can leverage the potential of existing capabilities and when the risk of irreversible and unsuccessful investments is not too great. On this basis, they categorize the potential actions of firms based on the degree of transformation required in their sectors and based on specific roles within the sectoral value chain (Kolk and Pinske 2008 , 2012 ). Thus, firms within the coal, oil, automobile, electricity and related industries are grouped together as they directly confront climate change and are forced to develop green FSAs. Firms specializing in green technologies and management are similarly focused on green FSAs (Kolk and Pinske 2012 ). Other firms, outside of those either requiring substantial transformation or providing transformation technologies, will be less stimulated to develop FSAs and rely more on external markets to purchase mitigation technologies. The logic of this perspective, however, does not speak to the transformational importance of the actions taken by cloud companies, particularly in the ways that they develop green FSAs through their external purchases. Supporting this view, Mayer and Gereffi (2010)  argue that end product firms with brand reputations to protect are those that will be most proactive in developing FSAs. Nevertheless, in regard to the origins of green FSAs, Kolk and Pinske’s (2008)  view that top management and home country conditions are principally responsible for FSA initiatives is supported by other studies. The potential for national conditions to shape FSAs and CSAs is evident in much research examining how national environmental regulations impose on MNEs (Abuzeinab 2017 ; Damert et al., 2017 ; Huang and Lei 2012 ; Slawinski et al., 2014 ; Tatoglu et al., 2014 ) and how national and local stakeholder demands and engagement influence MNE environmental performance (Buysse and Verbeke 2003 ; Cadez et al., 2017; Delgado and Marquez 2017 ; Delmas and Toffel 2004 , 2008 ; Gonzalez-Benito and Gonzalez-Benito 2006 ; Kassinis and Vafeas 2006 ; Tatoglu et al., 2014 ). Even so, Pinske and Kolk (2008) recognize that subsidiaries operating in (distinctive) host economies can contribute to the development of FSAs, including the cocreation of technologies in developing economies (see Kolk 2015 ). Especially in advanced countries, but increasingly apparent elsewhere, pressures on MNCs to ‘green’ their operations and eliminate negative environmental externalities have become more evident, even if rollbacks of key environmental initiatives do occur. For Martinez-Ferrero (2017) , these pressures are regulatory, normative or ethical, and rivalrous. Thus, company decisions to improve environmental behavior are influenced not only by new or threatened environmental laws imposed by governments but also by ethical concerns raised by nonprofit organizations and other advocacy groups and by rivals who may gain a competitive edge by more effectively reducing their environmental footprints and increasing their public acceptance and environmental brand reputation. Indeed, such pressures strongly motivate MNEs to adopt or exceed global standards, to make commitments that go beyond compliance and to explain to stakeholders why and to what extent they actually do go beyond compliance (Hoffman 2005 , 2007 ; King and McDonnell 2015 ; Martínez-Ferrero and García-Sánchez 2017 ; Prakash 2001 ; Wilson 2003 ). However, even for MNEs seeking global standards, implementation throughout global operations takes time, typically dependent on new investments, and disparities in environmental performance occur (Angel et al., 2007 ; Christmann 2004 ; Christmann and Taylor 2006 ; Morano and Kostova 2016 ; Perkins and Neumayer 2010 ; Vogel 2010 ). In summary, Rugman and Verbeke (1998a ; 1998b)  establish a model that remains relevant because it establishes a logic of environmentally mediated interaction between FSAs and CSAs that retains explanatory power. While oriented by MNE requirements to preserve or maintain market goals, the model recognizes that firms can respond to varying international and regional environmental standards as means to further develop FSAs on green lines. Cloud companies’ attempts to achieve global FSAs by investing in RE-coupled DCs are a case in point. These DCs involve significant investments, typically in excess of $200 m, and imply reconfigurations of existing grid systems rooted in vested interests. Cloud companies have negotiated these configurations by developing new contract-based relations with various agencies; indeed, for them, it is new contractual relations, rather than new technologies, that define the greening of their FSAs. Moreover, the negotiations have featured the external sourcing of RE and have in many countries been regional in scope. Drawing on the FSA-CSA review and related eclectic theory literature to elaborate on home and host country advantages (Dunning and Lundan 2008 ), an approach to explain interactions arising from the expansion of DC networks and their coupling is modeled in Fig. 1  . Unlike Rugman and Verbeke’s analysis, however, the process more explicitly incorporates home country effects on the development of FSAs. Cloud countries enjoy home country advantages that push them toward environmental FSAs, but they also face home country disadvantages arising from a fragmented electricity grid that requires extensive negotiations and innovation to deliver green FSAs. Green FSAs reflect, first, the capacity to define what RE means for a firm and its stakeholders and to commoditize it as a quantifiable and tradable entity. Second, new contractual modes enable cloud companies to act as commercial and industrial buyers to purchase power through electricity grids that hitherto only allow retail sales. The definition of RE as a commodity and innovation in contract modes requires significant institutional negotiation and innovation that supports Rugman’s (2010)  claim that transaction cost minimization is the basis of FSAs. Given the investments made in these FSAs, companies will be disposed to use them in host countries that have pre-established advantages that allow for rapid adoption or adaption, minimizing further transaction costs (North 1993 ; Williamson 1996 , 2000 ). The cloud companies will then attempt to duplicate in host economies the FSAs developed at home without their complete fixed cost reinvention, albeit not without costs and risks. We make three propositions to examine the interdependencies of the Home-CSA—FSA—Host-CSA and draw out critical factors for the propagation of RE for the SDGs.Proposition 1 Cloud companies seek to couple their expanding DC networks with RE and utilize their FSAs to do so . This straightforward proposition requires an assessment other where cloud companies have located DCs and to what extent they are coupled to RE .  Proposition 2 Cloud companies select foreign markets receptive to their FSAs . We identify and assess the CSAs that attract cloud companies .  Proposition 3 In certain situations , cloud companies seek to change Host-CSAs to accommodate their FSAs ; reasons for these efforts and reactions to them will be explored .     2 Methods and materials A mixed methods approach is used to define the FSAs and examine how they are modified in response to CSAs. The approach involves three main tasks: 1) identification of (green) FSAs developed under home country conditions; 2) identification of global DC locations, locations coupled with RE, commoditization and contract modes utilized, and host country conditions; and 3) a case study analysis of selected DC-RE couplings to draw out commonalities and differences. First, to identify FSAs, a textual analysis of corporate materials was necessary to define which cloud-related corporate activities impact carbon reduction (reputational risk) and require further investments incurring risk. The textual analysis applied content and qualitative analysis methods, which involved reading all material that the studied corporations had made available over a decade of environmental reports and press releases to identify how they define their environmental actions and how these are tied to corporate goals. These activities were coded and categorized according to a ground theory approach and cross-verified against assessments included in trade journals and the academic literature. Through categorization, three processes of greening FSAs are identified, namely, virtualization, DC power management and RE, through a review of declared corporate strategies and operations and academic and third-party analyses of the cloud industry. However, compared to the internally controlled energy reduction of virtualization and DC energy management, RE sourcing represents an external risk and is susceptible to diverse contextual forces; thus, it was chosen as the focus of the study. Second, a database was generated to chart and map cloud company DC locations and whether they are coupled with RE. The type of RE used is also identified. Such DC and RE location data points are increasingly available from released corporate materials. However, the matching of DC with RE is rarely straightforward, and the contractual conditions between cloud companies and partners are usually not released. Cloud companies do not release further information. The extent of DC-RE coupling was therefore cross-checked against a third-party corporate analysis, trade journals and news reports. At least 5 sources were cross-referenced to determine the attributes of each DC and its energy provision. The identification of commodity and contract modes required reviews of corporate press releases, sector analysis reports, trade journal reports, and news items. More complex was identifying host country conditions affecting the use of commoditization and contract modes, but these could be grasped from similar sources and inferred from the transaction partners of the cloud companies. Third, to reveal why particular countries/regions were chosen and how FSAs were adapted to CSAs, and according to Yin (2014) , a comparative case study methodology was used to determine distinctive and common characteristics among locations. This approach also helped reveal the interdependent nature of variables impacting each location and how distinct RE pathways were developed. The conditions among all DC-RE coupling instances are categorized and enumerated. In addition to the investigation of successful FSA-CSA configurations, a counterfactual robustness check was possible. This was done by examining why, in commoditization and contractual terms, DC-RE coupling has not occurred in some places where they could be expected. Government and industry consultant documents were important in this regard.  3 Results The results are presented sequentially to explain the initial development of pure market-oriented FSAs in the US, the home country of the cloud companies, and then how US social and institutional conditions had supported the companies in developing environmental FSAs. The latter explanation identifies two main processes: the commoditization of reputations for buying RE and the contract mode for purchasing RE. The diffusion of DCs and the extent of their coupling with RE are then mapped and tabulated to reveal coupling between locations and the type of commoditization and between the contract mode used and country-specific advantages. Finally, case studies are used to determine the interactions between FSAs and host country CSAs. 3.1 Generating FSAs: internally and externally 3.1.1 Internal FSAs: market-to-environment FSA conversion The cloud industry provides economies of scale for software, operating systems and hardware that greatly expand the computing and storage capacities of corporations and consumers and at a compellingly lower marginal cost. The commercial cloud industry began circa 2006 when Amazon discovered that the computing and storage capacities developed for its online commerce could be a valuable service sold to other companies. Microsoft, Google and others soon joined the cloud market. A roughly the same time, the rise of search, social media and Internet entertainment services provided Facebook, Apple and Google with the demand that prompted them to develop immense cloud capacities. Over the last decade, the very powerful FSAs developed by these companies have propelled a global expansion of DCs and billions of dollars in investment. At the heart of the (green) FSAs developed by these cloud companies is the virtualization process whereby they can use servers and software optimally and flexibly for multiple client needs. The servers that provide computing and storage capacities for the cloud are housed in large DCs that require power supplies equivalent to those required to service many thousands of homes. Power is used to run the servers themselves, and a large proportion is used for air conditioning to keep the servers running optimally. Both of these market-driven FSAs appear extremely energy consumptive. However, this perception has been reframed as an environmental FSA by cloud companies by claiming that the optimal use of cloud servers is vastly more energy efficient than if corporations use their own computing facilities on an intermittent basis, necessarily keeping them running for small loads and contingencies.   3.2 External FSAs: reputation commoditization and commercial and industrial contracting modes a. Commoditization: The cloud companies’ rationalization of their environmental performance by reframing virtualization benefits and other ancillary environmental efforts did not convince stakeholders such as Greenpeace (Greenpeace 2017 ; Miller 2011 ), who saw huge increases in fossil fuel-based energy consumption and demanded a switch to RE. Moreover, national stakeholders demanded that cloud companies initiate new sources of RE and support the transition of the grid (Bird et al., 2017 ; EPA 2018 ). The cloud companies responded to these demands through the long-term sourcing of new RE supplies while requiring measurable and transferable proof of their RE support. Due to the various options and qualities of RE (e.g., hydro vs. solar; some valued by stakeholders, some not), each company had to determine how RE was to be defined. With the engagement of stakeholders such the EPA, the Renewable Buyers Alliance, the WWF, RE100 and the Rocky Mountain Institute, the cloud companies’ viewpoints converged on a set of parameters: RE types that include solar, wind, and biogas (but excluding hydro and nuclear); production within regional grids; support for new sources of RE (so-called additionality); and a prerequisite capacity to make a unique claim to RE and to retire that RE claim from further market use. The commodity proof adopted by cloud companies is the renewable energy certificate (REC). The REC system had already been established in the US to certify purchases of RE by utilities from independent RE generators, primarily purchases mandated by portfolio standard regulations (minimum RE use by utilities). However, RECs do not signify additionality, leaving communication of this attribute up to the cloud companies. In the US, the REC system provides de facto property rights to enable RECs to be sold and bought, but it is a predominantly private sector managed system recognized by federal and state authorities. A corresponding mechanism would be required in other jurisdictions.  b. Commercial and industrial contract modes: Although the most important RE system innovation by cloud companies has been the opening up of utility grids to large-scale commercial and industrial purchases, the key to the grid is the contractual modes developed in the US to reduce financial risk for both generators and buyers (AAE 2017 ; BloombergNEF 2019 ; IRENA 2018 ; Wilson 2019 ). The generator seeks a long-term guarantee for demand to support investment in new development, while the buyer seeks control over prices and supply.    Power purchase agreements  (PPAs) represent the most important contract mode between generators and buyers. Google (2010 ; 2013 ; 2019)  originally repurposed what had been a contractual form used for bilateral agreements among utilities and independent generators. However, unlike utilities that can simply integrate RE into their grids, cloud companies must purchase RE from the generator and then sell it into the grid as a wholesaler. Cloud companies also have to incorporate a company with a license to perform such wholesaling. However, in most areas of the US, they still have to buy electricity retail from their regional utility, which gains this monopoly from its state government and regulatory commission. The granting of a monopoly has the purpose of protecting consumer costs and the reliability of supplies by maintaining the integrity of the grid (operations, maintenance, generation backup, and related costs). Google and the other cloud companies that followed in the use of PPAs would have to absorb or benefit from any differences in the prices of their wholesale of electricity and retail purchases. Green tariffs  represent a secondary contract mode between commercial and industrial buyers and utilities, and they were developed to reduce threats to grid integrity from commercial and industrial purchases. The utility agrees to allow sales through its grid of a volume of electricity equivalent to that purchased in a PPA as long as the buyer funds grid integrity. Green tariffs were developed through negotiations by Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook carried out in over half of the US states, with each green tariff composed of a list of different conditions protecting state and local stakeholders (AAE 2017 ; Facebook 2019 ; Guevara-Stone 2016 ). Green tariffs can be used to support utility-developed RE or that from independent generators. Green tariffs reduce buyers’ wholesale-retail price differential risk, and by 2020, they had become a favored FSA of Facebook and Google in particular, with each trying to develop or use green tariffs to their best advantage. Capacities to purchase RE through a contract mode such as the PPA and have it delivered through the grid in a socially acceptable manner were key to the development of commercial and industrial RE developments in the US home country. Equivalent mechanisms would be needed to couple RE to DCs as cloud companies develop their global networks in diverse host country conditions. 3.2.1 Diffusion of data centers and extent of renewable energy coupling Initially, cloud companies extended services globally from their US DCs using the global network of fiber-optic cables. However, with increases in data volume and demands to reduce latency between customers and DC computation, cloud companies globally expanded DCs rapidly from 2015 to 2020, investing tens of billions of dollars in fierce competition to build network economies. Fig. 2   maps the extent of the global diffusion of DCs and their coupling with RE. The map is simplified, only marking the locations where corporations have DC presence, when for volume and backup purposes, several DCs may be clustered. Amazon, for example, manages more than a dozen regions globally, with each containing one to several availability zones (each containing several DCs) and smaller computing facilities closer to demand (local zones and points of presence). Similarly, although RE is located in proximity to DCs, rarely are they adjacent; rather, the majority of RE sources are within the same regional electricity grid. The map indicates that cloud companies have not yet completely succeeded in coupling DCs with RE. This is the case because the speed of DC network building exceeds the speed with which the companies can build and negotiate access to RE through grids that are institutionally rigid. This pattern is most apparent in Asia-Pacific, where Amazon and Microsoft have aggressively built networks to capture Asia-Pacific’s fast-growing market (second after North America) (Cisco 2016 ). The pattern reflects the pair’s global commercial cloud shares of 33 and 18 percent (Synergy 2020 ). More oriented toward consumer demand, Apple, Facebook, and Google more closely match DC development with RE. The timing of corporate initiatives also plays a part, as Google led the way by not only leading hyperscale DC development in Europe but also coupling DCs with RE from earlier DC development. The concentration of DCs in Europe likely reflects the rapid transfer of home country cloud FSAs because of similarities among developed country markets and fiber optic infrastructure. The higher level of RE coupling also reflects similar developed market social demands for environmental performance. However, the concentration of DCs and RE coupling in Northern Europe, particularly in the Baltic Rim countries, does not reflect the fact that cloud demand is concentrated in Frankfurt, Paris and London. This is a reflection of locating DCs in a cooler climate but more importantly reflects regulatory and other institutions. The distribution of commoditization and contract modes is shown in Table 1  . Similar to US RECs, Europe developed guarantees of origin (GoOs) as a means to certify to buyers the fuel origins of electricity purchased to support activities such as consumer purchases or emissions trading. As in the US, GoOs have been repurposed for commercial and industrial purchases by cloud companies. However, unlike in the US, where national third parties govern REC trading across state jurisdictions, EU national governments limit cross-border trading among nations. Outside of Europe and North America, such RE commoditization is weak or incipient. Power purchase agreements have been used in every circumstance, seemingly with the absence of green tariffs used in the US to balance commercial and industrial purchases with the integrity of the grid and consumer protection. This absence, however, speaks to CSAs that enhance DC locations and that are negotiated with cloud companies. Indications of such CSAs, such as open grids, subsidies, and RE developer/distributor arrangements, are also provided in the right column of Table 1  and are elaborated in the case studies below.   3.3 Country and regional specific advantages Following Yin (2014) , a replication logic is applied to the analysis of the case studies to clarify how the use of the two dominant FSAs, commoditization and contract modes, vary depending on the country or region in which cloud companies are located. The assumption is that foresightful grid institutional reform or a willingness to negotiate institutional reform at least partially explains the selectivity of DC-RE coupling. However, climate and RE resource strength are also important, national RE subsidy schemes and local RE activities can help or hinder coupling, and some governments and regions are much more proactive in supporting DC locations. 3.3.1 The Nordic countries The reform of the European grid aspired to improve interconnections and greater cross-border sales, but governance remains primarily national and nationally interested (Deloitte 2015 ; Erbach 2016 ). Interconnection aspirations and the harmonization of national interconnections, liberalization and RE support, including GoOs, has been achieved to its greatest extent in and from the Nordic countries (Bröckl et al., 2011 ; Mundaca 2013 ). Thus, when in 2009 Google repurposed an old pulp and paper factory in Hamina, southern Finland, it soon initiated a PPA for windfarms to be developed in northern Sweden, using the integrated Nordpool grid and obtaining and retiring GoOs to prove additionality (Tung 2013 ). Google employed the same type of PPA developed in the US where electricity produced under its contract was sold wholesale to the grid near the generation source, and Google bought retail near its DCs. Google absorbed or gained the difference in prices. Since then, all of the cloud companies have focused DCs in the Nordic countries for access to the Nordpool grid, its competitive markets, wide selection of RE, easy transferability of its GoOs, and strong interconnections to other Northern European grids. A common pattern of development involves contracting with wind farm developers to build and operate windfarms, but shortly after completion, the facility is sold to an insurance company or other financial firm. Although Sweden, Norway and Finland have the most space and renewable resources for DCs, Denmark is closer to Europe’s markets and has better Internet cable connectivity and lower latency in addition to a skilled workforce and excellent electricity infrastructure and management. Moreover, it has a strong commitment to using its ample wind resources and has access to Nordic power supplies for redundant security. Apple, Facebook and Google have concentrated large DC clusters in the country’s agricultural west. Two issues are of note. First, despite Denmark’s reputation for support of utility supplied RE, Apple and Google introduced PPAs here, which were among the first nonsubsidy RE projects in Denmark. Facebook connected to a wind PPA in Sweden. While Facebook’s PPA seems to be less transformative of the national and local grid, Google and Apple faced significant criticism because Denmark’s energy transition is built on public subsidies and individuals were concerned that the cloud giants would be freeload off of public efforts. Indeed, this is a valid concern because estimates are that the cloud company-led DC industry could consume 17 percent of Denmark’s electricity by 2030. Second, again due to the advanced energy transition in Denmark, local stakeholders expected cloud companies to support district heating systems with their waste heat. They have done so but also face criticisms that the infrastructure required for their waste heat transmission and conversion would impose large upfront costs on local communities (Foresight/DBDH 2017 ; Sullivan 2015 ). Many of these issues have been addressed by national and local development authorities who strongly favor DC development.  3.3.2 Belgium and the Netherlands Amsterdam itself is one of the prime EU financial and corporate concentrations of DCs—the A in acronym FLAP + D (Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris plus Dublin) is used to identify these markets. Belgium, as the EU home base, also presents a significant market. Similar to Denmark, the two lowland countries are favored with low latency, a cool climate, excellent infrastructure and competitive electricity markets. Nevertheless, only Google is located here, and to do so within its RE commitment parameters, it has worked with stakeholders to develop FSAs and CSAs. The RE for Google’s first Belgian DCs seems to have been sourced from the Nordic countries; however, as it expanded its DC capacities, it sought closer supplies by undertaking its first offshore wind PPA. It bought 93 MW of a 370 MW wind offshore wind farm developed by French MNE Engie and contracted for its transmission from Dutch-Japanese Eneco. The PPAs in these systems are facilitated by contracts that allow electricity to be transmitted through the grid when the buying firm pays for grid access and costs and for the balancing of volumes (using the grid’s baseload) either directly with a utility or with a third party called an energy service provider (Dunlop and Roesch 2016 ; Douglas et al., 2020 ). While not sold through a contract called a green tariff as in the US, the ‘sleeve’ terminology is used to describe how the wholesale price obtained helps pay the costs of grid integrity and volume management. Whether this practice and terminology were introduced into the EU market by cloud companies is unknown, but this certainly speaks to the transferal of FSA capabilities developed in one market to another. The flexibility and diversity of supply modes in these countries has allowed innovations in the PPA theme. Google developed a double innovation in PPAs to supply its Eemshaven Netherlands DC. The first innovation involved working with three other MNEs (Phillips, AkzoNobel, DSM) to purchase the PPA, and the second PPA was for a windfarm owned by a cooperative of 4000 local citizens who retained five percent of power production for their own use (Google 2016 ; Zanchi et al., 2017 ).  3.3.3 Ireland Four cloud companies have built or are building DCs in Ireland. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are concentrated in the Dublin area with other cloud service providers and colocation facilities, while Facebook is based in the countryside. Dublin and Ireland have been transformed into a DC hub due to the presence of reliable power; high-speed fiber connections to the US, UK and EU; and a supply of large and low-cost buildings resulting from the 2008 bursting of the property bubble. Other factors amenable to DC investment FDI include low taxes, a moderate climate, an educated and English-speaking labor force, political stability, good infrastructure and probusiness policies (Callaghan Engineering, undated ). Ireland built a high capacity fiber ring around Dublin allowing access to transcontinental cables and introduced legislation designating DC as “strategic infrastructure developments” to facilitate local planning permissions (Dawn-Hiscox 2018 ). Ireland was amenable to cloud companies’ commitments, but not due to a government push for renewables—in the 2010s, Ireland still lagged in the RE targets set for it by EU directives (McLoughlin and Murphy 2019 ). However, the country does have excellent onshore and offshore wind resources and shows potential for tidal and wave power, and more importantly, Ireland uses a single grid into which all generators must supply their power. Ireland’s grid facilitates the use of PPAs because when firms enter an agreement with an RE provider, the firm can then either obtain a license that sells the electricity on to the grid directly or use an intermediary to buy and sell the electricity. The openness of the grid was capitalized on by cloud companies, and their drive toward RE was necessitated by a forecast that DC growth would consume over twenty percent of Ireland’s electricity by 2030. Facebook began its DC developments in Clonee in 2016 and has since expanded its DCs and RE, now claiming the operation to be 100 percent RE. Facebook entered into a 10-year PPA with international investment firm Brookfield, which already had 450 mw capacity in Ireland but was adding an additional 200 for Facebook (Judge 2016 ). In late 2017, Microsoft entered into a PPA whereby GE would build a windfarm (with generators also equipped with a battery to stabilize power flows to the grid) with grid transactions handled by a firm called Electroroute. Amazon developed two large-scale PPAs that were not only unsubsidized but paid for grid costs and reduced costs to consumers. Although Google has a large presence, it has yet to establish RE in Ireland. DC location, even with RE promised, is not always straightforward. In 2015, Apple was planning a large DC complex in Anthry and was seeking a total of 300 mw through PPAs (including a wave and tide proposal) (Paul 2015 ). However, the development met local environmental opposition in planning reviews and was referred to the courts. After a delay of 3 years, Apple decided to terminate its plans. The previously mentioned legislation allowing fast tracking of DC permission was prompted by Apple’s predicament but seemingly came too late (Moss 2018 ).  3.3.4 Asia-Pacific Although cloud demand is fast growing in Asia-Pacific, the coupling of DCs with RE lags behind that in Europe, primarily due to institutional barriers. The few examples of coupling bear out how these barriers have been overcome in the mutualistic development of FSAs and CSAs. Google first began to develop DCs in Taiwan in 2011, and by 2017, it had decided to build a hyperscale DC. Google’s attempts to obtain RE through the grid, however, were stymied by the national electricity monopoly (Kuo 2016 ), and it had to undertake a multiyear quest to change the system. In 2016, it supplied seed money for the Center for Resource Solutions to work with the Taiwanese government to develop an RE certification system similar to that of the US to lay the foundation for its PPAs (Hanna 2016 ; Wu and Huang 2016 ). Google also intended to use Taiwan’s experience to foster an REC system for the rest of Asia. Google worked with the Taiwanese government and with industry stakeholders to reform the electricity industry to allow the use of PPAs, culminating in the Electricity Amendment Act of 2017. Two years later, Google worked with three other firms to develop the country’s first PPA, albeit with a modest 10 MW solar farm built on stilts over fish farms. However, Taiwan has embarked on ambitious offshore wind developments. Apple has supplied its office, retail and colocation cloud facilities in Singapore and Japan with RE by establishing arrangements with local suppliers and regulators. The Singapore arrangement involves a 50 MW PPA with local RE developer Sunseap, which aggregates solar power from 800 rooftops. The arrangement is only possible, however, due to Singapore’s open grid. Sunseap also provides RECs that are certified by an evolving private third-party system. Microsoft used the same developer and REC system for 60 MW PPA a few years later. Japan proved more difficult because it did not allow PPA arrangements, and the cost of purchasing RE and RECs through existing providers was too exorbitant. Thus, Apple worked with a Japanese RE developer in a shared equity arrangement to aggregate solar energy. It still had to sell RE into the grid under Japan’s feed-in-tariff system and buy retail, but Apple held hope for the development of a better national REC system (Umaba 2019 ). Of the cloud companies, Apple is the most willing to directly invest in RE capacity. Apple has made commitments to develop two DCs in China’s Ghizhou and Inner Mongolia provinces and to power them with RE. Which type of agreement has been applied is unknown, although power for the Inner Mongolia DC is based on an agreement between Apple and the Ulanqab city government (Ejinsight 2018 ) while that for Ghizhou is forged with a state-owned enterprise. Both facilities are located in RE resource abundant areas. Apple’s capacity to supply RE to these DCs is supported by its efforts to encourage its Chinese suppliers to adopt RE, and this effort has resulted in Chinese suppliers delivering several hundred MWs of solar and wind power (Apple 2019 ). Australia has a smaller market with only Microsoft and Amazon building DCs and only Amazon coupling to RE, yet the Australian case is instructive for understanding the diversity of FSA-CSA interactions. Commercial and industrial PPA use took off in 2017, but Australia was particularly receptive to PPAs because its electricity grid is competitive in all stages: wholesale generation, transmission, distribution and retailers. To use the grid, participants must be authorized by the Australian Energy Regulator and provide consumer protections (Law Quarter undated ). Amazon worked with a leading provider of solar power in Australia to develop and build solar farms, from which they would take a large portion of the supply. The development of the commercial and industrial PPA market was supported by the initiation of the Business Renewables Center of Australia, which brought together businesses, regulators, academics and NGOs to advocate in a manner consistent (and linked) with the US Renewable Buyers Alliance. Australia also has a well-developed nationally regulated REC system through which a generator can pass on certificates to the industrial buyer, which can then retire them. Nevertheless, local governments and stakeholders influence this system, as in one of Amazon’s solar farm developments, the local planning authority received over 25 complaints against the development, prompting its review (Maisch 2020 ).  3.3.5 Latin America Latin America is only served by Microsoft in Mexico City and Buenos Aires and Amazon in Buenos Aires, and only in Chile has Google-coupled DCs with RE. Chile developed the world’s first competitive electricity markets in 1982, and this structure, combined with excellent solar and wind resources, made for rapid RE development. It took Google only 13 months of working with an international power company to install 776,000 solar panels to obtain 80 MW of power online. Although located approximately 645 km away from Google’s DC, solar power can be input into Chile’s main power grid. Subsequently, Chile’s four large national generators started work with commercial and industrial buyers, and Google signed long-term contracts with AES Genera for both wind and solar power in a contract that resembles a utility green tariff. The two companies also agreed to work together on cloud technologies to increase the efficiency of the grid. Importantly, Chile is the only country in Latin America with an REC system, and the country provides national land at favorable terms to wind and solar producers.    4 Discussion: RE coupling when FSAs and CSAs are complementary The results suggest strong complementarity between economic and environmental FSAs and a strong focus of MNEs on countries that are receptive to their FSAs. Equivalents to RECs are available in all of the markets that cloud companies have entered, and MNEs have almost universally used PPAs to secure their RE. The receptivity of most host countries has been passive insofar as their principle CSAs have been due to the pre-establishment of an REC system and of competitive and open markets. The pre-establishment of such institutions facilitated the introduction of corporate and industrial PPAs. That said, some countries and localities were willing to work with cloud countries to develop a mutually beneficial FSA-CSA relation.Proposition 1 Cloud companies will seek to couple their expanding DC networks with RE and will utilize their FSAs to do so . DC networks expanded rapidly and globally through the  2010s . RE coupling has followed with a short lag , although DCs are increasingly opened with RE already secured . Google first coupled RE to its Iowa DC and then signed its first overseas PPA for its Finnish DCs by  2013 and subsequently secured RE in proximity to most of its DCs shortly after opening or concurrent with opening . The other cloud companies followed this pattern within a few years . The preponderance of this coupling has occurred in Europe , particularly in the Baltic fringe countries and Ireland . The expansion into Asia-Pacific has been led by commercial cloud companies Amazon , Microsoft and Google , while Apple’s greatest presence is in its second largest iCloud market in China . Coupling has lagged in Asia-Pacific , but Singapore , Taiwan and Australia are developing effective models for coupling . Other than in Chile , there has been no coupling in Latin America and Africa despite significant DC investments and renewable resource capacities . It should be noted , however , that while the criteria for RE set by cloud companies require generation that is proxemic or at least within the grids that they operate , this linkage can be vague . For example , Google claims  100 percent RE supply , but it does not report RE supplies in Ireland , and the majority of cloud demand in Europe is in London , Frankfurt and Paris , but no cloud companies report utility scale RE supplies within England , France or Germany . Cloud company FSAs are embodied in RECs that include consideration for proxemic generation within the PPA and green tariff modes . RECs or their near equivalents are available in the countries where coupling has occurred . Europe had pre-existing GoOs , Chile alone within Latin America had RECs , Taiwan and Google developed RECs , Japan had a feed-in-tariff-based certificate system , and Singapore had a private-public REC system . Overwhelmingly , the RE supply mode is enabled through PPAs with independent developers and operators , and the DC accesses its energy through a volume stabilizing and reliable baseload grid . There is no evidence of the use of the US-developed green tariff contract mode , but as in the Nordic and the Low countries , the opening of competitive grids has allowed the inclusion of grid integrity costs into contracts with generators and distributors .  Proposition 2 Cloud companies will select foreign markets receptive to their FSAs . In Europe , the preponderance of coupling in Baltic rim countries is suggested by ample RE resources , but it is better explained by the pre-establishment of institutions that enable cloud companies to use their PPAs with low transaction costs . The Nordic states in particular developed a harmonized market and recognition of GoOs , strong grid interconnections and a well-managed competitive wholesale market for electricity . When Google decided to supply its Finnish DCs with RE , it was able to rapidly use its PPA expertise to develop windfarms in Sweden that connect to the Finnish grid . The development of competitive and open electricity markets also fostered the growth of many RE developers and operators and of financial institutions that would fund and insure against development risk and purchase solar and wind farms on completion . This large base of suppliers and financiers to choose from further enabled the use of PPAs , which is evident not only in the Nordic countries but also in Belgium and the Netherlands , where the cloud companies worked with a number of RE developers and electricity transmission and distribution companies . Ireland lagged in RE development compared to its Northern European counterparts , but it developed an open grid with a breadth of entities such as energy service providers , which the cloud companies were able to take advantage of and which pushed RE development forward . A significant issue for cloud companies taking out PPAs in Ireland , however , is that only generators can cancel GoOs  (Campmas et al., 2019 ). Green tariffs per se have not been used, likely because the costs of supporting grid integrity were for the most part built into contracts developed with the electricity transmission and distribution companies , which in turn are regulated by national authorities who ensure companies who provide and use the grid support the integrity of the system  (Dunlop and Roesch 2016 ; Douglas et al., 2020 ). This was the case in Northern Europe , including Ireland , and in Australia . The Australian case is notable in Amazon timing its PPA after the evolution of the commercial and industrial markets . Chile , as the global initiator of open competitive grids , provided quick entry for Google , even using an international developer . However , when national utilities realized the potential of RE , Google and a utility struck similarities to the utility green tariffs used in the US . Not coincidently , Google was placing more emphasis on green tariffs in the US by  2019. Rather than centering on a concern for grid integrity , critiques in Europe focused on whether cloud companies were unfairly exploiting national and local long-term subsidies to develop RE , especially since they would take up to  15- 20 percent of the total electricity demand in Denmark and Ireland . Likely to blunt this critique , Apple , Google , Amazon and Facebook initiated nonsubsidy RE developments . In this sense , they are outdoing their US operations that still benefit from federal and state tax abatements for RE production . That said , all Northern European countries have development agencies that strongly support investments by cloud companies , assisting them with land purchases and dealings with local authorities and securing tax concessions on electricity purchases .  Proposition 3 In certain situations , cloud companies will seek to change CSAs to accommodate their FSAs . The outstanding national cases are Taiwan and Japan . In the former instance , Google negotiated over several years to open up a national grid that was committed to the further development of centralized nuclear power so that it could use RE PPAs and to foster an REC system . Google believed that a Taiwanese REC system could be a forerunner in Asia , easing the use of PPAs elsewhere . Apple has not had as much success in changing the Japanese system , but it has repurposed the feed-in tariff system to achieve its RE ambitions . In addition to modifying CSAs or country conditions , the companies were willing to work with local governments and corporations to develop alternative development models and support local efforts . In Northern Europe , with its tradition of community-based RE , cloud companies developed district heating arrangements to use waste heat from DCs and even developed a PPA with one community-developed windfarm . DC projects are formidable land users ; thus , they are often subject to planning and environmental reviews . As Apple’s attempt to build facilities in Ireland demonstrates , these reviews may extend development times beyond what is acceptable to cloud companies or end in blocking DC and RE development . The basis for this analysis has been an examination of the conditions where cloud companies have located . This evidence can be supported by counterfactuals based on where they are not located , particularly in regard to Europe . The role of FSA-CSA dissonance is shown in Europe , where the main cloud markets of Paris and Frankfurt in particular are not directly coupled . Ironically , the main problem seems to be subsidies and regulations that support RE . France and Germany prohibit the issuance of GoOs to generators that benefit from subsidies ; thus , the Nordic countries , with their less restrictive practices , win out  (Campmas et al. 2019a , 2019b). Moreover , in European countries , energy-intensive companies do not use RE PPAs because they use risks lost in compensation for European Trading Scheme costs  (government compensation for internationally competitive , carbon leakage-prone industries ). Moreover , a utility-based  PPA market has not developed in some countries because generators of utilities are content with the government support they receive to develop RE ; thus , they do not actively pursue PPAs . For perspective , as stated above , Ireland does not let buyers of electricity retire GoOs , but at least they can buy them from a developer that may have a history of subsidies . The fact that Chile and Singapore are outliers among countries in their regions in that they have REC systems and attract cloud DCs underscores the counterfactual argument . India is an interesting case because although it has an REC system , Amazon and Microsoft have so far limited their RE investments in small rooftop solar facilities purposed for their office or distribution facilities . Perhaps the instabilities and institutions of the Indian grid have created barriers .    5 Conclusion The SDGs ask MNEs to support climate action and clean energy wherever they establish operations. Insofar as sustainable development recognizes the need to align environmental, economic and social development, these cloud companies demonstrate that economic and environmental capacities must indeed be coupled for the effective expansion of RE alongside the expansion of DCs. The cloud companies have developed a capacity to commoditize RE and make it transactionally and conceptually fungible as money or electrons. Thus, they can negotiate PPAs that meet both their financial and reputational risk parameters. These capacities were first developed in the US, but they became FSAs, as they have enabled cloud companies to not only enter foreign markets but also bring the innovations of commercial and industrial electricity purchases to these markets. Country conditions, however, have also mattered because it is the countries that had already established open and competitive electricity markets that have attracted cloud companies. Such capacities can be designated as possessing CSAs. Countries modifying their electricity grid institutions in response to cloud companies underscore the impacts of CSAs. This analysis indicates that Rugman and Verbeke’s (1998a ; 1998b)  logic of complementarity between economic and environmental performance has not changed simply because cloud MNEs have made commitments far exceeding regulations. The logic has not changed even though, ironically, MNEs have to fight government regulations limiting access to RE rather than strategizing how they have to override or live with environmental regulations. However, although Rugman and Verbeke (1998a ; 1998b)  claimed that small countries cannot establish or reap the benefits of pioneer regulations and institutions according to the Porter hypothesis (Porter and van der Linde 1995 ), this study shows that there are complex conditionalities to such relations (Ambec et al., 2013 ). The pre-establishment of competitive markets and corporate access to RECs in the Nordic countries, Chile and Australia has facilitated DC-RE coupling in these countries, whereas countries without such institutions have not received DC-RE coupling even where demand for cloud services should induce coupling. Furthermore, Kolk and Pinske (2008 , 2012)  claim that firms such as oil and automobile firms that are directly exposed to climate change issues will initiate the strongest response is called into question. Cloud companies have been able to respond so strongly because electricity is a cost that can be reduced and have been pushed to respond because their global reputations are at stake (Mayer and Gereffi 2010 ). Moreover, this study bears out that intrasector dynamics must be investigated to understand why different locations are selected for DCs and RE. As borne out by the worries of some countries and localities in regard to free riding on long-term collective efforts to foster RE or to maintain control over the local environment, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of MNE investment should always be practiced. Indeed, rather than being pioneers, perhaps these cloud MNEs are picking low hanging fruit, and further commercial and industrial demand for access may upset the stability of the grid. That said, the present work seems to indicate a positive pathway to bringing powerful MNEs toward the SDG goals of mitigating climate change, developing clean RE and transitioning electricity grids around the globe. The MNE’s commitments are important, but so are lessons to be learned from the ways that host countries have pre-established or modified their institutions to enable this rapid diffusion. Indeed, when considering the role of MNEs in pursuing the SDGs, it should be kept in mind that they represent only one side of the FSA-CSA duality. Countries must respond with institutional changes as well.  CRediT authorship contribution statement Jerry Patchell : research, Conceptualization, Methodology, writing.
