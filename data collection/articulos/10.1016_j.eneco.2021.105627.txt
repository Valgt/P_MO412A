                  Using a difference-in-differences approach, this paper investigates the impact of changes in China's sustainable economic development goals on the energy conservation and emissions reductions behavior of Chinese firms. On average, incorporating emissions reduction targets into the long-term development plans produced significant effects in terms of energy conservation and emissions reduction, reducing energy consumption intensity between 2008 and 2011 by 1.39% and carbon emission intensity by 2.37%. The effects were mainly achieved through two long-term mechanisms, namely, optimizing energy consumption structure and increasing investment in green technologies. Both reflect firms' preference to take long-term measures rather than temporary ones. We also found that non-state-owned firms, firms without government financial subsidies, and firms with high external financing dependence, put more effort into reducing their carbon emissions in order to comply with the adjusted goals.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, this paper investigates the impact of changes in China's sustainable economic development goals on the energy conservation and emissions reductions behavior of Chinese firms. On average, incorporating emissions reduction targets into the long-term development plans produced significant effects in terms of energy conservation and emissions reduction, reducing energy consumption intensity between 2008 and 2011 by 1.39% and carbon emission intensity by 2.37%. The effects were mainly achieved through two long-term mechanisms, namely, optimizing energy consumption structure and increasing investment in green technologies. Both reflect firms' preference to take long-term measures rather than temporary ones. We also found that non-state-owned firms, firms without government financial subsidies, and firms with high external financing dependence, put more effort into reducing their carbon emissions in order to comply with the adjusted goals.

Especially in recent years, the increasingly serious problem of high emissions in developing countries has attracted widespread attention (Li et al., 2019 ; Shi et al., 2020 ; D. Zhang et al., 2020 ). China's rapid economic growth following its reform and opening-up program in 1978 has been fueled by extremely high energy consumption along with massive carbon emissions (Xu et al., 2021 ). In response to the challenges posed by global warming, the Chinese government promised at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen at the end of 2009, that the country's carbon intensity (carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP) by 2020 would be reduced 40% to 45% below the 2005 level. To achieve the ambitious goal, the Chinese government announced to incorporate the carbon dioxide emissions reduction target as a binding indicator in its Medium- and Long-term Plan for National Economic and Social Development (hereafter, MLP) for the first time in history. In the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011–2015), 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020), and 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025), it subsequently pledged to peak carbon emissions no later than 2030 and to reduce the carbon intensity by 60% to 65% below the 2005 level by 2030.1  1 “The 14th Five-Year Plan for the National Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China” issued by the Chinese government [online; cited 13 March 2021]. Available from: http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-03/13/content_5592681.htm .   The government is clearly seriously concerned about China's contribution to global emissions and is determined to find ways to greatly reduce the country's energy consumption and emissions as quickly as possible. It is worth noting that in China the government's most important economic and social development long-term goals are announced in the five-year or longer-term development plans. These plans serve as a road-map for China's national economic development, including the major national construction projects, industrial layout, economic transformation and upgrading, innovation-driven strategies, environmental governance priorities, etc. In short, they delineate the general goals and directions for China's economic development through expected indicators and binding indicators (Wu et al., 2020 b). The expected indicators reflect the height of development that the Chinese government expects to achieve. The binding indicators reflect the work requirements of the Chinese government at all levels. To achieve the expected goal, especially the binding indicators, the Chinese government often needs to take extra steps to provide the correct policy environment and market environment. Therefore, with regard to environmental issues, incorporating emissions reduction targets into the long-term development plans now releases a clear signal of more stringent regulation policies in future, indicating how and to what extent the regulations pertaining to the environment should be followed. These official calls for real actions and investments in carbon emissions reduction are widely announced via all forms of media. All government departments at every level, all sectors of the economy and all firms, either state or non-state, are aware of the parts of the plans which apply to them. In other words, as sustainable economic development goals (SEDGs) are now incorporated into the long-term development plans, firms now have no option but to find ways to save energy and reduce their emissions. Otherwise, they could be continuously fined or permanently shut down in the future according to the standards which already existed before. This is quite different from the past when some high-polluting firms simply shut down their factories for a while as the calls to reduce emissions were merely discretionary and the environmental inspection policies were only temporary. Thus, the emissions reduction effects may be achieved through two long-term mechanisms. The first is that firms now may have an incentive to adjust the structure of their energy consumption, that is, by using more low-carbon energy to substitute for high-carbon energy. For firms in a developing country, this is not as easy a change as it seems. Indeed, some structural changes in energy consumption have been observed before at the macro level, but these may be due to the shutdown of high polluting firms, instead of improvements in these firms (Zhao et al., 2020b ). The other channel is to increase investment in green technologies, such as energy conservation and environmental protection equipment to achieve the goal of energy conservation and emissions reduction (Zhou et al., 2017 ). As carbon emissions reduction becomes a long-term goal, firms have more incentive to invest in energy conservation and environmental protection equipment which mean long-term benefits but short-term costs. From the perspective of causal identification, periodic changes in the emissions reduction targets will have different impacts on the firms in China's key monitoring industries compared to those in other industries. This provides an opportunity for effect evaluation. This article investigates the impact of changes in China's SEDGs on the energy conservation and emissions reductions behavior of Chinese firms. Using data from the China Taxation Survey (CTS) (more details are provided below) from 2008 to 2011, firms in the key monitoring industries were taken as the treatment group, while the other firms were made the control group to perform difference-in-differences (DID) estimation. In the robustness test, the propensity-score-matching (PSM) method was used to match the treatment group firms with the control group firms to do the PSM-DID estimation. The aim of this paper is not only to evaluate the actual energy conservation behavior and emissions reduction effects of including specific emission reduction targets in the development plans, but also to identify intermediate transmission channels and quantitatively measure the impact of these channels, so as to provide a practical and effective way for the Chinese government to comprehensively promote energy conservation and emissions reduction projects in the future. In this paper, two long-term mechanisms are identified, namely, optimizing energy consumption structure and increasing investment in green technologies. Both reflect firms' preference to take long-term measures rather than temporary ones. Finally, considering that the impact of changes in the SEDGs relating to energy conservation and emissions reduction depends to a large extent on firms' response and that there are many differences among the various Chinese firms (such as differences in ownership, political connections, financing dependence, etc.), this article uses a variety of heterogeneities to explore different firms' compliance and their energy conservation and emissions reduction behaviors. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2  provides a review of the related literature. Section 3  describes the study design, including the methodology and CTS data. Section 4  presents the baseline results, channel analysis, heterogenous effects, and a battery of robustness checks. Section 5  concludes with policy implications.  2 Literature review To jointly deal with global warming, governments around the world are all announcing policies relating to energy conservation and emissions reduction. Environmental regulation is the most important factor affecting energy conservation and emissions reduction everywhere (Ouyang et al., 2020 ). Over the past ten years, many scholars have conducted studies on the effects of various environmental regulation policies and have achieved fruitful results. These empirical results include, but are not limited to, energy efficiency (Bi et al., 2014 ; Mandal, 2010 ; Wu et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ), carbon price (Ren et al., 2020 ), carbon emissions abatement (Hu et al., 2020 ; Zhao et al., 2020a ), environmental performance (Huang et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2021 ; Yuan et al., 2017 ), climate change (Le Quéré et al., 2020 ; Ritter and Schopf, 2014 ; Smulders et al., 2012 ), energy transition (Huang and Zou, 2020 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Shi et al., 2020 ), productivity (Peng, 2020 ; Wang and Shen, 2016 ), innovation (Cai et al., 2020 ; You et al., 2019 ), firm investment (Dong et al., 2021 ; Liao and Shi, 2018 ), and labor markets (Sun et al., 2019 ). Judging from the conclusions of the existing literature, the research on the impact of environmental regulation on energy conservation and emissions reduction can be roughly divided into two categories. The research in the first category finds that not only market-based regulations, but also command and control regulation measures have worked effectively in emissions reduction in many countries (Pei et al., 2019 ; Zhao et al., 2020b ). These studies analyzed some specific industries in Canada, India, China, and the United States and found positive effects from environmental regulation policies relating to energy efficiency and emissions reduction measures (Laplante and Rilstone, 1996 ; Omer, 2008 ; Shahsavari and Akbari, 2018 ; Zhou and Huang, 2016 ). Recently, Pan et al. (2019)  used China's provincial panel data and found that command and control environmental supervision directly contributed to energy efficiency between 2006 and 2015, while market incentive environmental supervision promoted energy efficiency through technological innovation. Pei et al. (2019)  employed China's provincial panel data pertaining to energy-intensive industries spanning 2005 to 2015, and found that environmental regulations not only directly reduced carbon emissions, but also indirectly reduced carbon emissions through technical efficiency. The other category of research suggests that environmental regulation does not always work in promoting energy efficiency and emissions reduction: it depends on its timing and consistency. This research suggests that the impact of environmental regulation on energy conservation and emissions reduction is not significant in the short term, and may even be negative, that is, it will lead to an increase in energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity in the short term. The main reason for this phenomenon is that when the government is expected to adopt stricter environmental protection standards, firms tend to increase their energy consumption or increase their carbon emissions base, thereby creating greater bargaining space for future energy conservation and emissions reduction. For example, Smulders et al. (2012)  suggested that the early environmental regulations led to a rapid increase in carbon emissions. Ritter and Schopf (2014)  found that environmental policies not only led to accelerated mining of fossil fuels, but also to large emissions of greenhouse gases. Dirckinck-Holmfeld (2015)  investigated Denmark's environmental regulations and found that they could not improve energy efficiency. Hancevic (2016)  analyzed Mexico's Clean Air Act amendments in 1990 and found that environmental regulation had a negative impact on energy efficiency. Commenting on the Kyoto Protocol and countries that had pledged to limit global warming by reducing the demand for fossil fuels, Sinn (2008)  argued that if suppliers do not react, demand reductions by a subset of countries are ineffective, as they simply depress the world price of carbon and induce the environmental sinners to consume what the Kyoto countries have economized on. But in the long run, there is no significant difference between this type of research and the first type. According to the second category of research, environmental regulation can be pivotal in the achievement of energy conservation and emissions reduction targets set by the government. In short, environmental regulation will lead to an increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions in the short term, but will reduce energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity in the long term (W. Zhang et al., 2020 ). Something that can be gleaned from both categories of research is that the actual effect of environmental regulation depends on the transmission channels that affect firms in their energy conservation and emissions reduction behavior in the long-term as opposed to the short term. Normally, the transmission channels through which environmental regulation affects energy conservation and emissions reduction include structural adjustment (such as energy consumption structure, industrial structure, etc.) and technological transformation and upgrading (such as new technologies, processes, and products, etc.). At present, many studies are based on these transmission channels to support the adoption of environmental regulation policies to achieve the effect of energy conservation and emissions reduction. Given the above consensus and disputes, for most countries, especially developing countries, it is crucial to find a way to promote emissions reduction without hurting economic development too much. In this regard, Porter and Van Der Linde (1995)  argued that properly crafted environmental standards can trigger innovation offsets, allowing companies to improve their resource productivity, rather than simply add to costs. This “Porter Hypothesis” provides “hope” that accepting a fixed trade-off between environmental regulation and competitiveness unnecessarily raises costs and slows down environmental progress. However, it may depend on a country's innovation ability. As for developing countries, de Freitas and Kaneko (2011)  examined the decoupling between the growth rates in economic activity and carbon emissions from energy consumption in Brazil from 2004 to 2009 and found that the decoupling events were associated with energy mix diversification, carbon intensity improvement, and shifts in economic structure. They highlighted that Brazil's strategy for emissions mitigation from energy consumption was associated with fuel diversification (rational usage of natural resources), rather than improvements in energy intensity (technological route). Lin and Ahmad (2017)  decomposed the change in Pakistan's energy-related carbon emissions between 1990 and 2014 into pre-determined factors and found that carbon intensity was the key factor reducing carbon emissions while energy intensity and fuel substitution had mixed and unstable effects on the reduction of emissions. Using panel data for 87 countries from 2004 to 2010, Aşıcı and Acar (2018)  provided evidence that environmental regulations push the economic structure towards a cleaner transformation by which resources can be exploited more effectively, and short-run losses in economic growth can be avoided in the medium and long run, but are conditional on a successful transformation towards higher value-added and cleaner production processes. However, to date, a major policy factor that has been neglected in the research pertaining to China is that the government decided in November 2009 to include the carbon emissions reduction goals into the MLP as a binding index. Hence, the specific contributions of this study to the existing literature are threefold: first, it uses the Chinese government's policy practice of incorporating emission reduction targets into long-term development plans as a “quasi-natural experiment” ̶ and adopts a DID approach to study the role of long-term SEDGs in the development of environmental inspection policies. This research is a useful supplement to all the studies carried out on improving the environmental protection policy system. Second, the firm-level database used in this article is unique: the data is more authentic (investigated by the tax department), the coverage is wider (all industrial firms in China), and the sample size is larger (about 3 million observations), and contains detailed energy consumption data (such as the physical consumption of electricity, coal, and oil). Thus, this article can more effectively identify firms' response to changes in environmental protection policies and the transmission mechanism at the micro-level, thereby providing a reliable empirical basis for energy conservation and emissions reduction theory and policy design. Third, this article comprehensively evaluates the policy effects of China's launching energy conservation and emissions reduction actions and finds that with “long-term” emissions reduction action targets, firms can be encouraged to carry out energy conservation and emissions reduction actions through two long-term mechanisms, namely optimizing energy consumption structure and strengthening technological transformation. It is worthy of academic research and evaluation, as the government's experience and means to promote energy conservation and emissions reduction may be of significance to other emerging and developing countries in their quest to participate in global emissions reduction, i.e., help them balance “development and emissions reduction”.  3 Methodology and data 3.1 Methodology When the Chinese government declared making the carbon emission reduction goals a binding index in the MLP at the end of 2009, it created the conditions for what is known as a “quasi-natural experiment” with a treatment group and control group. Firms in China's key monitoring industries are expected to be more significantly affected than firms in other industries. In other words, changes in emission reduction targets will create significant differences among firms in key monitoring industries and firms in other industries. Thus, we conducted a DID approach to identify the effect:(1) log Y it  = β 0  + β 1  × post + β 2  × treat + β 3  × post × treat + β 4  × X it  + θ i  + ψ t  + ε it      Here, Y  are the explained variables, proxied by energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity. post  is used to distinguish the years before and after changes in the SEDGs, post  = 0 means from the year 2008 to 2009, and post  = 1 means from the year 2010 to 2011. Treat  represents the dummy variable of the treatment group of firms. According to relevant Chinese government documents,2  2 “Notice on further strengthening work to ensure the realization of energy conservation and emissions reduction targets in the 11th Five-Year Plan” issued by the State Council of China [online: cited 30 April 2020]. Available from: http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2010/content_1605326.htm .   the key monitoring industries for energy conservation and emissions reduction are the power, steel, non-ferrous metals, petroleum and petrochemical, chemical, and building materials industries. To this end, in accordance with the classification of China's national economic industries,3  3 Because the data from 2008 to 2010 were coded according to the 2002 National Economic Industry Classification, and the 2011 data were coded according to the 2011 National Economic Industry Classification, we adjusted the data from 2008 to 2011 to be coded in accordance with 2011.   we designated firms in the key monitoring industries for energy conservation and emissions reduction as the “treatment group”,4  4 The details of all key monitoring industries for energy conservation and emission reduction are shown in Table 1 .   and firms in the other industries as the “control group”.5  5 Information about the control group and the industries included in the control group are shown in Table R5  in the appendix.   β 3  is the coefficient of the interaction term, which is the core coefficient of this article. If the coefficient is significantly negative, it indicates that after the Chinese government included specific emission reduction targets in the MLP at the end of 2009, the energy consumption intensity and carbon emission intensity of the treatment group decreased more than the control group. This indicates that changes in the SEDGs are effective in changing the energy conservation and emissions reduction behavior of firms in the key monitoring industries. β 1  reflects the change in the time trend after the policy goal changes. β 2  reflects the original difference between the treatment group and the control group. X  represents the set of control variables, at the firm level, used to control factors that may affect the energy consumption and carbon emissions of the firm. θ i   and ψ t   are the individual- and year- fixed effects, respectively. ε  is the error term. To alleviate the concern that the selection of our treatment group was not random, we used a propensity-score-matching (PSM) approach to match our treatment group firms to more comparable controlled group firms. We further used the nearest-neighbor matching method to do the PSM approach and set the caliper to 0.05 multiplying the standard error of the propensity score (Cheng et al., 2021a ; Dehejia and Wahba, 2002 ). The main idea of the PSM method was to set up a treatment group and select the firms from the control group that had similar characteristics to the treatment group for comparison, so as to ensure that the control group and the treatment group were comparable before the SEDGs changed, and to ensure that the coefficient of the interaction term was the average treatment effect brought to the treatment group firms by the changes in the SEDGs. In this article, we selected the control variables at the firm level for matching. The matching results and propensity scores of all the control variables are shown in the appendix.  3.2 Data source and variables selection This article used data from the China Taxation Survey (CTS) from 2008 to 2011. This database is comprised of firms selected by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation using the stratified random sampling method. Approximately 700,000 to 750,000 firms are surveyed annually, covering all industries in the Chinese economy. Compared with other databases, this database not only collects detailed information on corporate tax payments, production and operation, fixed asset investment, and financial status, but also contains unique corporate energy consumption data, such as the physical consumption of electricity, coal, and oil, which makes the database more suitable for evaluating the impacts on firms of various policy target changes in energy conservation and emissions reduction. The number of observations of Chinese firms was 746,505 in 2008, 740,692 in 2009, 743,700 in 2010, and 694,313 in 2011. The unbalanced panel data of 2,925,210 firm-year observations was used in the baseline regression. In the robustness checks, we constructed a balanced panel data set with 245,635 observations for each year over the period 2008 to 2011. The energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity of firms are the core explained variables in this paper. First, it is worth noting that given the economic growth rates, a percentage decrease in emissions intensity is basically equivalent to a percentage reduction in total overall emissions, compared with a situation with no measures to control emissions intensity. As the world's largest developing country, China is experiencing rapid economic growth and energy consumption growth, which will inevitably lead to an increase in total carbon emissions. Moreover, China is still in a period of rapid urbanization and industrialization, and the increase in total energy consumption and total carbon emissions is inevitable. This is determined by the current development stage of the Chinese economy. Therefore, it is of more practical significance to focus on energy consumption intensity and emissions intensity because the same economic development goals will be achieved with lower carbon emissions. Second, at present, many environmental regulation policies formulated by the Chinese government focus mainly on energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity. This is the reason why this paper chose the carbon emissions intensity as the explained variable instead of selecting total carbon emissions. Finally, for developing countries, reduced emissions do not necessarily mean reduced total carbon emissions. A decrease in carbon emissions intensity also means a decrease in carbon emissions per unit of output, which can also have the effect of reducing emissions. Reducing carbon emissions intensity is the most important goal that China is pursuing before the “carbon peak” is achieved in 2030. Specifically, energy consumption intensity is obtained by dividing the total energy consumption by the total output value, where the total energy consumption is equal to the physical consumption of electricity, coal, and oil multiplied by the conversion coefficient of the respective standard coal.6  6 The standard coal conversion coefficients for electricity, coal and oil are 1.229, 0.7143, and 1.4571, respectively.   The carbon emissions intensity is obtained by dividing the total carbon emissions by the operating income, where the total carbon emissions are equal to the physical consumption of electricity, coal, and oil multiplied by the respective carbon emission factors.7  7 According to the IPCC (2006) , the carbon emission conversion factors of coal and oil are 1.82967 and 3.07267, respectively. Since the carbon emissions conversion factors of China's seven regional power grids are different, this article used the carbon emission conversion factors of the regional power grids where each enterprise is located to calculate the carbon emissions generated by electricity consumption (Yu et al., 2021 ).   In the regression, both the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity of firms take the log form. In order to control the possible factors that affect the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity, we introduced a set of control variables into the regressions.8  8 We obtained prefecture-level GDP per capita covering the period of 2008 to 2011 from the China City Statistical Yearbook  and took the log form (log_GDPper). Controlling for the GDP per capita variable in the regression, we could eliminate the impact of regional economic development on the energy conservation and emissions reduction of local enterprises. The new DID results are shown in Table R4 . We found that the coefficients of Post*Treat  in Table R4  were consistent with the basic results in this paper.   First, we used the number of operating years since the firm's establishment to measure firm age and take the log form. Second, the log value of total assets was used to measure firm size. Third, enterprise profitability and the leverage ratio are important financial variables that affect energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction. The higher the profitability, the more capable the enterprise will be in investing in energy conservation and emissions reduction. Therefore, enterprise profitability is negatively correlated with energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity. Similarly, the leverage ratio, another indicator reflecting an enterprise's financial position, may also affect enterprise energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction. On the one hand, the high leverage ratio may inhibit enterprises' financing capabilities in the future, thereby limiting enterprises' energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction. On the other hand, the high leverage ratio indicates that an enterprise has a certain bank-enterprise relationship and can obtain funds from bank financing. Such enterprises may be more willing to obey policy goals and carry out energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction. Thus, this paper introduces the profit rate and leverage ratio to the regression model, which aims to control the impact of the two financial variables on energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction. The profit rate equals net profit divided by business income. The total liabilities were divided by total assets to measure the leverage ratio. Fourth, some studies found that electricity consumption is affected by export intensity (Cheng et al., 2021b ), so we used the value of export delivery divided by business income to control the impact of export intensity. Fifth was the log value of government financial subsidies. Sixth, ownership comprises four types of firms in this article (state-owned firms (SOEs), private firms, foreign firms, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan firms (HMT)), and the private firms are the reference group in the regression.9  9 Table R1  in the appendix shows the correlation among the variables. We found that most of the correlation coefficients were less than 0.4, suggesting that there was no serious multicollinearity issue in the control variables.   Energy consumption structure optimization and technological transformation are two transmission channels for analyzing the impact of changes in the SEDGs on firms' carbon emissions. On the one hand, in the optimization of energy consumption structure channel, this article introduced firms' consumption of electricity, coal, and oil, respectively, and examined this channel by analyzing the impact of changes in the SEDGs on the consumption of electricity, coal, and oil. On the other hand, we used the investment in special equipment for environmental protection and for energy and water conservation, respectively, to characterize the technological transformation channel. The above five variables were taken in log forms. Table 2   shows the descriptive statistics of all the variables in this article. We winsorized the top and bottom 1% of all the continuous variables from their distributions.                 4 Empirical results and analysis We used the full sample and DID method to estimate the impact of changes in the SEDGs on firms' energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity. Following the results in the baseline regression, the two channels (i.e., energy consumption structure optimization channel and technological transformation channel) were tested. Subsequently, we divided the full sample into subsamples to investigate the heterogeneous effects. Finally, we used the PSM-DID method to eliminate the problem of non-random selection of treated group firms and undertook a battery of robustness checks. 4.1 Baseline results Table 3  reports the DID estimation results in the baseline regression. The coefficient of key interest is β 3 , associated with the interaction term post  × treat , which indicates the differential change in energy consumption intensity in the treatment group after the changes in policy objectives, compared to that of the control group. Column (1) reports the DID estimation results without any control variables, while Column (2) reports the DID estimation results with a set of control variables. In both columns, the coefficients associated with post  × treat  are both negative and statistically significant at the 1% significance level, indicating that the energy consumption intensity of the treatment group decreased more than that of the control group, and the policy effect was significant. Column (3) further controls the individual and year fixed effects. The coefficient of the interaction term is still negative and statistically significant. Besides, the magnitudes of the estimated results in all three columns are similar, suggesting the robustness of the estimation. Specifically, in Column (3), the magnitude is −0.014, showing that the energy consumption intensity reduction in the treatment group was 1.39% (e ‐0.014  − 1 ≈ ‐ 0.0139) higher than that in the control group. The above results all indicate that the Chinese government's inclusion of specific emission reduction targets in its MLP is effective in persuading firms to take steps to reduce their energy consumption intensity. In addition, the regression results of the control variables are basically in line with expectations. The larger the firm, the higher the profit margin, and the greater the export intensity, the lower the energy consumption intensity. The older the firm, the higher the intensity of energy consumption. Table 4  shows the DID estimation results for the impact of changes in the SEDGs on firms' carbon emissions intensity. Consistent with Table 3 , Column 1 contains no firm-level control variables, Column 2 contains firm-level control variables, and Column 3 further controls the individual and year-fixed effects based on Column 2. The results show that the coefficients associated with post  × treat  are all negative and statistically significant at a 1% significance level, indicating that the carbon emissions intensity of the treatment group decreased more than that of the control group, and the policy effect was significant. Specifically, in Column (3), the coefficient of the interaction term is −0.024, indicating that after the Chinese government incorporated specific emission reduction targets into its MLP, the carbon emission intensity reduction in the treatment group was 2.37% (e ‐0.024  − 1 ≈ ‐ 0.0237) higher than that in the control group. The regression results of the control variables show that the larger the firm, the higher the profit margin, and the higher the export intensity, the lower the firm's carbon emissions intensity. Based on the results in Tables 3 and 4 , the Chinese government's inclusion of specific emission reduction targets in its MLP was effective in persuading firms to implement measures to save energy and reduce emissions. Although the Five-Year Plans do not directly specify the energy-saving goals of each enterprise, the goals set in these plans can guide enterprises towards shifting to low-carbon and cleaner forms of energy. On the one hand, local governments can formulate more specific emission reduction targets based on the central government's target requirements, which would then be decomposed into layers and transformed into enterprise targets. As noted above, because the goals are public knowledge, when the central government disseminates the Five-Year Plan for emission reduction targets, enterprises had already anticipated that environmental protection agencies and local governments would strengthen their supervision. Therefore, enterprises in key regulated industries would take prompt emission reduction actions. On the other hand, at the time that the Five-Year Plan was being formulated, the state would correspondingly introduce a variety of supporting policies. For example, during the “Eleventh Five-Year Plan” period, the “Thousand Enterprises Energy Conservation Action” was implemented, and the “Ten Thousand Enterprises Energy Conservation and Low Carbon Action” was implemented during the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” period. The two actions further clarified the energy conservation goals of enterprises. Among them, the “Thousand Enterprises” refer to the 1007 enterprises within nine key regulated industries, including iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, coal, electric power, petroleum and petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, textiles, and papermaking, etc., which had a comprehensive energy consumption of more than 180,000 tons of standard coal in 2004. The “Ten Thousand Enterprises” referred to energy-consuming units with an annual comprehensive energy consumption of more than 10,000 tons of standard coal and key energy-consuming units designated by relevant departments with a total annual comprehensive energy consumption of more than 5000 tons of standard coal. The total number of enterprises in the “Ten Thousand Enterprises” was about 17,000. The Chinese government has recently promised the world that it would achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. These long-term goals have been written into the National Fourteenth Five-Year Plan and the 2035 Long-term Goal Plan. We believe that such ambitious environmental protection goals will inevitably create energy-saving and emissions-reduction policy effects on Chinese enterprises' energy consumption and carbon emissions.  4.2 Channel analysis Optimization of firms' energy consumption structure is one of the important channels through which this article attempts to test the impact of changes in the SEDGs on firms' energy conservation and emissions reduction. When faced with increasingly severe energy conservation and emissions reduction orders, firms are bound to adjust their energy consumption structure. Compared with the traditional forms of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, electricity is cleaner energy for consumption at the firm level.10  10 The carbon emissions conversion factors of coal and oil are greater than that for electricity.   This paper examines the impact of changes in the SEDGs on the consumption of electricity, coal, and oil, respectively, to verify the existence of the energy consumption structure optimization channel. The results are shown in Table 5 . Columns (1)–(2) report the DID estimation results for electricity consumption. The coefficient of the interaction term in Column (2) with controlling individual- and year- fixed effects is 0.123, showing that compared with the control group, after the SEDGs changed, the power consumption of the treatment group was about 13.09% (e 0.123  − 1 ≈ 0.1309) higher than that of the control group. In other words, the treatment group firms chose to consume more electricity to meet the stricter energy conservation and emission reduction targets proposed by the government. The coefficient of the interaction term in Column (4) was −0.087, indicating that after the Chinese government included the emissions reduction target in the MLP at the end of 2009, the coal consumption of the treatment group was 8.33% (e ‐0.087  − 1 ≈ ‐ 0.0833) lower than that of the control group. Furthermore, we found that the coefficient of the interaction term in Column (6) was −0.188, indicating that after changes in the SEDGs, the oil consumption of the treatment group was 17.14% (e ‐0.188  − 1 ≈ ‐ 0.1714) lower than that of the control group. From the regression results presented in Table 5 , it can be seen that an important finding is that when the Chinese government included specific emission reduction targets as binding indicators in its MLP in 2009, compared with the control group, the treatment group significantly increased its power consumption, and at the same time reduced its coal and oil consumption. This result verifies the optimization of the firms' energy consumption structure channel proposed in this article, that is, when firms face stricter standards relating to energy conservation and emissions reduction, they adjust their energy consumption structure by reducing traditional fossil fuel consumption and increasing non-fossil fuel consumption, such as electricity consumption, to achieve the emissions reduction goals. Technological transformation is the second channel proposed in this paper through which changes in the SEDGs affected firms' energy conservation and emissions reduction. Investment in special equipment for environmental protection and water conservation are adopted as the two proxy variables of technological transformation. Columns (1)–(2) in Table 6  report the DID estimation results of the firm's environmental protection equipment investment. We found that the coefficient of the interaction term in Column (2) is significantly positive and its value is about 0.012. This result shows that when the SEDGs changed, the investment in special equipment for environmental protection in the treatment group was about 1.21% higher than that in the control group. Columns (3)–(4) in Table 6  show that the coefficient of the interaction term is from 0.018 to 0.020, and is significant at the 1% level. This conclusion indicates that when the SEDGs changed, the investment in energy-saving and water-saving equipment for the treatment group was 1.82% to 2.02% higher than that of the control group. We therefore drew the following conclusion: after the Chinese government incorporated a clear emissions reduction target as a binding indicator in the MLP, the firms in the treatment group tended to carry out the technological transformation by increasing their investment in special equipment for environmental protection and energy and water conservation which ultimately helped reduce emissions. In other words, technological transformation is indeed an important channel through which changes in the SEDGs affect firms' energy conservation and emissions reduction.  4.3 Heterogenous effects 4.3.1 Role of subsidies Panels A and B in Table 7  indicate the DID results for firms that have and have not received government financial subsidies, respectively. All of the interaction coefficients in Panel A are not significant, which shows that when the Chinese government included specific emission reduction targets as binding indicators in its MLP, among the firms that had received government financial subsidies, there was no significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in terms of energy conservation and emissions reduction, and there was no obvious energy consumption structure optimization and technological transformation in the treatment group. This result shows that the changes in the SEDGs did not really play a role in energy conservation and emissions reduction for firms that have received government financial subsidies. By contrast, in the sample of firms in Panel B that had not received government financial subsidies, when the SEDGs were changed, the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity of the treatment group were significantly reduced compared to the control group; at the same time, the treatment group showed obvious characteristics of energy consumption structure optimization and technological transformation. The above results indicate that firms that had never received financial subsidies were more sensitive to changes in the SEDGs than firms that had received financial subsidies.  4.3.2 Role of ownership Panels A and B in Table 8  report the DID results for the state-owned firms and non-state-owned firms, respectively. In the sample of non-state-owned firms, the significance and sign of the coefficients of the interaction terms in Columns (1) to (6) are basically consistent with the benchmark results of this article, indicating that after the SEDGs changed, compared with the non-state-owned firms in the control group, the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity of the non-state-owned firms in the treatment group decreased more obviously, and this energy-saving and emissions-reduction effect was mainly realized through optimization of energy consumption structure and through technological transformation and upgrading. However, in the sample of state-owned firms, the significance of the interaction terms' coefficients in each column is much lower than that of the benchmark results. This indicates that when the SEDGs changed, there was no significant difference in the performance of the state-owned firms in the treatment group and the control group within the energy conservation and emissions reduction. We also found that the significance of the interaction terms' coefficients in the two transmission mechanisms was also weak.11  11 Due to the small number of observations in the SOEs group, we provided a smaller model with fewer regressors as a robustness test. Table R2  shows that the results were consistent.   This result shows that the non-state-owned firms were more sensitive to the government's emission reduction targets than state-owned firms. The estimated results in Tables 7 and 8  seem to indicate that firms having good relations with the government were more “indifferent” to changes in environmental protection policies. Therefore, we put forward a bold conjecture that the close government-firm relationship may make these firms “fearless”. There is insufficient motivation for them to actively optimize the energy consumption structure, promote technological transformation and upgrade to better meet future environmental protection requirements. This means that formulation of environmental protection policies alone cannot achieve maximum energy conservation and emissions reduction. More market-oriented reform measures are required, especially the establishment of a new “close and cleaning” political-business relationship. Perhaps it is only in this way that the implementation of environmental protection policies can be ensured.  4.3.3 Role of external financing dependence Panels A and B in Table 9  indicate the DID results for firms with high and low external financing dependence, respectively. The signs and significance of the interaction coefficients of each column in Panel A are consistent with the benchmark results, indicating that changes in the SEDGs indeed played a significant role in the energy conservation and emissions reduction in the treatment group of firms with high external financing dependence, whose reduction in energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity was significantly higher than that of the control group. At the same time, the characteristics of energy consumption structure optimization and technological transformation were also more obvious. By contrast, for firms with low dependence on external financing in Panel B, the treatment group and the control group did not show significant differences in the reduction of energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity after facing changes in the SEDGs, and the characteristics of energy consumption structure optimization and technological transformation were not obvious. The above results show that with changes in the SEDGs, firms with high external financing dependence were more sensitive than those with low external financing dependence. Based on economic intuition, firms with high external financing dependence would be subject to more financing constraints in the process of optimizing energy consumption structure and accelerating technological transformation. This would very likely weaken their motivation and ability to carry out energy conservation and emissions reduction. However, our results suggest otherwise. If the energy conservation and emissions reduction actions of Chinese firms are considered under China's credit market, the results are consistent with the bold conjecture proposed in Section 4.3.2 , that is, sensitive firms are more motivated to act on the government's development goals. When the government incorporated emission reductions in its development plan, firms expected the government to make supporting adjustments to credit policies, such as restricting bank loans to high-energy-consuming and high-emission firms. Therefore, firms with high external financing dependence had greater incentive to increase their environmental protection investment and optimize their energy consumption structure, to better meet the government's environmental protection requirements. By contrast, those firms with low external financing needs appeared to be fearless and largely indifferent to changes in the governments' environmental protection policies.   4.4 Robustness checks To do the robustness checks, we ran a battery of tests. First, we employed balanced panel data to replace the unbalanced panel data. Second, we added a robustness check to address the concern of the electric power. Third, we used the PSM-DID method to replace the DID method. Forth, to eliminate the impact of FDI on energy conservation and emissions reduction, we excluded all the foreign firms (including HMT and foreign firms) in the regression. Fifth, all the baseline DID regressions were re-executed with high dimensional fixed effects, including province × year  fixed effects and ownership × year  fixed effects. Sixth, we performed paralleling trend tests for the DID results following Benzarti and Carloni (2019) .12  12 As suggested by the reviewers, we replaced the individual fixed effects with regional fixed effects (i.e., city- and province-fixed effects) to run the regression. We found that the main results did not change significantly. The new regressive results are shown in Table R8  in the appendix.   4.4.1 Balanced panel data To eliminate the influence of non-balanced panel data on the baseline results, we retained the sample that existed continuously from 2008 to 2011 to obtain balanced panel data from 2008 to 2011. Table 10  reports the DID results for the balanced panel data. We found that the coefficients of the interaction terms were consistent with the baseline results. When the SEDGs changed, the reduction in both energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group, and this significant energy-saving and emissions-reduction effect was achieved through optimization of the energy consumption structure and technological transformation. Therefore, regression using balanced panel data would not change the empirical results of this article.  4.4.2 Addressing the concern of the power industry As the opportunity cost of reducing carbon emissions in the power industry may be lower than other industries, we make a robustness check to address the concern of the electric power. We rerun our regressions after removing the sector “Thermal Power Generation” in the treatment group. The new results are shown in Table R6  in the appendix. We find that all the coefficients of Post*Treat are consistent with the baseline results in the case of removing the thermal power generation sector in the treatment group.  4.4.3 PSM-DID method In order to ensure that the samples in the treatment group and the control group were comparable, we used PSM-DID for the robustness test. Regarding the PSM approach, the Kernel density of the treatment and control groups is shown in Fig. 1  . The result shows that after PSM matching, the difference between the treatment and control groups was insignificant. This means that the PSM matching was effective. The statistics of the PSM balanced test are given in the appendix (see the Table R7 ). The results also show that the PSM matching was effective. Table 11  reports the PSM-DID results of the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity of firms. It can be seen that the coefficients of the interaction terms in Columns (1) to (6) of Table 11  are significantly negative at the 1% level, indicating that the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity of the treatment group firms decreased more than those in the control group after changes in the SEDGs. Among them, the reduction in the energy consumption intensity of the treatment group was 1% more than that of the control group, and the reduction of carbon emissions intensity was 2.47% more than that of the control group. This is consistent with the DID estimation results in this article. Table 12  reports the PSM-DID estimation results of the mechanism test. It turns out that when the government incorporated emission reduction targets into its MLP, compared with the control group, the treatment group consumed more electricity and invested more in special equipment for environmental protection, and energy and water conservation. Put another way, the energy consumption structure optimization channel and the technological transformation channel still existed. Therefore, the empirical results of this article are reliable.  4.4.4 Controlling for FDI Previous studies have found that FDI may have a non-negligible impact on firms' energy consumption and carbon emissions (Malik et al., 2020 ; Salahuddin et al., 2018 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ). To reduce the interference of FDI on the evaluation of the economic sustainability goal policy effect, a feasible way was to exclude the sample of foreign-owned firms (including HMT and foreign firms) in the regression. The relevant results are shown in Table 13 . We found that the empirical results in the baseline regression and channel analysis are still valid.  4.4.5 High-dimensional fixed effects We replaced individual fixed effects and year fixed effects with high-dimensional fixed effects, which included province × year  fixed effects and ownership × year  fixed effects. The new DID regression results are shown in Table 14 . The results show that all the conclusions of the baseline regression and channel analysis in this article are still valid.13  13 After eliminating the interference of different policies in different regions, the basic results in this paper still exist. The results are shown in Table R3 .    4.4.6 Paralleling trend test The paralleling trend test is a key point to ensure the accuracy of the DID estimation results. It focuses mainly on estimating the interaction terms of treatment and all lead-and lag-years. If the coefficients of the interaction terms of treatment and lead years are significant, but insignificant for the lag years, then we can conclude that our DID estimation passes the paralleling trend test. Thus, we performed the paralleling trend test using the same method used by Benzarti and Carloni (2019) , Beck et al. (2010) , and Liu and Mao (2019) .(2) log Y it  = α i  + β n  ∑ n − 2 , + 1   D it n  + γ X it  + θ i  + ψ t  + ε it      The DID settings (i.e., post , treat , and post  × treat ) in the baseline regression (i.e., Eq. (1) ) were now replaced by a set of year-wise dummies D it  n   to capture the possible different trends in the two groups before and after the SEDGs changed. D it  n   equaled 1 if the firm belonged to the treatment group and n  years had passed since the year the SEDGs were changed, where −2 ≤ n  ≤ 1 due to the limited data available for this paper. X it  , θ i  , and ψ t  had the same settings as with the Eq. (1) . Each coefficient of the year-wise dummies was interpreted as the ceteris paribus difference between the treatment group and the control group. Table 15  reports the estimated coefficients of the year-wise dummies and other variables. We found that the coefficients of Y2008#Treat were insignificant, while the coefficients of Y2010#Treat, and Y2011#Treat were significant (and negative) at the 1% level. The results indicate that the changes in the SEDGs imposed a significant reduction effect on the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity in the treatment group in contrast to the control group. Following Beck et al. (2010)  and Liu and Mao (2019) , we also used the event study method to visualize the paralleling trend test. Fig. 2   plots the estimated coefficients of the year-wise dummies with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We found that the estimated coefficients began to decrease significantly from 2010, indicating that changes in the SEDGs significantly reduced the energy consumption intensity and carbon emissions intensity.    5 Conclusions and implications In 2009, the Chinese government incorporated specific emissions reduction targets as binding indicators into the medium- and long-term plans for national economic and social development. This new and important measure not only demonstrated the Chinese government's determination to switch to more sustainable economic development than in the past and signaled its keen efforts to increase energy conservation and reduce emissions, but also had a significant impact on the energy consumption and carbon emissions of Chinese firms. Based on this quasi-natural experiment, this paper used the unique China Taxation Survey data to evaluate the impact of changes in the SEDGs on the energy conservation and emissions reduction of Chinese firms. The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, incorporating specific energy conservation and emissions reduction goals into the MLP had obvious effects on energy conservation and emissions reduction: the energy consumption intensity of firms dropped by 1.39% and the carbon emissions intensity fell by 2.37%. Second, this paper verifies two channels through which changes in the SEDGs affected energy conservation and emissions reduction of firms, namely, the energy consumption structure optimization channel and technological transformation channel. Through this channel analysis, it was found that when the Chinese government incorporated clear emissions reduction targets into the MLP, firms' electricity consumption increased significantly, while coal and oil consumption decreased significantly. This implies that Chinese firms would achieve emissions reduction targets by optimizing energy consumption structure, increasing power consumption, and reducing fossil fuel consumption. At the same time, we also found that firms' investment in special equipment for environmental protection, energy-saving, and water-saving also increased significantly, indicating that firms would also achieve energy conservation and emissions reduction goals through the technological transformation channel. Third, the analysis of heterogeneity showed that non-state-owned firms, firms that had not received government financial subsidies, and firms with high external financing dependence were more active in reducing emissions when faced with changes in the SEDGs. The above empirical results have the following three policy implications: Firstly, incorporating specific emissions reduction targets into the MLP can achieve significant energy conservation and emissions reduction effects. It can guide firms in forming stable expectations, and achieve energy conservation and emissions reduction through medium- and long-term measures. For many developing countries, this approach can effectively overcome the instability of environmental protection policy implementation, and prevent firms from adopting merely temporary measures to deal with environmental supervision. Secondly, adjusting energy consumption structure, for example by increasing power consumption is one of the important ways for firms to achieve emissions reduction. But for many developing countries, not only is the power infrastructure weak, but continuous power shortages hinder the potential of a country's economic growth and also greatly stymie the motivation and potential of firms to reduce emissions. By the beginning of the 21st century, through increasing investments in power infrastructure and reforming the energy market, the Chinese government had resolved its widespread power shortages. However, power shortages still plague many developing countries, such as in Southeast Asia and Africa. We suggest that for developing countries with chronic power shortages, local governments should increase their investment in power infrastructure. At the same time, the international community should provide technical assistance to help establish a stable power supply for the growth of steady power demand so that firms can optimize their energy consumption structure and achieve emission reduction targets. Thirdly, not all firms will respond to changes in development goals promptly. Those that have a close relationship with the government and low dependence on external financing may be fearless and therefore lack the necessary motivation to save energy and reduce emissions. This shows that achieving emissions reduction targets requires a systematic policy system, not a one-size-fits-all policy. The independent formulation of environmental protection policies cannot achieve maximum energy conservation and emissions reduction. It also requires more market-oriented reform measures, especially the establishment of a new “close while cleaning” government-business relationship, to encourage all firms to reduce emissions together. Perhaps only in this way can we guarantee the implementation of environmental protection policies. As for the shortcomings of this paper, the firms' carbon emissions were calculated based on only electricity, coal, and oil consumption, because natural gas consumption was not included in the CTS. Second, the empirical sample in this paper covered only 2008 to 2011. This short span was inadequate in describing the trajectory of China's emissions completely. If the data becomes available in the future, we could provide a more solid analysis.
