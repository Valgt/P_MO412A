                  Over the past few decades, there has been heightened interest in developing modular, environmentally friendly, sustainable, and recuperative production processes that reuse, recycle, and reduce raw materials. The supercritical fluids extraction (SFE) process is emerging as a promising technology that can contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs). This review paper presents recent developments in using the SFE to recover bioactive compounds from biobased products and byproducts, emphasizing the potential use of this process in South America to help achieve the SDGs. The work focusses on critical aspects that have the potential to help increase the widespread implementation of SFE technology at an industrial scale. While data on economic feasibility and the environmental impact is limited, literature shows that among South American countries, Brazil has the greatest potential for obtaining various products from native and cultivated crops using SFE and achieving SDG 9. However, the dependence on imported equipment remains the major bottleneck.

Box: 170 Chile       Over the past few decades, there has been heightened interest in developing modular, environmentally friendly, sustainable, and recuperative production processes that reuse, recycle, and reduce raw materials. The supercritical fluids extraction (SFE) process is emerging as a promising technology that can contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs). This review paper presents recent developments in using the SFE to recover bioactive compounds from biobased products and byproducts, emphasizing the potential use of this process in South America to help achieve the SDGs. The work focusses on critical aspects that have the potential to help increase the widespread implementation of SFE technology at an industrial scale. While data on economic feasibility and the environmental impact is limited, literature shows that among South American countries, Brazil has the greatest potential for obtaining various products from native and cultivated crops using SFE and achieving SDG 9. However, the dependence on imported equipment remains the major bottleneck.

This agenda is an ambitious plan that consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets that integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social, and environmental. The goals comprise the end of poverty and hunger, protecting the planet, and the construction of peace focusing on a global solidarity approach [1] . Specifically, SDG 9 aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. In that context, novel technologies can contribute to job generation while more energy-efficient and sustainable processes are developed [2] . Therefore, the investment in scientific research and innovation principally in developing countries is necessary to close the gap between developed and developing countries. In the last decade, the industry has been focusing on developing a more sustainable production method to help achieve SDG. For example, concepts such as Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Circular Economy (CE) are getting paramount attention. I4.0 offers the automation of manufacturing processes by the customization and flexibilization of the production technologies. Moreover, the concept of the I4.0 is associated with information and communication technologies, digital manufacturing, worldwide competition, product diversification, and improvement of sustainable frameworks in cleaner processes [3] . The I4.0 technologies have significantly modified the food industry and has been characterized by new challenges, opportunities, and trends that have reshaped current strategies and prospects for food production and consumption patterns [4] . On the other hand, CE indicates a recuperative manufacturing process - that reuses, recycles, and reduces raw materials. The use of solvents is reduced by recycling into the process. In CE, the end-of-life notion is changed due to the development of systems that use raw materials intensively. Furthermore, alternative or renewable energy sources are used in processes that do not use hazardous chemicals. Therefore, cleaner production is one of the notable strategies for CE. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is a technique that uses substances at temperatures and pressures above their critical point. These substances are known as supercritical fluids (SCF) and possess particular properties. For example, SCF can diffuse like a gas while they have the solvation power of a liquid. Therefore, SFCs can penetrate deep into the matrix, extracting the targeted compounds. Moreover, the density and selectivity of the fluid can be changed just by adjusting pressure or temperature. Technologies such as SFE could have a meaningful contribution to the delivery of the SGD 9 under the approach of I4.0 and CE. Moreover, the linkage between SFE and SDG 9 can be clearly observed through the associated target 9.4. Target 9.4 states that by 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries acting following their respective capabilities [2] . SFE can provide a sustainable way of obtaining valuable natural products in processes that use non-toxic solvents such as CO2  and utilizes raw material intensively. For example, SCF can be re-used in the extraction process while different fractions can be obtained. Besides, SFE equipment offers high automation and can be easily coupled with other emerging technologies. For example, SFE has been successfully integrated with other novel techniques such as pressurized liquid extraction [5]  and ultrasound-assisted extraction [6] . On the other hand, although carbon dioxide (CO2 ) is the main greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, it is the most used solvent in SFE due to its lower critical conditions (30.9 °C and 7.38 MPa). CO2  is considered inexpensive, non-toxic and, nonflammable. Moreover, when CO2  is used as an extracting solvent, no chemical residues remain in the extract. Although CO2  has low polarity and it is not possible to extract polar compounds such as phenolic, through the use of co-solvents it is possible to change the polarity and expand the polar compounds to be recovered [7] . While generation of CO2  is harmful to the environment, the utilization of CO2  as an extracting solvent is one of the characteristics that allow SFE to contribute to the CE. For example, to reduce CO2  emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies are being developed. CCS refers to capturing CO2  emissions, compressing, and injecting deep into geological, oceanic, or mineral sites [8] . In contrast, CCU allows recycling and further use of the captured CO2  rather than storing it. Thus, the use of CO2  in the development of products and services can mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. This approach allows capturing the CO2  directly from the gas discharge from the industry or even from the air. CO2  capturing methods such as post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, oxy-fuel combustion capture, and direct air capture are intensively being developed for this application [9] . Once CO2  is compressed, it can be stored for further utilization in the industry. For example, CO2  can be used in food and oil industries, metals fabrication, cooling, dry cleaning, healthcare, and extraction solvent [10] . In that context, SFE systems can use CO2  from CUS technologies for the recovery of valuable compounds. At the same time, it helps to remove CO2  from the atmosphere, contributing to reducing carbon footprint. In the same way, extraction fits perfectly into the principle of CE. The SFE allows the intensive use of raw materials using non-toxic solvents in systems that allow close to complete solvent recycling. Thus, this work aims to elucidate the contribution of the SFE to SDG 9, focusing on South American countries. This work also highlights the South American biodiversity and its potential for obtaining value-added products by SFE. Although most of the topics discussed in this paper were previously reviewed in more detail, this review meant to raise the current status of the SFE technology in developing countries of South America and discuss some of the important aspects that can help increasing the industrial implementation of the technology in these countries, including integration of the SFE process, scale-up strategies, economic and environmental impact assessments, and the potential use of this process in South America linked to the SDGs accomplishment.  2 SFE to manufacturing value products Conventionally, bioactive compounds are extracted from plant- and algae-based materials using either aqueous or petroleum-based solvents [11–14] . However, petroleum-based solvents are non-selective. Thus, the extracts obtained using these solvents are not directly useable, i.e., it requires extensive purification steps. Bioactive compounds are thermally liable; consequently, the purification processes often result in either a product with decreased activity or with a trace of residual solvents [15,16] . Moreover, the solvents (except water - which have a high boiling point) are toxic, flammable, and expensive [17] . As mentioned above supercritical CO2  is emerging as a promising alternative for the recovery of bioactive compounds [18] . CO2  is a unique class of solvent which has a tunable solvent power [19] . The tunability of a solvent is the ability of the solvent to allows changing thermodynamic properties by altering the process variables. The use of CO2  has multiple advantages: it allows (1) customizing the properties to matches the target molecules and; (2) complete recycle of the solvent while avoiding the need for energy-intensive recovery options [20] . Besides, the “gentle” process helps to maintain the bioactive activity of thermally liable compounds. However, while CO2  is proven to be effective at small laboratory scale systems (including extraction of high added-value compounds), university to industry technology transfer is delayed because of the perceived high operating cost and lack of technical data for process scale-up [21,22] . Recent developments in the SFE technique allow in-situ  selective extraction of similar groups of bioactive compounds from various feedstocks, for example selective extraction of phospholipid, omega-3, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids rich oils, and carotenoid-rich extracts from various materials [22] . In this approach, two sets of extraction processes can be planned to achieve the objectives: (1) multistage selective extraction and; (2) multistage selective fractional separation. These two approaches allow producing bioactive ingredients which could be used directly in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics applications. The techniques also improve the yield and purity, minimize solvent consumption and extraction time, and support CE. In multi-stage extraction process, dried and milled solid materials are filled into a high-pressure extraction vessel while CO2  continuously flows up or down the packed column. In this case, instead of extracting at constant set temperature and pressure, it gradually increases in step function - starting at low pressure and working up -  while maintaining enough time between extraction. This approach will selectively extract only molecules with similar polarity at each pressure step. Non-polar and highly soluble compounds will be extracted first at low-pressure, the moderately soluble will follow, and then, the polar and sparingly-soluble compounds will be extracted at the end with the aid of co-solvents (e.g., using small percent of food-grade co-solvent) at high pressure [22–26] . For example, a five-step pressure will allow in-situ  extraction and separation of the products into five fractions with distinct compositions. An alternative to multi-stage extraction is to indiscriminately extract everything (both soluble and sparingly soluble compounds) at high pressure (e.g., 55 MPa) and then fractionally precipitate the extracts into multiple high-pressure separation columns based on solubility. In the first separator, compounds with low solubility will precipitate at moderate to high pressure. Those compounds which are still soluble at the pressure of the first separator will be carried over to the second column and the highly soluble and volatile fraction will be collected in the third and last column. The CO2  will then be depressurized and recycled. Integrating the two methods enable in-situ  extraction and separation of bioactive ingredients from various feedstocks [25,27] . Extraction of natural products is the most studied and widely applied technology among the supercritical CO2  technologies [23] . There are thousands of scientific papers published on the topic in the past three to four decades, with hundreds of patents filed [16]  and several market products. Some of the products extracted using CO2  include oilseeds, essential oils, CBD oil, spice oil & oleoresins, synthetic perfumeries flavors, fragrances, colors, hops, decaffeination of tea & coffee. In respective of the raw material, the extraction process and mechanism of obtaining the product remains the same. 2.1 Potential of South America biodiversity and SFE Biodiversity is the diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. More than 40% of the Earth’s biodiversity is in South America, more than one-quarter of its forests, and is the single most biologically diverse area worldwide [28] . For example, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela are known as megadiverse countries. They have the largest biodiversity indices, including a large number of endemic species (5000 endemic plant species each) [29] . For example, biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and cost-effective natural infrastructure [30] . In South America, biodiversity is crucial for human health (reducing the possibility of zoonotic diseases), agriculture (water, soil fertility, pollination, pest control, and growth and reproduction of food species), and weather (storm mitigation, climate regulation, waste assimilation) [31] . Due to its biodiversity, South America is an excellent source of indigenous fruits, vegetables, and plants to obtain compounds with biological activity [32] . In that context, South American biodiversity can provide a variety of sources for the extraction of several substances for which chemical syntheses could no longer be need. Therefore, although biodiversity does not contribute directly to SDG 9, it can enhance the potential of SFE and the accomplishment of the SGD 9. Moreover, among the species that comprise the associated biodiversity, SFE has been explored mainly wild and cultivated plants to seek several types of extracts with potential application in diverse industries. In that context, South American countries have great potential for the extraction of essential oils, isolation of bioactive compounds and the production of extracts rich in bioactive compounds. As can be observed in  Table 1 , in South America, mainly in Brazil, SFE has been used to obtain extracts from plants such as beetroot, yerba mate, feijoa, and pequí , among others. These plants are important due to their beneficial health properties. For example, yerba mate leaves water infusions are consumed in southern Latin America. Yerba mate tea has bioactive properties such as diuretic, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and central nervous system stimulant properties [33] . Similar to yerba mate, pequí is a fruit collected mainly in Brazil which has potential use for the fat industry due to its edible oil. In that context, crops like these have the potential to help achieving SDG 9. These crops present new opportunities for people in the regions when combined with the technologies such as SFE to produce greener and sustainable products through micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The widespread development of SFE technology could help solve the current challenges regarding the implementation of sustainable farming practices in South American countries and help advancing the principles of CE. Moreover, agriculture byproducts and organic wastes could be a valuable source of bioactive compounds and present an economic and environmental benefit capable of contributing to a CE in South American countries. Organic waste represents up to 50% of municipal waste in South American countries. Nonetheless, only between 1% and 20% of municipal waste is recycled, which indicates that approximately 90% of it ends up in landfills [50] .  Table 2  presents a summary of recent works that demonstrated the potential use of SFE to valorize agro-industrial byproducts in South America, mainly in Brazil. As can be observed in Table 2 , agro-industrial byproducts such as tobacco scrap [51] , passion fruit seeds [52] , and jalapeno industrial waste [53]  are a source of valuable compounds such as solanesol and phenolic compounds. Moreover, byproducts such as chañar almonds contain about 50% of edible oil with high content of unsaturated fatty acids. Salinas et al. [54]  used SFE at 60 °C and 40 MPa to extract about 84% of the chañar almond oil. In another work, Alvarez-Henao et al. [55]  obtained a phytosterols-rich extract from sugarcane bagasse using SFE. These compounds are known because they reduce serum cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. Moreover, sugarcane bagasse is one of the largest agro-industrial byproducts with potential application in several areas. In that work, an extract rich in β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol was obtained by SFE at 40 °C and 400 bar. Thus, by using SFE is possible to recover available high value-added compounds from agriculture byproducts or municipal wastes with potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industry, thus accelerating the transition towards a CE. In addition to that, it is important to highlight that using SFE it is possible to recover bioactive compounds with high purity, which can be considered more important than the compound recovery for many applications. Due to the tunable properties of CO2 , SFE can selectively extract different compounds, depending on the operating conditions used, resulting high purity of target compounds. It was possible to obtain an extract from annatto seeds containing 40% of geranylgeraniol when the CO2  density was decreased to 290 kg/m3 , while the extract obtained at a CO2  density of 840 kg/m3  resulted a geranylgeraniol content of 27% [56] . The extraction of α-bisabolol from candeia wood using SFE resulted extracts containing up to 53% of α-bisabolol, similarly to obtained by hydrodestillation, which is a longer process than SFE [42] . As it can be observed in Tables 1 and 2 , in general, extracts that are obtained by SFE using CO2  added of co-solvents present a lower purity than the extracts obtained using only CO2  as solvent. This behavior is related to the fact that polar co-solvents can improve the recovery of target compounds of intermediate and high polarity, but also decrease its purity since other non-desirable compounds can be co-extracted. Extracts from janauba leaves obtained by SFE revealed an euphol content of 75% when only CO2  was used as solvent, in contrast to 54% when ethanol was added as co-solvent [41] . Thus, depending on the application aimed for the extracts, the purity must be addressed other than the compounds recovery.   3 Intensified and integrated processes in biorefinery In addition to the utilization of SFE as a stand-alone technology for valorization of byproducts, the biorefinery approach has demonstrated a great potential to contribute with CE and fulfill the remaining gaps for the industrial application of SFE processes [65,66] . The concept of biorefinery is defined as sustainable processing of feedstocks for bioenergy and biochemical purposes resulting in various marketable products [67] . Biorefineries using intensified and/or integrated processes have been proposed as a recent trend to increase revenues with the production of multiple added-value products from renewable feedstocks with little or no waste generation, in addition to reducing the energy consumption [27] . Intensified processes are characterized by initiatives that can dramatically improve production capacity within a given equipment size, reduction of energy consumption and waste generation [68] . Process intensification can be achieved by combining techniques that can provide synergistic effects on improving the process efficiency and/or reducing energetic demands [69] . Interesting results have been obtained by intensifying SFE processes through the propagation of ultrasound waves in the extraction medium. The benefits of using ultrasound-assisted SFE is mainly related to physical cell damage caused due to local pressure differences, weakening of solute bonds to the plant matrix, micro-mixing to facilitate solute movement and to improve solvent accessibility, and macro-mixing to improve concentration gradients and, thus, mass transfer [70] . The application of ultrasound during SFE can affect both kinetic and extraction yield once this is probably the only way to produce mixing in SFE processes [71] . Interesting results have demonstrated that ultrasound assistance during SFE can improve the extraction kinetics, increase extraction yields, and reduce extraction time [70,72] . For example, the global yield of the SFE assisted by ultrasound (UASFE) of malagueta pepper (Capsicum frutenses  L.) increased up to 77% in comparison with the process without the assistance of ultrasound waves [73] . UASFE increased the global yield of rice bran (Oryza sativa  L.) oil by 27% in relation to the only SFE [74] . For the extraction of cumbaru (Dipteryx alata  Vogel) oil by UASFE, the application of ultrasound affected the extraction kinetics of fatty acids: a higher initial extraction rate was observed when SFE was assisted by ultrasound [75] . Dias et al.,[72]  have recently published a comprehensive review about the current status of extraction of natural compounds using supercritical fluids and pressurized liquids assisted by ultrasound. The authors remark that despite the positive results observed in the literature, the industrial application of UASFE is still challenging. There is a lack of literature dealing with the cost analysis and scale-up of ultrasound-assisted SFE. In addition, the high expenses with facilities, extraction time, and ultrasound power distribution in the extraction bed are some of the drawbacks for its industrial application. Another approach of process intensification is performing different extraction techniques using the same equipment, as described for manufacturing rosemary leaves [76] , for example. Firstly, a volatile fraction rich in terpenoids was extracted by SFE and, thereafter, the residue from SFE was directly used to obtain a non-volatile fraction by pressurized water extraction (PWE) using the same equipment. In this case, multipurpose equipment was used for process intensification, differently from integrated processes when different equipment are sequentially used to obtain each product of interest [77] . The integration of different extraction methods, including SFE, has gained attention in recent years since multistep biorefining processes may be able to increase the overall economic feasibility of extractions by adding an extra value product with different composition and properties. Therefore it may be more flexible for several applications, including foods, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics [65,78] . The multistep biorefining using SFE has been studied for different plants. Santana et al., [65]  have reviewed the perspectives on small-scale biorefineries using SFE integrated to other processes for several plants and byproducts, focusing on biorefining of crude plants and byproducts commonly found in Brazil.  Fig. 1  presents the proposed turmeric (Curcuma longa  L.) biorefinery. In this case, integrated processes were carried out to firstly obtain a volatile-rich fraction by SFE [79]  followed by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) to recover a curcuminoids-rich fraction using ethanol as solvent [80] . The PLE was further integrated to the supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) process to remove the ethanol from the extract, resulting the precipitation of a powder [5] . The depigmented turmeric residue is further extracted by subcritical water extraction (SWE) that resulted an aqueous extract rich in fermentable sugars and a partially-hydrolyzed solid fraction with a relevant starch composition [81] . Turmeric volatile oils and curcuminoid-rich extracts are extensively used for the formulation of medicines. Considering the poor stability and bioavailability of these constituents, the encapsulation of turmeric extracts by coprecipitation with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) using dichloromethane (DCM) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents and supercritical CO2  as antisolvent is a good alterantive [82] . In a more recent approach, the curcuminoids recovery step was improved by using high-intensity ultrasound-assisted (HIUS) [83] . The HIUS process enabled recovering the same curcumin yield obtained by PLE, but in a shorter time (5 min instead of 60 min used in PLE). In the same way, a biorefinery was proposed to valorize the annatto seeds ( Fig. 2 ). The biorefining starts with a selective sequential SFE to recover two fractions with different compositions [56] . The first fraction obtained at low CO2  density is rich in terpenoid compounds, mainly geranylgeraniol, while the fraction obtained at higher CO2  density is rich in tocotrienols. Beyond producing these two fractions of annatto seed oils, the defatted annatto seeds were subjected to HIUS to recover a bixin-rich fraction and, finally, the depigmented seeds were used to produce a pure starch by metabisulfite extraction [84] . Another integrated processes was carried out to firstly recover a fatty acids-rich extract from unripe genipap by SFE and, subsequently, obtain a genipin-rich extract from the defatted biomass using LPSE [85] . The results demonstrated that by integrating SFE+LPSE it was possible to reduce the cost of manufacturing from US$ 86.83/kg to US$ 11.18/kg of extract.  4 SFE process scale-up Building a resilient infrastructure promotes inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fosters innovation. Thus, scale-up is fundamental to reaching SDG 9 through innovation and further development of SFE equipment. The scale-up of extraction techniques, especially concerning SFE processes, is not trivial since it is not simply a case of increasing the volume of solvents and the amount of biomass [78] . In general, scale-up should ensure both profitability and the quality of the extracts. The great challenge of studying scale-up is the choice of the criteria, i.e., which parameters should be kept constant, which should vary, and how they should vary so that the extraction kinetics and extracts composition obtained at laboratory scale are reproduced at industrial scale [86] . Many research has been conducted on the scale-up of SFE from lab to pilot/industrial scale. Several scale-up criteria are established in the literature to be used depending on the mechanism that drives the process. Prado et al., [86]  divided the scale-up criteria described in the literature into three groups based on: kinetic parameters, bed geometry, and mathematical modeling. Briefly, the main criteria based on kinetic parameters are (i) constant mass of CO2  per mass of raw material ratio (S/F, Solvent/Feed ) when the solubility limits the process; (ii) constant CO2  flow rate to the mass of raw material (Q CO2  /F ) when diffusion limits the process; (iii) constant S/F  and Q CO2  /F  when both solubility and diffusion limit the process [87] ; (iv) another approach is to keep both S/F  and Q CO2  /F  in addition to a dimensionless number such as Re, that may imply changing the particle size of the raw material since variables as pressure and temperature are fixed [88] . The criterion concerned with bed geometry consists of maintaining constant the ratio of bed length and bed diameter (L b  /D b  ) [89] . The mathematical modeling aims to simplify the information, to describe and predict a process. However, although mathematical models based on the transport phenomena are critical tools in scale-up studies, they still present some limitations in reproducing the extraction curves at different scales [86] .  Table 3  presents examples of successful application of these scale-up criteria. As shown in Table 3 , the “scale-up” term is used for a wide range of extraction volumes. “Upscaling” may indicate the testing of parameters which were optimized using approximately 10 – 200 mL extractors, in 500 – 1000 mL extractors, while other studies have optimized parameters in 500 – 1000 mL extractors to then further scale-up the process to a 10 – 50 L pilot scale and even larger industrial volume vessels [78] . However, it is worth mentioning that the annual demand for processing some specific raw materials can be accomplished in vessels of up to 50 L, which means that this can also be considered as an industrial scale. Despite several studies have been dedicated to the description of extraction mechanisms and models for scale-up of SFE process, the results have demonstrated that stablishing an universal criteria applicable to different matrices is still a challenge, which becomes mandatory the development of scale-up studies for each raw material intended to be industrially extracted by SFE. So far, the criteria based on keeping kinetic parameters constant by using S/F  and/or Q CO2  /F  have shown the best results and can be used as good starts for further scale-up studies [86] . The success or failure of any scale-up process to reach the industrial application depends not only on reproducing extraction kinetics at different scales but also on several factors including instrumentation, batch/flow process, economics, and energy consumption [78] . Integrated processes allow sustainable processes that contribute to the CE. Promising results were obtained at laboratory scale for integrated/intensified processes applied to recover valuable extracts that has the potential to drive the scale-up studies in the future to be more focused on innovative extraction technologies, which would be more feasible alternatives than conventional processes [93] .  5 Simulation and economic analysis of SFE process Simulation softwares and models significantly improve process sensitivity analysis and optimization that further enhance the design and scale-up of the process. Furthermore, optimized processes allow efficient resource utilization (raw materials and utilities). In this regard, the proper utilization of simulation tools strongly contributes to SDG 9, by generating reliable data about the economic potential and environmental impacts of the processes under the I4.0 concepts, thus enhancing products diversification and global competitiveness of the SFE technology. SFE research over the past two to three decades using various raw materials indicate that the primary challenges that represent drawbacks for the widespread industrial application are mainly concerned with the economic feasibility of SFE processes, especially in developing countries such as those located in South America. In this regard, more recently, studies dedicated to the economical evaluation of SFE have been developed. Techno-economic evaluation is a cost-benefit comparison that measures the feasibility and establishes benchmarks for investments. By this assessment, it is possible to raises the gaps, needs, and opportunities for research that can advance efficient and economically competitive processes [94] . The main issue of economic assessment tools is input data availability, which requires assumptions as a solution. To avoid making the wrong conclusions, such assumptions must be practical and require solid knowledge of the process, process objectives, the vegetable matrix and products, and market trends [94] . Economic assessment is generally performed after a technical optimization of the extraction parameters to enable the definition of the process parameters that will be used for the simulation of industrial applications. One of the main assumptions made for economic evaluation is that at large scale, the extraction curves behavior and extracts composition maintain the same as those obtained at laboratory scale at the same conditions, keeping constant time, temperature, S/F ratio, apparent bed density, and porosity [95] . As previously discussed, this is a valid assumption for SFE of many vegetable matrices, but it is not for many others. In this regard, the scale-up studies prior to economic assessment may provide an additional guarantee for the correct design of equipment and economical estimates [78] . The economic assessment generally starts with calculating the cost of manufacturing (COM) that is encompassed by the following components: direct costs, fixed costs, and general expenses. Direct costs correspond to the expenses varying with the production rate. Instead, fixed costs do not vary with the production rate. This costs are related to depreciation, taxes, and insurance and is considered even if the process is stopped. General expenses are the necessary costs needed to maintain the business and include administrative, sales expenses, research, and development [96] . The initial capital investment of SFE is relatively high due to the high emphasis on the compression region, especially in meeting the requirement of high-pressure extractor vessels and compressor designs [97] . However, despite the high initial investment cost, research has shown that in most cases of scaled-up SFE processes, the final COM is almost entirely influenced by the cost of the raw materials. Evaluating the COM along the SFE kinetic curve, it is generally observed that the COM is higher at the beginning of the extraction because a small amount of extract is obtained and the specific cost of raw materials acquisition is high [79] . Afterward, COM decreases with increasing extraction times up to a certain value, usually located near to the end of the constant extraction rate (CER) period, that represent the period with the highest extraction rate with a recovery of approximately 50–90% of the extractable compounds [98] . However, as extraction time progresses, COM becomes dependent on the extraction rate and tends to increase since the diffusion-controlled period of the extraction is reached and a minimal amount of extract is available [79] . At a given fixed extraction time, the COM composition can vary with the production scale, generally being reduced with the increase in production capacity. This reduction is usually attributed to reductions in specific costs of labor, utilities, and fixed investment. In contrast, the specific costs of raw materials remain constant, which increases its share of COM with increases in production scale [99] . For example, the contribution of the raw materials costs to the COM increased from 3.6% to 39% with scale-up for the SFE of cupuassu butter [100] , and from 40% to 80% for pitanga leaves [101] . The main operating parameter that affects the cost of SFE is the extraction time, thus the optimization of this parameter in scale-up studies to maximize the extraction yield is crucial [102] . The pilot-scale testing after laboratory studies to optimize the extraction time is also very important for the correct design of CO2  pumps capacity. When the economic assessment is performed directly from the laboratory to the industrial scale, the pump capacity necessary to maintain the same extraction time at both scales may be out of reality. It can happen when laboratory studies use small amounts of raw material with intermediate/high CO2  flowrates that enable reaching large S/F ratios in short extraction times. If one simulates the industrial process maintaining the same S/F and extraction time obtained at laboratory scale, the required CO2  flow rate would be inconsistent with the capacity of the pump available in the market and represent high energetic consumption. In this regard, optimizing the extraction time in pilot-scale and adequate it to the capacity of commercial pumps is mandatory to result in techno-economic evaluations as closest to the realistic scenarios. As previously mentioned, in recent years many studies have focused on the techno-economic evaluation of SFE processes to obtain several bioactive compounds from different vegetable matrices.  Table 4  presents techno-economic studies developed during the last ten years in South American countries that aimed to demonstrate the economic feasibility of obtaining bioactive compounds from native plants by SFE. The data presented in Table 4  is not an exhaustive survey but enables observing that the SFE technology has been explored for obtaining several different classes of bioactive compounds with high potential of application in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries using a wide range of scales reaching up to 2 × 500 L. All the reported studies bring the COM of the extracts, but only some of them present data regarding the feasibility of the process, which is mainly due to the difficulties of establishing selling prices for the obtained extracts, since the selling price definition depends on several aspects including target market, extract composition and quality. To overcome this limitation, some studies perform a sensitivity analysis using different selling prices for the extracts to evaluate the minimum selling price that becomes the process feasible. This is an interesting strategy because enables people from the industry who has an updated view of the market to evaluate if the selling price that became the process feasible in the process is a practicable price for given markets. The economic evaluation of integrated processes that apply SFE in at least one step of the process has been demonstrated that the better use of the raw materials through the diversification of products obtained is a promising way to decrease the COM of the extracts.  Table 5  presents the studies of economic evaluation of obtaining bioactive compounds by integrated processes developed in countries of South America. Náthia-Neves et al., [85]  and Aguiar et al., [103]  compared performing the SFE in a single process and in an integrated system and demonstrated that the integrated processes reduced the COM, despite of the addition of unit operations. These observations corroborate the fact that a better usage of raw material is very important to increase the feasibility of SFE processes. In most cases, it represents the highest share in the COM. As it can be seen in Tables 4 and 5 , when byproducts and wastes are used as raw materials for obtaining bioactive compounds, that is the case of cupuassu [100]  and passion fruit [104]  byproducts, and assai waste [105] , the COM is expressively lower when compared to other “virgin” raw materials. In addition to reducing the COM of the extracts, the use of byproducts as raw materials for obtaining bioactive compounds by SFE can reduce the environmental impact since it enables reducing the disposal of these materials. The following section will discuss the data available in the literature about the environmental impact of SFE processes.  6 Environmental impact The adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes is a target point of SDG 9, and the CO2  emission per unit of value added is the one of the indicators of achievement of this goal [2] . As previously mentioned, the use of CO2  in SFE processes can mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions. Despite SFE is technically considered a mature technology, its industrial application is emerging and systematic studies regarding the environmental issues are still limited in the literature. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an interesting tool to disclose the impacts of supercritical CO2  processes and can provide interesting outputs to the technology development. A scientifically-based approach regarding the methodology of LCA of various production systems is presented in the ISO 14040 and 14044 guidelines, however, some authors have pointed out that the environmental impacts of emerging technologies, including SFE, cannot be evaluated in the same way and with the same precision as the mature technologies, since for emerging technologies other sources of information, such as patents, articles, and pilot data need to be used instead of – or in addition to – established databases, leading to a higher degree of uncertainty [114–116] . In addition to it, due to the lower maturity of the data for novel technologies, comparisons maybe positively biased towards the already existing processes, and environmental analysis may in fact hinder rather than promote the introduction of novel technologies, which raises the vital importance of the assessment of environmental impacts of novel processes and find ways to handle the inherent uncertainties in the interpretation of results [115] . LCA approach was evaluated to identify critical aspects of different green technologies, including SFE, hot water extraction (HWE), and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) for the extraction of phenolic compounds from spruce bark [115] . The use of ethanol as solvent in UAE and as cosolvent in the SFE was the main contributor in all the studied categories, except ionizing radiation, for the both processes. According to the results, the use of ethanol as cosolvent in SFE is not favorable from a LCA perspective due to the ethanol lost in the residual biomass, leaving only 82–83% as recovered and reused solvent. The ethanol production accounts for a significant share, more than 70%, of the total environmental burden in most impact categories. The CO2  had considerably smaller relative impact, attributed to the easy recovery that enables reusing as much as 98% of the CO2 . The environmental impact of obtaining volatile oil from Aquilaria sinensis  by SFE in Malaysia was assessed by LCA [116] . In this case that only CO2  was used as solvent, i.e., without ethanol as cosolvent, the extraction processes contributed to the highest impact toward the environment due to its high energy consumption. Nevertheless, this study considered laboratory scale data and the authors estimated that the process might reduce the environmental impacts when the maturity of the process increases. In general, laboratory scale experiments exclude the energy recovery, heat insulation, recycling of materials and process integration which could affect the overall process efficiency. However, when the technology matures and develops into larger scales, these aspects of the process can be achieved and further improve the environmental performance [116] . It is also worth to mention that, in Malaysia, the main resources of energy are comprised of coal, natural gas and hydropower with a proportion of 51%, 45%, and 4%, respectively, which means that by replacing the energy sources for renewable options could also reduce the environmental impact of the technology. The obtaining of essential oil from rosemary using hydro distillation (HD) and SFE was compared in terms of life cycle’s primary energy and carbon emissions in Portugal, following LCA approach [117] . The study considered fresh and dried rosemary samples. When the HD process considers a lyophilization step to obtain dried extracts, this becomes the most energy intensive process, since this step accounts for 97% of the total primary energy. So, considering the obtaining of 1 g of aromatic extract, SFE is the best process. However, if 1 g of α-pinene is considered as functional unit, HD becomes more attractive due to its higher selectivity in comparison with SFE. These authors also commented that the environmental impacts calculated in this study considering laboratory scale results could be reduced by increasing the scale production [117] . LCA was also employed to analyze the environmental impact of microalgae oil acquisition using different extraction techniques, including SFE, CO2 -expanded fluid extraction, and conventional extraction using organic solvents (chloroform, methanol, dichloromethane, isopropanol, and cyclohexane) [118] . Considering the solvents used in each extraction method, it was observed that the extraction techniques using CO2  presented a significantly lower environmental impact compared to the conventional extractions using organic solvents due to the harmful nature of these compounds. However, when energy consumption was included in the analysis, the environmental impact changed significantly. Extraction methods that required an intense energy input, such as SFE, suffered greatly from the propagation of the environmental impact from electricity generation, in contrast to what was observed for the conventional extractions that were less sensitive to the consideration of energy consumption [118] . A study comparing the potential environmental impact of three extraction processes to recover essential oils from citronella (Cymbopogon winteriana ) and lemongrass (Cymbopogon citrus ) in Colombia was performed by Moncada et al. [119]  The processes evaluated were water distillation, SFE, and solvent extraction, and considered two scenarios: (1) without any level of energy integration and (2) with full energy integration. The results demonstrated that the least harmful process was fully integrated water distillation followed by SFE. The carbon footprint analysis demonstrated that water distillation without energy integration was the most harmful process due to the energy required to heat the water to its bubble point. A similar effect occurs with SFE because the external energy required for the compression of CO2  leads to a higher carbon footprint. Considering all of these aspects, it is shown that the heat integration strategy should be considered in the design of cleaner processes. Similar results were obtained by the same authors for the extraction of essential oils from oregano (Origum vulgare ) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis ) [112] . Considering the expressive importance of energy integration in SFE processes, the biorefinering approach can also contribute in this extend. In this regard, exciting studies have demonstrated that the integration of SFE plants with (or in close proximity) to an alcoholic fermentation plant, that produces high purity CO2  as a byproduct and ethanol can provide a win-win situation since the power generation facility could be shared and CO2 , heat, and electricity can be bought at the manufacturing cost price [120–122] . For example, when a SFE plant to produce β-ecdysone-rich extracts from Brazilian ginseng (Pfaffia glomerata ) was integrated to sugarcane biorefinery, the simulation results demonstrated that the economic potential of the SFE process was increased up to 57% [121] . This increase resulted from the integration that allowed the use of the CO2  and ethanol (as cosolvent) available in the biorefinery with lower costs and to the energetic integration between the sugarcane biorefinery and the SFE plant. Based on the examples, using CO2  to replace organic solvents is an excellent alternative to reduce the environmental impact of extraction processes. However, the energy consumption of SFE processes remains a very important environmental issue. The adoption of renewable power sources is necessary to reduce the environmental impact of CO2  processes, as demonstrated by Wang et al.[118] . These authors reported that the environmental impact of SFE can be reduced to one-third when solar energy is applied and to one fourth when wind is applied. However, while the adoption of renewable energy is a promising way to reduce the environmental impact, the cost of this type of energy is also an important issue for the industry since the use of renewable energy can be up to six fold more expensive than the current power sources.  7 Research and innovation of SFE in South American countries To achieve the SDGs, governments have to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization. Therefore, according to the SDG’s agenda [123] , by 2030, significantly raising the industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product should be reached in line with national conditions. That includes supporting the development, research, and innovation in novel technologies such as SFE. Moreover, the access to financial services and the integration into value chains and markets of small-scale enterprises should be increased, especially in developing countries such as South American countries. South American countries based their economies on exporting natural resources. Moreover, industrial exports and exports of natural resources are the two primary growth patterns. South American countries import large quantities of goods. However, these goods are re-export but with little added value and, they have little recourse to local skills [124] . Although research intensity in Latin America has stayed relatively low, Brazil is the most prominent country in the region. For example, after a comprehensive search over the past five years in the Web of Science database using the keywords “supercritical fluid extraction”, Brazil is the second country in the world to produce articles related to SFE. According to the gathered data, the largest number of articles associated with SFE was from China (16.8%), followed by Brazil (11.87%), Spain (8.3%) and, the USA (6.7%). In South America, as expected, Brazil achieved the highest number of publications in the SFE area, as can be observed in  Fig. 3 . After Brazil, Colombia produced the largest volume of papers in South America in the last five years in the SFE area. In particular, Brazil focuses its SFE research on native and cultivated plants, as shown in Fig. 3 . On the other hand, countries such as Colombia, Argentina, and Uruguay are working to valorize agriculture byproducts such as mango peel, tobacco scrap, and byproducts from olive oil. South American countries have extraordinary biodiversity and a great variety of species that can be used as a source to obtain extracts with bioactive properties. Information about the small industries in South America that are developing or producing SFE equipment or value-added ingredients using SFE technologies is scarce. However, some companies have been doing efforts to establish companies dedicated to the production of extracts using SFE in South America, especially in Brazil and Colombia. The largest SFE plants installed in South America are located in Colombia and are dedicated to produce cannabis extracts: Clever Leaves [125]  has an extraction capacity of 104,400 kg/year and Blueberries Medical Corp [126]  has a capacity of 80,000 kg/year with prediction of expanding its extraction capacity up to five times in the future. Recently, a SFE plant to produce Cannabis extracts with extraction capacity of 44,000 kg/year was installed in Uruguay [127] . In Brazil, smaller companies – mainly startups – have been exploring SFE applications at pilot scale to produce extracts to be used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries [128–130] . Rubian Extratos [128]  is a startup company focused on developing biorefineries to obtain bioactive extracts, such is the case of active complexes obtained from passion fruit, annatto seeds, jaboticaba skin, and hop, that are already available for sale. S Cosméticos do Bem [129]  is another startup company focused on developing natural cosmetics – such as repellent sprays and rejuvenating serums - containing bioactive compounds from Artemisia annua  obtained by SFE. Bioativos Group [130]  also conduct R&D focused on developing integrated SFE and pressurized liquid extraction processes following CE and biorefinery concepts and had its initiatives toward a “Pollution-free planet” recognized by the UN during a workshop hold in Berlin in 2017 [131] . Bioativos’ portfolio includes extracts, essential oils and resinoids from clove bud and black pepper, among others. These Brazilian startups cases have the support of universities to conduct research activities related to extraction experiments and chemical and biological characterization of the obtained extracts, which demonstrates the importance of the private initiatives working in close proximity with universities to accelerate the development and industrial implementation of technologies such as SFE. The universities can provide technical assistance and facilitate the access to small companies that does not have in situ the infrastructure necessary to develop technologies such as SFE. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one company in Brazil able to produce SFE equipment from lab scale until 2 × 100 L [132] . As demonstrated in  Table 6 , some of the major market players, technology developers, and SFE equipment manufacturers are located in countries of North America, Europe and Asia. So, the dependency of South American countries on imported equipment may is one of the factors that hinder the larger industrial application of SFE in these countries.  8 Final remarks and conclusions Novel clean extraction technologies such as SFE can significantly contribute to reaching SDG 9 by enabling the intensive use of raw materials in cleaner processes that use GRAS solvents such as CO2  and ethanol in most cases. Moreover, the possibility of integration and intensification with other novel extraction processes can further contribute to I4.0 and CE. Due to its biodiversity, South American countries have great potential for obtaining several products derived from the SFE technologies. Therefore, the already started initiatives have great potential for expansion to attend to the current demands for producing bioactive compounds that are more environmentally friendly. Despite this, SFE is still far from a well-established production scenario in South America. One of the drawbacks of its expansion is the absence of SFE manufacturers in South America, which makes the industry dependent on imported equipment, substantially increasing purchase and maintenance costs. A large number of publications about SFE from South America, mainly from Brazil, demonstrates the technical potential of SFE to obtain various products from native and cultivated crops. However, it is still necessary to increase the data about the economic feasibility and the environmental impact of these processes. The generation of reliable data that provides enough information to encourage the industry to invest in the development and implementation of the SFE seems to be a critical factor in increasing its industrial application. In this regard, the participation of universities is crucial to enable the development of pilot tests and provide the technical advice needed by the industries.
