Renewable Energy Journal fla 09601481 218 119326 119326 119326 text/plain 2023-12-31 December 2023 © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Elsevier Ltd. Wang, Hu 
                  Renewable energy firms are mainly private. The long payback period and low return characteristics of renewable energy projects and the natural financing disadvantages of private firms seriously hinder the sustainable development of renewable energy firms. We study the impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development using a sample of Chinese renewable energy firms from 2008 to 2022. The results show that the increasing financial investment preference of renewable energy firms significantly inhibits their sustainable development. Further, we also find that the increase in digital inclusive finance and the increase in transparency weaken the negative impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development.

Does the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms promote their advance towards sustainable development goals? Hu Wang Conceptualization Data curation Formal analysis Methodology Software Supervision ∗   School of Business, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China School of Business Yangzhou University Yangzhou 225009 China  School of Business, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China  ∗ Corresponding author      Renewable energy firms are mainly private. The long payback period and low return characteristics of renewable energy projects and the natural financing disadvantages of private firms seriously hinder the sustainable development of renewable energy firms. We study the impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development using a sample of Chinese renewable energy firms from 2008 to 2022. The results show that the increasing financial investment preference of renewable energy firms significantly inhibits their sustainable development. Further, we also find that the increase in digital inclusive finance and the increase in transparency weaken the negative impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development.   Keywords Renewable energy firms  Financial investment preference  Sustainable development  Technical innovation  Capital allocation efficiency    1 Introduction China's carbon emissions have ranked first in the world since 2005, and the percentage of carbon emissions in total global emissions is rising, so the realization of the "double carbon" goal is facing great pressure [1 ]. At present, China's energy production and consumption show a structure of coal-based and multi-energy complementary sources, less than 30% of the total energy consumed is from renewable sources. Renewable energy has the characteristics of low pollution, low carbon emissions, and recyclable use, and the formation of an energy structure dominated by renewable energy is the future development trend [2 ,3 ]. In the tenth Five-Year Plan, China first proposed the development of renewable energy as a long-term strategy for the sustainable development of the energy industry. Since the beginning of the 12th Five-Year Plan, China has made the decrease of carbon dioxide emissions (carbon intensity) per unit of GDP a mandatory goal in the national plan and has identified key tasks, areas, and projects for addressing climate change. China has enacted a number of rules and regulations to promote the growth of the renewable energy industry, such as the Renewable Energy Industry Development Guidance Catalogue and the Measures for the Management of Additional Funds for the Development of Renewable Energy Electricity Prices. The Chinese government's support for the renewable energy industry has contributed to the rapid expansion of China's renewable energy industry. Renewable energy's installed capacity has increased from 570 million kilowatts in 2016 to 1.063 billion kilowatts in 2021, and the number of listed renewable energy firms has increased from 88 in 2010 to 168 in 2021, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2   . Due to the fact that China's economy is currently experiencing a new normal phase, economic growth shows a downward trend. As a consequence of the widespread COVID-19 epidemic and the growing uncertainty of economic policies, the downward pressure on China's economy continues to increase, resulting in a slow increase in energy demand. Compared with traditional fossil energy, the high cost of renewable energy has also become one of the obstacles to its widespread use [4 ,5 ]. Renewable energy projects are generally characterized by a long recovery period. As a means of lowering their exposure to default and other credit concerns, banks are more inclined to make short-term loans [6 ]. Therefore, renewable energy firms typically prefer to engage in long-term projects using short-term loans, which results in a maturity mismatch between investment and financing and increases their risks [7–9 ]. The low return characteristics of renewable energy projects make it difficult for firms to generate sufficient cash flow to repay short-term debt. When renewable energy firms cannot obtain new loans, they may face a fracture in the capital chain and fall into financial difficulties. Financial assets are characterized by strong liquidity, ease of cashing, and high returns. In order to better support the development of their main business, renewable energy firms will invest in financial assets to mitigate their financing constraints and timely cash assets to deal with financial difficulties. The high-risk characteristics of the financial market not only bring high returns to renewable energy firms but also increase the risk of asset loss. The increase in default risk for firms leads to banks tightening their loans, which further inhibits technical innovation. The sustainable development of renewable energy firms is crucial to the high-quality development of the renewable energy industry and the achievement of the "double carbon" target. Academics have studied renewable energy firms extensively. For example, Sadorsky [10 ] uses the variable beta model to study the determinants of the risks of renewable energy firms. The empirical results show that the firm's sales growth reduces its risk. When oil returns are positive and moderate, sales growth can offset oil returns, reducing systemic risk. Li et al. [11 ] study the influence of political relations on the firm efficiency of renewable energy firms in China and find that the higher the level of political relations, the stronger the relationship between political relations and firm efficiency. Liu et al. [12 ] find that the direct financing cost for Chinese renewable energy firms cannot be reduced by enhancing environmental information disclosure. Kempa et al. [13 ] analyze the difference in debt costs between renewable energy firms and non-renewable energy firms. The findings suggest that renewable energy firms may initially face higher debt costs, with cost advantages emerging over time and lower debt costs in economies with more developed banking systems. Qi et al. (2021) indicate that government subsidies improve energy transition performance. From the above research, it can be seen that scholars have studied renewable energy firms from different perspectives. However, the impact of renewable energy firms' preference for financial investments on their sustainable development has received little attention. The inhibition in the sustainable development of renewable energy firms will seriously hinder the realization of the green low-carbon transformation of China's economic development and "double carbon" goals. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how renewable energy firms' investment preferences affect their sustainable development to promote the renewable energy industry's high-quality development [14 ]. The contribution of this paper is mainly reflected in the following aspects. First, different from the previous screening methods for renewable enterprises, in this paper, according to the operating revenue of all firms in the concept plate that belong to the category of renewable energy, firms whose renewable energy business revenue accounts for more than 30% of their total operating revenue are manually selected as renewable energy firms. The sample in this paper can accurately reflect the renewable energy attributes of firms and presents good representativeness. Second, we investigate the impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development and find that the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms significantly inhibits their sustainable development. The financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development by inhibiting technical innovation and reducing capital allocation efficiency. The conclusion of this paper helps elucidate the underlying logic of the impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development and provides new ideas for promoting the sustainable development of renewable energy firms. Third, from the perspectives of digital inclusive finance and firm transparency, we investigate the moderating effects of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development. The conclusion enriches the literature related to renewable energy firms and financial investment and provides policy suggestions for promoting the sustainable development of renewable energy firms. The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2  presents related literature and hypothesis development. Section 3  develops the research design. Section 4  describes the empirical results and checks for robustness. Section 5  shows the channel tests between financial investment preference and the sustainable development of renewable energy firms. Section 6  presents the moderating effects between financial investment preference and the sustainable development of renewable energy firms. Section 7  concludes the paper.  2 Related literature and hypothesis development 2.1 Financial investment preference and sustainable development The indirect finance mechanism that predominates in China's financial system leads to the financing of firms mainly coming from bank loans, while banks tend to lend to state-owned firms in order to reduce credit risks. However, most listed renewable energy firms in China are private firms, which means that renewable energy firms often have difficulty obtaining financing. The long-term characteristics of renewable energy projects also enable renewable energy firms to use a large number of short-term loans for long-term investment, resulting in a maturity mismatch between investment and financing [8 ]. The low return characteristics of renewable energy projects would lead to poor performance by firms [15 ]. Affected by the normalization of COVID-19 and the increasing uncertainty of economic policies, the investment return in the real economy continues to decline, and the financing constraints of renewable energy firms become more prominent. In order to mitigate the financing constraints faced by firms and achieve better performance, renewable energy firms will invest part of their funds in financial markets and obtain higher returns through financial investment [16 ]. The high return of financial assets is usually accompanied by high risks. In order to compensate for the high risks borne by creditors, they may raise the loan interest rate on renewable energy firms investing in financial assets. This will increase debt costs and reduce the profits of renewable energy firms. The reduction of profits will inevitably affect the investment of renewable energy firms, forcing firms to increase short-term loans and invest in long-term investments and reducing innovation input. Long-term loans have higher risk and uncertainty than short-term loans [17 ]. In order to reduce credit risks, creditors may convert long-term loans to renewable energy firms and prefer short-term loans [18 ]. The reduction of long-term loans will force renewable energy firms to use more short-term loans for long-term investment, which aggravates the maturity mismatch between investment and financing and inhibits technical innovation. Technical innovation usually requires a large investment over a long period, which makes it difficult to obtain benefits in the short term [19 ]. Technical innovation is an important factor in sustainable development [20 ]. Therefore, the financing of renewable energy firms will significantly inhibit their sustainable development. Based on the above analysis, we put forward the following hypotheses.Hypothesis 1 The financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development.  Hypothesis 2 The financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development by inhibiting technical innovation.   Renewable energy firms investing their funds in financial assets will inevitably crowd out investment in their main business. It is not beneficial to improving production efficiency to reduce firms' investments in their core businesses, which causes a deviation in investment efficiency from the level that would be optimal [21 ]. The management of firms improves their performance and salary by obtaining returns through financial investments, and the high risk and high return characteristics of financial investments encourage the management to continuously increase investment in financial assets, thereby reducing investment in main businesses [22 ,23 ]. In the context of continuously increasing production costs such as labor and materials, the reduction of investment in the main business is not only detrimental to the maintenance of original production efficiency but even reduces production efficiency [24 ]. An increase in the cost of production will result in a reduction in output for the same amount of input, while the decrease in main business input caused by financial asset investment will inevitably prompt firms to reduce labor and material inputs or reduce the quality of labor and materials, leading to a decrease in production efficiency and significantly reducing the capital allocation efficiency of firms [25 ]. The decrease in capital allocation efficiency will seriously affect the sustainable development of renewable energy firms [26 ]. Based on the above analysis, we put forward the following hypotheses.Hypothesis 3 The financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development by reducing capital allocation efficiency.     3 Data and methodology 3.1 Sample selection and data sources The sample consists of China's listed renewable energy firms during the period from 2008 through 2022. Since there is no industry classification for renewable energy, we refer to the concept of firms that screen renewable energy firms. Renewable energy includes solar energy, wind energy, biomass energy, hydrogen energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, etc. In this paper, all the firms in the five conceptual categories of renewable energy (solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydrogen energy) that belong to the category of renewable energy are screened out, and a total of 627 firms are obtained. The business scope of all firms on the same concept plate includes business related to concept names. Although many firms engage in business related to concept names, the revenue from business related to concept names accounts for only a small part of their total revenue. In essence, such firms cannot be treated as renewable energy firms. In order to better reflect the renewable energy attributes of firms, firms whose renewable energy business revenue accounts for more than 30% of their main revenue are divided into renewable energy firms. After manual screening of the proportion of each firm's main revenue, excluding ST, *ST, or PT firms during the sample period and firm samples with missing data, our final sample consists of 157 listed renewable energy firms with 1,684 firm-year observations. The balance sheet, financial statements, ownership structure, management compensation, and board structure of the sample in this paper are from the CSMAR database and the Wind database. The firm concept plate classification and main business details are from Sohu Security.  3.2 Model setting Our baseline regression model captures the relationship between the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development:(1) S D i t   = α + β F i n i t   + δ C o n t r o l s i t   + θ i  + η t  + ε i t       where the dependent variable S D i t      represents the sustainable development of firm i    in year t   . We use total factor productivity (TFP) to measure the SD of renewable energy firms. TFP refers to the effectiveness with which resources (such as human resources, material resources, and financial resources) are developed and utilized. TFP is the foundation of firms' sustainable development. The widely used OP and LP models are adopted to measure the TFP of renewable energy firms [27 ,28 ]. F i n i t      represents the financial investment preference of renewable energy firm i    in year t   . In accordance with Demir's [22 ] research and in conjunction with the balance sheets of Chinese publicly traded firms, we categorize the following as financial assets: trading financial assets, derivative financial assets, net loans and advances, net financial assets available for sale, net held-to-maturity investment, and net investment real estate. The dummy variable of firm investment in financial assets is set as the proxy indicator of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms. When renewable energy firms invest in financial assets, the value is 1, otherwise it is 0. The control variables in this paper include: firm size (S i z e   ) is calculated using the natural logarithm of total assets; return on assets (R o a   ) is calculated as net margin divided by total assets; financial leverage (L e v   ) is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets; fixed asset ratio (F a r   ) is calculated as fixed assets divided by total assets; ownership concentration (O c   ) is calculated as the proportion of shares held by the largest shareholder; management compensation (M c   ); and the number of board members (B n   ). The model also controls the firm- and year-fixed effects.  3.3 Descriptive statistics The average value of financial investment preference in Table 1   is 0.626, reflecting that more than half of renewable energy firms will invest in financial assets. The average value of return on assets is 0.024, the minimum and maximum are −0.959 and 0.263, respectively, reflecting the low profitability of China's renewable energy firms as a whole, and the return on assets of the firms with the highest profitability is only 0.263.   4 Empirical analysis 4.1 Baseline regression results The results of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development are presented in Table 2  . The regression results in columns (1) and (3) show that the coefficients of F i n    indicate that the increase in the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms will significantly inhibit their sustainable development. The coefficients of F i n    in columns (2) and (4) further demonstrate the negative correlation between the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development, thus verifying Hypothesis 1 . Previous studies have pointed out that financial investment of firms crowds out their investment in main businesses and reduces physical investment [23 ,29 ], which is not conducive to their sustainable development. Our results are consistent with the results of previous studies, and we demonstrate that the adverse effects of financial investment on sustainable development also exist in renewable energy enterprises, thus providing new evidence for the adverse effects of firm financial investment.  4.2 Robustness tests 4.2.1 Adding control variables Considering that business revenue growth (G r o w t h   ) and economic development (R g d p   ) will affect the sustainable development of renewable energy firms. We add business revenue growth rate (G r o w t h   ) and economic development level (R g d p   ) on the basis of existing control variables, the level of economic development (R g d p   ) is measured by the natural logarithm of regional GDP. The coefficients of F i n    in Table 3   show that the increase in the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms will reduce their sustainable development.  4.2.2 Alternative measures of financial investment preference In order to mitigate the impact of variable selection on the conclusion, we select the ratio of profit from financial channels to operating profit to measure the level of financial investment preference of firms. The profits from the financial channels include investment revenue, profit and loss from changes in fair value, and other comprehensive revenues. To reduce the deviation caused by the negative ratio of financial channel profit to operating profit, the ratio of financial channel profit to operating profit is standardized. The financial investment preference of renewable energy firms can be expressed as: (financial channel profits-operating profits)/|operating profits|. The results in Table 4   show that the coefficients of F i n    suggest that the increase in the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms will inhibit their sustainable development, which supports Hypothesis 1  and verifies the robustness of the results.  4.2.3 Excluding the samples of financial crises We obtain the new samples after excluding the samples of financial crises during 2008–2009 to exclude the effect of the global financial crisis and re-estimate Eq. (1 ). The coefficients of F i n    in Table 5   prove that the conclusion that the increase in the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms significantly inhibits their sustainable development is still valid.  4.2.4 Endogeneity In order to mitigate the endogenous problem of mutual causality between the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development, we use the two-stage instrumental variable method to examine the impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development. We select the growth rate of the broad money supply M 2 g    as an instrumental variable. According to the results of the instrumental variable method in Table 6  , the coefficient of M 2 g    is significantly positive, indicating that there is a significant positive correlation between M 2 g    and F i n   . The results of the Kleibergen-Paap Wald rk F statistic and the Cragg Donald Wald statistic reject the hypothesis of insufficient identification of instrumental variables and weak instrumental variables. The p    value of the H a n s e n    test is greater than 0.1, indicating that there is no over-identification of instrumental variables. The coefficients of F i n    show that, after considering the endogenous problem, the conclusion that the increase in the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development is still valid.    5 Channel tests 5.1 Technical innovation Theoretical analysis shows that the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms will inhibit their sustainable development by inhibiting technical innovation. We estimate the model below to verify this channel:(2) T i i t   = α + β F i n i t   + δ C o n t r o l s i t   + θ i  + η t  + ε i t       where T i i t      represents the technical innovation of firm i    in year t   . We quantify technical innovation using the number of patent applications. In Table 7  , the coefficients of F i n    are significantly negative, indicating that the increase in the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their technical innovation. The results verify that the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development by inhibiting technical innovation, thus supporting Hypothesis 2 .  5.2 Capital allocation efficiency We verify the second channel that the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms affects their sustainable development here. The model we use is as follows:(3) C a e i t   = α + β F i n i t   + δ C o n t r o l s i t   + θ i  + η t  + ε i t       where C a e i t      represents the capital allocation efficiency of firm i    in year t   . We use inefficient investment to measure capital allocation efficiency. The higher the inefficiency of investment, the lower the capital allocation efficiency [30 ]. In Table 8  , the coefficients of F i n    are significantly positive, indicating that the increase in the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms reduces their capital allocation efficiency. The results verify that the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development by reducing capital allocation efficiency, thus supporting Hypothesis 3 .   6 Moderating effects 6.1 Digital inclusive finance The application of digital technology to the field of inclusive finance can effectively reduce the information gap between firms and financial institutions [31 ], improve the convenience of obtaining financial services, and expand the boundaries of financial services. Digital inclusive finance enables small and medium-sized private firms limited by traditional financial institutions due to relatively poor credit to obtain loans. Digital inclusive finance can effectively change the credit market structure monopolized by traditional financial institutions and reduce the cost of credit [31 ]. Therefore, renewable energy firms in regions with a higher level of digital inclusive finance may be more likely to obtain long-term loans at a lower cost, thus promoting their sustainable development. We construct the model below to analyze the impact of digital inclusive finance on the relationship between the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development:(4) S D i t   = α + β F i n i t   + β 1  F i n i t   × D i f i t   + β 2  D i f i t   + δ C o n t r o l s i t   + θ i  + η t  + ε i t       where D i f i t      represents the level of digital inclusive finance of firm i    in year t   . We use the digital financial inclusive finance index compiled by the Internet Finance Research Center of Peking University to measure the level of digital inclusive finance in different regions. We define the indicator variable of digital inclusive finance as 1 when it is greater than the median of the sample and 0 otherwise. The coefficients of F i n × D i f    in Table 9   demonstrate that the higher the level of digital inclusive finance, the smaller the negative impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development. The results show that the increase in the level of digital inclusive finance inhibits the negative impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development.  6.2 Firm transparency The timely release of relevant business information can effectively improve firm transparency. Higher firm transparency can help external investors understand the internal operation of the firm and effectively reduce principal-agent costs and information asymmetry [32 ,33 ]. Financial institutions assess credit risks according to the information provided by firms. The higher the transparency of the firm, the more accurate the assessment of credit risks by financial institutions, so as to reduce the risk of adverse selection. As a result, financial institutions are more likely to provide long-term loans to firms with higher transparency [34 ], thereby promoting renewable energy firms to increase innovation investment and promote their sustainable development. We construct the following model to analyze the impact of transparency on the relationship between the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development:(5) S D i t   = α + β F i n i t   + β 1  F i n i t   × T r a n s i t   + β 2  T r a n s i t   + δ C o n t r o l s i t   + θ i  + η t  + ε i t       where T r a n s i t      indicates the transparency of firm i    in year t   . We use firm earnings management to measure firm transparency. According to the modified Jones model, corporate earnings management regresses all firms through Eq. (6)  by year and industry [35 ,36 ]:(6) T A C C i t    T A i t − 1     = α 1 T A i t − 1     + β 1  Δ S A L E S i t    T A i t − 1     + β 2  P P E i t    T A i t − 1     + ε i t        Calculating the total discretionary accrued profit D A    from the coefficient estimated from Eq. (7) :(7) D A i t   = T A C C i t    T A i t − 1     − ( α ‾  1 T A i t − 1     + β ‾  1  Δ S A L E S i t   − Δ R E C i t    T A i t − 1     + β 2  ‾  P P E i t    T A i t − 1      )      where T A i t − 1      is the total assets of firm i    in year t   . D A i t      represents the total discretionary accrual profit of firm i    in year t   . Δ S A L E S i t      represents the change of total revenue of firm i    in year t   . Δ R E C i t      represents the change of the net operating accounts receivable of firm i    in year t   . P P E i t      represents the total fixed assets of firm i    in year t   . The absolute value of discretionary accrued profit is used to measure the transparency of firms. Firms' transparency increases with the decrease in value. We define the indicator variable of firm transparency as 1 when it is greater than the median of the sample and 0 otherwise. The coefficients of F i n × T r a n s    in Table 10   suggest that the lower the transparency of renewable energy firms, the greater the negative impact of their financial investment preference on their sustainable development. The results show that the increase of the transparency of renewable energy firms inhibits the negative impact of financial investment preference on sustainable development.   7 Conclusion As an alternative to traditional fossil energy, renewable energy is of great significance for optimizing energy structure, improving climate and the environment, and achieving sustainable development. We investigate the relationship between the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development and further analyze the influence channels and the moderating mechanism of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms affecting their sustainable development. We find that there is a negative correlation between the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms and their sustainable development. The financial investment preference of renewable energy firms inhibits their sustainable development by inhibiting technical innovation and reducing capital allocation efficiency. The increase in digital inclusive finance and the increase in transparency weaken the negative impact of financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development. The conclusions of this paper present important policy implications. First, regulators should strengthen subsidies for renewable energy firms, especially small and medium-sized private firms, and weaken the motivation of renewable energy firms to invest in financial assets so as to reduce their financial investment preference. Regulators should continue to improve the credit market structure and guide traditional financial institutions to increase long-term credit support for renewable energy firms. Improving renewable energy policies, providing a good environment for renewable energy firms, improving investment efficiency, and reducing costs Secondly, regulators should continuously improve the digital level of traditional financial institutions and further strengthen the efficiency of credit evaluation before credit granting, risk control during credit granting, and supervision after credit granting. Broadening the financing channels of renewable energy firms, improving the efficiency of credit resource allocation, mitigating the financing constraints of renewable energy firms, and effectively reducing financing costs Thirdly, renewable energy firms should strengthen the construction of firm information disclosure and internal control systems, improve the authenticity and accuracy of information disclosure and internal control quality, reduce information asymmetry and principal-agent costs, and mitigate the maturity mismatch between investment and financing. There are also some limitations to our study. We only consider the two mechanisms of technological innovation and capital allocation efficiency of financial investment preference affecting the sustainable development of renewable energy firms, and we may ignore other mechanisms where the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms affects their sustainable development. In fact, the financial investments of renewable energy enterprises may have many impacts on their sustainable development. Therefore, the impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development through other channels needs to be further studied. Furthermore, how the impact of the financial investment preference of renewable energy firms on their sustainable development affects the broader renewable energy industry as well as the development of a low-carbon economy is also worthy of more in-depth discussion in the future.
