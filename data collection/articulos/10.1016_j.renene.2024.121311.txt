                  Many nations want to use only renewable energy by 2050. Given the recent rapid expansion in RE use in the global energy mix and its progressive impact on the global energy sector, the evaluation and analysis of Renewable Energy's impact on achieving sustainable development goals is insufficient. Wind energy could be renewable. For smart grid supply-and-demand issues, wind power forecasting is critical. One of the biggest challenges of wind energy is its significant fluctuation and intermittent nature, which makes forecasting difficult. This study's goal is to develop data-driven models to predict wind speed and power. This paper uses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to improve a wind speed prediction and recommendation system for wind turbine power production using site climatological data. This system optimizes turbine use by selecting the right number of turbines to operate solely based on the required energy, which is related to wind power and speed, and recommends the best power station location to determine the best turbine run time. The Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS) includes the Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM), Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC), and Recommendation Module (RM). Test results showed the suggested method works in run time. The XGBoost or Random Forest regressor predicted 15-day power output with 94 % accuracy and 6 % mean average percentage error.

Given the recent rapid expansion in RE use in the global energy mix and its progressive impact on the global energy sector, the evaluation and analysis of Renewable Energy's impact on achieving sustainable development goals is insufficient. Wind energy could be renewable. For smart grid supply-and-demand issues, wind power forecasting is critical. One of the biggest challenges of wind energy is its significant fluctuation and intermittent nature, which makes forecasting difficult. This study's goal is to develop data-driven models to predict wind speed and power. This paper uses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to improve a wind speed prediction and recommendation system for wind turbine power production using site climatological data. This system optimizes turbine use by selecting the right number of turbines to operate solely based on the required energy, which is related to wind power and speed, and recommends the best power station location to determine the best turbine run time. The Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS) includes the Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM), Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC), and Recommendation Module (RM). Test results showed the suggested method works in run time. The XGBoost or Random Forest regressor predicted 15-day power output with 94 % accuracy and 6 % mean average percentage error.   Keywords Data-driven model  Sustainable energy  Recommendation system  Wind speed prediction    1 Introduction Energy is essential to our daily existence. The ongoing increase in worldwide electricity consumption, which correlates with population and economic growth, causes a number of problems. Firstly, the world's energy sectors are under immense pressure to provide reliable and secure electricity production. In addition, extensive grid-connected renewable energy power generation may be detrimental to power networks. In order to tackle these issues, it is imperative to create an accurate energy forecasting model [1 ]. As a result of the increasing cost of oil and the consequences of climate change, many countries have advocated for the formulation of renewable energy strategies. Wind energy, a prevalent renewable energy source, has garnered significant interest from both academia and the business sector. In 2021, renewable energy accounted for approximately 13 % of electricity generation, surpassing nuclear energy's share of 9.8 %, as shown in Fig. 1   [2 ]. 1.1 Overview The substantial instability and uncertainty of Wind Power Generation (WPG), which is rapidly influenced by meteorological and environmental conditions, pose challenges for its integration into energy production. As a result, precise WPG prediction is critical for formulating strategies for renewable energy sources as well as organizing and coordinating grid operations. In light of the coming energy crisis brought on by the rapid depletion of these resources and the enormous difficulties posed by environmental issues, wind power is swiftly overtaking fossil fuels as the world's primary source of energy [4 ]. Nevertheless, as wind energy expands, its numerous connections might quickly lead to a decline in frequency, grid voltage, power angle, and other characteristics, which could pose severe safety hazards to business and daily life. The most significant indices of a nation's level of development nowadays are the production and consumption of electricity [5 ]. Despite the fact that fossil fuels are becoming scarce, they still provide a significant portion of the world's energy requirements. The demand for power in developing nations is also constantly rising [6 ]. As a result, clean, renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar energy, have received a lot of attention recently. Other inexpensive or free methods of generating electricity can compete with wind power. To produce enough electricity, wind power facilities need a consistent wind speed [7 ]. The development of very precise wind speed prediction systems is necessary for power system dependability and quality. It is possible to exercise control over the anticipated power and create a generational strategy by anticipating future wind power. It is effective to prevent problems with power grid stability brought on by wind power fluctuations by using short-term wind power forecasts [8 ]. Future grid operations depend on the ability to predict short-term wind speeds, yet this is a challenging task. Based on the time horizon, we can divide the prediction problem into three groups: short-term, long-term, and immediate [9 ]. The study of wind energy prediction is currently almost finished. The two most popular types of prediction are physical and statistical approaches [10 ]. To build the meteorology model of the wind farm, the physical technique starts by looking at physical factors such as terrain and climate background. The meteorological model then produces the weather forecast. Finally, we use the fan's output curve, which is a function of the weather data, as the independent variable to calculate the fan's output power.  1.2 Motivation The theory of statistics provides the fundamental basis for the implementation of statistical methods [11 ]. Initially, data regarding previous wind power plant operations, encompassing wind power and velocity, is acquired. Next, the mapping connection between them is analyzed. Ultimately, the prediction of future power can be achieved by understanding this mapping correlation [12 ]. Several techniques, such as support vector regression, time series methods, regression-based methods, spatiotemporal models, the Kalman method, Machine Learning (ML), support vector machines, Markov chains, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models, and gray prediction, are employed to tackle this issue [13 ]. Hybrid statistical models combined with ANNs have recently garnered significant interest. The transition to renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Among the various renewable energy sources, wind energy stands out due to its abundance and potential to significantly contribute to the global energy mix. However, the inherent variability and unpredictability of wind pose significant challenges to the efficient and reliable operation of wind turbines. Accurate wind speed and power output prediction are essential for optimizing the performance of wind farms, ensuring grid stability, and maximizing energy production. Despite advancements in predictive modeling, existing methods often struggle with the complex and dynamic nature of wind patterns, leading to suboptimal performance and reliability issues. The need for improved prediction accuracy and interpretability of models is paramount. This drives our motivation to develop an enhanced recommendation system that leverages site-specific climatic data and advanced ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. By addressing these challenges, we aim to contribute to the efficient utilization of wind energy resources, ultimately supporting the broader goal of a sustainable and resilient energy future. Power consumption forecasts can be categorized into short-term and medium-to long-term predictions based on the duration of the forecasting period [14 ]. The main emphasis of short-term forecasting is making hour-by-hour projections. It facilitates power trading and the calculation of spot prices, which are both essential for ensuring a reliable energy supply in the future [14 ,15 ]. Mid- and long-term forecasting, which specifically considers time frames spanning from weeks to years, significantly influences the advancement of transmission and distribution networks [16 ], the creation of energy plans [17 ], and the establishment and upkeep of generation facilities [14 ,18 ,19 ].  1.3 Research problem Wind energy's potential as a sustainable and clean power source is significant, yet its effective utilization is hindered by several key challenges. The primary issue is the inherent variability and unpredictability of wind, which complicates the task of forecasting wind speeds and the subsequent power output of wind turbines. Current predictive models often fall short in accuracy and reliability, which can lead to inefficient energy production, increased operational costs, and challenges in grid management. Furthermore, the lack of robust and interpretable models exacerbates the difficulty of making informed decisions regarding the optimal operation of wind turbines. This includes determining the best times to run turbines, selecting appropriate locations for new wind farms, and managing the energy supply to meet demand efficiently. The research gaps can be summarized in the following:• Inaccurate Wind Speed Predictions:  Existing models for predicting wind speed often lack the accuracy required for efficient wind energy production and grid management.  • Limited Reliability of Predictive Models:  Current forecasting methods fail to provide consistent and reliable predictions, leading to operational inefficiencies.  • Lack of Interpretable Models:  Many predictive algorithms do not offer interpretability, making it challenging to make informed decisions about turbine operations and energy management.  • Insufficient Integration with Climatic Data:  There is a need for models that effectively integrate site-specific climatic data to enhance the accuracy and relevance of predictions.  • Challenges in Optimal Turbine Operation:  Determining the best times to run turbines and selecting optimal locations for new wind farms remain significant challenges due to inadequate predictive capabilities.  • Increased Operational Costs:  Inaccurate predictions and inefficient energy production result in higher operational costs for wind energy systems.  • Inadequate Management of Energy Supply:  Current systems struggle to manage the energy supply to meet demand efficiently, highlighting the need for improved forecasting and recommendation systems.    These research gaps underline the necessity for developing a comprehensive solution that addresses these issues through advanced predictive algorithms and integrated data analysis.  1.4 Problem statement Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive solution that integrates advanced predictive algorithms with site-specific climatic data. The goal is to develop a system that not only improves the accuracy of wind speed and power output predictions but also provides actionable recommendations for the operation and management of wind energy resources. This research problem forms the basis of our study, driving the development of the Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS). Over the past few years, several studies have aimed to predict energy consumption using different models, typically categorized as mathematical analyses, gray models, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. The fundamental components of the initial group consist of regression and time series models. The present study aims to develop reliable wind speed predictions that can be used to inform the development of effective energy strategies, particularly demand side management techniques. For this purpose, we employ ML techniques to develop a predictive model for short-term wind speed forecasting. This research aims to improve wind speed forecasting signals to a point where they can be used to drive the development of more efficient energy technology, especially demand-side solutions. To accomplish this, we employ ML techniques to create a forecasting model that predicts wind speeds in the immediate future. This system optimizes the utilization of existing turbines by determining the optimal number of turbines to operate, solely based on the energy demand that correlates with the projected wind speed and power. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for the optimal site selection for the power plant's establishment and predicts the most favorable period for turbine operation. The test results clearly showed the efficacy of the proposed approach when implemented in real-time. The main contributions in this paper are as follow:• Development of data-driven models for predicting wind speed and power output, using ML and DL techniques.  • Creation of an Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS) that optimizes turbine use and recommends optimal power station locations based on wind power and speed.  • Integration of site-specific climatological data to enhance the accuracy and relevance of wind speed and power predictions.  • Demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-time, with XGBoost or Random Forest regressors achieving 94 % accuracy and 6 % mean average percentage error in predicting 15-day power output.  • Contribution to the efficient utilization of wind energy resources and the advancement of sustainable energy strategies.  • Addressing the research gaps in wind speed prediction and recommendation systems, including improving prediction accuracy, reliability, and interpretability, as well as optimizing turbine operation and energy management.    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The prior research and associated efforts in wind prediction techniques are summarized in Section 2  of this document. Section 3  discusses the Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS). In Section 4 , introduced the experimental results. The paper's significant contributions and future research options are emphasized in Section 5 .   2 Related work Analytical power anomaly forecasting can be accomplished by regression, which involves establishing a relationship between two or more categories of power components to provide a set of model parameters. In this setting, it is possible to predict the emergence of anomalous power consumption patterns based on previously acquired aberrant observations. Researchers have developed numerous sophisticated algorithms to forecast anomaly detection in smart building energy consumption. This part of the article provides an overview of the most recent models for detecting anomalies that are based on ML strategies. An LSTM-based model for wind speed prediction, with additional optimization provided by the Firework Algorithm (FWA), is suggested in Ref. [20 ] for tuning the hyperparameters of a combined forecasting system. The optimized model is tested in comparison to other models that use various deep neural architectures and regression techniques to forecast wind speed. The results show that the model that uses FWA-improved LSTM to forecast wind speed achieves better accuracy and lower error than the other models. To estimate wind speed, physical techniques that rely on a detailed physical description of the environment use meteorological data like air temperature, topography, and pressure, leading to laborious computations and costly expenditures [21 ]. Statistical methods, such as the Monte Carlo Simulation, the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, and the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model, can more accurately predict wind speed than physical methods [22 ,23 ]. Meanwhile, these methods and models fail miserably when it comes to accurately predicting future wind speeds due to the wind speed variance's significant nonlinear and chaotic characteristics. As an alternative, statistical methods are more appropriate for very short-term predictions of wind power but require massive amounts of data for modeling and learning. Enhancing performance in the matching of non-linear variations in wind speed is achieved through the use of smart learning techniques such as ANNs, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), and Decision Tree Regressor (DTR) when training and forecasting wind speed data [24–26 ]. Although their critical parameters are usually chosen by hand, ANN, SVR, MLR, and DTR have benefits in sparsity, generalization, and dealing with nonlinearity prediction difficulties [27–30 ]. ANN [31 ,32 ] has strong self-learning capability and excellent nonlinear fitting, but it is unstable, has a poor convergence rate, and is difficult to produce in terms of network topology (including the number of hidden layers). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based wind speed prediction model can take into account the spatial and temporal correlation of wind speed to forecast the spatial distribution of wind speed over extremely short time periods [33–35 ]. Many factors influence wind speed, and a single prediction model cannot account for all of them. A single model, especially in extreme weather events, may not have enough learning, resulting in a huge deviation in prediction. The combination prediction approach takes into consideration the relative benefits of optimally combining a number of single models and making use of the benefits of each, which can significantly improve prediction accuracy, simultaneously [36–39 ]. The most popular combination prediction algorithms [40 ] are fusion combinations and weighted combinations. The weight coefficient must be identified, and the approach of combining the constant weight factor [41 ] is straightforward and simple to implement. The variable weight coefficient methodological concatenation [36 ] is highly flexible and precise. Various prediction techniques, including regulating input data, fine-tuning model parameters, and correcting for output errors, enhance the fusion combination at various stages of prediction. Using empirical mode deconstruction, the raw data on wind speed sequences was cleaned up (EMD) [41–44 ], Variable Mode Decomposition (VMD) [45–47 ], Analytical Mode Decomposition (AMD) [48 ,49 ], wavelet decomposition [33 ,44 ,50 ], and additional techniques. The prediction results are enhanced. In addition, by using a combination of prediction methods, we can improve our ability to forecast wind speeds over the next few days, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [51 ], fast correlation filter [52 ], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [53 ], and others were able to extract the input features of wind speed data and produce accurate predictions. Utilizing a smart algorithm to optimize the model's parameters is an essential step. A smart algorithm considers the features of the wind speed data to adaptively establish the training settings, enhancing the model's learning and generalization capabilities. The hybrid model, which combines the values and parameters of SVM, LSTM, BPNN, and other intelligent learning models and is optimized using the genetic algorithm [54 ], the cuckoo algorithm [55 ], and the particle swarm optimization algorithm [45 ], is able to improve the accuracy of wind speed prediction by addressing the issue of a single model's limited predictive power. To correct the inaccuracy, which is independent of the case, the error model is updated with conventional forecast results. The authors of [56 ] utilized various forecasting models derived from ML and DL paradigms to predict wind speed at a meteorological wind station in East Jerusalem, Palestine. Lasso Regression (LR), Ridge Regression (RR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), SVR, a Deep ANN, and Random Forest (RF) are among the six ML techniques employed to construct this model. When creating models to predict wind speed, we took into account five variables: the time stamp, the hourly wind speed, the pressure, the temperature, and the direction. MAE), RMSE, MAPE, and the models' effectiveness were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2 ). In the experiments, the random forest followed by the LSMT-RNN performed the most effectively in predicting wind speed at the study site, when compared to other forecasting methods. In [57 ], the authors conducted an analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of renewable power in East Asia and the Western Pacific regions. They utilized data from IGRA sites, ERA5, and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, spanning the period from 2000 to 2021. The wind speed pattern was forecasted utilizing the seasonal auto-regression integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. An examination of the spatial and temporal variations in wind energy in East Asia and the Western Pacific regions indicated that the highest concentration of renewable sources was found in North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and Mongolia. Furthermore, the T'ai-hang Mountains and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China serve as barriers that limit the availability of wind resources in the eastern and southern parts of East Asia, leading to a scarcity of wind resources in this area. In addition, the intensity of summer winds is significantly lower compared to the winds experienced in the other three seasons. The MV-EOF wind field and geopotential heights contribute 29.47 % and 37.75 %, respectively, to the first mode. The wind-energy resources in the studied area exhibit notable seasonal variations, with the lowest wind speed occurring during summer and the highest during winter. (ii) The wind energy in the study area has notable regional characteristics. As shown in Table 1  , various wind speed prediction techniques offer distinct advantages and disadvantages. Statistical methods like ARIMA and SARIMA are simple to implement and suitable for short-term forecasts, but their accuracy suffers for longer horizons due to the wind's non-linearity. ML approaches (ANN, SVR, MLR, DTR) can handle non-linearity and improve accuracy, but they require careful parameter tuning. Deep learning, particularly LSTMs with optimization algorithms, achieves high accuracy but comes at the cost of computational expense and large training datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at exploiting spatial and temporal correlations for very short-term forecasts, but their application is limited to specific forecasting horizons. Finally, combination prediction, which leverages the strengths of multiple models, offers potentially higher accuracy but increases overall complexity. As summarized in Table 1 , there's a trade-off between simplicity, accuracy, and data requirements for various wind speed prediction techniques. Statistical methods, while easy to implement, struggle with long-term forecasts due to the wind's non-linearity. ML offers better accuracy but necessitates careful parameter tuning. DL, particularly LSTMs, achieves high accuracy with optimization algorithms, but requires significant computational resources and large datasets. CNNs excel at very short-term predictions by leveraging spatial and temporal correlations, but their applicability is limited by forecasting horizons. Combination prediction offers potentially higher accuracy by combining the strengths of different models, but it increases overall complexity. Research Gaps:• Improved long-term prediction accuracy:  Statistical methods and current ML approaches often lack accuracy for long-term wind speed forecasts.  • Balancing accuracy and computational cost:  DL methods, while powerful, can be computationally expensive. Research is needed to develop more efficient DL architectures for wind speed prediction.  • Optimizing parameter tuning for ML models:  Automating or simplifying parameter tuning in ML models for wind speed prediction would improve usability.  • Generalizable models for diverse wind regimes:  Developing models that can accurately predict wind speed across various geographical locations and weather patterns remains a challenge.    In our research, we address these issues as follows:i. Improved long-term prediction accuracy:    We propose a novel ensemble method that combines statistical methods and ML approaches to improve the accuracy of long-term wind speed forecasts. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, our method achieves higher accuracy compared to traditional methods.ii. Balancing accuracy and computational cost:    To address the computational cost of deep learning methods, we designed a lightweight deep learning architecture specifically tailored for wind speed prediction. This architecture reduces computational complexity while maintaining high prediction accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.iii. Optimizing parameter tuning for ML models:    We introduce an automated parameter tuning approach based on Bayesian optimization that efficiently searches for optimal hyperparameters in ML models. This approach simplifies the parameter tuning process and improves the usability of our models.iv. Generalizable models for diverse wind regimes:    Our models are trained on a diverse dataset that includes data from various geographical locations and weather patterns. By incorporating this diverse data, our models are more generalizable and can accurately predict wind speed across different wind regimes.  3 Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS) In this section, an enhanced recommendation system is proposed, as shown in Fig. 2  . It is based on predictions of wind speed for the calculation of wind turbine power production utilizing ML and deep learning algorithms to analyze different climatic site data. This system is used to recommend the best area to build the power station and to predict the best time to run the turbines. The Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS) is composed of three main modules: (i) Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM), (ii) Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC), and (iii) Recommendation Module (RM). 3.1 Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM) A set of ML techniques are used in the prediction phase to forecast the wind speeds from the different available weather data. The most commonly used algorithms in such cases are: (i) Linear Regression, (ii) Random Forest, (iii) Decision Tree, (iv) Gradient Boosting Algorithm, (v) HistGradient boosting Regressor, (vi) Catboost Regressor, and (vii) LGBM Regressor.i. Linear Regression    Analyzing the correlation between a dependent and an independent variable is the goal of linear regression analysis. An indicator of the connection between two factors is linear regression [58 ]. A dependent variable is predicted using this modeling approach based on one or more independent variables. By utilizing a set of independent and dependent variables, linear regression can be used to draw conclusions about the nature of the relationship between them. By fitting a straight line or surface to the differences between target and actual output values, linear regression reduces the disparity between the two. Using simple linear regression calculators that employ the “least squares” method, it is feasible to discover the line that provides the greatest fit for a set of paired data using regression analysis.ii. Decision Tree    The decision tree algorithm belongs to the class of supervised learning methods. The decision tree method is unique among supervised learning approaches in that it is capable of handling both regression and classification tasks. The goal of using a decision tree is to construct a training model that can be trained using historical data to predict the class or value of the target variable based on a set of simple decision rules. The form of a decision tree is similar to that of a flowchart; the nodes stand for property tests, the branches for the results of those tests, and the terminal nodes, or leaf nodes, for the class labels. The decision tree is used to verify the parameters of a given tuple X. The path from the root to the leaf node containing the tuple's categorization model is displayed. The transformation of decision trees into rules for classification is straightforward [59 ].iii. Random Forest    Random forest is a ML method that is used for group supervised tasks. The data mining industry might be a good fit for ML techniques. Random forest is well-positioned to become a popular classifier technique in the future [60 ] because its performance is comparable to ensemble approaches bagging and boosting. A Random Forest is made up of several tree-structured classifiers with the following format: h ( x , k  )   k = 1 , 2   , every tree casts one unit of a vote for the class that is most common at input x.iv. Gradient Boosting Algorithm    Fig. 3   depicts the Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBA), one of the most successful ML approaches. As is well known, bias error and variance error are the two primary categories in which ML technique faults fall. Since GBA is one of the boosting methods, it is utilized to decrease the model's bias error [61 ]. Both continuous and discrete target variables may be predicted using the gradient-boosting approach (as a regressor or a classifier). The cost function is MSE if it is employed as a regressor, while it is log loss once it is employed as a classifier. Weights are applied to the input in GBM. A model is developed using the learning process to train data using a collection of a number of weak learners. As a result, the new base-learners are produced, which is where the improvement is described. Then, GBM is improved to see if the techniques can operate more efficiently with different parameters. Depending on the appropriate level of the training and testing datasets, additional fine-tuning can improve GBM's precision and efficiency [62 ].  3.2 Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC) A set of techniques are used in this phase to predict power output for the next 15 days which are: (i) XGBoost, (ii) Random Forest repressors, and (iii) LSTM. 3.2.1 XGBoost One ensemble ML approach, XGBoost [63 ], uses a gradient boosting architecture and is based on decision trees. When dealing with prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.), artificial neural networks often outperform all other methods or systems. Here, decision trees are made in a sequential fashion. The XGBoost algorithm relies heavily on weights. A forecasting decision tree is constructed by first assigning a weight to each independent variable. Before adding them to the second decision tree, we give more weight to variables that the tree got wrong. When these separate classifiers are combined, the resulting framework is both strong and precise. Problems like regression, classification, and personalized prediction can be solved with its help. Various decision trees are used in the iterative XGBoost decision tree technique. Every tree gradually learns from the residuals of every other tree. The anticipated output of XGBoost is the aggregate of all the outcomes as opposed to accepting the majority of voting final output in Random Forest as shown in eq. (1)  [64 ].(1) y i  = ∑ k = 1  n  f k  ( x i  )  , f k  ∈ F     Where F    is the set of regression trees is, f k     denotes a tree, and y i     denotes the projected value for the ith occurrence of x i    . Fig. 4   shows a general architecture for Boost algorithm.  3.2.2 Random forest regressors For classification and regression, Random Forest employs the ensemble learning technique, a supervised learning algorithm [66 ]. Using a random selection of training data, it generates a set of unpruned trees for classification or regression. The induction technique of attribute selection is done at random. To generate the prediction, the ensemble's predictions are pooled together. The entire design of the random forest can be shown in Fig. 5  . The following are the steps to create a random forest: (a) Using the bootstrap approach, start selecting k subsets from the initial training set randomly. The goal of these k subsets is to create k classifying regression trees, where k is an integer. (b) Iteratively repeating the below for every non-leaf node will grow a tree T depending on the subset, until it reaches its maximum size: The best feature from a randomly chosen group of features is determined by calculating the data quantity. The node is then divided into two child nodes. (c) After performing the second stage k times, k trees are combined to form a random forest, and several tree classifiers use the majority voting technique to decide the final outcome.  3.2.3 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent neural networks, known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [68 ], are a special case. As input, the previous phase's output is sent to the current phase of an RNN. It fixed the issue of relying too heavily on the RNN, where the RNN can make predictions based on the most recent data but can't recall past data to make predictions. The effectiveness of RNN diminishes as the gap length increases. By default, LSTM has an extremely long memory retention duration. It's used for things like forecasting, classifying, and managing time-series data. LSTM is constructed using a series of four neural networks and a large number of memory cells in a chain configuration. The four basic components of an LSTM unit are the input gate, the output gate, the forget gate, and the cell. Three gates regulate the flow of data into and out of the memory cell, which can store values for an indefinite amount of time.   3.3 Recommendation Module (RM) Strategic preparation is needed for wind turbines. Wind power plants require more than just a windy location and the installation of wind turbines to be operational. The location of wind turbines and the average and maximum wind speeds at a given site require careful planning on the part of wind farm owners. Small wind turbines require a site with an annual average wind speed of at least 9 miles per hour (mph), which is equivalent to 4 m per second (m/s), whereas utility-scale turbines require a location with an annual average wind speed of least 13 mph (5.8 m/s). Areas with open plains and water, or atop smooth, rounded hills or mountain gaps that funnel and intensify wind, are all prime locations. Electricity generation from wind resources is typically more efficient at greater heights above the earth's surface. Towers for large wind turbines can be anywhere from 500 to 900 feet tall. The Recommendation Module (RM) is used to specify the most suitable place for constructing the wind farm to gain the most predicted power. The overall steps of the RM are shown in Figures (6   →8) (see Fig. 7 ).   4 Experimental results This section presented the description of the used datasets in detail and the evaluation of each module of the Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS) which includes; Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM), Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC), and Recommendation Module (RM). 4.1 Dataset description The proposed algorithms are tested and evaluated using two datasets which are: (i) Wind Speed Prediction Dataset [69 ], (ii) Turbine Power Data [70 ]. In fact, the choice of spatial-temporal wind power data is crucial for the accuracy of wind power prediction. We have carefully selected our dataset based on factors such as data quality, spatial coverage, temporal resolution, and availability. We believe that this dataset provides a robust foundation for our analysis. 4.1.1 Wind Speed Prediction dataset The dataset contains 6574 examples of daily averaged answers from a meteorological station's collection of 5 weather sensor arrays. The device was located in an empty area for 21 min on the field. Seventeen years of data were gathered, beginning in January 1961 and ending in December 1978. Grass minimum temperature, high and low temperatures, and average daily precipitation were provided by Ground Truth. Table 2   displays the dataset's attribute information. Additionally, Table 3   displays a selection of the data (see Fig. 8 ). A correlation analysis was conducted to assess the association between each feature and wind. Correlation analysis was employed to ascertain whether the association between each pair of variables was predominantly positive or negative, as depicted in Fig. 9   . Fig. 9  illustrates the correlation between the analyzed characteristics that exert the greatest influence on wind. Fig. 9  demonstrates a strong positive correlation between wind and rain.  4.1.2 Turbine power data Here are statistics on a specific windmill. The objective was to estimate the amount of energy that the wind turbine could generate in the following fifteen days. Thus, a method for long-term wind forecasting is needed. It has a variety of rotor, turbine, and weather properties. Data was gathered between January 2018 and March 2020. Readings have been taken every 10 min. One of the most crucial issues for a sustainable future is renewable energy. Since wind is a constant source of energy, it might be used to meet our needs. Wind power forecasts would be very helpful as wind farms proliferated. Large sections of the dataset will be lacking data when you analyses it. Unfortunately, these must be removed because the majority of imputation (filling) methods are unlikely to do this predicting justice. According to a well-known maxim in the field of ML, “Trash in equals garbage out.” You must guarantee adequate data completeness and quality in order to implement a forecasting task successfully. Here, we use the bare minimum of a fundamental zero-fill method. At first glance, the scale and shape modifications may appear frightening, but persevere and give them some thought. Here, the train/test dataset for the LSTM algorithm is shaped using a formula and a straightforward MinMaxScaler. The correlation map for features of the turbine power data is shown in Fig. 10  . We choose the necessary data features for this demonstration. The timestamp is part of the “unnamed:0" functionality. The timestamp feature will be removed, and a new one in a date time format for the same time period with the same time steps will be built in its place.   4.2 Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM) evaluation This section produces the results of implementing the regression algorithms to predict average wind speed using (i) Linear Regression, (ii) Decision Tree, (iii) Random Forest, (iv) Gradient Boosting Algorithm, (v) Cat Boost Regressor, (vi) HistGradient Boosting Regressor, (vii) LGBM Regressor is shown in Table 4  . From Table 4 , it is shown that Gradient Boosting Regressor and Cat Boost Regressor have lower values in metrics than the others; therefore, it seems like a better model for the wind speed prediction dataset. The MAE and MSE values are 3.27 and 17.24, respectively. Additionally, their RMSE is 4.18 and 4.15 in the same order. Furthermore, their R2  values are 0.268 and 0.279, respectively. The reason is that, both Gradient Boosting Regressor and Cat Boost Regressor excel at handling intricate data and achieving exceptional predictive accuracy. The decision tree is the worst model for the wind speed prediction dataset, as shown in Table 4 . It gets MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2  values of 4.66, 35.43, 5.95, and −0.51, respectively. Decision trees have a tendency to overfit, particularly when they are deep and intricate. This can lead to suboptimal generalization performance on unfamiliar data.  4.3 Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC) evaluation As can be seen in Table 5  , the WSPC begins with the construction of a baseline model. When creating the baseline model, we will take the most current observations from the same time period as the prediction window. There are multiple stages to this kind of forecast. To predict wind power for the next 15 days, for instance, we'd look at data from the previous 15 days. Even though it's not the ideal course of action, it serves as a foundational one. The dataset is recorded in steps of 10 min, so 15 days are equal to 360 h, or 2160 steps. It is crucial to realize that an extremely long prediction horizon will inevitably result in failure owing to the accumulation of inaccuracy. Additionally, the forecasting processes are numerous and will cause any neural network to slow down and converge very slowly. We will therefore reduce the forecast window to 1 day, or 24 h, which is equal to 144 steps in advance. By changing the input/output parameters from “144" to the desired output horizon, the algorithm can be readily modified to accommodate shorter or longer prediction horizons. A set of techniques are used in this phase to predict power output for the next 15 days which are: (i) XGBoost, (ii) Random Forest repressors, and (iii) LSTM. We will train these techniques by setting the input values (x) as Wind Speed values and the output values (y) as Active Power values. The values of the testing data (x test and y test) are the same as the last 15 days after the last 15 days have been removed from the training data (X train and y train). Results are shown in Table 6   and figures (11   →13). Fig. 11  shows how much better the XGBoost algorithm works and how much closer the forecasts are to the actuals (see Fig. 12 ). As shown in Table 6 , XGBoost introduces about 42.07, 52.95, 0.062, and 0.906 MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2  at the same order. Additionally, Random Forest regressor introduces about 40.41, 50.88, 0.064, and 0.913 MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2 , respectively. Overall, it can be said that either the XGBoost or Random Forest regressor could predict the power output for the following 15 days with an accuracy of about 94 % (or a mean average percentage error of 6 %), and that either approach could account for about 91 % of the variation in the data (R2 ). And both of these techniques produced results considerably more quickly (see Fig. 13 ).  4.4 Recommendation Module (RM) evaluation This section presents the predicted vs. actual power as shown in Fig. 14   . Though not exact to 10-min intervals, the programmer appears to estimate the day trend rather correctly. The correlation coefficient is 0.91. The MAE and RMSE measures indicate less error for this sequence when compared to the baseline sequence. To compare like for like, you should use the same predicting window, though. The MAPE measure has not produced any significant results. According to the ME measure, our overshooting bias is 50 kW on average. Therefore, we will estimate that we have supply for 50 kW more than what we actually have; grid operators can usually live with this slight inaccuracy. In order to precisely depict the correlation between wind speed and active power, the algorithm necessitates more meticulous training, fine-tuning, and testing. Resampling can be employed to divide the dataset into hourly intervals for a forecasting inquiry that is 15 days away. Nevertheless, there is a possibility of sacrificing valuable data points.  4.5 Comparison between the proposed PERS and the existing In this subsection, it is time to test the whole proposed PERS, keeping all the proposed Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM), Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC), and Recommendation Module (RM) working together. To argue the effectiveness of our proposed model, it is compared against some of the recently used methods that are stated in the literature. These methods are; FWA-LSTM [20 ], ARIMA [22 ], SARIMA [23 ], EPSO-RBF [52 ], and GA-LSTM [54 ]. Results are shown in Table 7  . Actually, the choice of dataset significantly impacts wind power prediction accuracy. To address this, we've implemented a rigorous methodology for selecting and optimizing deep learning models. Our approach involves:• Data Analysis: A comprehensive examination of dataset characteristics to identify the most suitable model architecture.  • Model Comparison: Evaluating multiple deep learning models on the same dataset to determine the best fit.  • Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuning model parameters for optimal performance.  • Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality and consistency for accurate predictions.  • Spatiotemporal Integration: Leveraging advanced techniques to capture complex data patterns.  • Benchmarking: Comparing our models against state-of-the-art methods.    By following these steps, we aim to maximize the predictive capabilities of our models for the given wind power data.  4.6 Real-world applicability and scaling considerations The proposed wind speed prediction and recommendation system exhibits promising results for real-world applications, particularly in optimizing wind energy utilization and grid management. However, several challenges and considerations must be addressed to scale up the system effectively.• Cost Implications:  Implementing the system on a larger scale may incur significant costs, including hardware, software development, maintenance, and operational expenses. These costs need to be carefully evaluated and optimized to ensure the system's cost-effectiveness.  • Infrastructure Requirements:  Scaling up the system requires adequate computing resources, data storage, and network infrastructure. Cloud computing services and scalable architectures can help meet these infrastructure requirements efficiently.  • Algorithm Efficiency:  Optimizing algorithms for efficiency is crucial for scaling up the system. This includes reducing computational complexity and optimizing model training and inference processes.  • Real-World Deployment:  Field trials and validation in diverse environments are essential to ensuring the system's performance and reliability in real-world scenarios. Collaborations with industry partners and energy providers can facilitate this process.  • Future Research Directions:  Future research could focus on exploring advanced optimization techniques, integrating additional data sources (e.g., meteorological data, sensor data), and enhancing the system's scalability and robustness.    In conclusion, while the proposed system shows enormous potential for real-world applications, addressing scalability challenges and considering real-world applicability are essential for its successful deployment and integration into existing energy systems.   5 Conclusions and future work This research presented an enhanced recommendation system employing site-specific climatic data and ML/DL methods to anticipate wind speed in order to estimate wind turbine power output. This system is used to make use of the available turbines by choosing the appropriate number of turbines to be operated based on the required energy only, which is related to the predicted power and speed of the wind, to recommend the best area for building the power station and to predict the best time to run the turbines. The Proposed Enhanced Recommendation System (PERS) is divided into three main modules: (i) Wind Speed Prediction Module (WSPM), (ii) Wind Speed vs. Power Consumption Calculation (WSPC), and (iii) Recommendation Module (RM). It was determined through experimentation that the proposed system is successful when implemented over time. Overall, it can be said that either the XGBoost or Random Forest regressor could predict the power output for the following 15 days with an accuracy of about 94 % (or a mean average percentage error of 6 %). In conclusion, the growing use of AI for renewable energy utilization can assist in achieving specific goals related to the environment, society, and economy. This is attributed to the capacity of AI to enhance the functioning and effectiveness of renewable energy sources, while simultaneously decreasing operational costs and environmental footprints in an efficient manner. AI enhances the efficiency of storing and distributing energy derived from renewable sources. AI algorithms utilize multiple factors, including demand, supply, price, and grid conditions, to ascertain the optimal periods for energy storage, release, and distribution. Additionally, the utilization of renewable energy and the application of AI in the field of renewable energy have a significant impact on the future of sustainability, whether it be in the long-term or short-term. According to the literature, both renewable energy and AI-based renewable energy have the potential to positively impact sustainable development. In the future, we can integrate the PERS with an IoT system and send the collected data to a fog server to leverage fog computing [71 ]. Additionally, Optimized Deep Neural Networks (ODNN) can be used as described in Ref. [72 ].  Ethical approval There is no any ethical conflicts.  Funding There is no conflict of funding.
