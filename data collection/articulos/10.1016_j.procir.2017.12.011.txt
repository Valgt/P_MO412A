                  In recent years some cases have shown a decrease in emissions related to energy consumption (i.e. CO2/kWh) because of green energy transition and focus on energy efficiency that consequently means that emissions from building materials in a building life cycle perspective are becoming relatively larger. The focus on reducing emissions is creating a shift from a use phase perspective into a more holistic approach using a life cycle perspective.
                  The building industry needs transparency of its environmental impacts to make informed decisions. Nevertheless, many material and product manufacturers have not produced Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) or similar evaluations of the environmental life cycle impact. This study assesses how small and medium enterprise (SME) developers of building products can start their Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) journey by addressing the relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), defined by the United Nations, and which of the 169 targets material and product manufacturers have a direct or indirect impact on.

Introduction  In the early 1980s the World Commission on Environment  and Development was asked by the General Assembly of the  United Nations to make â€œa global agenda for changeâ€� [1]. In  1987 the report â€˜Our Common FutureÂ´, also known as the  Brundtland Report, was published and sustainability was  positioned centrally in the discussion on world development  [2].    Thirty years later the ecological footprint index (coupled  with the human development) shows that countries such as  Denmark overshoot the sustainable world ecological and  biological capacity by at least a factor of 3 [3]. The necessary  reduction in greenhouse gasses, increase in world population  projection and increase in global material use due to an increase  in middle-class population means that the technology needs to  be eight times as environmentally friendly as it is today [4]. A  global challenge that must be addressed and the construction  industry have a significant impact.   The construction industry share of extracted materials from  Earthâ€™s biological or mineral resources is known to be around  44% [5]. As an example, the construction industry is the largest  user of natural resources and produces massive amounts of  waste in the UK [6]. Through the past fifty years the energy  consumption in new buildings in Denmark has been reduced  from approximately 350 kWh/m2 to 40 kWh/m2 [7]. Together  with the more environmental friendly energy production for  heat and electricity the development, manufacturing, transport,  disposal and recycling of building materials account for an  Â© 2018 The Authors.

Secher et al. /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  54 â€“ 58  increasing share of the new building's overall resource and  environmental life cycle impact.    Two main methods of quantifying the environmental  impacts of construction products, Environmental Product  Declarations (EPD) and Product Environmental Footprint  (PEF), are described as Ramboll acknowledges these as some  of the main declarations on the market for construction  products. However, as they both can be expensive to procure,  especially for smaller businesses, this resource is intended to  help the construction industry start its journey towards  sustainable practice through inspiration from the relevant UN  Sustainable Development Goals and related.  The work conducted in this study is produced because it is  Rambollâ€™s view that construction material and will play an  increasingly central role to fulfil the global goals.  2. LCA in the Danish building industry  Ramboll experiences an increased interest in sustainability  assessments, for example of urban districts, buildings and  different building materials.  In years the focus in the building industry has been on  energy consumption but because of scarce material resource  and embedded energy, materials potentials of improvement  have become a focus area. In fig. 1 are kg CO2-eq pr. m2 pr.  year displayed for four selected Ramboll DGNB certified  buildings over a timeframe of 50 years. The figure shows a  higher impact from materials compared to heat consumption  from district heating. The emissions from district heating in the  Danish DGNB manual version 2014 is even with a static 50  year projection, which means that the actual emission from heat  in reality will be lower than seen in fig. 1.  Fig. 1. Global Warming Potential for four selected Ramboll DGNB  certified buildings where an LCA has been conducted showing their impact  on construction and heat requirement over 50 years.    In Denmark the projection towards 2050 shows an increased  share of renewable energy in the energy mix, and in particular  a fast change for district heating systems [8]. In addition, by  2020 over half of Danish electricity will be provided by wind  power alone [8], and throughout Europe there are currently  plans in motion to reduce the use of fossil fuels dramatically  [9].   In evaluating the emissions from energy production  projection towards 2050 against the target of a fossil-free  European energy mix by 2050, the embedded energy and  emissions in construction materials and products will have an  increasingly relatively larger environmental impact in the  construction industry. Thus, it is Rambolls view that  environmental impacts related to construction materials and  circularity will increase in the years to come.  3. Construction Product Declarations   Sustainability objectives differ for each company and  institution depending on how they impact society and the  environment. Whether private or public sector, the challenge is  to identify and integrate more holistically sustainable  approaches to achieving business goals and economic health.  Many companies face demands for documented  environmental performance from authorities and customers.  Other companies see commercial benefits in enhancing the  transparency of their respective products and providing more  sustainable products than their competitors.  3.1. Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)  EPDs are based on the European Standard EN 15804, and  most are all third party verified [10].  Ramboll continuously works with third party verified EPDs  in order to help our clients meet a wide array of business  objectives, primarily market differentiation and product  stewardship. EPDs are an internationally recognized  standardized framework to assess the environmental impacts of  materials, components or the full product life cycle assessment  (LCA). EPDs are standardized calculations with a third-party  review, which enhances the transparency of the information  made available this way.   It is Rambollâ€™s experience that EPDs are primarily used for  building classification systems such as DGNB, purchasing and  product selection and product development. EPDs are a  valuable tool as they serve to provide a verified overview of  environmental performance, and in the case of DGNB, it also  assists in gaining points in the building classification system.  3.2. Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)  Product Environmental Footprint is a multi-criteria measure  of a productâ€™s or serviceâ€™s environmental performance  throughout its entire life cycle. Upon conducting a PEF, the  information is produced with the goal of benchmarking as well  as identifying key areas of interest in the various production  stages, also including supply chain activities [11]. These areas  are then targeted in order to reduce their environmental  impacts.  Thus, a PEF also utilizes the holistic view that Ramboll  always applies when working with sustainability. It is  important to always assess the robustness of a given PEF model  with regard to completeness checks, sensitivity checks and  consistency checks. A model is never stronger than the quality  0.0E+00 1.0E+00 2.0E+00 3.0E+00 4.0E+00 5.0E+00 6.0E+00 7.0E+00 8.0E+00 9.0E+00 Building I Building II Building III Building IV kg  C O 2- eq  p r.  m 2  pr . y ea r  Global warming potential - 50 year life cycle period  Construction Heat requirement 56   Andreas Q. Secher et al. /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  54 â€“ 58  of data upon which it is built. When the robustness of the PEF  is assessed, the potential improvements such as cleaner  technologies, changes in product design, implementing an  environmental management system (EMAS, ISO14001) will  be recommended and the potential improvements quantified.  3.3. Comparison of product declarations  Both methods can be used to evaluate and quantify the  environmental performance of, for example but not limited to,  construction materials. However, a comparison between them  is not possible even though they share some of the same impact  categories such as CO2-eq and ozone depletion.   Even though they share the LCA approach, PEFs do  currently not have a European standard such as the EN15804,  and thus rely heavily on data that has otherwise been peer  reviewed and accepted. Some articles even raise a critique that  â€œPEFs are adding unrealistic requirements, burden and costs to  LCA application for business and SMEâ€™s without adding  valueâ€� [12].  The holistic LCE approach, supported by the relevant SDG  targets, removes the unnecessary burdens from the industry,  and enables their journey towards sustainable practise through  inspiration from the relevant Sustainable Development Goals.  4. SDGs for material and production manufacturers in the  construction industry  Construction material and product manufacturers have a  significant influence and impact on reaching a range of targets  within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In contrast  to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which range  from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of  HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education, the  SDGs address the responsibilities, and direct and indirect  impacts the developed countries have. The UNâ€™s SDGs will  complete the work begun with the MDGs. Supported by the  more business focused UN Global Compact, there is a growing  need to focus and measure sustainability on a global and local  scale using methods such as Life Cycle Assessments [13].  Fig. 2. UN Sustainable Development Goals      This chapter pinpoints what targets can be addressed as an  initial start on working towards reaching the goals and  sustainability demands the construction industry is facing.  4.1. Direct impact  The direct impact is, for the purpose of construction product  developers, defined in this article as â€˜resulting impacts from the  production and use of a given construction productâ€™. The  construction material and product manufacturers have a direct  influence, as identified by Ramboll, on 7 of the 17 SDGs as  seen in fig. 3.      Fig. 3. Sustainable Development Goals for construction material and  product manufacturers.    The SDGs where construction material and product  manufacturers have a direct impact have been assessed by  investigating all 169 targets. Notice that targets that is marked  with * is where EPDs and PEFs (and product life cycle  assessments) can measure performance.   Below are the relevant SDG targets that have been identified  to have a direct impact:    1. Target 3.9) By 2030, substantially reduce the number of  deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air,  water, and soil pollution and contamination  2. Target 6.3) By 2030, improve water quality by reducing  pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of  hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion  of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing  recycling and safe reuse globally  3. Target 6.4) By 2030, substantially increase water-use  efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable  withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water  scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people  suffering from water scarcity  4. *Target 7.3) By 2030, double the global rate of  improvement in energy efficiency  5. *Target 8.4) Improve progressively, through 2030, global  resource efficiency in consumption and production and  endeavour to decouple economic growth from  environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year  framework of programmes on sustainable consumption  and production, with developed countries taking the lead  6. *Target 9.4) By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit  industries to make them sustainable, with increased  resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and  environmentally sound technologies and industrial  57 Andreas Q. Secher et al. /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  54 â€“ 58  processes, with all countries taking action in accordance  with their respective capabilities  7. Target 11.6) By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita  environmental impact of cities, by paying special attention  to air quality and municipal and other waste management  8. *Target 12.2) By 2030, achieve the sustainable  management and efficient use of natural resources  9. Target 12.4) By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound  management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their  life cycle, in accordance with agreed international  frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air,  water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts  on human health and the environment  10. *Target 12.5) By 2030, substantially reduce waste  generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and  reuse  4.2. Indirect impact  The indirect impact is, for the purpose of construction  product developers, defined in this article as â€˜impacts following  effects of the construction product through its value chain or  impact not aimed at primarilyâ€™. Below the relevant SDG targets  that have an indirect impact are identified:    11. Target 3.4) By 2030, reduce by one third pre-mature  mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  through prevention and treatment, and promote mental  health and wellbeing.  12. Target 6.6) By 2020, protect and restore water-related  ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers,  aquifers and lakes  13. Target 12.6) Encourage companies, especially large and  transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices  and to integrate sustainability information into their  reporting cycle  14. Target 12.7) Promote public procurement practices that are  sustainable, in accordance with national policies and  priorities  15. Target 14.1) By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce  marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based  activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution  16. Target 15.1) By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration  and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater  ecosystems and their services, in particular forests,  wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations  under international agreements  17. Target 15.5) Take urgent and significant action to reduce  the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of  biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the  extinction of threatened species  18. Target 17.16) Enhance the global partnership for  sustainable development, complemented by multi- stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share  knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources,  to support the achievement of the sustainable development  goals in all countries, in particular developing countries  5. Discussion   5.1. SDGs and Product Declarations   The SDGs require a systemic approach and to provide  consumers with adequate information through, amongst others,  standards and labels and engaging in sustainable public  procurement [14]. The Environmental Product Declaration and  Product Environmental Footprint are labels or standards that  focus on supplying adequate information with a systemic  approach to emissions such as CO2 equivalents and ozone  depletion. These standards could be used to document the  construction material and product manufacturersâ€™ impact on the  SDGs and support their targets, as listed in table 1.  The  indicators from the SDGs are taken from the official revised list  of global SDG Indicators [15].   Table 1. EPD/PEF usefulness in connection to relevant SDG targets and  indicators for construction product developers.  Targets Indicators from SDG EPD/PEF  Target 7.3 Energy intensity measured in  terms of primary energy and GDP  Partly useful as  SDG indicator   Target 8.4  and   Target 12.2  8.4.1 Material footprint, material  footprint per capita, and material  footprint per GDP    8.4.2 Domestic material  consumption, domestic material  consumption per capita, and  domestic material consumption  per GDP  Partly useful as  SDG indicator  Target 9.4 CO2 emission per unit of value  added  Useful as SDG  indicator  Target 12.5 National recycling rate, tons of  material recycled  Useful as SDG  indicator    The Green Construction Board has identified seven tips that  can directly help the construction industry to reduce life cycle  emissions [16] which can be used as a beginning if EPD/PEF  are not currently affordable. The seven tips are: communicate  end of life options, consider take-back schemes, consider  offering your product as a service, minimise waste during  manufacture, optimise packaging, design for remanufacture  and optimise secondary materials.   Adding to the importance of transparency in the  construction industry and life cycle engineering we would like  to quote UN goal 12, why it matters; â€œItâ€™s in businessesâ€™  interest to find new solutions that enable sustainable  consumption and production patterns. A better understanding  of environmental and social impacts of products and services  is needed, both of product life cycles and how these are affected  by use within lifestyles. Identifying â€œhot spotsâ€� within the value  chain where interventions have the greatest potential to  improve the environmental and social impact of the system as  a whole is a crucial first step. Businesses can also use their  innovative power to design solutions that can both enable and  inspire individuals to lead more sustainable lifestyles, reducing  impacts and improving well-being.â€� [14]  By generating transparency of the environmental impact  such as through EPDs or PEFs value can be added to the  construction industry. However, as pointed out in the quote and  58   Andreas Q. Secher et al. /  Procedia CIRP  69 ( 2018 )  54 â€“ 58  through the other targets discussed in the previous section, a  better understanding of the social impacts and businessesâ€™  innovative power to design solutions that enable, amongst  others, sustainable life cycles, reduction in impacts and  improvements in well-being, is also necessary to address for  construction product developers.    5.2. The holistic approach of Life Cycle Engineering  It is Rambollâ€™s experience that construction product  developers want to look beyond product declarations and is  also investigating how products comply with sustainability  certification standards such as DGNB, LEED and BREEAM.  Beyond these certification standards Ramboll applies a holistic  LCE approach when assessing sustainability. It is also  Rambollâ€™s task to include life cycle cost, chemicals in the  context of the specific project and a focus on human well-being  and social impact.   Ramboll addresses components, products and services using  LCE through LCA and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) comparisons,  adjusted to the need of the client. The efforts are always  adjusted to the defined task and often the initial work kickstarts  a longer LCE journey where both complete LCAs and EPDs  ends up being requested by the clients. However, Ramboll is  often tasked with the job of having to identify the most  sustainable solutions to a given product or service. These  requests rarely have an extended time frame, thus a method for  quickly screening manufacturers and companies in general  have been implemented. Basically, relevant companies are  screened for publicly available information regarding  important topics:    x Emissions of volatile Organic compounds   x CO2 emissions pr. relevant unit  x Any environmental management system (if  implemented, which one?)  x Any relevant certifications (Cradle to Cradle etc.)  x Corporate Social Responsibility (If at all, how do they  work with it on a daily and yearly basis)    Ramboll gather information on these topics, to evaluate the  product so that companies overall environmental impacts  transparency becomes apparent, thus enabling our clients to  take informed decisions on which companies and products to  initiate corporation with.  A huge barrier for industries to adapt an LCA approach is  the often-excessive costs that can be associated with a full  product LCA. Through Rambollâ€™s LCE method it is ensured  that the benefits from a holistic view of a given product are  achieved at the pace and cost that is sustainable for the client.   6. Conclusion   Sustainability objectives differ for each company and  institution depending on how the businesses impact society and  the environment. Sustainable Development Goals and the  relevant targets provide an excellent point of departure for the  sustainability journey that all manufacturers can have the  opportunity to commence. LCE offers a sustainable holistic  view of not only a production phase, but the life cycle impacts  of a given product, design, or service. It is well known that a  full LCA on a product can be a financial burden, especially for  small businesses, and therefore acts as a prohibiting factor. This  resource has highlighted the most relevant targets within the  Sustainable Development Goals for small and medium building  product manufacturers and can be used to start the journey of  successfully working towards sustainability.

Sustainable Development Goals and the  relevant targets provide an excellent point of departure for the  sustainability journey that all manufacturers can have the  opportunity to commence. LCE offers a sustainable holistic  view of not only a production phase, but the life cycle impacts  of a given product, design, or service. It is well known that a  full LCA on a product can be a financial burden, especially for  small businesses, and therefore acts as a prohibiting factor. This  resource has highlighted the most relevant targets within the  Sustainable Development Goals for small and medium building  product manufacturers and can be used to start the journey of  successfully working towards sustainability.

In recent years some cases have shown a decrease in emissions related to energy consumption (i.e. CO2 /kWh) because of green energy transition and focus on energy efficiency that consequently means that emissions from building materials in a building life cycle perspective are becoming relatively larger. The focus on reducing emissions is creating a shift from a use phase perspective into a more holistic approach using a life cycle perspective. The building industry needs transparency of its environmental impacts to make informed decisions. Nevertheless, many material and product manufacturers have not produced Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) or similar evaluations of the environmental life cycle impact. This study assesses how small and medium enterprise (SME) developers of building products can start their Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) journey by addressing the relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), defined by the United Nations, and which of the 169 targets material and product manufacturers have a direct or indirect impact on. The study describes each relevant target and their relation to life cycle engineering.
