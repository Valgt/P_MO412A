                  Improved environmental management is key to several of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper focuses on the interaction between formalization of the Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) sector in Tanzania, and the regulation of negative environmental impacts. Key environmental impacts associated with ASM in Tanzania include: deforestation, use of mercury and cyanide in gold processing, dust and noise pollution, generalized water pollution, soil contamination, and failure to properly reclaim mining areas, and/or secure or fill-in mine shafts. Previous studies found that the Tanzanian regulatory framework was not well suited to the needs of the ASM sector, governance of ASM environmental issues was overly centralized, and environmental awareness amongst miners was low. Over the past five years, the Tanzanian government has reformed environmental regulations in the mining sector and has attempted to formalize ASM. It has also aligned some of its development targets to the SDGs. This paper describes current environmental regulations and policies, discusses actual and potential linkages to formalization initiatives, and assesses the capacities of different stakeholders to regulate and reduce environmental impacts, in the context of the SDGs.

Keywords State-led development  Formalization  Artisanal and small-scale mining  Environmental degradation  Tanzania  SDGs    1 Introduction Diverse organizations and governments around the world currently support ‘formalization’ of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). Formalization has different meanings, and may involve reforming systems and practices to increase accountability, improve health and safety, improve labour standards, reduce conflicts with large-scale mining (LSM) projects and communities, and reduce negative environmental impacts. The latter issue is particularly important in terms of the relevance of ASM to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As documented by Hilson and Maconachie (2019) , neither the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) nor the SDGs addressed the ASM sector in a substantial way. Hirons (2020)  warns that the SDGs may have negative impacts on ASM due to their likely perpetuation of a mining sector bias towards large-scale mining, and because a focus on measuring impacts rather than reforming systems of governance is likely to result in continuing marginalization of the sector. Nevertheless, there is some recent academic attention to the more positive potentials of support to ASM in meeting the SDGs. De Haan et al. (2020)  argue that ASM currently has mainly positive impacts on four of the SDGs (Goal 1: No Poverty; Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals); mainly negative impacts on five of the SDGs including the environmentally-focused SDGs mentioned below; and both positive and negative impacts on the remaining eight SDGs. Laing and Moonsammy (2021)  argue that ASM impacts are positive for Goal 1: No Poverty; Goal 4: Quality Education; Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities and Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, but that impacts are mixed or negative for the other SDGs. They point out that there are complex interactions between ASM contributions to different goals, including “co-benefits and conflicts” (ibid. p. 149). Buss et al. (2021)  point to gender considerations in the SDGs, noting that they go further than the MDGs in prioritizing increased inclusion of women in various decision-making processes, access to resources for women, recognition of women’s roles in unpaid but essential care work, for example. However, there are concerns that the SDGs may favour limited economic arguments around the inclusion of women in ASM without adequately accounting for various structural factors that limit their capacities to compete equally with men, and Buss et al. argue that women’s “financial autonomy” should be the focus of projects in the ASM sector that are aligned with the SDGs (p. 35). Hilson et al. (2020)  also address gender issues in ASM, emphasizing that contemporary development policy is heavily influenced by ideas of gender equality within the SDGs. The authors use data from Ghana to demonstrate the complexities involved in improving environmental and health outcomes in ASM, specifically in terms of mercury use in the informal gold sector. They argue that a bottom-up approach to understanding women’s labour in ASM is needed in order to understand the heterogeneity of the labour force and the gendered labour roles. Maconachie and Conteh (2021)  note that several reforms targeting the ASM sector in Sierra Leone were intended to help the country meet the SDGs, including environmental goals. Recognizing the (limited) success of these reforms, they identify local political economy issues (such as cronyism involving local customary leaders in diamond-producing areas and national-level politicians) as an obstacle. They contend that one of the key ways in which ASM might contribute to the SDGs is through its links to agriculture (e.g. mine sites providing markets for rural farm production, or mining revenue being invested in agricultural intensification); a theme which is explored further in Ofosu et al. (2020) . Niesenbaum (2020)  acknowledges that ASM could represent an important contribution to the SDGs as it provides livelihood opportunities for low-income households who have few other options; but he argues that currently, artisanal and small-scale gold production in Costa Rica does not contribute to any of the SDGs, due to environmental impacts, poor governance, health impacts, and limited economic benefits. Nevertheless, he contends that simply banning ASM would contradict most of the SDGs as it would close the door to potential benefits. He recommends a range of interventions to bring ASM into line with the SDGs including inclusive decision-making systems, technological improvements, and certification schemes. Most studies that have looked at environmental ASM issues and the SDGs have focused on specific institutional frameworks, such as Fairtrade schemes (Sturman et al., 2018 ) or the Minamata Convention (Hilson et al., 2020 ). Hirons (2020)  observes that environmental issues are “frequently invoked in anti-ASM discourses” and that projects which focus on quantifying environmental impacts “are potentially counter-productive if they serve to divert resources or attention away from core governance issues”. He argues that artisanal and small-scale miners themselves, as well as other non-state actors, should be involved in shaping governance in ways that can improve environmental outcomes (ibid.). Outside of the academic realm, it has been noted that ASM is of great relevance to all of the SDGs, including environmental ones (Weldegiorgis, 2016 ). Looking at the case of Ghana, Mensah et al. (2020)  have used a human security conceptual framework to examine a range of ASM issues of relevance to the SDGs including ‘health, security, environment and social life’ (p. 85). Here, we focus on environmental impacts of ASM, and potentials for reducing and mitigating those impacts in Tanzania, through formalization. Our position, as laid out in several other articles (e.g. Kinyondo and Huggins, 2019 , 2020 ; Huggins and Kinyondo, 2019), is that ASM is of great significance for the livelihoods of rural low-income households who may have few alternatives; that ASM also contributes to the national economy of countries like Tanzania; and that states, donor agencies, and other actors should facilitate miners to improve the sector (in terms of labour, social, health, economic, environmental, and other dimensions). Further, we argue that governance of the ASM sector should be reconfigured so that miners themselves take on significant decision-making power (for example, through ASM associations, grassroots organizations, and broad consultation). Therefore, while we argue that formalization can reduce environmental impacts from ASM, this is dependent upon how formalization is defined and who is involved in designing, implementing, and overseeing interventions in the ASM sector. The SDGs goals and targets of particular importance to the environmental impacts of ASM in Tanzania are shown below in Table 1  . Key environmental impacts associated with ASM in Tanzania include deforestation, mercury and cyanide emissions, dust and noise pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, and failure to properly reclaim mining areas (Macháček, 2019 ; Daley et al., 2018 ; United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2012 ; Kitula, 2006 ). Furthermore, certain mines operate in ‘protected’ areas, which are particularly environmentally sensitive (IPIS, 2019 ). The Tanzanian government has acknowledged the challenges of monitoring and regulating the mining sector (cited in Daley et al., 2018 ). These challenges are partly financial and logistical: it is expensive to systematically monitor and regulate the many ASM sites across the country, often in geographically remote areas. Additional challenges are posed by a regulatory framework that has historically been ambiguous. It is important to examine the current institutional and policy context, given a recent Tanzanian policy shift in favour of formalizing ASM, rather than criminalizing it (Huggins and Kinyondo, 2019 ; Kinyondo and Huggins, 2020 ). This article seeks to answer the following questions: does the current regulatory and institutional context in Tanzania enable environmental management of ASM sites? What opportunities exist to improve environmental management through formalization? How might such efforts align with the SDGs?  2 Methodology Due to the covid-19 pandemic, interviews with key informants in Tanzania were conducted by phone. A total of thirteen interviews were conducted. Of these, six participants belonged to government agencies in the mining sector; three respondents belonged to civil society organizations (CSOs); three were scholars; and one was a small-scale miner. Mining has been a point of acute political contention in Tanzania, and for this reason we have maintained the anonymity of all participants. In addition to phone interviews, a thorough literature survey was conducted in order to identify all regulations, policies, and programmes related to environmental management in the ASM sector; and recent experiences from other countries in improving environmental management in ASM. Content analysis was used to identify, summarize and synthesize environmental dimensions of the various documents identified.  3 Environmental impacts of ASM Environmental impacts of ASM have been exhaustively documented, but can be analyzed in different ways. For example, some phenomena represent environmental impacts and  public health risks for local communities and  occupational health and safety issues for mine-workers. The impacts may also be felt differently by different sections of society (e.g. men and women). Below, we describe the main environmental impacts associated with ASM. Although they are treated separately, they may have cumulative effects, and combinations of different impacts may have a severe overall effect on local environments. 3.1 Land-use changes Land-use change includes sub-categories such as land degradation, deforestation, and unreclaimed mining areas. There are also overlaps between land-use changes and other impacts, such as hydrological regimes. One African study found that, “although the land use change associated with mining is relatively small compared to logging or conversion for agriculture, its negative impacts are long lasting” (Festin et al., 2019, p. 381 ). The first sub-category of land-use change addressed here is land degradation. The nature and extent of land degradation depends on the type of ASM being conducted: alluvial mining, in and around river beds; surface mining which involves removing large amounts of topsoil; or deep rock mining which involves constructing underground mine shafts. Alluvial mining often involves the erosion of river channels, which can affect the course of the river. There are also major impacts on water quality from such activities, particularly due to sediment, which is disturbed and released into water. Surface mining involves removal of topsoil through use of excavators, manual digging or washing out material by applying water. In terms of area affected, and total volume of waste material, surface mining usually has the greatest impacts (Festin et al., 2019 ). The waste material can be separated into overburden and waste rock, which are not inherently harmful, and processed tailings material, which is more environmentally problematic due to potential leaching of chemicals. Large-scale alteration of the landscape can result in subsidence, risk of landslides, and other dangers. In Tanzania, land degradation has been noted in ASM areas in the Northwest (IPIS, 2019 ), as well as at tanzanite mines in Merelani in Simanjiro District (Malisa and Kinabo, 2005 ), and many other areas. The second sub-category of land degradation is deforestation. Mine sites are usually cleared of trees and vegetation prior to excavation. Access roads and other infrastructure may also involve the felling of trees. Mineshafts are often constructed using locally-cut logs. In larger mine sites, buildings may be constructed using timber, and charcoal may be used for cooking. There may also be indirect effects of mining on forest areas. For example, mine sites and associated infrastructure may provide opportunities for commercial logging, charcoal production, and other activities to expand. In biodiverse primary forest areas in Colombia, the Congo Basin, and West Africa, ASGM has been identified as a key driver of deforestation (United States Agency for International Development (USAID, 2020 ). In Tanzania, ASM areas in Geita District and Shinyanga are impacted, for example (IPIS, 2019 ; Kitula, 2006 ). Mining takes place in some forest reserves such as Biharamulo in Geita and Makere in Kigoma Region (IPIS, 2019 ). The third sub-category of land degradation is improper closure and reclamation of mine sites. Mining may render land unsuitable for activities such as farming (Ofosu et al., 2020 ). The process of reclaiming or restoring mining sites1  1 the two terms are often used interchangeably   has become standard practice in large-scale mining in many parts of the world, but not yet for ASM. Reclamation may involve physically stabilizing the area and returning layers of topsoil; using chemicals to reduce soil toxicity; or phytoremediation, using plants and microorganisms, compost or biochar. Recolonization of the site by trees and plants can be passive or active (facilitated). Mine pits are filled to recreate the pre-existing landscape. Reclamation is less common in Africa than in other parts of the Global South (Festin et al., 2019 ). Cases of reclamation in Kenya, South Africa and Ghana took place on industrial (large-scale) mine sites. Some reclamation has been attempted on ASM sites in Rwanda and Ghana (Bansah et al., 2016 ; Cao Diogo et al., 2017 ).  3.2 Water use and water pollution Water-related impacts are very common (Lynas et al., 2018 ) including those affecting water availability (quantitative) and those changing water quality (qualitative) (Barasa et al., 2016 ). A major sub-category of hydrological impacts is the physical alteration of hydrological regimes. Extensive mining activities may have impacts at landscape level. As ASM is typically conducted without prior geological or hydrological surveys, these changes to the hydrological regime may be unpredictable. Another possible impact is reduction of quantity of water available for ecosystem functions. Water is often diverted from surface water or underground sources using diesel and petrol pumps, which may impact local biodiversity, especially fish and other aquatic species. Women and children may be particularly impacted in terms of access to potable water. A third sub-category is reduction in water quality. Water may interact with disturbed mineralized material, absorbing heavy metals and changing pH levels, before flowing into other water sources (Doreleku et al., 2018, p. 125). The sheer presence of large numbers of miners may also effect local water sources: sanitation is often a challenge. A final major sub-category of water-related impacts is chemical pollution. For example, artisanal and small-scale gold miners use mercury to process gold. Small amounts of mercury-contaminated water may escape or may leach out of discarded tailings (Speigel, 2009). Mercury then, “increases in concentration, or is biomagnified, up the aquatic food chain and can result in deleterious effects on biota and ecosystem functions” (Tschakert and Singha, 2007 , p. 1309). While retorts, hoods and other technologies exist to make the process safer, uptake has been limited (Hilson et al., 2018 ). In several countries, including Tanzania, some ASM operations are shifting from mercury amalgamation to vat leaching systems, which utilize cyanide to process material which has already been treated using mercury (Schoneveld et al., 2018 , p. 31). This is more efficient, but waste from vat leaching processes must be disposed of properly. Cyanide poses a potential health and environmental risk, particularly when combined with mercury (Nyanza et al., 2017 ). Other chemicals are introduced into the environment indirectly, when mineralized materials are concentrated, processed, then discarded as tailings (Njinga and Tshivhase, 2019 ; Sullivan et al., 2005 ). Additionally, pollution of water with fuel from motorized pumps is possible.  3.3 Air pollution Overall, air pollution associated with ASM is less serious than that caused by large-scale mining, as heavy machinery is rarely used. Nevertheless, some environmental impacts are possible. The first impact is production of dust, which can be reduced if some vegetation is left in the vicinity (LUC et al., 2013 ). Dust contained and concentrated within mining pits and shafts is particularly damaging to the health of miners, who often lack access to personal protective equipment (PPE). Silicosis, a lung disease, is prevalent in hard rock mining involving explosives (Ralph et al., 2018 ). The second major form of air pollution is localized particulate air pollution associated with the frequent use of diesel or petrol engines. This might occur in larger ASM sites. These are unlikely to have major environmental impacts, but miners may be vulnerable to health impacts from such fumes, particularly as fumes are heavier than the surrounding air and can sink into mine pits and shafts. The resulting concentration of carbon monoxide and other chemicals can be fatal.   4 The SDGs and development in Tanzania Tanzania has publically supported the SDGs, and broadly aligned its National Five-Year Development Plan II for the Mainland and the Zanzibar Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty III with the SDGs (United Republic of Tanzania (URT, 2019 ). Government involvement in UN consultations prior to the announcement of the SDGs provided a sense of national ownership of the SDGs, and the government held a nationwide consultation process on the post-2015 agenda, which included a wide range of stakeholders (Jönsson and Bexell, 2021 ). In 2014, further consultations were held on how the post-2015 development agenda could be localized within the Tanzanian context (ibid.). UN agencies and CSOs have promoted the SDGs in Tanzania through various awareness-raising and training activities (ibid.). However, a recent report indicated that Tanzania’s preparations for implementation of the SDGs remained insufficient, particularly in terms of capacity to monitor, coordinate and finance implementation (Risse, 2019 ). This trend – inadequate monitoring and reporting capacity – is common globally in terms of SDG implementation (Jönsson and Bexell, 2021 ). Moreover, awareness-raising has mostly targeted an urban elite, reflected in the lack of coverage of the SDGs in the Kiswahili media, compared to English-language newpapers (Jönsson and Bexell, 2021 ). While President Magufuli is a member of the high-level group on the 2030 Agenda (a position he inherited from his predecessor, President Kikwete), his involvement in the group has been ‘passive’ to date (ibid.) The government produced a Voluntary National Review document in 2019 (United Republic of Tanzania (URT, 2019 ) which mentions mining only seven times, and exclusively in terms of the economy. For example, it reports that mining and quarrying represents 4.4 percent of total GDP (United Republic of Tanzania (URT, 2019 , p. 47) and 5.3 percent of total GDP growth (p. 67). These brief references to the mining sector do not specifically mention ASM. The framing of mining as an economic issue reflects a broader tendency of the Government of Tanzania to prioritize financial issues in the ASM sector (payment of royalties and taxes, capitalization, etc.) (Huggins and Kinyondo, 2019 ; Kinyondo and Huggins, 2019 , 2020 ). The UN is providing funding towards all the 17 SDGs in Tanzania. SDG 2 (zero hunger) is the highest-funded. SDG 3 (good health and well-being) receives the second largest amount of UN funding. The main environmental goals – e.g. life on land – receive less funding (UN Tanzania, 2020 ). In general, “environmental efforts in Tanzania depend heavily on donor funding” (Kilama et al., 2016 , p. 9). Researchers have noted that major policies such as the Tanzanian National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty tend to ignore environmental factors (Kilama et al., 2016 , p. 5), and that “the environment is one of the [SDG] targets that face particular problems in relating to data availability” (Kilama et al., 2016 , p. 5). In the recent past, the state as well as donors have deployed environmental or ‘green’ discourse in Tanzania within a context of commercial agricultural development, which has emphasized creation of economic growth and arguably de-prioritized environmental sustainability (Buseth, 2017 , p. 46).  5 Environmental regulations and policies in the ASM sector in Tanzania Mining regulations and policies have addressed environmental impacts since the 1980s. However, until relatively recently, the focus of regulations was on large-scale mining. Over the past decade, states have placed increased emphasis on regulating and formalizing ASM. The National Environmental Policy, 1997, includes a section on mining (both ASM and LSM). It emphasizes mercury use as a problem. It also requires reclamation and restoration of land; controlled discharge of waste or air pollution, clean-up of accidents, and regular environmental audits (United Republic of Tanzania (URT, 1997 , p. 17). Several projects were implemented by the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals, with donor funding, to encourage use of retorts and to improve mercury handling (Hilson et al., 2018 ). However, none of the other policy goals were followed with more specific policies and actions. The Mining (Environmental Protection and Conservation) Regulations, 1999 were the first mining laws to expressly address environmental issues in ASM. They seek to prevent water contamination, forbid removal of vegetation from riverbanks; ban use of mercury without retorts; ban use of cyanide leaching without written permission, and require PPE for use of such toxic chemicals; require proper disposal of tailings; and require backfilling or fencing of abandoned mines. Once again, few of these were enforced. The 2017 Amendments to the 2010 Mining Act strengthen environmental dimensions of Tanzania’s legal framework. It stipulates that the Environmental Management Act (2004) applies to the mining sector. It requires Mineral Rights Holders to prepare annual reports which include environmental issues, particularly those prioritized by local authorities. The amendments also focus on transport, treatment, storage and disposal of waste; and establish the ‘polluter pays’ principle, making mining operators responsible for costs of environmental remediation. The 2017 Amendments also make the Mining Commission responsible for monitoring and auditing environmental management plans and activities. Regional Mining Offices (RMOs) are mandated to conduct regular inspections of mine sites, and include environmental issues in their responsibilities (IPIS, 2019 ). Other agencies with environmental responsibilities include the Occupational Health and Safety Agency (OSHA). Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are key to environmental management approaches. The first EIA in Tanzania was conducted in 1980, but EIAs were required for the mining sector only in 2005 (LUC et al., 2013 ). Between 2005 and 2009, about 20 EIAs were conducted in the mining sector (LUC et al., 2013 ). It is unlikely that they were conducted at ASM sites. Under the 2004 Environmental Management Act (United Republic of Tanzania (URT, 2004 ), holders of a Primary Mining License (PML) had to register with NEMC, which was responsible for determining whether a full EIA would be needed. It is not clear how many PMLs actually registered with NEMC. The 2010 Mining Act then contradicted the 2004 Environmental Act. It requires that an environmental and social impact assessment is conducted before mining starts, and that an environmental protection plan (EPP) be submitted (Ministry of Energy and Minerals, 2010 ). The Mining Act required PML holders to report on environmental impacts to the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, though there is limited information on how many PML holders complied. This contradiction was resolved in the 2017 Amendment to the Mining Act, which gives precedence to the National Environmental Act, and hence gives overall responsibility to NEMC. One study of EIAs in Tanzania (Sosovele, 2011 ) found that knowledge of the regulations amongst government officials was low, and that NEMC was unable to play an effective enforcement role, because of its reliance on government funding and general lack of independence from the Tanzanian state.  6 Dissemination, implementation and enforcement of environmental regulations The Tanzanian government faces challenges in implementing and enforcing ASM environmental policies, due to insufficient funding, poor coordination between state agencies, and the informal nature of ASM, which often takes place in remote rural areas. Tanzania is one of the most significant African countries in terms of volumes of mercury emissions. In 1994, World Bank launched a major technical assistance project, which included on-site training for artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) workers on mercury use, and distribution of mercury retorts (Hilson et al., 2018 ). However, the regulatory environment was a barrier to formalization, which discouraged ASM involvement in such programmes (ibid). Other approaches have included training involving regional ASGM associations and zonal mining officers (UNEP Global Mercury Partnership, 2010 ) and construction of protected amalgamation ponds (IPIS, 2019 ). In 2013 Tanzania became a signatory to the Minamata Convention, an international agreement to reduce global emissions of mercury. A number of centres for training in improved ASM technologies were established in 2019, and it was originally intended that they would include training on mercury reduction and safe use. However, it is not yet clear from any official or media reports whether this is in fact the case; reports focus only on tax revenues accruing from the centres (Materu, 2019 ). Unsafe mercury use is still widely practiced at ASGM sites across Tanzania. Institutionalization of the Minamata Convention in Tanzania reflects the inter-agency coordination difficulties mentioned above: efforts are led by the Ministry responsible for the Environment, rather than by the Ministry of Minerals (formerly Ministry of Energy and Minerals) or Mining Commission. Cyanide is also an environmental problem. Tanzania signed up to the international Cyanide Code in 2006, and state mining officers are obliged to provide guidance to all registered ASM gold operations on how to follow the Code. However, awareness remains low, especially at unregistered gold mining sites (Nyanza et al., 2017 ). An older study found that the regulatory framework was not well suited to the needs or capabilities of the ASM sector, governance of environmental issues was overly centralized, and awareness amongst miners of their environmental responsibilities was low (Mwakaje, 2012 ). There are more than 30,000 approved PMLs in Tanzania, but fewer than 10 % are estimated to be operational at any time (Schoneveld et al., 2018 , p. 47). This makes systematic monitoring of environmental impacts challenging. NEMC has insufficient capacity to effectively monitor the ASM sector. For example, a recent study found that NEMC only employed four technical staff in the Northern Zone, who were responsible for all sectors (not just mining) across three regions (Schoneveld et al., 2018 , p. 48). While an EPP may be submitted by some miners, “in practice, the EPP is merely a formality and poorly scrutinised, and in some zones also poorly enforced.” (Schoneveld et al., 2018 , p. 49). NEMC plans to increase the number of certified environmental inspectors. At the same time, there are indications that the government intends to issue provisional environmental certificates, which will allow projects to commence even while an EIA is being conducted. This suggests a willingness to sacrifice rigour in the process for economic growth (Schoneveld et al., 2018 , p. 71). In general then, “reports from SGM [small-scale gold mining] mining areas in Tanzania suggest a lack of enforcement of environmental safety regulations, as well as occupational health and safety regulations” (Nyanza et al., 2017 , p. 6). Coordination between different state agencies has been an issue. There is also “unresolved tension” between the Ministry of Minerals and NEMC over responsibilities for environmental regulations (Schoneveld et al., 2018 , p. 49). In some cases, the Ministry apparently ignores NEMC regarding environmental matters in ASM (Schoneveld et al., 2018 ).  7 Formalization of ASM in Tanzania Formalization of ASM can refer to various different processes, including clarifying or allocating rights to land and minerals; legalization (through reforming laws and/or ensuring compliance with laws); technical and technological improvements; improved organizational governance; and capitalization and scaling up of operations. Efforts to formalize ASM in Tanzania have taken place for many years, but have gained renewed impetus recently. One of the main instruments of formalization is the PML: from 2000 to 2019, approximately 29,000 PMLs were issued (Reid et al., 2019 ). The World Bank-funded Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP), operational between the late 2000s and 2019, included several formalization aspects including demarcation of mineralized areas reserved for ASM, capacity building activities, a small grants programme, support to value addition (e.g. gem cutting and polishing), and construction of demonstration and training centres (known as Centres of Excellence, COEs). In 2014, the responsibilities of the State Mining Corporation (STAMICO) were extended to include coordinating formalization of ASM. Specifically for the tanzanite sector, formalization has involved requiring mining companies to issue a contract to every miner, pay salaries (rather than operating through production sharing agreements where miners are given a proportion of the gems found), and a crackdown on smuggling (Kinyondo and Huggins, 2019 ). To encourage ASM operators to formalize and pay fees, the government consulted with regional ASM associations in 2019, and established a royalty and fees regime specifically for ASM. The Government has also established trading centres across the country, to encourage miners and dealers to sell minerals, gems or metals officially. The strengths and weaknesses of such approaches have been debated (see e.g. Huggins and Kinyondo, 2019 ; Kinyondo and Huggins, 2019 , 2020 ; Pedersen et al., 2019 ; Reid et al., 2019 ). This article does not discuss all pros and cons, but rather describes the ways in which formalization efforts might address (or fail to address) environmental impacts of ASM. One critique of formalization approaches in Tanzania is that they have focused on PLM holders, rather than the artisanal mine workers (Merket, 2018 ). Some formalization projects assume that PML holders and other ASM miners are entrepreneurs, keen to scale up and formalize (Kinyondo and Huggins, 2020 ). This ‘scaling up’ assumption leads to a reliance on technology adoption: the idea that ASM operators, if they have access to capital, will adopt technologies that are more efficient (e.g. for processing), which are more environmentally friendly. However, some miners may prefer to remain smaller-scale, and less formal, using cheaper equipment, to avoid paying fees, royalties and taxes. More generally, the organizational structures of ASM are quite complicated. The priorities of ASM workers are likely to be different from those of PML holders. Improved environmental management is likely to occur under a combination of conditions, including training and awareness-raising, monitoring and enforcement, and financial incentives. There are some existing links between formalization approaches and environmental protection. For example, one criteria for an application for credit under the SMMRP (World Bank) loans scheme was an environmental management plan. In addition, COEs have vat leaching gold processing systems, which result in lower emissions of toxic chemicals than mercury amalgamation. There are hopes that miners will not only use processing systems at COEs, but may also purchase vat leaching systems for themselves. However, in general, formalization approaches have emphasized state revenue collection and paid less attention to environmental aspects.  8 Perspectives of research participants Respondents were unanimous that gold is prioritised when it comes to environmental monitoring. This is mostly because unlike gemstones, gold production involves chemical processing. Moreover, gold comprises the single largest ASM subsector in the country. According to research participants, the key agencies with environmental responsibilities are NEMC, OSHA, the Mining Commission, RMOs, District and Village Councils. However, OSHA, NEMC and the Ministry of Minerals are, in practice, the most active agencies in the sector. All these agencies have limited capacity (human, financial and technological) to undertake their mandate. Participants report that the legal framework is relatively clear. PML holders are required to submit an EPP prior to commencement of mining. However, the existing legal framework generally addresses LSM. As an academic participant argued, “this generally makes it harder to follow-up and address the critical environmental issues prevalent in the ASM sector”. It is not surprising then that most respondents had reservations on whether the legal framework for environmental protection in ASM is sufficiently clear. Furthermore, 75 % of respondents stated that dissemination of the legal framework is inadequate. The few who think dissemination is adequate reported that laws are available at the ministry or online (which does not mean they are available to artisanal miners); or that miners will have read them while applying for a license (because they have to adhere to environmental regulations before being given licenses). However, this applies to holders of a PML, not the artisanal mining workforce. Moreover, completing forms does not mean they have access to relevant information. There are isolated efforts to further disseminate information especially during training of ASM operators. Even then, such efforts, as one academic respondent put it, “cannot be said to have been consistent, neither can they be said to constitute an effective dissemination of a legal framework to all stakeholders”. Institutional responsibility for environmental protection in the ASM subsector seems vague. While NEMC assumes the overall mandate for environment management, STAMICO seems to do the same within the ASM subsector. Moreover, OSHA plays a role in ensuring that miners are safe. The Mining Commission too is involved, while local authorities play the ‘watch dog role’ trying to protect communities from potential and/or actual adverse impacts. Coordination is therefore important, but respondents almost unanimously described coordination as weak. Agencies work in silos, with little information shared across related institutions, and at times duplicate activities. The ASM respondent pointed out that government agencies visit them separately, in an uncoordinated manner. There is little coordination between central government and local government authorities when it comes to EPPs. The few instances when central government agencies link up with local authorities normally occur during crises, when they need local authorities to address conflicts. The ASM operator stated that, “I have not witnessed any coordination on the ground though the law stipulates it”. There are also questions of conflicts of interest. STAMICO has the mandate to ensure environmental protection in the subsector through, among other means, training ASM workers. However, miners see STAMICO as a competitor, as it is also engaged in commercial mining activities. Moreover, the Mining Commission, while having a responsibility to enforce environmental regulations, also issues mining licenses. Checks and balances seem to be compromised through this combination of roles. Half of the government participants believe that there are inter-agency tensions. Meanwhile, an academic suggested that the ministry could be ‘politicising’ ASM, by allowing ASM to take place without environmental protection and mitigation, for the sake of gaining votes from miners and their dependents. This is at the expense of letting STAMICO execute its mandate. Participants mentioned that once EPPs are filed, very little follow-up on environmental impacts is conducted. EIA is considered to be mostly for LSM while the ASM operators develop an EPP. However, some confusion remains regarding how EIA and EPP differ, and whether ASM must undergo only the EPP, or both. The majority of the respondents suggested that PML holders (not ASM workers) are solely responsible for maintaining environmental standards. However, the Environmental Management Act, 2004 stipulates that any person involved in mining operations is responsible for maintaining environmental standards. The ASM respondent pointed out that mining site managers are held responsible for environmental standards in their mines. Most respondents reported that the transparency is adequate. Applications can be done using an online tool or through NEMC’s regional offices. However, a few respondents had reservations about the process. An academic argued that corruption can become an issue when, for example, preparation of EIAs and EPPs are conditions for providing grants or other assistance. The ASM respondent also claimed that EIA and EPP are used as an excuse to exhort bribes, especially by local government authorities who threaten to shut down miners’ operations. Environmental monitoring requires capacities in research, and equipment. Most respondents identified financial constraints at different levels of government that curtail effective environmental protection in ASM. As one academic put it, “funds budgeted for environmental protection, could easily be diverted to other ‘pressing’ matters”. In terms of ASM capacities, the majority of respondents agree that ASM operators organized into cooperatives or associations have greater capacity to manage environmental issues than those that remain completely informal. Most participants also reported that regional ASM associations do exert pressure on ASM operators to improve their environmental management practices. However, respondents said that this pressure has been too soft. The majority of respondents, including those in government, do not think mining areas with lots of government intervention are effectively regulated regarding environmental impacts. According to one academic, if anything, the evidence points to human right abuses at ASM sites where there are major government interventions. There is almost a unanimous view among respondents that the attention paid to ASM by the government is mostly driven by its desire to maximize fiscal benefits rather than improve ASM. As one NGO respondent told us, “I gravely doubt whether formalisation has anything to do with improvement of ASMs… formalisation easily makes government control of ASMs possible”. Another respondent, working for the government, confirmed that while there have recently been more discussions around environmental management, the state’s priority is to get ASM operators to pay taxes. An NGO participant supported this view, arguing that government’s focus is on improving marketing of minerals rather than tackling issues such as environmental challenges. Most respondents, including government officials, see no evidence to show that revenues generated from initiatives such as mineral trading hubs are pumped back into the ASM subsector to facilitate environmental monitoring and regulation. Revenues go to the central basket of funds and hence are used for the government’s priority activities. There may thus be a need to ring-fence part of the revenues for improving environmental standards. Nevertheless, while the general perception is that initiatives such as trading centres are meant to maximise revenue collection by the government, the majority of the respondents thought that COEs and demonstration centres could help improve environmental standards, e.g. through training on various environmental issues.  Conclusion and recommendations This article set out to answer three questions: does the current regulatory and institutional context in Tanzania enable environmental management of ASM sites? What opportunities exist to improve environmental management through formalization? How might such efforts align with the SDGs? The regulatory and institutional context provide opportunities for improved environmental management, but there are major obstacles, including poor interagency coordination, and insufficient capacity. Moreover, emphasis by central government agencies on state revenue collection and macro-economic development overshadows other considerations including environmental protection. There is not an automatic connection between formalization of ASM, and improvement of environmental protection. For formalization activities to have positive environmental impacts, they must be designed to do so. Nevertheless, there is a broadly pro-ASM agenda at the highest levels of government, which provides opportunities to build environmental activities into formalization programmes. The following recommendations reflect the views of research participants. First, respondents advised that the government should formulate regulations specific to ASM. Such regulations must be backed by means to enforce them. Regulations should also state clearly whether only EPPs, rather than EPPs and EIAs, are required in ASM. Such regulations would be updated regularly to stay relevant. It is also important to include ASM sites in land use planning processes, from village level, up to national level, hence making the location of mine sites known to a large number of stakeholders. Laws and regulations should be decentralized so that RMO and local government authorities have powers to oversee the ASM subsector rather than only the central government. Funds generated by ASM must be ring-fenced against reallocation to other uses. The government should consider bringing back subsidies to the ASM subsector. Moreover, the government should ensure that ASM operators have access to credit to improve their technical capacity. ASM operators could be incentivized to promote environmental protection various measures including making credit provision conditional on effective environmental protection, or lowering taxes and fees to ASM operators who protect the environment. There is a need to more clearly define roles for each institution involved in ASM governance. There is also a need to create specific departments for ASM issues within NEMC and other relevant agencies. ASM departments should be established in district councils where ASM activities take place for coordination between central and local governments. While this will undoubtedly have significant financial implications, ASM is a key economic sector that deserves adequate attention and service. Moreover, capacity of ASM associations could be strengthened, so they can do more to promote, monitor and enforce environmentally sustainable practices. While recent government rhetoric is pro-ASM, it has framed ASM largely as an economic issue. Environmental protection, and by extension the sustainability of mining, must be a permanent agenda for politicians, without showing restraint in enforcement for political gains. However, better environmental outcomes are unlikely to result only from more regulation and enforcement, but rather from improvements to the overall governance environment for ASM. ASM should not be criminalized; rather messaging must be geared towards motivating ASM operators to rethink their approaches. In the end, the ASM subsector can only be built based on decisions made by all stakeholders. So far the subsector has been accorded ad hoc  consultations. Broader consultation and engagement should be pursued, as laid out in SDG Goal 17: Partnerships. While the government’s emphasis on economic factors is problematic, the recommendations suggest strong interlinkages between environmental and public health SDGs (see Table 1 ) and financial considerations. It is probable that access to credit and financial incentives for improved environmental management could have positive impacts. There are therefore interlinkages between the environmental SDGs and the more economic-development related goals. The government of Tanzania is committed to the implementation of the SDGs, but much more could be done to promote, coordinate and facilitate SDG-related activities at the local level (e.g. district level), including within the ASM sector.
