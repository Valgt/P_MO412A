                  The prime objective of the current study is to investigate the impact of financial inclusion, fintech, natural resources rent and renewable energy consumption on the CO2 emission of Cemental Asian countries. The study is carried out on the sample of Central Asian Countries over the period of 20 years from 2000 to 2019.The Central Asian states predominantly rely on coal as their primary fuel source for electricity generation. Coal served as the predominant fuel for power generation in Kazakhstan during the year 2020. Over 50% of Kyrgyzstan's electricity needs are met by coal. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are coal-producing nations. The study has employed the NL-ARDL estimate to examine the hypothesis relationships, and the results of the study reveal that factors such as financial inclusion, Fintech, natural resource rent and renewable energy has significant impact on CO2 emission. The findings of the study also have a significant impact on the policy implications and long-term viability of Central Asian nations. These policies should be in accordance with SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 13 (Climate Action). Central Asia's policymakers should balance economic benefits with environmental risks when extracting natural resources, emphasizing responsible resource management in line with SDG 15 (Life on Land), ensuring a balance between potential economic benefits and environmental risks.

The prime objective of the current study is to investigate the impact of financial inclusion, fintech, natural resources rent and renewable energy consumption on the CO2 emission of Cemental Asian countries. The study is carried out on the sample of Central Asian Countries over the period of 20 years from 2000 to 2019.The Central Asian states predominantly rely on coal as their primary fuel source for electricity generation. Coal served as the predominant fuel for power generation in Kazakhstan during the year 2020. Over 50% of Kyrgyzstan's electricity needs are met by coal. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are coal-producing nations. The study has employed the NL-ARDL estimate to examine the hypothesis relationships, and the results of the study reveal that factors such as financial inclusion, Fintech, natural resource rent and renewable energy has significant impact on CO2 emission. The findings of the study also have a significant impact on the policy implications and long-term viability of Central Asian nations. These policies should be in accordance with SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 13 (Climate Action). Central Asia's policymakers should balance economic benefits with environmental risks when extracting natural resources, emphasizing responsible resource management in line with SDG 15 (Life on Land), ensuring a balance between potential economic benefits and environmental risks.

The principal determinants of ED—substantial carbon footprint (CFP) and substantial ecological pressure—are at once influential and impedimental to the realization of sustainable economic environment and growth. As demonstrated by Arachchige and Kumarasinghe (2021) , the quantification of human-induced environmental impact through the utilization of greenhouse gas quantities is a capability of the CFP. These gases consist of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases, emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, and electricity consumption. CO2 emissions, as per the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, constitute a substantial factor in the worldwide warming of the planet and the deterioration of the environment (Parviainen, 2021 ). These emissions constitute 75% of the overall greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, British Petroleum reports that CO2 emissions increased by 29,714.2–33,444.0 million tons between 2009 and 2017. Global warming is projected to escalate by 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2050, assuming present patterns in greenhouse gas emissions persist. As a result of the precipitous rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, “immediate action” is necessary to avert an environmental catastrophe. Consequently, several scholarly investigations (Lidskog et al., 2020 ) have endorsed the implementation of suitable regulations and policies to safeguard the habitability of the Earth for posterity. The global economy has undergone a rapid transformation over the course of the past few years, which has caused people to be concerned about both their financial situation and the state of the environment (Khan et al., 2023 ). As a result of the increasing significance of these environmental issues, a number of economies have committed resources to the process of achieving financial development and environmental stability (Falcone, 2020 ). One of the most important aspects of financial development (FND) is the inclusion of the financial sector in any economy, which indeed is an integral component of FND. The effects of FND on the environment have been the subject of investigation in a number of international studies and authors with various theoretical and empirical models have tried to investigate the impact of (Anis et al., 2021 ). However, there is a still gap in the existing literature and dearth of research that offer any conclusion on the role of FNI plays in decreasing the environmental degrading. However, there have only been a handful of studies that have been conducted on the topic of sustainable environments. When we talk about financial inclusion, we are referring to the fact that all individuals and businesses should be able to access a variety of financial services and products in a way that is simple, dependable, and sustainable. FIN, environmental health, and social well-being are the three areas that the International Framework Convention (IGF) places the utmost importance on. As a result of the significance of the region (in relation to FNI and ED), we decided to use the central Asian nations as our case study. Beginning in 1980 and continuing until 2016, the rate of financial growth in Central Asian nations slowed. These economies require capital for environmentally responsible investments and financial reforms in order to boost the rate of economic and sustainable economic enviornment and growth in the region. Therefore, the focus of this research is on FNI as a factor that contributes to climate change in the context of the states that occupy central Asia. Furthermore, researchers believe that TIN is essential for the preservation of FND and NRS as well as the reduction of the environmental impact that these species have (Lu and Wang, 2023 ). A number of global factors are contributing to the degradation of the environment (Prăvălie et al., 2021 ). Some of these factors include the rising consumption of energy, emissions of greenhouse gases, pollutants, contamination of water, and excessive use of fossil fuels. Scholars are relating a variety of aspects to the CFP-EFP in order to find mitigation solutions that could assist in achieving sustainable economic environment and growth and improving the quality of the environment. As a result of this, TIN is widely acknowledged to be of critical importance to FND and the amount of sustainable growth that is generated by industrial operations (Shehata et al., 2022 ). Studies that have been conducted on environmental quality have demonstrated that cutting-edge technological advancements that are implemented during production significantly increase the long-term environmental viability. Fareed et al. (2022)  made the assertion that TIN lowers both the amount of energy that is consumed and the amount of CO2 that is emitted. Cheng et al. (2021)  and An et al. (2021)  are some of the studies that have attempted to investigate the connections between TIN and CO2 reduction. However, these investigations have solely concentrated on both greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions. In spite of this, our study used CO2 reduction as substitutes for environmental sustainability in order to evaluate the degree to which the environment was deteriorating. Because of this, the implementation of TIN in the country is absolutely necessary in order to fulfil the commitments that were made at a climate change summit on a global scale. During the course of our research, we made use of both comprehensive evaluations, as was mentioned earlier. Regarding environmental sustainability, the responsible administration of natural resources stands out as a crucial element (Oleśniewicz et al., 2020 ). The growth channel of natural resources can contribute to CO2 emissions, making rapid economic expansion drive up the demand for nonrenewable energy sources like natural gas, oil, and coal. Consequently, this leads to alarmingly high levels of CO2 generation. Moreover, the utilization of resources in the initial phases of development has a harmful impact on the ecosystem. The primary drivers of this consumption are increased mining and agricultural activity, both of which disregard environmental sustainability. Studies have shown that implementing these measures results in a rise in both revenue and CO2 emissions (Boukhelkhal, 2022 ). However, it is primarily human activities that are responsible for ED and climate change. Majeed and Ozturk (2020)  argue that ED is a consequence of the growing need for food, energy, infrastructure, water, and clean air. This increased demand results in higher emissions and puts significant strain on the environment. The research conducted by Tien et al. (2021)  found that human capital is the most probable factor in safeguarding the planet by ensuring the identification of a high-quality environment. As per Moustairas et al. (2022) , education has led to a rise in the quantity of recycling activities conducted by both individuals and businesses. Central Asia is located in the centre of Eurasia and covers over 4 million square kilometers, making it the seventh largest region in the world in terms of land area. The central Asian states consist of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Kyrgyzstan has the smallest population among the five. Central Asia possesses a plethora of energy resources, encompassing renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower, alongside fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil. If the quantities of these resources exceed the demand in the domestic market, they can be exported to international markets to fulfill energy needs. These resources can be employed to support the growth of agricultural operations (Razi and Dincer, 2022 ). Kazakhstan ranks ninth in terms of total land area among all countries worldwide. Uzbekistan, located in Central Asia, is the most densely populated and advanced state in the region. It has an approximate population of 33 million individuals and experiences a population growth rate of nearly 700,000 annually. Central Asia (CA) was formerly a Soviet republic. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of five new entities in the field of international relations in the region have collectively led to a substantial escalation in the strategic significance of these nations. These states possess vast reserves of water and hydroenergy resources, as well as significant deposits of oil, gas, uranium, gold, and other minerals. In addition, they possess hydropower resources. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan collectively possess around 4.3 percent of the global proven gas reserves. Their measure encompasses approximately eight trillion cubic meters (Brilha,2023). It is reasonable to expect that the amount of gas being exported will grow in the future. Through the crucial gas pipeline called “Central Asia - Center,” which passes through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan's gas can be transported to Russia, Ukraine, and the countries in the Caucasus region. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Central Asia emerged as a significant supplier of oil and gas on a global scale. Several studies have specifically examined the heavy dependence of the Central Asian states on oil and gas. Notably, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan have experienced significant growth in the production, consumption, and export of these commodities (Vepayev and Deniz, 2020 ). These fields of research have been the focus of numerous investigations. Coal, petroleum, and gas remain indispensable to the economies of the Central Asian states (Zhumabayev et al., 2022 ; Al-Aiban, 2024 ). Central Asia is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change compared to other regions within the European zone. The World Bank carried out a study on the adaptation to climate change in Central Asia in it was which revealed that temperatures in the region have already risen by 0.5 °C, and it was argued that it is projected to increase further by 1.6–2.6 °C from 2030 to 2050. In addition to that it was revealed that despite the resource-rich nature and high levels of human development in Central Asian countries, there has been a 12% rise in CO2 levels. The contribution of the study is threefold: Firstly, the study examines the pioneering impact of financial inclusion, fintech, natural resource rent, and renewable energy consumption on the CO2 emissions of Central Asian countries. Secondly, the study has employed one of the robust econometric estimation techniques, NL-ARDL, over a period of 20 years from 2000 to 2019. Lastly, the study has focused on central Asian countries that are rich in mineral resources and are witnessing an era of financial development and growth. The remaining sections of the study are organized as follows: Section 2  provides an overview and emphasizes the existing literature. Section 3  provides an overview of the data, resources, and methods used in the study. Section 4  presents the statistical results and subsequent discussions. The analysis is concluded in Section 5 , which also provides policy recommendations.  2 Literature review 2.1 Financial inclusion and ED The impact of financial inclusion on ED has long been a subject of debate. Researchers with different theoretical methods have tried to examine the impact of financial inclusion on ED, and they have employed robust economic estimation to examine this relationship (Hasan and Du, 2023 ; Abaidullah, 2024 ; Khokhar et al., 2024 ). However, yet the impact of financial inclusion on ED seems to be a puzzle whose parts need to be fixed. The relationship between FND and ecological sustainability has been the subject of discussion in the academic community, with two primary schools of thought being the focus of attention (Lawrence et al., 2022 ). According to their findings, FND has the potential to stimulate the development of environmentally friendly technologies that produce environmentally friendly goods with the objective of preserving an environment that is immaculately clean, thereby increasing the degree of sustainability in development on a global, national, and regional scale. According to the second line of the study, the increased CO2 emissions could be caused by FND because it encourages production activities such as manufacturing and manufacturing (Voumik et al., 2023 ). It has been demonstrated through research how FND contributes to the degradation of the environment. Despite this, there is a paucity of published material that directly links FIN to the deterioration of the environment. According to the findings of previous studies, the relationship between FNI and environmental proxies in economies that are part of the central Asian states is complicated, scarce, and controversial. Taking this into consideration, the topic of developing a financial system that is capable of sustaining itself is currently gaining traction among academics and politicians all over the world(Thiemann, 2024 ). The goal of green finance is to provide a variety of financial products, including funding and investment in activities that are environmentally sustainable (Akhtar et al., 2023 ). Therefore, if the central Asian states and the rest of the world want to continue their development while simultaneously reducing their impact on the environment, they might benefit from a green finance system.  2.2 Fintech technological innovation and ED In light of the critical nature of environmental challenges, researchers are increasingly focusing their attention on the effects that innovation has on the degradation of the environment itself (Abdelsalam and Sajid, 2023 ). It has been demonstrated through historical evidence that TIN has a significant impact on the ecological sustainability. However, TIN in general and financial technology in particular has received a relatively low level of attention in previous research. The limited number of studies on the relationship between Fintech and ED offers ambiguous results arguing that TIN can have both positive and negative effects on ED. Ramzan et al. (2023)  carried out a study on the sample of 35 member countries of OECD argued that TIN has a substantial negative impact on environmental quality and has positive and sign faint influence on environmental sustainability within the. Furthermore, they provided evidence that TIN has an impact on the environmental sustainability and is a catalyst in achieving SDG of the OECD. The study conducted by Li et al. (2021)  on an Asian country and found that TIN has a positive and signifying impact on ED Asian economies. The results of the study argue that TIN played a significant role in enhancing the environmental sustainability in Bangladesh and offer roadmap for the achievement of SDG. Ali et al. (2020)  conducted a study using panel data from 33 European countries spanning from 1996 to 2017, exploring the relationship between economic growth and energy innovation. ED has an impact. The study employed second-generation panel data econometrics to control cross-section independence and heterogeneity and FMOLS to analyze the panel data. The study's findings imply that energy innovation has a significant negative impact on the environment. However, GDP supports the Kuznets curve and has a U-shape relationship with ED. Besada et al. (2022)  examine the empirical consequences and find a durable and enduring relationship between TIN and ED. Yang et al. (2023)  found that TIN has a positive impact on the environmental sustainability of the region. Most experts in the field concur that TIN have the capacity to enhance the environment. Their argument asserts that TIN facilitates the expeditious development of novel methodologies. As a result, it improves energy efficiency and reduces the need for using energy obtained from fossil fuels. The research findings are inconclusive regarding the effect of TIN on environmental sustainability. However, most of their findings do not align with the positive and negative impacts that TIN has on the environment. The current body of research shows that there is disagreement regarding whether TIN contributes to the exacerbation of ED. 2.2.1 Renewable energy and ED In order to overcome ecological hazards, sustainable energy and growth are essential for environmental sustainability. Accordingly, renewable energy sources are a better way to boost the economy without compromising environmental safeguards (Hye et al., 2023 ). When it comes to producing energy and potentially protecting the environment, renewable sources are superior. Several pieces of evidence point to renewable energy sources playing a significant role in reducing emissions of CO2. Ali et al. (2021)  found that renewable energy can help reduce CO2 emissions in Pakistan, China, and India, which supports the EKC inverted U-shaped hypothesis. However, contrary to popular belief, renewable energy sources in Turkey and other MENA countries are not very effective at lowering CO2 emissions (Omri and Saidi, 2022 ). According to Madaleno and Nogueira (2023) , the growth-renewables connection has helped Brazil's ecosystems by cutting down on carbon emissions. Innovative renewable energy sources have helped reduce carbon emissions and enhance environmental quality in China. The validity of the EKC inverted U shape as the superior policy for legislators is not in question. While the central-western regions do not exhibit the EKC inverted U shape, it is clearly visible in the eastern region. Renewable energy consumption reduced CO2 emissions in the west and east, but had no effect in the middle. It was demonstrated by Forsén (2020)  that renewable energy is competent. As a result, it held the EKC and RKC theories in both developed and developing nations and helped reduce CO2 emissions worldwide. Economic growth's double-effect has stabilized environmental problems in the fifteen Asian emerging economies by reducing carbon emissions, and the EKC of an inverted U shape has been confirmed. The EKC inverted U shape has been proven and CO2 emissions have been mitigated in G20 nations through GDP square (Yan (2021) . Even without the EKC inverted U-shaped hypothesis, renewable energy decreased the ecological footprint in OECD countries (Pata, 2021 ). When ED is considered as an ecological footprint, a panel study of fourteen European nations confirms the EKC of U and inverted U shape. ED is measured as CO2 emissions, which simultaneously recognizes EKC's just inverted U-shaped premise. Nevertheless, according to Chiambaretto et al. (2021) , the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources has reduced the environmental shame felt by Europe. Additional evidence suggests that renewable energy and financial development in Europe's emerging economies have a negative impact on carbon emissions that is both linear and non-linear, and that this effect holds true in an inverted U shape (Dong et al., 2022 ). Green funding and technology are essential for the energy transition to be planned properly in order to achieve environmental sustainability.   2.3 Natural resource rents, and environmental degrdation Rents and natural resources that are utilized effectively contribute to the maintenance of a habitable planet. Within the context of the long-term positive association, Ullah et al. (2020)  discovered that CO2 secretions and urbanization were located on opposite sides of the association. One of the factors that contributes to Africa's ecological crisis is the use of nonrenewable resources and power outages. On the other hand, resource rents have helped to protect the environment and reduce emissions of CO2. According to Adebayo et al. (2021) , the rapid urbanization and economic growth of China are causing the country's environmental sustainability to deteriorate. This is a threat to the health of the environment. On the other hand, resource rents have made the overall impact on the environment even more severe. According to the evidence presented by the panel, urbanization has led to an increase in the environmental impact and a decrease in the quality of conservation in the top ten industrial nations. Despite the fact that urbanization is beneficial to the environment, natural resources are detrimental to it. It has been suggested by Haseeb et al. (2020)  that the textile industry, exports, and oil prices are also factors that have an impact on the climate. After the conclusion of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP-26), Khaddage-Soboh et al. (2023a,b)  assert that rents from natural resources have contributed to the enhancement of climate technology. There is a positive correlation between urbanization and overall environmental improvement, as stated by Peng et al. (2020) , and urban areas in China are exhibiting signs of improvement in light of this correlation. There are, without a doubt, differences between regions; for instance, in comparison to urban areas, non-urban areas boast a higher percentage of environmental improvement. According to Ali et al. (2023) , urbanization has an elastic impact on carbon secretions and causes environmental disruptions in Saudi Arabia. This is the conclusion reached by the researchers. According to Ariken et al. (2021) , the Silk Road Economic Belt regions of Guangxi, China have all been experiencing an upward trend in urbanization. This trend has been sustained throughout the entire region. Although this was the case, the eco-environment indexes of the provinces of Guangxi, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan all showed signs of improvement. According to the findings of Huang and Matsumoto (2021) , urbanization has led to an increase in CO2 emissions in thirty different provincial regions. These emissions are even more excessive when energy and per capita income are taken into consideration. According to Zhang and Chen (2021) , the development of coordinated coupling contributed to the achievement of sustainable urbanization in the province of Shandong in China. Nevertheless, when it comes to urbanization, fifty percent of the cities are classified as being in a transitional state. The environment is under increasing pressure as a result of ongoing pollution and the depletion of resources. Despite this, actions are being taken to address this problem, including the improvement of infrastructure, the promotion of sustainable resource utilization, the enhancement of the environment, and the enhancement of urbanization. Kane et al. (2021)  found a trend that was not only nimble but also encouraging in the midst of the chaos that was caused by urbanization and environmental change. In the southwest region of China, the rate of urbanization was rapid, but the rate of environmental improvement was sluggish. Carbon emissions have increased in Northeast Asian economies as a result of urbanization and the utilization of renewable resources; however, these emissions have decreased as a result of economic growth, as indicated by the findings of a panel of researchers (Kane et al., 2021 ). The use of clean energy, on the other hand, has been beneficial to Bangladesh's environment because it has reduced CO2 emissions. On the other hand, environmental conditions have deteriorated as a result of expanding urbanization and increased economic activity (Han, 2020 ). In light of the strong correlation that exists between increased energy consumption, GDP growth, urbanization, and CO2 emissions, it is of the utmost importance that Pakistan's economic policies and electricity policies be better integrated. In spite of this, environmental conditions can be effectively managed through the utilization of both renewable and nonrenewable resources (Chen et al., 2023 ). BRICS data indicates that cities contribute to the preservation of the environment in a better state than it was in the past, and the relationship between growth and the environment follows an EKC that is shaped like an inverted U (Hasan et al., 2023 ).   3 Data The study is carried out on the sample of Central Asian Countries over the period of 20 years from 2000 to 2019. The variable and their measurements are shown in Table 1    below. The outcome of descriptive statistics of selected variables is shown in Table 3  (see Table 2 ). The mean, median, maximum, minimum, SD, skewness and kurtosis values of data are shown in this table. This table also display the Jarque-Bera statistic test results along with their probability values. This test is used to determine whether variables are normal distributed or not. Here, are the details.  4 Panel unit root test In the first step of our process, we started by determining whether or not the variables followed a stationary distribution. The technique of panel unit root testing is utilized by the scientific community in order to accomplish this mission. Panel unit root testing is superior to individual time series analysis when it comes to performance, particularly when the power levels are extremely high. In accordance with Loukil et al. (2021) , these investigations are panel multi-series unit root analyses, albeit with a few modifications. In the process of unit root analysis, the following methods are utilized: IPS and LCC, Breitung, ADF, and PP. Under the assumption of a joint unit root process, the LCC test guarantees that the value of pi does not change between the sections written by Diaz (2022) . This stands in contrast to the IPS unit root test, which permits the execution of a single unit root process. Logarithmic panel unit root tests were carried out with the intention of determining whether or not any of the variables had reached a state of stagnation. The symbol H1 is used to indicate that there is no unit root, while the symbol H0 is used to indicate that there is a unit root. Each and every one of the tests demonstrates the behavior that was anticipated when the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is applied, as shown in Equation (5)  below:(1) Δ y i t   = a y i t − 1   + ∑ j = 1  p i   β j i   Δ y i t − j   X i t  ′  δ + ε i t        Assuming that the lag orders of various terms can diverge between cross sections, it is assumed that α = p −1 will remain constant throughout the simulation. We can determine whether or not our hypotheses are correct by using the LLC test.H0 pi : α = 1 (where the unit root is present in the null hypothesis).  H1 pi : α < 1 (where the alternate hypothesis lacks a unit root).   The LLC, IPS, Breitung, Fisher ADF, and PP panel methodologies were utilized in order to carry out observable stability checks prior to the unit root testing that was carried out. Table 3  provides a summary of the findings obtained from the unit root statistical tests. The panel unit root demonstrates that none of the variables are statistically significant at the level and first difference of analysis. This is the case for all of the variables. There is no way to reject the null hypothesis (H0) because the requirements of the Pena Unit Root test are satisfied by all of the variables taken into consideration. Accordingly, the indications are undergoing a transformation. Because the variables have reached a state of stability, the null hypothesis can be rejected once all of the variables have overcome the initial level.(2) Δ l n C O  2  i t   = α θ  + ∑ k = 1  n  α 1 k   Δ l n F N I  ( t − k  )   + ∑ k = 1  n  α 2 k   Δ l n F T I N  ( t − k  )   + ∑ k = 1  n  α 3 k   Δ l n R E N R  ( t − k  )   + ∑ k = 1  n  α 4 k   Δ l n N R R  ( t − k  )   + β 1  l n F N I  ( t − 1  )   + β 2  l n F T I N  ( t − 1  )   + β 3  l n R E N R  ( t − 1  )   + β 4  l n N R R  ( t − 1  )   + ε t       4.1 Panel NL-ARDL test In this section, the NL-ARDL model, which was developed by Husein and Kara (2020) , is presented to the individual. The research investigates the relationships between energy consumption, economic growth, technological advancement, CO2 emissions, ecological footprint, and green economic development. The NL-ARDL method and tree models are utilized in the investigation. This method of evaluation is designed to make it possible to use a single equation to describe both co-integration and nonlinear asymmetry. This is the goal of the approach. With the help of the NL-ARDL model, we are able to observe how the positive and negative variations of the deconstructed variables influence the variables that are dependent on them. The model is not rendered invalid by the utilization of a limited sample set. Adaptability is achieved due to the absence of a predetermined sequence in which the variables are required to be integrated. It is a dynamic error correction representation that produces robust empirical results, despite the fact that the sample size is relatively restricted. The equations that will be used to represent the logarithmic and positive/negative changes in the descriptive variables will have the following form during the modeling process:(3) CO 2  it  = ∝ it  + δ it  + β +  F N I  i t  +  + β −  F N I  i t  −  + β +  F T I N  i t  +  + β −  F T I N  i t  −  + β +  R E N R  i t  +  + β +  R E N R  i t  −  + β +  N R R  i t  +  + β +  N R R  i t  −  + μ i t       In this equation, the variables that are being considered are β, which stands for the coefficients, μ i t     , which stands for the intercept, t, which stands for time, and i, which stands for the nations themselves. When it comes to equation (4) , there are a few different ways to phrase it in order to represent the NL-ARDL framework of all examples:(4) Δ CO  2 it   = μ + ρ C O  2 it − 1   + ϑ +  F N I  i t − 1  +  + ϑ −  F N I  i t − 1  −  + ∅ +  F T I N  i t − 1  +  + ∅ −  F T I N  i t − 1  −  + ω +  R E N R  i t − 1  +  + ω −  R E N R  i t − 1  −  + φ +  N R R  i t − 1  +  + φ −  N R R + ∑ j = 1  n − 1   α j Δ C O  2 i t − 1   + ∑ j = 0  n 2   ( π j +   Δ F N I  i t − j  +  + π j −  Δ F N I  i t − j  −   )  +  ∑ j = 0  n 3   ( τ j +   Δ FTIN  i t − j  +  + τ j −  Δ FTIN  i t − j  −   )  +  ∑ j = 0  n 4   ( σ j +   Δ RENR  i t − j  +  + σ j −  Δ RENR  i t − j  −   )  +  ∑ j = 0  n 4   ( φ j +   Δ NRR  i t − j  +  + φ j −  Δ NRR  i t − j  −   )  + ε  i t         The following formula can be used to determine the short-run NL-ARDL elasticities with an error-correcting mechanism:(5) Δ CO  2 it   = μ + ∑ j = 1  n − 1   α j Δ C O  2 i t − 1   + ∑ j = 0  n 2   ( π j +   Δ F N I  i t − j  +  + π j −  Δ F N I  i t − j  −   )  +  ∑ j = 0  n 3   ( τ j +   Δ FTIN  i t − j  +  + τ j −  Δ FTIN  i t − j  −   )  +  ∑ j = 0  n 4   ( σ j +   Δ RENR  i t − j  +  + σ j −  Δ RENR  i t − j  −   )  +  ∑ j = 0  n 4   ( φ j +   Δ NRR  i t − j  +  + φ j −  Δ NRR  i t − j  −   )  + ε i t         The effects of variables FNI, FTIN, RENR and NRR can be split into positive and negative components, as shown in equations (6)–(9) :(6) Δ FNI  it  = μ + F N I  0  + F N I  i t  +  + F N I  i t  −      (7) Δ FTIN  it  = μ + F T I N  0  + F T I N  i t  +  + F T I N  i t  −      (8) Δ RENR  it  = μ + R E N R  0  + R E N R  i t  +  + R E N R  i t  −      (9) Δ NRR  it  = μ + N R R  0  + N R R  i t  +  + N R R  i t  −        4.2 Unit root results For the purpose of ensuring that all of your variables are stationary at level, first difference, and second difference prior to employing the panel NL-ARDL approach, it is advisable to conduct a unit root test. The results of the unit root test organized according to panel are presented in Table 3 , which can be found here. Following the analysis of the data, we have determined that certain variables are level stationary, while others are first difference stationary. Panel root tests, such as Levin, Lin, and Chu t (LLC), Im, Pesaran, and Shin W-stat (IPS), Breitung, Fisher ADF, and PP, are the first step in determining the stationarity level of the input variable. These tests are used to determine whether or not the variable is stationary. In the event that this assumption is taken into consideration, the results of the econometric model will not be biased in favor of Gujarati (2003) . Co-integration test used to verify whether the indicators are Co-integrated or not. Table 5    explain the Padroni test. The unit root test on the computed residual considering country and time factor heterogeneity, together with the autoregressive coefficient in Central Asian nations (Ameer et al., 2023 ). Additionally, in the modern series analysis, the examination of log-run cointegration connections was drawn from Central Asian economies. There is no co-integration with individual intercept, trend, and no intercept or trend null hypothesis is statically rejected by the Padroni panel test in Panel A, ADF. The unit root test statistically mean value for each individual Central Asian country. The ADF (t-statistics) is 0.289 with residual variance in the panel B when co-integration is used with rho, PP and ADF statistics. Table 6    show the results of Kao Engle-Granger based test. Where the co-integration vector is uniform across the nation. The outcome supports the co-integration theory for variables in Central Asian countries. The final test is a panel co-integration test, or Fisher test, which is used to support Johansen methodology Johansen (1991) , as shown in Tables 4–6  (Camba and Camba, 2021 ). The p-value of each Johansen trace statistic and eigenvalue are combined in the panel co-integration test, which also rejects the null hypothesis that there is no co-integration Chiang-Ching and Tan (2018)  (see Table 7 ). It can be deduced from the fact that the long-term positive coefficient for FNI indicates that the expansion of financial inclusion is accompanied by an increase in CO2 emissions. In the early stages of economic development, when financial inclusion is on the rise, there is a correlation between increased economic activity and consumption patterns, which can then lead to higher carbon emissions. This is because consumers are more likely to spend their money on things that they already own. On the other hand, the FNI has a negative coefficient over the long term, which brings about an intriguing nuance: a decrease in the level of financial inclusion appears to be linked to a reduction in the amount of CO2 emissions. As economies develop, there is a possibility that there will be a shift toward practices that are more sustainable, which would reduce the damaging effects that financial activities have on the environment. There is not a consistent pattern of positive or negative effects on CO2 emissions stemming from FTIN. Since the negative coefficient indicates that there is a correlation between increased innovation in the financial technology sector and decreased CO2 emissions, it lends long-term support to the EKC hypothesis (Rafique et al., 2020 ). The results of the study offer an insight on how new technologies contribute to the promotion of environmentally friendly business practices in central Asian countries. However, the positive short-run coefficient for ΔFTIN suggests that the initial result of increased carbon emissions could be the result of rapid increases in technological innovation in the field of fintech in short run. One of the possible explanations of this difference in short and long run relationship that certain technological advancements require a significant amount of energy, or it could be that environmentally friendly practices that are associated with these technologies have been slow to reach widespread adoption. The negative coefficients for RENR over both the long and short terms indicate that shift to green energy lower the ED. The results of the study are consistent with the proposition of EKC hypothesis, which advocates that that developed economies are more likely to use renewable energy sources, which are better for the environment, this is consistent with the theory. Moreover, the long-run positive coefficient for NRR and ED, indicate that central Asian countries that rely heavily on rents from natural resources have higher levels of CO2 emissions than other countries (Khaddage-Soboh et al., 2023 ). The results are also in line with the proposition of the EKC hypothesis, which postulates that countries with abundant natural resources may have difficulty containing the pollution that is a consequence of their abundance of these resources, this finding contradicts the hypothesis.   5 Conclusion This study investigates the impact of financial inclusion, fintech, natural resource rent, and renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions in Central Asian countries from 2000 to 2019. The research, conducted using the NL-ARDL estimation method, found that factors such as financial inclusion, fintech, natural resource rent, and renewable energy significantly influence CO2 emissions. The findings also have significant implications for policy implications and long-term sustainability in Central Asian nations. These policies must align with SDG 7 and 13, which focus on providing affordable and clean energy and combating climate change. Policymakers in Central Asia should prioritize responsible resource management to balance economic benefits and environmental risks associated with natural resource extraction, aligning with SDG 15 (Life on Land). Within the context of this particular geographical setting, the findings shed light on both the similarities and differences that are associated with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory. The fact that there is a negative correlation between renewable energy (RENR) and CO2 emissions suggests that there is a discernible movement in the direction of cleaner energy sources in the economies of Central Asia. This could be beneficial for the mitigation of environmental issues. A positive long-run coefficient corresponds to early development, and a negative coefficient after that suggests a possible shift towards sustainable practices as Central Asian economies develop. At the same time, FNI demonstrates a complex relationship; a positive long-run coefficient corresponds to early development. Long-term improvements are in line with the EKC, but short-term increases indicate possible environmental problems caused by rapid technological changes. This is one of the reasons why the impact of fintech technological innovation (FTIN) is so complicated. The interactions with natural resource rents (NRR) further complicate the situation; a positive coefficient in the long run calls into question the predictions made by EKC. The findings of this study shed light on the intricate environmental and economic dynamics that are present in Central Asian countries. These findings also highlight the necessity of developing sophisticated policy strategies that take into account the distinct regional interaction of variables across a variety of time scales. The significance of environmentally responsible practices in the financial and technology sectors is brought to light by these findings, which also call for additional research into the factors that influence the ecological footprint of economies in Central Asia. In order to make informed decisions that foster economic growth while simultaneously protecting the environment, the policymakers of the Central Asian nations need to have access to this comprehensive information.  6 Policy implications The NL-ARDL model's findings have a significant impact on Central Asian nations' policy implications and long-term viability. This is because the SDGs play a significant role in their implications. The discovery of a negative correlation between renewable energy (RENR) and CO2 emissions suggests that Central Asian countries should increase their investment in renewable energy to curb environmental damage. Governments can utilize this information to formulate policies that promote the use of renewable energy sources. These policies should be in accordance with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 13 (Climate Action). The intricate connection between financial inclusion (FNI) and CO2 emissions further highlights the importance of well-targeted financial policies that boost economic growth for all without putting the environment in jeopardy. In accordance with SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), policymakers in Central Asia should consider ways to promote financial inclusion while also protecting the environment as the economies of the region continue to develop. Because financial technology innovation (FTIN) has ambiguous effects, it is critical to adopt technology with extreme caution. In spite of the fact that technological advancements might actually be beneficial to the environment in the long run, it is necessary to take a balanced approach because of the short-term increases in CO2 emissions. Central Asian countries should incorporate Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) into their technological policies to ensure compliance with SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). According to the relationship, there is a possibility that relying heavily on natural resource rents (NRR) has environmental costs. The policymakers of the nations that make up Central Asia ought to exercise caution when it comes to the extraction of natural resources, striking a balance between the potential economic benefits and the risks to the environment. The SDG 15 (Life on Land) aligns with the emphasis on responsible resource management.  CRediT authorship contribution statement Yu Jie:  Conceptualization, Formal analysis.
