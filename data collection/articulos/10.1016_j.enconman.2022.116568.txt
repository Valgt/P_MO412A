                  Large-scale bioenergy production utilizing agricultural residues (ARs) in multi-paths has potential energy, environmental, economic and social (EEES) impacts. If, how and to what extent these impacts integratively bring sustainability contributions at regional scale remains to be explored. Herein, the EEES impacts quantified based upon a multi-resource-technology-output life cycle framework are reflected as 17 indicators, and linked to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and their sub-goals to explore the sustainability contributions and trade-offs in 31 Chinese provincial regions by 2030 in three scenarios of ARs availability. Results indicate that the ARs can contribute to 1.86 billion GJ net energy output and 32.1 billion yuan net profit by 2030 in the complete scenario with the highest ARs availability. Attributed to open burning avoidance and fossil energy offset, there are mitigation effects on 11 out of 13 life cycle environmental impact categories, however intensification effects on Freshwater eutrophication and Marine eutrophication. Regional sustainability score closely depends on ARs availability, while does not strictly parallel it. The ARs-abundant regions, such as Heilongjiang, Henan and Jilin, benefit outstandingly from bioenergy production to enhance regional sustainability (especially on SDG1, SDG7 and SDG13). The findings can provide decision-makers with references to soundly boosting agricultural bioenergy development to consolidate regional sustainability.

If, how and to what extent these impacts integratively bring sustainability contributions at regional scale remains to be explored. Herein, the EEES impacts quantified based upon a multi-resource-technology-output life cycle framework are reflected as 17 indicators, and linked to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and their sub-goals to explore the sustainability contributions and trade-offs in 31 Chinese provincial regions by 2030 in three scenarios of ARs availability. Results indicate that the ARs can contribute to 1.86 billion GJ net energy output and 32.1 billion yuan net profit by 2030 in the complete scenario with the highest ARs availability. Attributed to open burning avoidance and fossil energy offset, there are mitigation effects on 11 out of 13 life cycle environmental impact categories, however intensification effects on Freshwater eutrophication and Marine eutrophication. Regional sustainability score closely depends on ARs availability, while does not strictly parallel it. The ARs-abundant regions, such as Heilongjiang, Henan and Jilin, benefit outstandingly from bioenergy production to enhance regional sustainability (especially on SDG1, SDG7 and SDG13). The findings can provide decision-makers with references to soundly boosting agricultural bioenergy development to consolidate regional sustainability.

Bioenergy is an environmentally friendly, abundant and widely distributed source of renewable energy [2] . As a main type of bioenergy accounting for larger than 45Â % in the total quantity in China, agricultural residues (ARs) (including straw and crop residues) has a considerable potential to accelerate the realization of China's ambitious goals of carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, as well as to combat global climate change [3,4] . Simultaneously, large-scale bioenergy production utilizing ARs in multi-paths will trigger combined energy, environmental, economic and social (EEES) impacts, potentially exerting influence on regional sustainability, either positive or negative, which remains elusive [5,6] . Abundant biomass feedstock is the basis for large-scale bioenergy production. The assessment of ARs potential for bioenergy production has been conducted mainly based on three levels as theoretical reserve, collectable quantity and quantity available for bioenergy production [7] . Remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies were commonly adopted to evaluate the spatiotemporal characteristics of ARs [8,9] . Some prediction models were developed for forecasting ARs potential based on the historical trends in data on crops [10,11] . When the feedstock is transported to bioenergy projects according to optimized supply routes, it can be converted into various energy products including power, solid, gaseous and liquid fuels through different bioenergy technologies (BTs) [12,13] , the selection of which aligns with regional characteristics, biomass types, and resource distribution [14,15] . The performances of BTs vary on energy conversion efficiency, greenhouse or pollutant mitigation and operation cost. These performances have been assessed through life cycle assessment (LCA) [16â18] , emergy analysis [19] , cost-benefit analysis [20] , multi-criteria decision making analysis [21]  etc. to demonstrate the economic feasibility or environmental sustainability. Scholars also conducted scenario analysis by changing scales or parameters of BTs focusing on direct-combustion power generation [22] , briquette fuel [23] , biogas [24] , cellulose ethanol [25] , and gasification power generation [26] . Among the methods adopted, LCA is capable of analyzing each link in the entire process of bioenergy production utilizing ARs (including feedstock supply, energy conversion, and final use) in detail, and quantifying the environmental and economic outcomes of the final energy products from production to use. Zhao et al. [27]  used LCA to study the environmental impacts of seven corn straw bioethanol production technologies on seven life cycle impact categories in 10 links including transport and fragmentation, pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Wang et al. [28]  combined LCA, life cycle cost and best-worst method to evaluate the overall sustainability of four different scenarios of straw-fired power generation from environmental and economic point of view. At region scale, attributed to, for example, replacing fossil energy with bioenergy products, bioenergy production can create considerable environmental benefits [29] . Scholars have analyzed the greenhouse gases (GHGs) reduction potential in regions at provincial (Alberta of Canada) [30] , national (European Union) [31] , and global [32,33]  scales. Combining both environmental and economic dimensions, the environmental sustainability and economic feasibility of direct combustion of agricultural waste for power generation [34] , as well as the energy balance, economic profit and environmental impacts of converting biomass waste into fuel ethanol [35]  have been investigated. The environmental and socioeconomic impacts of bioenergy development at regional scale both reflect the sustainability of the bioenergy system itself and are closely linked to regional sustainable development [36] . The multidimensional complexity of sustainability poses a challenge for defining and establishing the criteria for quantifying sustainability. Several frameworks for selecting and evaluating sustainability indicators for bioenergy development were proposed [37,38] . The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposed by the United Nations in 2015 is the norm framework for addressing sustainable development issues that consists of 17 SDGs covering 169 specific sub-goals [39] . Targeting either developing [40,41]  or developed countries [42,43] , multiple routes for bioenergy production focusing on different combinations of technologies or policies were put forward to comprehensively evaluate their impacts on regional sustainable development. Moreover, using biomass such as energy plants and microalgae involves the input of many elements as in case of land, water, and fertilizer, and thus large-scale bioenergy production may incur some negative impacts on sustainability [44] . Some scholars paid attention to the sustainability trade-offs in bioenergy development, focusing on the water-land nexus [45] , energy-water-land nexus [46] , and energy-food-water-land nexus [47] . These studies have confirmed the benefits created by bioenergy production and its correlation with regional sustainable development. By summarizing the reviewed studies, it can be found that large scale bioenergy production can invoke certain energy (e.g. energy products), environmental (e.g. GHG reduction), economic (e.g. profits) and social (e.g. new employment) impacts at regional scale. Specific to bioenergy production utilizing ARs, an elaborative assessment of these impacts in an integrative way from ânetâ and âlife cycleâ perspectives, is still in need to link ARs utilization to SDGs. If, how and to what extent multipath bioenergy production utilizing ARs brings contributions and trade-offs to regional sustainability remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multi-resource-technology-output integrated system consisting of biomass resource subsystem, bioenergy technology subsystem (four types of BTs) and bioenergy output subsystem (four dimensions of impacts) and covering the whole life cycle of bioenergy production utilizing ARs. Based upon the integrated system, the EEES impacts are evaluated and linked to SDGs to explore the sustainability contributions and trade-offs in 31 Chinese provincial regions by 2030 in three scenarios of ARs availability for bioenergy production. The main contribution of this study lies in (1) prospecting regional agricultural bioenergy development from multipath, net and life cycle perspectives in detail; (2) linking the EEES impacts of bioenergy production utilizing ARs to regional sustainability for unravelling the contributions and trade-offs. The findings are expected to provide decision makers with reference to soundly boosting regional agricultural bioenergy development to consolidate regional sustainability.  2 Methods 2.1 Integrated framework for bioenergy production utilizing ARs The basic structure of the integrated system is depicted in Fig. 1  . The life cycle boundary covers feedstock procurement, project operation and bioenergy product consumption. Biomass resource subsystem corresponds to the process of feedstock procurement, which involves the potential, collection and transportation of ARs for 14 crop categories. Bioenergy technology subsystem corresponds to the process of project operation, which involves energy conversion through four BTs. Bioenergy output subsystem corresponds to the process of bioenergy product consumption, which involves four dimensions of impacts as all the outputs of the whole system.  2.2 Biomass resource subsystem The ARs in biomass resource subsystem refers to the portion currently used for energy purpose and discarded by farmers. No impacts on straw turnover, feed production and other purposes would be induced. The yields of the selected 14 categories of crops (including corn, wheat, rice, beans, potatoes, cotton, etc.) account for larger than 99Â % of the total. Details of the prediction of ARs potential are provided in Supplementary materials . A âresource-islandâ mode for the collection and transportation of ARs is adopted (see Fig. S1  and descriptions of the âresource-islandâ mode in Supplementary materials ) [48] . (1) Energy impacts  The energy consumption, pollutant (or GHG) emissions and economic cost induced by procurement of ARs are calculated. The energy consumption derives from diesel consumption for bailing and delivery of ARs by mechanical equipment.(1) ENE  proc   = d  bail   Q ener   + d tran   f â â« 0  R  2 f Ï r  2  d r + L   Q ener       where ENE  proc     is the energy consumption during feedstock procurement; Q ener     is the quantity of ARs for bioenergy production (QRBP) in a region; d bail     and d tran     are the diesel consumption factors for baling and transportation of ARs (L/t -ARs and L/t -ARs/km); L  is the transport distance from a resource island to the bioenergy project; R  is the radius of a resource island. (2) Environmental impacts  There are pollutant and GHG emissions from diesel consumption.(2) E proc  p  = E bail  p  + E tran  p  = e d  p  d bail   Q ener   + e d  p  d tran   f â â« 0  R  2 f Ï r  2  d r + L   Q ener       where E bail  p   ,E tran  p    and E proc  p    are the emissions of pollutant (or GHG) p  from baling, transportation of ARs and the whole procurement process, respectively; e d  p    is the emission factor of diesel for pollutant (or GHG) p  (kg/L). (3) Economic impacts  The economic cost derives from feedstock purchase and diesel consumption.(3) ECO  proc   = Ï purc   Q ener   + Ï dies   ( d   bail   Q ener   + d tran   f â â« 0  R  2 f Ï r  2  d r + L   Q ener   )      where ECO  proc     is the cost of feedstock procurement; Ï purc     and Ï dies     are the price of unit quantity of ARs and diesel.  2.3 Bioenergy technology subsystem (1) Energy impact s  We select four BTs including direct-fired power generation (BT1), briquette fuel (BT2), biogas (BT3) and bioethanol (BT4), which have wider adoption, better maturity and overall sustainability performance, to respond to regional needs for electricity, solid fuel, gas fuel, and liquid fuel [4,21] . Total bioenergy energy production (ENE  conv    ) can be calculated as:(4) ENE  conv   = h  T 1   Q ener  T 1   + h T 2   Q ener  T 2   + h T 3   Q ener  T 3   + h T 4   Q ener  T 4       where Q ener  T 1     to Q ener  T 4     are the quantity of feedstock for four BTs, and â T 1  T 4   Q ener  Ti   = Q ener     ; h T 1     to h T 4     are the energy production coefficients of four BTs (MJ/t -ARs) (reflected as net bioenergy production with deduction of the self-use of the energy projects). The bioenergy projects also consume fossil energy during project operation as auxiliary energy inputs.(5) ENE  oper   = u  T 1   Q ener  T 1   + u T 2   Q ener  T 2   + u T 3   Q ener  T 3   + u T 4   Q ener  T 4       where ENE  oper     is total energy consumption during project operation; u T 1     to u T 4     are the energy consumption coefficients of four BTs (MJ/t -ARs). (2) Environmental impacts  There are not only air pollutants and GHGs, but also water pollutants generated during project operation.(6) E oper  p  = e T 1  p  Q ener  T 1   + e T 2  p  Q ener  T 2   + e T 3  p  Q ener  T 3   + e T 4  p  Q ener  T 4       where E oper  p    is the total emissions/discharges of pollutant (or GHG) p  during project operation; e T 1  p    to e T 4  p    are the emission/discharge factors of four BTs corresponding to project operation for pollutant (or GHG) p  (kg/t -ARs). ( 3) Economic impacts  Total economic cost during project operation (ECO  oper    ) consists of the cost for auxiliary materials, equipment maintenance, labor, tax, appreciation, etc., which can be unified as the cost of unit quantity of ARs corresponding to each BT.(7) ECO  oper   = Ï T 1   Q ener  T 1   + Ï T 2   Q ener  T 2   + Ï T 3   Q ener  T 3   + Ï T 4   Q ener  T 4       where Ï T 1     to Ï T 4     are the cost of unit quantity of ARs for four BTs (Chinese yuan (CNY)/t -ARs).  2.4 Bioenergy output subsystem (1) Energy impacts  The net energy impact, namely net energy output (ENE ) is expressed as:(8) ENE = ENE  conv   - E N E  proc   - ENE  oper        (2) Environmental impacts  The pollutant (GHG) emissions from the consumption of briquette fuel, biogas and bioethanol are considered.(9) E use  p  = e â²  T 2  p  h T 2   Q ener  T 2   + e â²  T 3  p  h T 3   Q ener  T 3   + e â²  T 4  p  h T 4   Q ener  T 4       where e â²  T 2  p    to e â²  T 4  p    are the emission factors of briquette fuel, biogas and bioethanol for pollutant (or GHG) p  (kg/MJ). In order to maximize the potential environmental benefits of bioenergy production, we additionally consider that (i) if not used for bioenergy production, this portion of ARs would be discarded and open-burned, resulting in pollutant and GHG emissions (considering the carbon neutral nature, CO2  emissions are not considered); (ii) attributed to the bioenergy products including bio-power, briquette fuel, biogas and bioethanol, corresponding quantity of traditional power, coal, natural gas and gasoline would be substituted. Thereby, the pollutants and GHGs generated from open burning of ARs, and from consuming the substituted fossil energy would be avoided (Fig. 1 ).(10) E avoi  p  = e open  p  Q ener   + e a v o i T 1  p  h  T 1   Q ener  T 1   + e a v o i T 2  p  h T 2   Q ener  T 2   + e a v o i T 3  p  h T 3   Q ener  T 3   + e a v o i T 4  p  h T 4   Q ener  T 4       where E avoi  p    is total avoided emissions of pollutant (or GHG) p ; e open  p    is the emission factor of ARs open burning for pollutant (or GHG) p  (kg/t -ARs); e a v o i T 1  p    to e a v o i T 4  p    are the avoided emission factors corresponding to the bioenergy products of four BTs for pollutant (or GHG) p  (kg/MJ). The amount of mitigated emissions of pollutant (or GHG) p  is expressed as:(11) E miti  p  = E  avoi  p  - E proc  p  - E oper  p  - E use  p      If the value of E miti  p    is positive, emissions of pollutant (or GHG) p  are mitigated; if the value is negative, emissions of pollutant (or GHG) p  are instead intensified. The mitigation effect on a certain environmental impact category can be measured by characterizing the mitigated emissions of corresponding pollutants (or GHGs).(12) EP  h  = â p  E miti  p  CF  h  p      where EP  h    is the mitigated environmental impact potential h ; and CF  h  p    is the characterization factor for converting pollutant (or GHG) p  into environmental impact h . Normalization allows to eliminate units of impact potentials and understand better the relative magnitude for each impact category:(13) ENV  h  = EP  h  NF  h       where ENV  h    is the normalized mitigated environmental impact potential h ; and NF  h    is the normalization factor for environmental impact h . Herein, we employ the âReCiPe2016 Hâ method at midpoint level, with the details provided in Table S2  in Supplementary materials . (3) Economic impacts  The sales of the bioenergy products can create income (ECO  inco    ):(14) ECO  inco   = Ï â²  T 1   h T 1   Q  ener  T 1   + Ï â²  T 2   h T 2   Q ener  T 2   + Ï â²  T 3   h T 3   Q ener  T 3   + Ï â²  T 4   h T 4   Q ener  T 4       where Ï â²  T 1     to Ï â²  T 4     are the price of unit quantity of bioenergy products of four BTs (CNY/MJ). The net economic impact, namely net profit (ECO ) is expressed as:(15) ECO = ECO  inco   - ECO  proc   - ECO  oper        (4) Energy, environmental, economic and social impacts  Bioenergy production also contributes to the social impacts such as new employment created, and new income of farmers; economic impacts such as value added of bioenergy industry. For a unified calculation of all EEES impacts, we obtain the coefficient for each type of impact corresponding to each BT in terms of 1Â t -ARs (b j  i   ). Therefore, a type of EEES impact (IMP  j   ) can be obtained combined with Q ener  Ti    . For example, in terms of new employment created, b j  i    denotes the new employment contributed by a BT corresponding to 1Â t -ARs.(16) IMP  j  = â i = 1  4  b j  i  Q ener  Ti         2.5 Linking impacts of bioenergy production utilizing ARs to SDGs The four dimensions of impacts are combined to the sub-goals of SDGs to quantify the sustainability contributions and trade-offs. Fig. 2   shows the SDGs and their sub-goals associated with bioenergy production through the indicators of the EEES impacts, with more details provided in Table S3 . We introduce a traceable quantitative approach to linking the indicators to SDGs, which derives from the original definitions of SDGs. The contribution to each SDG is addressed through several indicators that cover one or two aspects related to a sub-goal. For example, one of the indicators of social impacts âNew income of farmersâ is associated with SDG1.2.1 âProportion of population living below the national poverty lineâ, and linked to SDG1.2 âBy 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitionsâ, and thus finally linked to SDG1. In a similar way, all the 17 EEES indicators can be linked to 13 out of 17 SDGs. Each indicator is normalized, and the number of indicators associated with the sub-goals under the corresponding SDG is identified. The mean value of indicators under each SDG is taken, ranging within 0â100 [49] . The individual indicators are only associated with several sub-goals under an SDG, and thus cannot represent the overall impact on this SDG. The mean value of indicators is weighted under this SDG (1 V   ) and under the top target of sustainable development (1 W   ). Following the SDG Index and Dashboards Reports [50] , there is no consensus among different epistemic communities on assigning higher weights to certain SDGs. We therefore follow the existing research on SDGs [49,51,52]  and select a fixed and equal weight to every SDG to reflect the commitment of policymakers to treat all SDGs equally.(17) Z r  = X r  Max ( X r  )   Ã 100     (18) Z r  = Min ( X r  )  X r   Ã 100     (19) S w  = â k  Z k  w   K  Ã 1 V  Ã 1 W      (20) S SDG   = â w  S w      where Z r    is the normalized value of indicator r ; X r    represents an indicator of the energy, environmental, economic or social impacts. If the indicator is positive, Eq. (17) is applied, and if the indicator is negative, Eq. (18) is applied. S w    is the score under SDG w ; Z k  w    is an indicator under SDG w ; K  is the number of indicators under SDG w ; V  is total number of sub-goals under SDG w ; W  is the number of SDGs associated with bioenergy production (W Â =Â 13); S SDG     is the total score on sustainability contributions of bioenergy production utilizing ARs for a regions.   3 Data and scenarios 3.1 Data sources This study takes the 31 provincial regions in China as the study considering distinct levels of crop yield and ARs potential, for providing local government with more practical and pertinent references. The period 2020â2030 is the study period considering potential large scale bioenergy production in the context of pursuing earlier carbon peaking in China. The data on crop yields and the influence factors are obtained from the Provincial Statistical Yearbooks [53]  and China Rural Statistical Yearbooks [54] . Considering data availability, the time range for principal component analysis and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is 2003â2019 (T Â =Â 17). The data on ARs-grain ratios and ARs collection coefficients, and the information about the âresource-islandâ supply mode for the collection and transportation of ARs are provided in Table S1, S4-S6 . The basic life cycle inputs and outputs of bioenergy production utilizing ARs are presented in Table S7 . The data required for the quantification the life cycle EEES impacts for each BT are obtained from previous studies combined with the field survey on the pilot bioenergy projects (details provided in Table S7-S11 ). Specifically, some of the data for the quantification of the mitigated environmental impact potentials are obtained from the SimaPro software (Eq. (12) (13)) [55] .  3.2 Scenario setting The collected ARs are used for a wide range of purposes, including fertilizer, industrial feedstock, feed, base materials for fungus, and energy. The portions currently used for energy purpose and discarded by farmers are focused on in this work, without compromising the use for other purposes, especially straw turnover. Three scenarios are established, namely business as usual (BAU) scenario, moderate scenario, and complete scenario. The BAU scenario is set under the current proportion of ARs for bioenergy production in each region. The differences in agricultural development and relevant socioeconomic factors lead to disparities in the QRBP and suitability for bioenergy development among regions [56] . The moderate scenario is thereby set, in which different levels of ARs available for bioenergy production are set for regions. In order to highlight the complete potential of regions for bioenergy production, a âcomplete scenarioâ is set, in which all ARs available for bioenergy production are assumed to be completely used. The details for scenario setting are provided in Table S12-S13 . QRBP coupled with ARs distribution among BTs determines the multipath development of bioenergy production. Herein, we assume the ARs distribution proportions as 50Â %, 30Â %, 10Â % and 10Â % for BT1 to BT4 according to the national average state and as constant annually. A univariate analysis of ARs distribution for each BT is conducted to examine the uncertainties of the EEES impacts.   4 Results 4.1 Quantity of ARs for bioenergy production The collectable quantity of ARs will increase from 705.33 Mt in 2020 to 869.88 Mt in 2030. Fig. 3   shows the spatial disparity in QRBP in 2020 and 2030 in three scenarios. Regions with larger collectable quantity are distributed mainly in the Northeast and North, such as Heilongjiang, Shandong and Henan. The potential for these three regions will account for 31.4Â % of the national total by 2030. The potential for Beijing, Shanghai, Tibet and Qinghai is much smaller. The proportion of ARs available for bioenergy production (âbioenergy proportion for ARsâ for short in the following text) and the collectable quantity collectively determine the QRBP of regions. The proportions of ARs for other purposes, and the suitability for bioenergy development affect the bioenergy proportion for ARs. At the national level, the QRBP in 2030 will be 98.07 Mt, 188.47 Mt and 272.08 Mt, with its proportion in total collectable quantity as 11.3Â %, 21.7Â % and 31.3Â %, respectively in three scenarios. The moderate scenario reflects a prospect for regions with greater possibility, rationality and applicability, where the QRBP in Heilongjiang, Henan and Jilin ranks top three.  4.2 Impacts of bioenergy production utilizing ARs 4.2.1 Energy impacts The energy impacts of bioenergy production originate from total bioenergy production and energy consumption during feedstock procurement and project operation. As illustrated in Fig. 4  , In the BAU scenario, total net energy output will increase from 0.55 billion GJ in 2020 to 0.67 billion GJ in 2030. In the rest scenarios, total net energy output can be 1.29 billion GJ and 1.86 billion GJ by 2030. The proportions of bioenergy production for four BTs are 23.1Â %, 60.0Â %, 9.2Â % and 7.7Â %, respectively. The proportion of net energy output in total bioenergy production for BT2 can be as high as 97.6Â %, followed by that for BT3 (92.4Â %), BT2 (86.3Â %) and BT4 (78.5Â %). The ARs-abundant regions consistently have larger net energy output, like Heilongjiang, Henan and Jilin, where it accounts for 20.1Â %, 9.1Â % and 8.8Â % in the national total, respectively.  4.2.2 Environmental impacts The environmental impacts in three processes of the life cycle of bioenergy production are presented in Fig. 5  . A positive value represents mitigation effect and a negative value represents intensification effect on an impact category. The intensification effects appear to two of 13 impact categories, including Freshwater eutrophication  and Marine eutrophication  (see Fig. 5 (a)). For these two impact categories, the adverse effects derive from water pollutant discharges during project operation, for which there are no corresponding avoided discharges. For other impact categories, the avoided emissions offset the emissions during the life cycle, which contributes to considerable mitigation effects. The most remarkable mitigation effect appears to Particulate matter formation , followed by Ozone formation human health , Photochemical oxidant formation  and Fossil depletion . Project operation is in the leading position in inducing the negative impacts in the life cycle, whose contribution share is larger than 80Â % for all impact categories. The consumption of auxiliary materials and fossil fuels is responsible the emissions/discharges during project operation. The intensification effects on Freshwater eutrophication  and Marine eutrophication  are caused by total nitrogen, total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen discharged during project operation of BT3 and BT4, with no corresponding avoided discharges. BT1, BT2 and BT3 all induce intensification effects on the toxicity-related impacts due to HC emissions (see Fig. 5 (b)). However, the intensification effects are less significant than the mitigation effects contributed by BT4 attributed to the avoided emissions of HC through substitution of gasoline with bioethanol. All BTs have mitigation effects on the rest impact categories, with only that of BT4 on Terrestrial acidification  as an exception. Seen overall, the contribution shares of four BTs in total normalized environmental impacts are 43.8Â %, 39.7Â %, 9.5Â % and 7.0Â %, respectively. Such shares differ greatly across impact categories. Typically, the shares for global warming are 50.4Â %, 40.0Â %, 4.2Â % and 5.4Â %, while are 23.0Â %, 60.8Â %, 8.5Â % and 7.7Â % for fossil depletion. The high contribution shares of BT1 and BT2 are attributed to larger ARs distribution proportions and larger emission factors of substituted fossil energy (i.e. traditional power and coal).  4.2.3 Socioeconomic impacts The cost of bioenergy production consists of procurement cost and operation cost, with the two accounting for around 65Â % and 35Â %, respectively. This implies the critical role of feedstock procurement in the net profit. As depicted in Fig. 6  (a-d), total net profit will increase from 9.4 billion CNY in 2020 to 11.6 billion CNY by 2030 in the BAU scenario, which can be as high as 32.1 billion CNY by 2030 in the complete scenario. Four BTs contribute 29.2Â %, 54.2Â %, 3.1Â % and 13.5Â %, respectively, which is determined by the profit rate and ARs distribution for BTs. The profit rate of BT2 is as high as 39.1Â %, followed by that of BT3 (14.5Â %), BT3 (13.2Â %) and BT4 (10.7Â %). Due to less requirement of BT3 for external energy, auxiliary materials, equipment maintenance, labor, etc. for its smaller scale compared with other BTs, the share of operation cost in its total cost is much smaller. This contributes to much larger share of procurement cost for BT3 (see Fig. 6 (e)). The results of other impacts, including new employment created, value added of bioenergy industry, new income of farmers are provided in Table S14 .   4.3 Sustainability contributions and trade-offs of bioenergy production utilizing ARs To explore the comprehensive performance of bioenergy production on regional sustainability as accurately and exhaustively as possible, we quantify regionsâ score on each SDG to enable trans -regional comparisons, as plotted in Fig. 7  . A region with larger values of the indicators on positive impacts, and with smaller values of the indicators on negative impacts has a higher score. A larger QRBP would induce greater negative impacts on certain SDGs, vice versa. These negative impacts derive mainly from the intensification effects on Freshwater eutrophication  and Marine eutrophication , which thus have trade-off effects on SDG6 and SDG14. The ranking of regions on sustainability score does not exactly match that on QRBP, even showing considerable divergence. For example, despite falling behind in terms of QRBP, Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin have substantially improved rankings. For regions with abundant ARs, such as Heilongjiang, Jilin and Henan, the negative impacts on SDG6 and SDG14 do not affect the ranking because the positive impacts are too enormous to be offset by the trade-offs. Moreover, it can be noted that the ranking fluctuations for regions between 2020 and 2030 are dramatic, which is induced by the increase in QRBP from 2020 to 2030. It can be manifested that the sustainability score closely depends on QRBP, without strictly paralleling it. The highest score appears to Heilongjiang and far exceeds that of other regions. Heilongjiang has higher scores on SDG1, SDG7 and SDG13, and lower scores on SDG6 and SDG14. The impacts associated with SDG1, SDG7 and SDG13 are all positive, while SDG6 and SDG14 relate to the intensification effects on the eutrophication-related impacts. The case of Beijing better demonstrates the trade-offs between bioenergy production and SDGs. Beijing has the smallest QRBP and thus lesser negative impacts on SDG6 and SDG14, which results in relatively higher scores on these SDGs. Beijing surpasses many regions that have larger QRBP, ranking the middle among all regions. Regions with low to medium level of QRBP have neither the advantages of the ARs-abundant regions in enormous positive impacts on SDGs, nor the advantages of the ARs-deficient regions in least significant negative impacts on SDGs. This leads to the rankings of, for example, Tibet, Tianjin and Ningxia at the bottom.  4.4 Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis We run a sensitivity analysis using Crystal Ball software, which calculates sensitivity by calculating rank correlation coefficients. All parameters are tested, including the coefficients for crop yield estimation and life cycle EEES parameters for the BTs, to extract the critical parameters most influential to the EEES impacts and regional total score on SDGs. Considering the similarity of the sensitivity of regional results to parameters, we focus on Anhui as an example, with the results presented in Table S17 . The extracted parameters in the BAU scenario are the bioenergy proportion for ARs, the coefficients for crop yield estimation, and the ARs-grain ratios of crops with larger yield. In the moderate scenario, besides the aforementioned three groups of factors, the suitability for bioenergy development is additionally concerned. The complete scenario just involves the bioenergy proportion for ARs. The bioenergy proportion for ARs is the critical parameter in each scenario, which demonstrates the foremost role of QRBP in determining the EEES impacts of bioenergy production utilizing ARs, as well as the sustainability contributions. The coefficients for crop yield estimation, the ARs-grain ratios of crops with larger yield, as well as the newly introduced suitability factors for bioenergy development all indirectly affect QRBP. AÂ Â±Â 20% range is set for the critical parameters (as in Table S7-S11 ) to examine the uncertainties of the EEES impacts. The uncertainty ranges corresponding to 1Â t -ARs are displayed in Fig. 8  (a-e), resorting to the Monte Carlo method. The uncertainties of various parameters makes the results of various impacts appear with a varying range of error mostly around 30Â %. In this study, the ARs distribution proportions for four BTs are set constant annually, which would trigger large uncertainties to the results. We univariately set the distribution proportions, as 100Â % for one BT and 0Â % for the rest ones, to detect the uncertainties caused by ARs distribution among BTs. As delineated in Fig. 8 (f), BT2 outperforms all other BTs on all environmental impacts except ozone formation human health, which BT3 performs best on. BT4 proves to be the most egregious on all environmental impacts except the toxicity-related ones. In contrast, the socioeconomic impacts, including new employment created, value added of bioenergy industry, and new income of farmers, of BT4 are at the top of the list, and this state inevitably leads to sustainability trade-offs. BT2 demonstrates its advantage in different environmental impacts, either positive or negative. The significantly higher energy conversion efficiency than other BTs allows to substitute more fossil energy and thereby contributes to larger positive environmental impacts, such as the mitigation effects on terrestrial acidification, fossil depletion, photochemical oxidant formation and global warming.   5 Discussion When predicting ARs potential, six major influencing factors of crop yield are adopted to help forecast the aggregated quantity of a variety of crop species. Particularly, the newly designed region-specific integrated ARs-grain ratio and integrated ARs collection coefficient assist in quantifying the collectable quantity at the absence of detailed data on the yield of subdivided crop species. When the collectable quantity is given in a region, the QRBP is determined by bioenergy proportion for ARs, which is closely relevant to local utilization purposes of ARs and the suitability for bioenergy development (as considered in the moderate scenario). In order not to incur the impacts on other utilization purposes of ARs (feed, fertilizer, material, etc.), we determine the portions currently used for energy purpose and discarded by farmers as available for bioenergy production. It is noteworthy that the portion that is originally used as household fuels is included for bioenergy production. The farmers can either retain the ARs as household fuels to save money or sell the ARs to earn money and consume the bioenergy products instead. The introduction of the suitability for bioenergy development is aimed at differentiating the bioenergy proportion for ARs for regions and reflecting a relatively optimal level at which a region should mobilize ARs. The spatial disparity in QRBP in China is obvious, and the northeastern and northern regions are more advantageous in terms of feedstock abundancy. Four BTs have wide differences in the performance from EEES perspectives. The life cycle inventory analyses of four BTs covering three subsystems detail the coefficients for all dimensions of impacts in terms of 1Â t -ARs (Eq. (16), Table S7-S11 ), which is defined as âimpact intensityâ. In order to highlight the environmental benefits of bioenergy production, open burning avoidance and fossil energy offset are incorporated into the quantification of the mitigation effects of BTs on environmental impacts. Such consideration can be supported by studies by Michaga et al. and Nandimandalam et al. [57,58] . The impact intensities are combined with QRBP and ARs distribution proportions for four BTs to quantify the EEES impacts, with the latter as a crucial bond linking ARs and BTs. As the information of ARs distribution among BTs is highly inadequate especially for the coming decade, we assume constant proportions annually. To cover such a drawback, an uncertainty analysis is conducted by univariately setting the distribution proportion, as 100Â % for one BT and 0Â % for the rest ones, for the comparison with the original results. Given regional QRBP, a larger impact intensity and a larger ARs distribution proportion jointly facilitate to a larger contribution of a BT in the EEES impacts. BT2 is in the leading position in net energy output, and has advantage in all environmental impacts (except ozone formation human health) (largest mitigation effects on 11 impact categories and smallest intensification effects on two impact categories among four BTs in terms of 1Â t -ARs). Although without the largest ARs distribution proportion, its advantages are outstanding among four BTs. Despite that most of the intensification effects on eutrophication-related impacts are triggered by BT4, it offsets the intensification effects on toxicity-related impacts and has the largest potentials for new employment created, value added of bioenergy industry and new income of farmers that are however compromised by the low ARs distribution proportion (Fig. 8 (f)). Analyzed from the perspective of process, the contributions of feedstock procurement, project operation and bioenergy product consumption to environmental impacts differ across impact categories, with the contribution of project operation overwhelmingly larger than others. This suggests the importance of paying attention to the detrimental impacts induced by the inputs of auxiliary materials and fossil fuels, which are traced as the sources of the sustainability trade-offs combined with the impacts induced by fuel consumption during feedstock procurement. For the economic impacts, the cost of feedstock procurement is obviously higher than that of project operation except for BT4 that has more expensive material inputs. It proves the need for optimizing the feedstock supply route to not only alleviate the impacts induced by fuel consumption during feedstock procurement but also attain better economic profits. Seen overall, a consistency lies in the EEES impacts for regions, that is, a region with larger QRBP has larger EEES impacts, with Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin at the leading position. Four dimensions of impacts either positive or negative are reflected as the sustainability contributions and trade-offs based on the identified links between the EEES impacts and SDGs. A comprehensive scoring method is applied to characterize the comprehensive performance of bioenergy production on SDGs. For positive impacts, the larger QRBP, the more significant the positive impacts, and thus the corresponding SDG score is higher than that for regions with lower QRBP (e.g. Heilongjiang on SDG1); For negative impacts, in contrast, smaller QRBP induces a higher corresponding SDG score for a region (e.g. Beijing on SDG6). The sustainability scores of regions suggest that it is not that a larger QRBP definitely implies better performance of a region on SDGs. In our empirical case, the higher scores contributed by larger positive impacts attributed to larger QRBP for, such as Heilongjiang, Henan and Jilin, can maintain the top ranking of these regions without being compromised by the negative impacts on SDG6 and SDG 14. While Beijing typically benefits from small negative impacts attributed to smaller QRBP, which leads to a notably favorable sustainability score for it in contrast to its smallest QRBP among all regions. There are some limitations in this study. First, as the data on the influencing factors of the yield of individual category of crop are unavailable, six influencing factors of total crop yield are selected to forecast total crop yield, as well as total quantity of ARs. Second, the portion of ARs used as household fuels by farmers is incorporated into the proportion for bioenergy production, without considering the willingness of farmers to sell ARs and the impacts of not retaining ARs for household use. Third, only four BTs that have wider adoption and better maturity in China, without considering those have lower penetration and the emerging ones, such as gasification and pyrolysis. Finally, restricted by the information of development prospect of BTs at regional scale, the ARs distribution proportions for four BTs are assumed constant annually based on the initial year, which would otherwise differ across regions and change annually. The above consumptions or dispositions would inevitably induce inaccuracy of the results, which is expected to be improved by better data availability in the future. Some policy implications on bioenergy production utilizing ARs to promote regional sustainability can be inspired. (1) The differences in the estimated collectable quantity of ARs by 2030 between regions are ascertained, which are related to intensity and structure of crop farming. Regions with a larger collectable quantity have larger potential not only for bioenergy production, but also for other utilization purposes. The deployment of ARs for various utilization purposes should be localized and region-specifically rational. (2) Different BTs allow wider options for bioenergy industry development, which is also beneficial for diversified regional energy demands. Regional decisions on future bioenergy industry development should be made with respect to both the EEES impacts (either positive or negative) of BTs themselves, but also ARs distribution among BTs, incorporating local demands for various energy types. (3) From process perspective, the cost of feedstock procurement and the negative environmental impacts from project operation should be ameliorated by optimizing feedstock supply route and intensifying process management of bioenergy projects. From BTs perspective, BT2 is most advantageous on net energy output and almost all environmental impacts; BT4 is most advantageous on toxicity-related impacts and all socioeconomic impacts. Technological selection for bioenergy industry development should be in alliance closely with local environmental and socioeconomic conditions. (4) The sustainability score of bioenergy production in a region does not strictly parallel its QRBP due to the sustainability trade-off effects. Regions with low to medium level of QRBP may not benefit substantially from bioenergy production in terms of sustainability contributions. Heilongjiang, Henan, Shandong, and Jilin have the best sustainability performance owing to their superior QRBP, which should be the priority when deploying bioenergy development nationally.  6 Conclusion In this study, an integrated system of bioenergy production utilizing ARs is constructed from life cycle and multi-resource-technology-output perspectives. In three scenarios of ARs availability for bioenergy production, the life cycle EEES impacts of bioenergy production in 31 Chinese provincial regions are assessed based on the integrated system, and linked to SDGs to reveal regional sustainability contributions and trade-offs within the period 2020â2030. The main findings are as follows. (1) At the national level, the QRBP in 2030 will be 98.07, 188.47 and 272.08 Mt, with its proportion in total collectable quantity as 11.3Â %, 21.7Â % and 31.3Â %, respectively in three scenarios. Heilongjiang has the most abundant ARs, followed by Henan and Jilin. (2) During 2020â2030, total net energy output will increase from 0.55 to 1.86 billion GJ; total net profit will increase from 9.4 to 32.1 billion CNY, to the largest extent. A region with larger QRBP has larger EEES impacts. (3) Attributed to open burning avoidance and fossil energy offset, there are mitigation effects on 11 out of 13 environmental impact categories, which are remarkably significant on Fine particulate matter formation , Ozone formation human health  and Photochemical oxidant formation . There are intensification effects on Freshwater eutrophication  and Marine eutrophication . (4) The cost of feedstock procurement and the negative environmental impacts from project operation are prominent. Observed solely from BTs perspective, BT2 is most advantageous on net energy output and almost all environmental impacts; BT4 is most advantageous on toxicity-related impacts and all socioeconomic impacts. (5) Regional sustainability score of bioenergy production closely depends on QRBP, without strictly aligning with it. The ARs-abundant regions benefit outstandingly from bioenergy production to enhance regional sustainability, especially on SDG1, SDG7 and SDG13. Regions with the smallest QRBP can increase the ranking on sustainability score to some extent compared with that on QRBP. The underlying factors and influencing mechanism of regional QRBP and EEES impacts deriving from bioenergy production utilizing ARs are discussed. How and to what extent multipath bioenergy production brings contributions and trade-offs to regional sustainability is revealed. The findings and policy implications can better inform policymakers in agricultural bioenergy development planning to boost regional sustainable development. The methodological system integrating life cycle EEES impacts to SDGs is also applicable to other bioenergy (e.g. livestock manure) or renewable energy (e.g. photovoltaic power generation) to explore relevant sustainability contributions and trade-offs, which provides us with expanding research directions.
