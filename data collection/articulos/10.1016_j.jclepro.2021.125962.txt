                  The research objective is to analyze how companies address their contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to manage their legitimacy. Reaching the SDGs by 2030 is considered vital for the well-being of humanity and the planet with multiple parties challenged to contribute. This requires changes in current routines, including the “business as usual” of companies, as achieving the SDGs without companies is unlikely. However, how companies address their contribution to the SDGs is unexplored. Informed by legitimacy theory, FTSE 100 reports on sustainability performance are analyzed deductively with a classification scheme, complemented by an inductive thematic analysis. Two-thirds of companies address the SDGs and legitimize their contributions by mapping the SDGs to existing activities or using them as inspiration for future activities, either for their core business or sustainability as an add-on. The resulting four legitimization strategies - conciliatory, transparency, stimulation, and transformation - largely indicate symbolic rather than substantive disclosure without changes to the “business as usual”. The paper contributes to literature and practice by developing a framework of four corporate legitimization strategies and evaluates these efforts critically. The paper concludes that at this point, while all four strategies might be suitable from a legitimacy perspective, if the aim is to achieve the SDGs by 2030, the dominantly symbolic legitimization strategies are insufficient.

While the SDGs are primarily aimed at states, the resolution by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly (2015)  calls upon companies to address their contribution to the SDGs by applying “their creativity and innovation to solving sustainable development challenges” (UN General Assembly, 2015 : 29). Due to the importance of the SDGs for the well-being of humanity and the natural environment, as well as the need for corporate support to reach them (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ), this call has been picked up by institutions, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (Williams et al., 2019 ) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as the World Wildlife Fund (Verles and Vellacott, 2018 ). These calls by various stakeholders create pressure on companies to address their contributions to the SDGs (García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ). While companies can choose to ignore the external pressure, there is a risk of losing legitimacy (Suchman, 1995 ). Since companies have often managed their legitimacy and communicated their sustainability performance in corporate reports (Castelló and Lozano, 2011 ; Deegan et al., 2002 ; Deegan, 2019 ), one possibility to respond to the external pressure is to address the SDGs as part of sustainability reporting. Research found that in particular larger companies, such as multinational enterprises (MNEs) have already started choosing this response and have begun reporting on the SDGs (Guandalini et al., 2019 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019b ; Williams et al., 2019 ). Addressing the SDGs, however, presents a challenge, as this global external policy covers a multitude of topics among its 17 goals and 169 targets and was mainly developed for states, lacking applicability for companies (Hacking, 2019 ; Kühnen et al., 2019 ; Sullivan et al., 2018 ). Despite these obstacles, a study by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD, 2018 ) found that 50% of 250 corporations interviewed claim to have realigned their strategy and objectives to the SDGs. At this point, however, research has not explored how  corporations have begun reporting on their contributions to the SDGs (Dahlmann et al., 2019 ). This article extends previous research regarding the reporting on SDGs from whether  (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ) to how  corporations report on their contributions to the SDGs. This has been identified as a research gap (Adams and Larrinaga, 2019 ; Witte and Dilyard, 2017 ) and addressed in a multitude of recent calls for papers (Avellan and Caucci, 2018 ; Ivanaj et al., 2020 ; Nonet et al., 2020 ). To answer the research question and analyze how companies report on their contributions to the SDGs , this paper first introduces the theoretical frame, legitimacy theory, which informs the analysis of SDG disclosure. In the research methods, a classification scheme for analyzing reporting on the SDGs is developed by building on previous disclosure analyses. This deductive approach is complemented by an iterative, inductive approach. The key findings show an emphasis on traditional non-financial reporting themes with some links to business operations, although with an overall low tendency of changes linked to the SDGs. A framework of four legitimization strategies for the SDGs is introduced and discussed critically concerning its potential for substantive, rather than symbolic, change. With this, the paper contributes to literature and practice through the development of a framework of four legitimization strategies and evaluates these efforts critically from the perspective of legitimacy theory.  2 Theoretical frame for analyzing corporate contributions to the SDGs While research has addressed sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting in-depth (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2020 ; Hahn and Kühnen, 2013 ; Kolk, 2003 ), the focus on the SDGs has been limited, so far (Dahlmann et al., 2019 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). However, the theoretical frames applied to analyze sustainability and CSR disclosure apply to SDG disclosure as well. Multiple theoretical viewpoints, such as institutional, including legitimacy (Deegan, 2019 ; Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ), stakeholder (Hall et al., 2015 ; Hörisch et al., 2014 ), but also agency, in particular, information asymmetry theory (García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ; Pucheta-Martínez et al., 2019 ) are suitable, as a high-quality disclosure aims at managing legitimacy, informing stakeholders and reducing information asymmetry (Ching and Gerab, 2017 ). While these theoretical frames have been linked to analyze reporting (Kuruppu et al., 2019 ; Qian et al., 2020 ), this study is informed by legitimacy theory as it presents one of the most frequently applied theories in sustainability, including social and environmental, reporting (Hahn and Kühnen, 2013 ; Vourvachis and Woodward, 2015 ). Furthermore, the analytical lens of symbolic or substantive disclosure as part of legitimacy theory is best suited to discuss the findings. 2.1 Managing legitimacy in the context of the SDGs Companies use communication with their stakeholders as a means of managing their legitimacy (Deegan, 2019 ; Suchman, 1995 ). Reporting presents a channel of one-way communication of the corporation to its stakeholders (Deegan, 2019 ). Research found that legitimacy concerns drive sustainability, including environmental and social, reporting (Deegan, 2019 ; Hahn and Kühnen, 2013 ; Patten, 1992 ). Legitimacy can be defined as “generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions” (Suchman, 1995 : 574). Legitimacy theory has long been used (Deegan, 2002 ; Deegan et al., 2002 ) and continues to be used (Deegan, 2019 ; Dumay et al., 2018 ) to explain why companies report on their social and environmental performance. The pressure for companies to contribute to the SDGs has been built up by stakeholders such as NGOs, e.g. Gold Standard (2019) , the media, e.g. Forbes (Freeland, 2019 ; Hackenberg, 2019 ) and The Guardian (Earley, 2016 ; Watson, 2015 ) and governments, e.g. United Kingdom Cabinet Office (2019)  and the German Federal Government (2019) . Furthermore, guidance by the Global Reporting Initiative and UN Global Compact (2019)  focus on the SDGs (Adams et al., 2020 ; Global Reporting Initiative, 2019 ). These expectations and pressures might turn into a threat to the legitimacy of the organization if they are not addressed (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983 ; Ivanaj et al., 2017 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ; Zucker, 1987 ). Suchman (1995)  identified a literature stream on strategic legitimacy that follows the understanding that legitimacy can be managed, in particular, legitimacy can be gained and maintained. A focus on gaining legitimacy is of particular importance for the SDGs because their introduction was rather recent. A key aspect of disclosing information is to build legitimacy (Hahn et al., 2015 ), for example through reporting (Fernandez-Feijoo et al., 2014 ), thereby creating transparency (Hahn et al., 2015 ) and decreasing information asymmetry (e.g. Akerlof, 1970 ). However, a risk of voluntary reporting disclosed by the organization is a skewed or blurred representation (Hahn and Lülfs, 2014 ). For example, Boiral (2013)  found that 90% of negative events occurring in the studied firms were not reported. This indicates that reports might present a distorted picture and highlights the necessity to assess the presented information critically.  2.2 Analytical lens for discussing SDG disclosure: Substantive or symbolic Ashforth and Gibbs (1990)  highlight that when organizations manage their legitimacy, they tend to choose from a spectrum of symbolic to substantive responses, which remains an important analytical lens thirty years later (Deegan, 2019 ). While substantive disclosure is linked to changes of the management and other processes (Adams and Frost, 2008 ; Jiang and Bansal, 2003 ; Maas et al., 2016 ), symbolic disclosure is understood as simply changing the presentation and portrayal of the organization, focusing on reputation rather than actual changes (Bebbington et al., 2008 ; Perez-Batres et al., 2012 ), which has been discussed as greenwashing (Wu et al., 2020 ). Deegan (2019)  highlights that a risk of legitimacy theory lies in the perception that it simply manipulates opinion, rather than affecting actual change in the management and performance of the company. However, the understanding that legitimacy management focuses exclusively on reputation management (Bebbington et al., 2008 ) disconnected from internal sustainability management and performance of a company, juxtaposes the relevance of the SDGs. Corporate sustainability management has linked externally reported sustainability performance to internal management efforts of the company (Maas et al., 2016 ; Schaltegger and Wagner, 2006 ; Silva et al., 2019 ). Therefore, although the focus of this research on external reports implies that internal processes are not reviewed, the analytical lens of symbolic or substantive disclosure is applicable to discuss the four developed legitimization strategies critically. For the case of the SDGs, Bebbington and Unerman (2018)  argue that the SDGs could be used to adapt internal management or to present the organization in a more favorable light, masking the lack of efforts. These two perspectives could be aligned with the two extreme sides of substantive or symbolic (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990 ; Deegan, 2019 ) SDG disclosure. While both responses, i.e. symbolic or substantive, might have the same legitimizing effect (Perez-Batres et al., 2012 ), the link to the SDGs shows the shortcomings of the symbolic response. The SDGs provide an agenda deemed necessary to reach sustainable development by 2030 (Dahlmann et al., 2019 ). This importance was picked up by multiple stakeholders and their core concern is that change from current practices and business as usual is necessary (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ; Whiteman et al., 2013 ; Williams et al., 2019 ). Previous research, e.g. Adams (2008)  as a response to Bebbington et al. (2008) , highlights the need to consider sustainability disclosure as part of the broader social, political and economic focus, e.g. the SDGs. However, symbolic disclosure is defined by a lack of actual changes and rather focusing on a new type of presentation. Symbolic disclosure, therefore, lacks the changes that are needed for reaching the SDGs. Despite calls in research (Ivanaj et al., 2020 ; Nonet et al., 2020 ; Witte and Dilyard, 2017 ) and indications in practice of corporations addressing the SDGs (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; PWC, 2015 ; WBCSD, 2018 ), an analysis of how  companies have been reporting on their contributions to the SDGs is currently missing. To answer the research question systematically, a classification scheme for analyzing deductively the reporting of companies concerning their contribution to the SDGs is developed and complemented with an iterative inductive analysis, which are introduced next.   3 Research method This paper conducts an empirical analysis, consisting of a deductive content analysis, which has long been a preferred method in disclosure analyses (Adams et al., 1998 ; Hahn and Lülfs, 2014 ; Michelon et al., 2015 ; Sassen and Azizi, 2018 ) as well as an inductive thematic analysis (Boyatzis, 1998 ; Braun et al., 2019 ; Joffe, 2012 ). First, in the deductive analysis, reports were reviewed using criteria from a classification scheme developed for this analysis. Second, in the inductive analysis, the discovery of latent patterns in the data led to the development of a framework on how companies seek to legitimize their contribution to the SDG. Although each research approach has its advantages and disadvantages (Joffe and Yardley, 2004 ), by combining both (Fereday and Muir-Cochrane, 2016 ), deductive content and inductive thematic analysis, their benefits balance the shortcomings of each. The deductive content analysis benefits from a systematic approach with clear pre-defined categories (Joffe, 2012 ), which is common in reporting research (e.g. Michelon et al., 2015 ), aimed at rigor by minimizing subjective bias, as well as objectiveness and replicability. While the critique of the content analysis is that the aggregation of data might be disconnecting the meaning from the data (Joffe and Yardley, 2004 ), this is compensated with the inductive thematic analysis, where the focus is on identifying meaningful patterns in the data (Braun et al., 2019 ). Next, the sample, the classification scheme for the deductive analysis, and inductive approach to draw meaningful insights from the data are introduced and justified. 3.1 Sample To address the identified research question on how companies report on their contribution to the SDGs, this paper reviews the current approaches of Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 companies. The focus on MNEs and large companies can be justified, as MNEs tend to be more visible and therefore more vulnerable to maintain their legitimacy. Empirical research has found that large companies, in particular MNEs in the UK (Adams et al., 1998 ; Michelon et al., 2015 ), tend to have a strong focus on sustainability disclosure (Guenther et al., 2016 ; Kolk, 2003 ), including SDG reporting (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). This analysis focuses on the most recent reports available to capture the most current snapshot, which is common in reporting (Kolk, 2008 ). Therefore, FTSE 100 reports on sustainability performance, including sustainability, corporate (social) responsibility, or integrated reports for the timeframe covering 2018 were included. For 3i, the recent report was titled 2019 but referred to the year ending March 31, 2019, thus mainly the year 2018, and was therefore used for analysis; the same logic was applied in other instances. Integrated reports were considered when companies explicitly referred to integrated reports or when the corporate website linked to their sustainability performance in the annual report (e.g. IAG, 2018 ). In the case of GlaxoSmithKline, it was unclear what constituted the sustainability (or equivalent) report, thus both referenced documents on sustainability activities were analyzed. Another company (Ferguson) referred to their publicly available CDP (2019)  report, however, for 2018, the company had not provided information to CDP (as of June 2019), thus no report was included in the analysis. For companies with online reports, e.g. Unilever (2018) , the relevant file was included. The supplementary material provides an overview of the companies and their respective reports that were included in the analysis.  3.2 Deductive coding: Classification scheme for quality of information In order to analyze the disclosure of SDG reporting systematically, a classification scheme is developed and applied. Informed by legitimacy theory, this classification scheme builds on the premise that, based on stakeholder and institutional pressure, companies engage in disclosing sustainability-related information to create transparency (García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ; Velte and Stawinoga, 2017 ) and maintain legitimacy (Amran et al., 2014 ; Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ). The classification scheme draws on the extensive academic literature on sustainability (including CSR) reporting and disclosure (Adams et al., 1998 ; Deegan et al., 2002 ; Fifka, 2013 ; Hahn and Kühnen, 2013 ; Michelon et al., 2015 ), focusing on what  is disclosed in relation to the SDGs (content ) as well as how  the information is reported (quality of information) . Therefore, the classification scheme contributes to the rigor of the research, by allowing the qualitative research to be objective and inter-subjectively verifiable, as well as preventing subjective bias. 3.2.1 Content: What is disclosed in relation to the SDGs? This category focuses on what corporations report on the SDGs. First, this content category analyzes if the SDGs are referenced in general. Second, any specific SDGs are noted, including what details are shared in connection to each SDG. This includes SDG-specific information, e.g. how companies contribute to SDG 13 on climate change. Third, references to SDG target-level are noted, e.g. SDG 12.3 on halving food waste. This highlights how detailed corporations report on the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets. The analysis also takes into account if companies provide a reason for choosing to focus on their specific set of SDGs.  3.2.2 Quality of information: How is information on contributions to the SDGs disclosed? Rather than a sole descriptive focus on what or simply how much is disclosed, which has been a prominent approach for analyzing corporate disclosure (Hahn and Kühnen, 2013 ; Michelon et al., 2015 ), the classification scheme includes an analysis of the quality of information. This provides better insights on the level of content of a specific topic, which has been recommended (Beretta and Bozzolan, 2008 ; Kannenberg and Schreck, 2019 ; Michelon et al., 2015 ). While early studies tend to focus on whether any  information is provided (e.g. Rosati and Faria, 2019a ), others use the amount or quantity  of information as an indication for the quality of disclosure (Michelon et al., 2015 ). Since approaches solely assessing the amount of information have been criticized in the disclosure literature (Beattie et al., 2004 ; Kannenberg and Schreck, 2019 ), subsequent analyses on (sustainability) disclosure have included additional criteria, beyond the amount of information (e.g. Ching et al., 2013 ; Ching et al., 2014 ; Michelon et al., 2015 ). This classification scheme builds on these criteria for quality measures by coding accuracy  (Wiseman, 1982 ) and time orientation  of information (Michelon et al., 2015 ). Table 1   provides an overview of the quality of disclosure. The accuracy of information is assessed by reviewing whether the information is qualitative or quantitative, differentiating financial and non-financial quantitative information (Beattie et al., 2004 ; Wiseman, 1982 ). Time orientation reviews if a corporation reports on the SDGs in a backward- or forward-looking manner, i.e. being past- or future-oriented (Beattie et al., 2004 ). This information is important to better understand how encompassing the approach of the corporation to reporting on the SDGs is. Time orientation shows whether corporations have set themselves objectives that they have been following or plan to follow in the future. Specific corporate goals, aiming for future change as well as communicating past progress (Maas et al., 2016 ), are relevant to understand both past performance and the future direction of the company. This is an indication of the level of commitment and implementation of SDG-related information. While this analysis focuses on a cross-sector analysis for 2018 and a longitudinal analysis is not included, even one time observations can indicate a past or future orientation because the reports can communicate the performance of previous years and/or indicate plans for the future. Linking time orientation to accuracy, i.e. qualitative or quantitative description, provides a stronger indication for the commitment to specific objectives when details on specific SDGs are provided.   3.3 Inductive thematic analysis To draw more meaningful insights from the data, reflexive thematic analysis has become a popular inductive approach (Braun et al., 2019 ; Nowell et al., 2017 ). The aim of thematic analysis “is to provide a coherent and compelling interpretation of the data, grounded in the data” (Braun et al., 2019 : 848), in particular, to uncover latent patterns. In this case, the latent patterns provide the foundation for the development of the framework from the data. Thematic analysis consists of a six-step process (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ; Braun et al., 2019 ; Nowell et al., 2017 ). The first step is the familiarization with the data and gaining an overview of the entire dataset (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ; Joffe, 2012 ). In this study, this included reviewing the different sustainability reports for references to the SDGs and noting how the companies framed their contribution to the SDGs. The first phase in this research was accompanied by reviewing the information as part of the deductive data analysis. For example, one code in the deductive analysis recorded what reasons companies provide when focusing on selected SDGs. These reasons sometimes provided insights into the way companies describe their engagement with the SDGs or even justify their contribution. The observations led to step two (Braun et al., 2019 ), identifying potential emerging features, resulting in new codes. For example, during the analysis, it became clear that the tasks of some chief officers were linked to sustainability or in some cases even the SDGs. While this was coded, it later emerged as not relevant for the analysis and was therefore neglected. However, another observation was that companies explicitly link the SDGs to their core business, while others did not make this link, leading to a new code for SDG contributions linked to the core business. For example, BP states that their “core business of delivering energy to the world contributes directly to goals 7, 8 and 13" (BP, 2018 : 70), whereas St. James’s Place (2018)  links the SDGs to their corporate responsibility, i.e. as an add-on rather than the core business. Their reported SDG contributions focus on employee volunteering, employability programs, donations to charity and the use of renewable energy. Their core business is wealth management, but the reported SDG activities are not linked to this. Thirdly, reviewing the data critically led to the exploration of potential themes for which different codes were collated (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ; Braun et al., 2019 ). These themes were more latent (Braun et al., 2019 ; Joffe, 2012 ) in the data. In terms of how  companies were engaging with the SDGs, two distinct considerations became evident. Either companies seemed to link their contribution to the SDGs to their core business or they linked them to activities, which can be considered as an “add-on” of sustainability or CSR activities outside the core business. Furthermore, companies justified their corporate contributions by either looking at existing activities and matching these to the SDGs or they used the SDGs to inspire plans for the future. While time orientation was also investigated in the deductive content analysis, the emerging focus for the thematic analysis was slightly different, as the reported information was not linked to past or future performance, but the way companies approached the SDGs and linked their activities to them was either in a forward-looking or backward-looking manner. This meant that companies either considered existing activities and mapped these to the SDGs justifying how their existing activities contributed to the SDGs or they used the SDGs to develop new ideas (e.g. projects or products) with the aim of SDG contributions. Based on these two themes in the data, an analytical matrix (Nadin and Cassell, 2012 ) was developed as an ‘organizing figure’ (Pratt, 2009 : 858) to differentiate how companies legitimize their corporate contributions to the SDGs. Along these two themes, four legitimization strategies were developed conceptually, grounded in the data. The themes, along with the four legitimization strategies, are discussed in Chapter 5 with Table 3  as the organizing figure. Fourth, the emergent themes were reviewed for each company in the sample mentioning the SDGs. This included reviewing multiple analytical categories and several individual codes as well as going back to the individual reports to determine how companies legitimized their corporate contribution to the SDGs, which was more evident in some cases. As the quote from BAE Systems shows: “this year we have reviewed how our business contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and have included this information within this report.” (BAE Systems, 2018 : 10), they link the SDGs to their existing business activities, as well as portraying an orientation on past and existing activities. Other cases included a more detailed consideration of how companies framed their contribution to the SDGs. During this analytical stage, it became clear that while all four strategies present relevant choices as a response to managing legitimacy as part of the SDGs, one legitimization strategy, the transformation strategy, received less attention than the others. Methodological research on thematic analyses recognizes that this can happen (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ). However, reviewing the two themes resulting in the development of the transformation strategy shows that they are well used in the sample. 20 companies draw on the SDG in a forward-looking manner as inspiration with 35 companies linking the SDGs to their core business rather than to add-on activities. While the combination of both manifestations of the theme (inspiration for core business activities) is less frequent, links to the academic literature highlight the validity of the transformation legitimization strategy, while highlighting that it currently presents a gap in practice. Fifth, the four manifestations of the two themes, the legitimization strategies, were defined and named (Braun and Clarke, 2006 ). To minimize subjective bias and ensure rigor, these were thoroughly discussed with external experts at multiple meetings during their development, by presenting the research at two scientific conferences as well as four research workshops with about 10–15 researchers, which is recommended for research conducted by one researcher (King, 2012 ; Nowell et al., 2017 ). Sixth, the discussion of the themes as well as the developed legitimization strategies are finalized through the selection of relevant extracts as well as linking them to the research question and literature. In this analysis, the developed framework is not only discussed with examples from the data, but the strategies are also linked to the existing literature, an approach recommended by Nowell et al. (2017) , and evaluated critically concerning their potential corporate contribution to the SDGs.   4 Findings To answer the research question, how companies report on their contributions to the SDGs, the FSTE 100 reports on their sustainability performance were analyzed systematically. Figure 1   shows that out of the 87 FTSE 100 firms providing reports on their sustainability performance, 67 report on the SDGs, confirming previous research (Rosati and Faria, 2019a , 2019b ). In total, eight out of the 67 companies reference all SDGs individually. Regarding the quality and depth of reporting, 23 only make a general reference to the SDGs, showing limited adoption. For example, Lloyd Banking Group states that they “have a role to play in supporting […the SDGs]” (Lloyds Banking Group, 2018 : 1), though which type of role remains unexplained. While 44 companies provide some type of quantitative, qualitative financial or non-financial information on the specific goal level, these often present singular instances. For example, BT Group (2019)  listed several SDGs as their contribution across the strategic focus areas of their sustainability strategy and added selected SDGs to descriptions of their activities, however, how these were connected was not elaborated. Thirteen companies mention at least one of the 169 SDG targets, although these also often present single, selected targets. Overall, most SDGs were presented without direct links to sub-targets of the SDGs. An exception presents target 12.3 to halve food waste by 2030, which has been selected by supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury, and Morrison. The findings imply that even though some links to contributions to high-level goals were drawn, in-depth links to sub-level targets have not yet been established. Even in cases with target-level information, the causal link regarding activities and contribution remains unclear. For example, RELX mentions sub-targets, e.g. SDG 16.3 (RELX, 2018 ), but does not provide information on how they aim to contribute to them. 4.1 Quality of information While two-thirds of FTSE 100 companies have identified the SDGs as a relevant reference framework, directly linked and identified measurable indicators to report corporate contributions to the SDGs are still largely missing. When comparing the quality of information as qualitative, quantitative financial and quantitative non-financial information and differentiating the time orientation (Table 2  ), the analysis shows that most information is provided as future-oriented context information by about half of the companies rather than measurable, quantitative indicators. Furthermore, even in cases where the need for measurable indicators is recognized, operationalization seems to be lacking. For example, Intertek (2018)  states “[w]e use the UN SDGs as a third party, independent framework to track our Country and Business Line progress in sustainability.” (p. 32). Intertek’s indicators, however, are largely qualitative and a clear overview for tracking SDG-specific objectives has been missing, so far. This aligns with previous research (Hák et al., 2016 ), which states that suitable indicators for measuring progress to the SDGs are needed. Table 2  indicates an interesting difference for quantitative non-financial information, where ten companies provide more future-oriented information (39) than past-oriented (29) information. A review of these ten companies shows that most of the quantitative non-financial indicators for future performance focus on planned activities, e.g. Informa states that by “2020, we’ll identify five new projects that engage our customers within a specific vertical around the SDGs and create value in helping address the goals” (Informa, 2018 : 36). While this seems to indicate that companies are using the SDGs as inspiration to develop new objectives, whether companies actually address these set goals and report on their progress, should be tracked. While Table 2  provides details on the quality of information for reporting on the SDGs in general, Figure 2   provides an overview of how each SDG was addressed. The findings indicate that a high number of companies simply reference the SDGs (category “general reference” in Fig. 2 ), e.g. stating that a certain SDG is important to them without further explanation. Some companies provided detailed information in more than one type of information category, e.g. qualitative and quantitative, which is summarized in the “mixed” category. The most-reported SDG is SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth (mentioned in 52 reports), followed by SDG 13 on climate action (50). SDG 12 on responsible production and consumption, though linked to companies, only received 45 references, so less than half of the FTSE 100 seem to perceive the necessity to explicitly report on their efforts for SDG 12 on responsible production and consumption as part of their sustainability reporting. Least referenced is SDG 2 on zero hunger. Using quantitative financial, i.e. monetary, information as an exemplary category for a more detailed review, the analysis shows a focus on investments, saved costs as well as charitable donations. The focus of SDG-related investments is on the environmental and economic aspects of sustainability, while donations to charity solely focus on the social aspect of sustainability. Donations to charity focus on SDG 1 aiming at no poverty and on SDG 10 on the reduction of inequalities. WPP (2018) , for example, highlights social benefits of £331 million in 2018 based on their pro bono work for the SDGs as part of SDG 17. For investments, the focus is on quality education (SDG 4) through investments in the workforce (WPP, 2018 ) as well as investments in the infrastructure such as energy (Aviva, 2018 ; BP, 2018 ; SSE, 2018 ) for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 9 (industry innovation and infrastructure), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and governments). Overall, the focus on investments outweighs the focus on donations to charity, indicating that the consideration of SDGs in quantitative financial, i.e. monetary terms, seems to be more relevant to business activities rather than sustainability or CSR activities as add-ons that are decoupled from the core business. The next section discusses three main findings based on the content analysis of the reports and relevance concerning legitimacy and contributions to the SDGs.  4.2 Emphasis on traditional themes of non-financial reporting SDG disclosure of FTSE 100 corporations seems to be particularly strong in areas that have a tradition of being reported as part of their non-financial performance. For example, health and safety concerns have long been relevant in operational management and subsequent reporting, especially for manufacturing companies. SDG 3 on good health and well-being is often reported with qualitative and quantitative information for the company itself, the supply chain as well as projects in communities. Similarly, the level of detail is high for SDG 13 on climate action for both qualitative and quantitative, as well as past and future information. SDG 13 is the second most frequently referenced SDG. While some companies are reporting on it without any quantification (Croda International plc, 2018 ), others provide an overview of past emissions and future emission targets (Aviva, 2018 ; Rentokil, 2018 ; Rio Tinto, 2018 ). Details on equality measures are often addressed providing goal level information. Activities regarding SDG 5, gender equality, mainly focus on women in leadership positions for both qualitative and quantitative non-financial information, such as percentages of women in leadership positions. Closely linked to SDG 5 on gender equality is SDG 10 on reducing inequalities, where companies mainly affirm their support for inclusiveness, fairness, and diversity in particular for minorities. While at first glance, this emphasis on traditional non-financial reporting indicates that companies work with the SDGs and actively connect their current activities to the SDGs, it also points to the fact that companies have not made any changes but rather benefit from their established reporting by providing a link to the SDGs. Although this makes sense from a business perspective, it indicates that companies do not draw on the SDGs to make changes, but rather map existing activities to suitable SDGs. However, companies could also use the SDGs as inspiration to initiate changes in their business operations, which is discussed next.  4.3 Links to business and operations Links to general business activities are often drawn for SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, e.g. the contribution of companies to increase employment. Companies highlight their commitment to SDG 8 either through rather standard company activities, e.g. employment and training opportunities, by committing to pay a living wage or to prevent labor abuses in the supply chain. The topics covered under SDG 9 on industry innovation and infrastructure are in particular on digitalization and innovation, which should be reliable, sustainable, and resilient. In terms of innovative reporting approaches, companies increasingly set measurable objectives using novel approaches to report on their progress, e.g. GlaxoSmithKline (2018)  claims to have “reached 102 million people through access strategies, including through tiered pricing and product donations” (p. 2). However, the way in which these 102 million people have been determined is not clear, which is also true for the methodology of other novel measurement approaches. For example, Johnson Matthey (2019)  claim that 87% of their sales contributed to the SDGs. The company seems to use subjective criteria to assess whether a product contributes to the SDG, stating that “a judgement is made” (p. 236) without the provision of criteria. While this presents the only attempt to classify the entire product portfolio concerning its contributions to the SDGs, a lack of providing criteria for replicability is a shortcoming regarding transparency. While SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production could have been considered an important topic for MNEs, the reporting under this goal includes an eclectic mix of qualitative and quantitative information. The complication might lie in the lack of specific company-level objectives in the SDG itself. The topics sorted in this category by the companies range from basic, long-standing environmental initiatives (e.g. waste and emission reduction) to more innovative approaches aiming at sector and supply chain, e.g. building a network of sustainability champions throughout their supply chain in the area of sustainability (InterContinental Hotels, 2018 ; Taylor Wimpey, 2018 ). Linking the SDGs to the business and operations might be a first indication leading to substantive changes and generating contributions to the SDGs. However, a closer look at the way these activities linking SDGs and business operations are reported, reveals rather basic activities (e.g. commitment to paying a living wage), without actual changes to the core business. Furthermore, even novel approaches, e.g. mapping the sales of products to the SDGs, show a lack of transparency and clarity in terms of the measurement approach. This lack of transparency prevents clear insights into whether these products actually contribute to the SDGs. Questions include whether negative impacts to some SDGs are considered and compensated or if simply positive contributions to selected SDGs are accounted for. Nevertheless, the novel approach provides an innovative perspective to evaluate the current status-quo of contributions to the SDGs of products and services with opportunities to adjust these to increase contributions to the SDGs in the future.  4.4 Industry trends Joint industry initiatives can facilitate and align contributions to the SDGs of companies in the same industry, e.g. how supermarket chains can contribute to reaching SDG 12.3 aimed at halving food waste. This shows that joint industry initiatives might be a suitable approach to increase awareness and reach specific SDGs by 2030. Furthermore, joint industry initiatives could be utilized by stakeholders to gain company involvement for specific SDG goals or targets. This is of particular relevance because industry initiatives or companies in the same industry targeting the same SDG do not present a trend. Except for industries with obvious SDG links, e.g. the energy sector, focusing on SDG 7, clean energy, other industries have so far not (yet) shown a mimetic behavior. For example, while some financial institutions report on their contributions based on providing financing necessary for reaching the SDGs, e.g. Barclays (2018) , others seem to put a higher emphasis on developmental, rather philanthropic efforts with partners, e.g. Lloyds Banking Group (2018) , confirming previous research (Avrampou et al., 2019 ). These different patterns, e.g. mimetic in energy-related industries with rather obvious links to the SDGs and non-mimetic in other industries, could be explained with the phase of legitimacy management, i.e. on gaining  rather than maintaining  legitimacy (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983 ; Suchman, 1995 ). Alternatively, it could also be argued that the energy sector is under stronger pressure and risk of losing its legitimacy than others . It presents an interesting angle for future research, in particular as the FTSE 100 sample only provides limited opportunities for sector comparison. At the same time, from a practice perspective, this presents a potential lever for stakeholders. By establishing joint industry initiatives, stakeholders could engage with companies in one industry to gain the support of (selected) SDGs and aim for better integration of the SDG(s) across companies in the sector.   5 Discussing legitimatization strategies for corporate contributions to the SDGs While the findings indicate that companies often report on the SDGs by simply mapping existing efforts to the SDGs, the inductive analysis uncovered two dominant themes concerning how companies draw on the SDGs to justify their contribution. MNEs focus on either past  or future  activities to link their SDG contributions to either sustainability as an add-on  or core business  activities. Along these two themes, a framework of four legitimization strategies for corporate contributions to the SDGs is conceptually developed. The four legitimization strategies, including conciliatory, transparency, stimulation, and transformation strategies, can co-exist and might be implemented in parallel. In accordance with legitimacy theory (Suchman, 1995 ), companies may choose a combination of strategies, although out of the 65 portraying a legitimization strategy, only six show this tendency. For example, while Anglo American (2018)  followed a conciliatory strategy, they were the only company recognizing “that conventional business models would have to change to a certain degree to achieve the 2030 vision of the SDGs” (Anglo American, 2018 : 17), indicating a transformation strategy. The framework in Table 3   presents four legitimization strategies for corporate contributions to the SDGs with a brief description, an evaluation of the level of contribution, and an indicative example. It should be noted that to categorize each company with regard to their legitimization strategy, each report was reviewed and several reported aspects were considered to check for suitability. After introducing and discussing each strategy, these are evaluated concerning their symbolic or substantive approach for their contribution to the SDGs. 5.1 Conciliatory strategy When companies communicate that they determine their contribution by reviewing their existing and established activities of CSR, responsibility, or sustainability add-ons that are not directly linked to their core business, this presents a conciliatory strategy. Rather than making changes to contribute to the SDGs, companies claim that their current sustainability and CSR activities (rather than their business activities) are already aligned with (selected) SDGs. Based on these already developed activities and objectives, they legitimize their contribution to the SDGs. For example, National Grid (2019)  explicitly states that they selected the SDGs based on the objectives that they already pursued as part of their non-financial activities. Similarly, Antofagasta (2018)  communicates to have used the SDGs to structure and categorize their sustainability programs and other policies, e.g. their climate change standard. The sustainability report of Diageo (2018a)  states that their program “Water of Life has reached more than 10 million people in India and in 21 countries in Africa since 2006, including 234,000 this year. It is focused on access to water, sanitation, and hygiene in line with SDG 6” (p. 47). Although it could be argued that these activities contribute to the predecessor of the SDGs, the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs themselves had not yet been developed in 2006. Thus, rather than inspiring and creating substantive change in corporations to create contributions to the SDGs, in a conciliatory legitimization strategy, companies seem to simply remap their existing efforts to the SDGs, showing that they contribute to the SDGs. However, the reason for introducing the SDGs and subsequent stakeholder pressure on firms to contribute is based on the understanding that the current conduct is not geared towards sustainable development. Rather, this approach could be understood as a reactionary strategy to satisfy stakeholder pressure (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2018 ). Thus, the strategy is considered conciliatory as it aims at pacifying stakeholders demanding potential changes. Although the way existing information is portrayed has been adapted with the aim of maintaining legitimacy, actual changes in the business are missing. While this conciliatory strategy can be useful to the company to legitimize their contribution in a symbolic way (Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ), the overall contribution to the SDGs tends to be low. The reason for this is that, if previous activities of companies were already geared towards sustainable development as outlined in the SDGs, the SDGs themselves would not have been necessary (Williams et al., 2019 ). However, at this moment, global sustainable development is not reached and, therefore, choosing the conciliatory strategy has limited potential to contribute to reaching the SDGs by 2030.  5.2 Transparency strategy A second legitimization strategy pursued by companies, is linking their existing core business activities to the SDGs. The key difference to the conciliatory strategy is that companies focus on their core business rather than just their CSR or sustainability activities as an add-on. This communicated approach creates the impression that the company makes it more transparent how existing core business activities contribute to the SDGs, thus describing a transparency legitimization strategy. Overall, most companies choose a transparency strategy to legitimize their contribution to the SDGs. In particular, by stating which SDGs have the strongest link, i.e. are most material, to their core business. For example, Reckitt Benckiser describe the SDGs as a blueprint of challenges that need to be addressed, and their businesses “identified the SDGs where they can have the greatest impact. By working to eradicate the burden of preventable disease, enhancing hygiene, improving infant and child nutrition (particularly during the first 1000 days) and helping the world live more sustainably, RB can have a positive and lasting impact” (Reckitt Benckiser, 2018 : 2). Others are rather referencing their business as usual, for example, Standard Life Aberdeen (2018) states that based on their focus on “fair work and inclusive employment” (Standard Life Aberdeen, 2018 : 6), they mainly contribute to SDG 8. This selective focus on particular SDGs, e.g. SDG 8 for Standard Life Aberdeen, and neglecting other SDGs, can either portray an issue in line with previous sustainability reporting called cherry-picking (Hahn and Lülfs, 2014 ) or an approach to identify material SDGs (Whitehead, 2017 ) with a focus on the strongest contributions. Cherry-picking in sustainability reporting holds the risk of providing only a favorable picture while neglecting the negative and thus not showing a comprehensive picture of the company, which has been dubbed SDG washing (Eccles and Karbassi, 2018 ; Nieuwenkamp, 2020 ). The approach might satisfy stakeholder pressure superficially by reporting contributions to the SDGs, reducing the risk of the company to lose its license to operate (Prno and Slocombe, 2014 ) and maintaining their legitimacy. In contrast to the criticism linked to cherry-picking, this approach to select the SDGs most relevant to the business can also present a materiality selection based on where companies see that they can have the biggest impact. The question remains on whether the SDGs that are not in focus and therefore receive no attention in the report are simply less relevant without strong impacts or if negative impacts on the areas covered by these SDGs occur. The issue of selecting SDGs as a strategic choice to focus on materiality and the strongest impact versus the accusation of cherry-picking warrants further research. Linking the SDGs to the existing core business has both benefits and shortcomings. Similar to the evaluation in the findings regarding business operations (chapter 4.3.), links to the core business indicate a higher potential for change with regard to the SDGs than focusing on sustainability and CSR as an add on. However, as companies focus on existing activities rather than the SDGs as an inspiration to change their core business, a contribution to the SDGs based on changing business as usual is not applicable. Nevertheless, links to the core business can present a first step to highlight material links to SDGs, which can initiate transformational activities, in a next step.  5.3 Stimulation strategy A different approach to the SDGs is to use them as inspiration to develop and plan activities that contribute to the SDGs. For example, companies can use the SDGs as guidance for developing their future sustainability or CSR activities. For a stimulation strategy, the SDGs are used in an inspirational way to create changes. However, in these instances, the focus is on activities that are separate from the core business. This presents a stimulation strategy as companies use the SDGs as an inspiration for determining their future sustainability objectives. In particular, many corporations report the year 2020 as the finish line for their current sustainability or CSR strategy (e.g. Croda International plc, 2018 ). Planning beyond this deadline and looking for inspiration for new sustainability objectives, corporations turn to the SDGs for guidance. Diageo (2018a)  states that they begin “looking beyond 2020, with longer-term objectives to enhance the value we create and our contribution to the SDGs for 2030.” (p. 41). In contrast, the Diageo (2018b)  sustainability addendum states that the 2020 targets were developed with the SDGs in mind. This, however, presents a contradiction, which indicates that the company has not integrated the SDGs strategically, so far. Some companies that have not provided detailed information on their sustainability efforts previously might find it easier to use the SDGs as guidance for developing future activities and indicators. Evraz (2018) , in their first sustainability report, set out several qualitative statements as their ‘input’ to the SDGs, without a timeline or further specifications. Although renewing CSR and non-core business-related sustainability strategies after 2020 presents an opportunity for companies to re-evaluate their current sustainability performance, a risk persists. Lacking the link to the core business implies that all activities and changes tend to be on the periphery of the business rather than its core, resulting in a reported contribution to the SDGs that is more symbolic than substantive.  5.4 Transformation strategy A fourth approach to how companies have used the SDGs is as an inspiration to make changes to their business. Changes with links to the core business can relate to adapted organizational practices (e.g. Narayanan and Adams, 2017 ), selected business opportunities (Gerstlberger et al., 2014 ; Schaltegger et al., 2019 ), e.g. the development of specific products aimed at contributing to the SDGs, or the entire business model (Bocken et al., 2014 ; Schaltegger et al., 2016 ; Stubbs and Cocklin, 2008 ). This range implies that the contribution to the SDGs can vary from low to high depending on the changes. At the low end of the spectrum of the transformation strategy is that companies use the SDGs to start identifying business cases, where specific products contribute to the SDGs. For example, HSBC (2019)  reports issuing two SDG bonds aimed at projects aligned with selected SDGs. While this presents necessary first steps in transforming the product portfolio, the majority of products could be lacking contributions to the SDGs or worse, continue contributing to unsustainability. Going one step further, Informa states that they collaborated with different business units to brainstorm on how to transform their business, identifying the SDGs as a lever for growth (Informa, 2018 ). As a result, they “are already seeing more and more colleagues thinking about how products and partnerships can better support their markets to solve big challenges like the SDGs” (p. 40). Furthermore, Informa is the only company showing evidence that their focus on the SDGs was supported through organizational changes, as they seem to have at least one dedicated individual focusing on the SDGs, evidenced by the job title “SDG and Impact Specialist” (Informa, 2018 : 39). A higher contribution to the SDGs can be reached by changing the core business model (e.g. Schaltegger et al., 2016 ) as part of the transformation strategy. One company (Anglo American, 2018 ) outlines the necessity to use the SDGs to transform the business model so that their core business is set up in a way that contributes to the SDGs. Despite recognizing this need, however, no company has portrayed actual changes in this regard. Although first indicative steps highlight the emergence of a transformation strategy, none have actually applied this to their business model. Rather different approaches and claims in the direction of a transformation strategy are evidenced. These, however, present first levers, e.g. personnel focusing on the SDGs, changing product and services, different management and measurement approaches, which could be adopted by others in order to create more substantive change aimed at contributing to the SDGs.   6 Critical review of legitimization strategies: Substantive or symbolic SDG disclosure Although the discussed legitimization strategies for contributions to the SDGs depict logical managerial steps to gaining and maintaining legitimacy through the provision of information as a response to external stakeholder pressure, looking back at the call on companies by the UN General Assembly (2015)  reveals their shortcomings. To reach the SDGs by 2030 requires substantive change from business as usual (Dahlmann et al., 2019 ; Williams et al., 2019 ). This study finds that the way the MNEs in the sample portray their contribution to the SDGs, indicates rather symbolic than substantive change (as described by Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990 ) in response to the external stakeholder pressure (e.g. as described in Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ) concerning the SDGs. While the focus of this research is based on the reports of companies and can thus not be tied back to what corporations manage internally, the way companies report their sustainability efforts, e.g. their contribution to the SDGs, can indicate aspirations linked to action (Christensen et al., 2013 , 2019 ). Because the different legitimization strategies indicate rather symbolic (i.e. backward-looking or without links to the core business) than substantive disclosure, they are currently largely lacking aspirations for substantive change concerning their corporate contributions to the SDGs. In particular, linking the SDGs to CSR-related and sustainability add-on activities that are separate from the core business, and by focusing on past activities points to a reframing without any effects to the management and operations (Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ; Shrivastava et al., 2013 ). This implies that the conciliatory, transparency, stimulation as well as minor changes as part of the transformation strategy are rather symbolic because the majority of companies lack indications of change aimed at contributions to the SDGs. While the transformation strategy indicates the most substantive approach affecting internal processes (Shabana and Ravlin, 2016 ) with potential future changes to the core business and organizational structure (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990 ), it is currently limited due to its wide spectrum and with predominantly low contributions. The findings show rather smaller changes (e.g. selected new products or positions in the company) than a transformation of the business model. Even with regard to future business opportunities, the response was limited with only six companies showing indications for a transformation strategy. However, the necessity of transforming business models has been discussed and outlined in the academic literature (Hall and Wagner, 2012 ; Schaltegger et al., 2012 , 2016 ), lately in particular concerning the SDGs (Kolk et al., 2017 ; Pizzi et al., 2020 ; Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). Although van Zanten and van Tulder (2018)  highlight that there is a clear business imperative for engaging the SDGs as they offer potential for new business models and additional revenue, the findings of this study indicate that it has only been implemented to a limited extent by the FTSE 100, so far. This, however, presents an opportunity for future research, as empirical research focusing on the motivation of companies to engage with the SDGs and a review of internal activities will provide more nuanced insights, as business opportunities might not necessarily be communicated externally before their implementation. Lastly, while this analysis and discussion is informed by legitimacy theory, other theoretical perspectives have not been applied to analyze the data, although their importance has been recognized in the literature review. Therefore, future research could benefit from analyzing corporate contributions to the SDGs from other theoretical perspectives, such as stakeholder theory or signaling theory, as previous analyses of sustainability reports have done before (Ching and Gerab, 2017 ; Cho et al., 2015 ; Hahn and Kühnen, 2013 ). In particular, analyzing stakeholder expectations and satisfaction concerning corporate responses to the SDGs can provide further insights into whether current levels of SDG disclosure are deemed sufficient. Furthermore, signaling theory, as a way to dissolve information asymmetry (Connelly et al., 2011 ) and create transparency (Hahn et al., 2015 ), provides a relevant angle to analyze whether the current legitimization strategies offer an approach to reduce information asymmetry regarding the MNEs response and intention concerning the SDGs.  7 Conclusion The paper contributes to the literature by critically discussing the strategies that companies choose to address their legitimacy concerning their corporate contributions to the SDGs. Most FTSE 100 companies legitimize their approach to corporate contributions to the SDGs with rather symbolic responses through conciliatory, transparency, and stimulation strategies. Using the SDGs to inspire and identify changes to the business model, as indicated by a transformation legitimization strategy has the potential to create substantive change. So far, however, the transformation strategies chosen by MNEs are linked to marginal changes to selected products. While the need for a transformation of the entire business model aiming at contributing to the SDGs has been identified, implementation is lacking. The analysis presents opportunities for practice and research. Research can use the framework to further investigate how companies with a transformation strategy draw on the SDGs to facilitate change, thereby increasing substantial contributions. Furthermore, focusing on SDG reporting but choosing a different theoretical lens, e.g. stakeholder or information asymmetry theory, or method, e.g. explorative, can provide further insights. The practice of selecting material SDGs, sometimes criticized as cherry-picking, warrants further research. In particular, whether a focus on SDGs with material links to the core business leads to higher contributions to the SDGs or whether the neglected SDGs are those with negative impacts, should be investigated. Lastly, practice can use the developed framework to reflect which legitimization strategy companies are applying. Management can use this to reflect critically upon their current legitimization strategy and potentially change their approach, while external stakeholders can constructively provide ideas for future adaptation and be more specific in their demands. The resulting changes are likely to increase contributions to the SDGs.
