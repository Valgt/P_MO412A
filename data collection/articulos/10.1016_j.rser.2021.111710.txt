                  The rapid progress in the global population and technical advances have resulted in exponential growth in the use of fossil fuels. These are not only limited in resources but also have a severe environmental impact. The accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), more specifically carbon emissions, in the environment has resulted in severe health issues and climate changes. The Paris Climate Agreement calls for restricting global warming to only 1.5 °C by 2050 relative to the pre-industrial era. This requires reducing global GHGs emissions as soon and as much as possible. Massive efforts are being put into minimizing GHG emissions, such as using renewable energy resources and/or using carbon capture technologies (CCT). In this study, different CCTs were introduced, focusing on the pre-combustion as a promising CCT approach. In this work, the role of CCT in realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was thoroughly analyzed and discussed. A total of 87 indicators were developed to measure and analyze the contribution of CCT to achieving the different SDGs. The focus given to the role of the pre-combustion CCT in achieving SDGs is being elaborated. The indicators and analysis covered the economic, environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development. It was found that CCT contributes well to all 17 SDGs, with core and substantial contributions to SDG-7 of "Affordable and clean energy", and ultimately SDG-13 of "Climate action". The developed indicators would work as a guideline for the different players to ensure that CCT is fully adhering the SDGs principles. The proposed indicators have nine main benefits, i.e., assist in the achievement of the SDGs, providing information for the decision-makers, enhance and benchmark sustainability performance, improve risk management, enhance data management and reporting practices, improve resource allocation and reduce the expenses, improve environmental performance, reduce social impact, and improve communications with stakeholder. Moreover, the different barriers facing the CCT were presented.

Center for Advanced Materials Research University of Sharjah PO Box 27272 Sharjah United Arab Emirates       The rapid progress in the global population and technical advances have resulted in exponential growth in the use of fossil fuels. These are not only limited in resources but also have a severe environmental impact. The accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), more specifically carbon emissions, in the environment has resulted in severe health issues and climate changes. The Paris Climate Agreement calls for restricting global warming to only 1.5 °C by 2050 relative to the pre-industrial era. This requires reducing global GHGs emissions as soon and as much as possible. Massive efforts are being put into minimizing GHG emissions, such as using renewable energy resources and/or using carbon capture technologies (CCT). In this study, different CCTs were introduced, focusing on the pre-combustion as a promising CCT approach. In this work, the role of CCT in realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was thoroughly analyzed and discussed. A total of 87 indicators were developed to measure and analyze the contribution of CCT to achieving the different SDGs. The focus given to the role of the pre-combustion CCT in achieving SDGs is being elaborated. The indicators and analysis covered the economic, environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development. It was found that CCT contributes well to all 17 SDGs, with core and substantial contributions to SDG-7 of "Affordable and clean energy", and ultimately SDG-13 of "Climate action". The developed indicators would work as a guideline for the different players to ensure that CCT is fully adhering the SDGs principles. The proposed indicators have nine main benefits, i.e., assist in the achievement of the SDGs, providing information for the decision-makers, enhance and benchmark sustainability performance, improve risk management, enhance data management and reporting practices, improve resource allocation and reduce the expenses, improve environmental performance, reduce social impact, and improve communications with stakeholder. Moreover, the different barriers facing the CCT were presented.   Keywords Carbon capture  Pre-combustion  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Barriers  Circular economy  Climate change    1 Introduction Global carbon emissions from fossil commodities have increased by 2.7% annually over the last decade, and are currently 60% higher than 1990 levels, the Kyoto Protocol's reference year [1 ,2 ]. CO2  levels, on the other hand, are required to be cut by at least half to save global surface temperatures from rising by more than 2 °C by 2050 [3 ]. Carbon capture (CC), followed by storage or utilization (CCS or CCU) are only two of the several solutions being explored around the planet to further accomplish this aim of combating climate change [4–6 ]. Meanwhile, CCS is also one of the promising technologies that could assist in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [7–9 ]. CCS poses a host of technological and economic challenges that must be addressed for its wide implementation. One of the most significant economic barriers is the high cost, hence making it unprofitable, as it necessitates a significant capital expenditure [10 ]. Technically, CO2  leakage rates from geological formations are unknown. Additionally, in some countries, CCS might not be feasible, as such formations have low storage capacity or are inaccessible, resulting in higher shipping and injection costs, as in the case of the United Kingdom UK, Norway, Singapore, Brazil, and India [10 ,11 ]. CCU is a similar alternative that has increasingly gained traction across the globe because it can convert emitted CO2  into useful chemicals and fuels, while still helping to mitigate climate change. CCU has the benefit over CCS in that CO2  is used as feedstock and is typically a lucrative operation when goods may be exported [10 ]. CO2  also has the advantages of being a “renewable” feedstock and non-toxic when compared to traditional petrochemical feedstocks, despite being of low quality [12 ]. Even though CO2  conversion to different materials is energy-intensive, the prospect of ensuring a reliable supply of fuels and chemicals can be a powerful driver for CCU [10 ,12 ]. Nonetheless, existing global chemical production is inadequate to sequester carbon emissions enough to contribute substantially to achieving carbon mitigation goals. Furthermore, CCU often delays rather than eliminates CO2  pollution over the lengthy timescales needed to combat climate change. Other mitigation considerations, such as environmental risks, must be addressed in addition to the above factors before the implementation of CCS/CCU. This is vital to ensure that the mitigation of climate change does result in any other environmental concerns. It's also important to measure the effects throughout a life cycle to prevent moving environmental pressures from one point to another. The United Nations, in 2015, set seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs), as shown in Fig. 1  , to be achieved by 2030 in the path of achieving peace and prosperity for both human and Earth (https://sdgs.un.org/goals ). The goals are to large extent interconnected, as such, efforts toward achieving a certain goal help partially in achieving some of the other goals as well. The SDGs aims are not to only end poverty and hunger, but also to work towards saving the planet and promoting the well-being and health of individuals. The main strategy of the UN for the protection of the planet is by supporting the present and future needs of generations. The UN, with the support of 193 member states focuses on the preservation of resources for the use of future generations.The world is in a state of climatic emergency, as such, SDGs play a central role in producing clean and affordable energy for saving life on both sea and land-hence taking demonstrable actions [13 ]. CCS can be considered as an extremely reliable, secure as well as a sustainable approach for reducing the effects of global warming [14 ]. This work presents a detailed novel analysis of various CC technologies, with a focus on pre-combustion, in relation to SDGs achievement. The work describes and discusses the different carbon capture technologies (CCTs) in terms of working principle and performance, comparing different CCTs for their different advantages and disadvantages. The work then thoroughly discusses the contribution of CCT in achieving SDGs. The work is then expanded to develop a set of novel indicators relating CCT contribution toward the achievement of UN-SDGs. The developed indicators are set with the ultimate objective to ensure that all possible trade-off impacts of the pre-combustion CC-based projects with all SDGs have been reduced or even eliminated, as well as providing a set of balance between the three pillars of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental, and social. This work is opening a new opportunity to the different engineering disciplines through integrating sustainability within their project with the aim to achieve the SDGs. Furthermore, the different barriers facing the CCTs as well as the role of the CCT in circular economy and related SDGs were elaborated.  2 Carbon capture technologies: an outlook Several commercially accessible and commonly used technologies for capturing CO2  from a gaseous mixture already exist today, usually as a purification stage in many industrial activities, mostly in oil and gas processing [15 ,16 ]. The process selection is usually based on the chemical and physical conditions of the gaseous stream being processed (flowrate, pressure, temperature, CO2  concentration, impurities present,..etc.). CC processes have been widely used to remove CO2  in natural gas processing, hydrogen and ammonia production, and many other industrial processes. However, captured carbon is commonly emitted into the atmosphere, or less often utilized for the production of chemicals as in the case of urea, i.e., reacting CO2  with ammonia to produce urea [17 ]. Fig. 2   shows the different CCS and CCU options from carbon source to carbon sink. Carbon emissions have also been partially retrieved from flue gases emitted by coal- or natural gas-fired power plants. The CO2  is captured and marketed as a product to local businesses, including food processing facilities. Even so, very little volumes of CO2  are required to produce such consumer goods around the planet, and almost all of them are easily released into the environment (as in the case of carbonated drinks). Since the majority of anthropogenic CO2  is generated in the flue gas from fossil fuel combustion, CCTs, as shown in Fig. 3  , are categorized as either post-combustion or pre-combustion [18 ,19 ]. The third approach, known as oxy-combustion or oxyfuel, does not necessitate the use of a CO2  capture system. While certain manufacturing processes use oxy-combustion, this approach is still in the early stages and is not yet viable for power plants. The main aim of CCTs is to produce a CO2  stream to be sequestered, either by storage in geological formations, CCS, or utilize CCU [19 ]. In CCS, CO2  is injected deep underground at high pressures, to then be easily transported and pumped via pipeline. 2.1 Post-combustion carbon capture As the name suggests, carbon emissions are captured from combustion flue gases. Currently, power plants produce a huge portion of the global carbon emissions [20 ,21 ]. Fig. 4   shows a typical scheme of post-combustion CC, as applied to flue gas from a power plant using the absorption process. The flue gases are mostly: nitrogen 67–77 vol%, originally present in combustion air at 79 vol%, followed by carbon dioxide 8–14 vol%, water vapor 8–20 vol%, and oxygen 2–5 vol% based on fuel type, i.e. coal or natural gas [22 ,23 ]. In addition to some impurities such as sulfur oxides SOx (depending on the sulfur impurities in the fuel), nitrogen oxides NOx (from oxidation of nitrogen present in air), and particulate matter PM (such as soot from coal). To satisfy relevant pollution control measures requirements, these species including mercury must be eliminated, to ensure an adequately clean gas stream for subsequent CO2  capture. The most efficient CCT for the flue gas of power plants in general, and pulverized coal (PC) power plants, in particular, is chemisorption by monoethanolamine (MEA) in the amine absorption process. The amine process captures normally 85–90% of the CO2  in the flue gas stream. The CO2 -rich amine is then heated to release CO2  and recycle CO2 -lean amine [24 ]. The CO2  is then compressed and piped for CCS or CCU, while the regenerated amine is recycled back. 2.1.1 Enzymatic carbon capture Chemical absorption of CO2  using amines has several advantages, including: high efficiency, cheap technology, and maturity [24 ], as shown in Fig. 4 . Despite these merits, chemical absorption using amines has been shown to not offer an appealing option for CO2  separation from flue gases on a global scale [25 ]. In addition to the CO2  emissions associated with the amines' manufacturing process, there are many disadvantages to using amines as absorption solvents, including high toxicity, corrosiveness, degradability, and volatility [26 ], as well as the significant energy expenditure needed to regenerate the solvent and recover the CO2  [25 ]. The addition of enzymes or other catalysts may help to mitigate this impact by increasing the rate at which the reaction occurs [27 ]. One of the CCT is enzyme-enhanced CCS, namely the use of carbonic anhydrase (CA). Enzymes are advantageous in such processes because they speed up the reaction rate, which is particularly important for bicarbonate-forming solvents [28–31 ]. The enzyme CA is responsible for the hydration of CO2  into bicarbonate (Reaction 1).(1) C O 2  +  H 2  O  ↔ H C O 3 −  +  H +       CA-promoted aqueous solvents exhibit substantial increases in CO2  absorption rate, as these enzymes catalyze the rate-limiting step, which is CO2  hydration [32–35 ]. There are several CO2  capture industrial operations that use CA to activate a number of solvents. Free enzyme When Na2 CO3  solutions are boosted with 0.5 mg/mL of CA, the absorption rate of the solution may rise by a factor of 7.6 [36 ]. The findings of modelling studies also support the usage of this solvent, as the packing height may decrease by a factor of 12 in the case of using CA of 0.5 mg/mL, and decreased by a factor of 24 when employing CA of 1 mg/mL [37 ]. The previously mentioned examples only examined free CA, which is usually regarded as the top limit when immobilization is taken into consideration. Gladis et al. [38 ] investigated the effect of CA addition on CO2  absorption in a wetted wall column. Results demonstrated that the CA significantly improved the CO2  absorption in case of MEDA “N -methyl-diethanolamine” and K2 CO3 , while CA had a moderate effect and no effect with AMP “2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol” and MEA “monoethanolamine”, respectively. The authors showed that the concentration of the CA and the operating temperature depend on the type and concentration of the solvent. In order to get an enhancement factor that is as similarly feasible to the one achieved with a free enzyme, the method by which the three phases flue gas, solvent, and solid catalyst are brought into contact is very important. In the following sections, we will discuss the various configurations for post-combustion CO2 collection, based on immobilized CA increased absorption.  2.1.2 Static device; packed-columns, scrubbers and bubble columns As the flue gas and solvent are circulated through a packed column, a high surface packing material is used to bring the two phases, the flue gas and the solvent, into contact (Fig. 4 ). The packing's primary aim is to maintain excellent contact between the two phases, while preventing phase coalescence. Column packing may be utilized as a CA carrier for bioaccelerated CO2  absorption in a variety of applications. Several studies have been carried to investigate CO2  absorption using CA immobilized on washcoat [39 ], in the form of beads [40 ,41 ], on the surface of steel matrix [42 ], or polyurethane foam materials [43 ]. In general, the immobilization of the CA resulted in significant decrease of the CA loading. However, lower CO2  absorption capacity was observed compared to the free enzyme. The examples above demonstrate that in order to fully exploit the catalytic potential of CA, i.e., to achieve an enhancement factor comparable to that of free enzyme, it is necessary to reduce the mass transfer resistance associated with CO2  transport from interface to enzyme active site to an acceptable level. Instead of immobilizing the enzyme in/on the packing material, it is possible to immobilize it in/on flowable microparticles that create a slurry in order to enhance mass transfer and fully utilize the catalytic potential of CA [44–47 ].  2.1.3 Dynamic devices A more sophisticated bioreactor design was suggested, which is based on the idea of process fluid dynamic intensification [48 ]. The use of devices such as rotating bed or rotating disc reactors, which have a high rotational speed, result in better phase dispersion and a thinner liquid film thickness as opposed to conventional devices. As a result, significant gains in mass transfer are achieved, while the size of this equipment is reduced when compared to traditional columns. When it comes to improving the resistance to enzyme deactivation under mechanical loads and moving gas–liquid interfaces, immobilizing enzymes may be a useful option [49 ,50 ].  2.1.4 Gas liquid membrane contactors Essentially, a gas-liquid membrane contactor is a porous membrane that is sandwiched between the gas and liquid phases. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional packed columns in terms of gas/liquid flow flexibility, compactness, and ease of scale-up [51 ], membrane contactors have been suggested as an alternative to conventional packed columns [52–60 ].  2.1.5 Challanges facing the enzymatic CCT Enzymes are “fragile” molecules that can only function under a certain set of circumstances (temperature, pH and ionic strength). As a result of their tiny size (the average CA particle size is 5 × 4x4 nm3  [61 ]), they are difficult to collect and recycle [62 ,63 ]. CA would be dissolved in the solvent in the case of CO2  capture through absorption. Due to the high temperatures needed in the stripper, in the event of thermal desorption of CO2 , the enzyme may be rendered inactive. It is possible that high ionic strength and pH, which occur when the saturated solvent is delivered to a crystallization unit, may result in enzyme deactivation if CO2  is retrieved in the form of carbonate/bicarbonate crystals. It is as a result of this that enzymes immobilized in industry are very common [64 ,65 ]. There are many immobilisation methods available, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages [28 ,66 ]. The thermal stability of the enzymes (during stripping process) is another issue that challenges the application of enzymatic CC. Gundersen et al. [67 ] proposed ultrafiltration membrane as a promising method for decreasing the deactivation of the enzymes during long term operation. Also, CA derived from thermophilic organisms is especially intriguing, due to its resilience to high temperatures [68 ,69 ].   2.2 Oxy-fuel carbon capture technologies In oxy-combustion CCT, oxygen O2  is used, instead of air, for combustion. This removes a significant portion of nitrogen N2  present in conventional flue gas, i.e., 67–77 vol %, making it mostly CO2 , H2 O, and O2 , and some other impurities which are removed [70 ]. Cooling and compressing the flue gas is then the easiest way to remove water vapor, leaving almost pure CO2  for CCS/CCU, as seen in Fig. 5  . The main benefit of oxyfuel is that it eliminates the need for a complex CC process, however, an air separation unit (ASU) is needed to provide O2 , and present the main cost component of oxyfuel CCT. However, flue gas temperature is much higher in the case of oxyfuel, allowing partial recycling of flue gas stream for heat recovery, hence higher energy efficiency.  2.3 Pre-combustion In pre-combustion, the fuel is partially combusted producing CO2 /CO and H2 , i.e., partial oxidation, as in syngas production (mixture of CO and H2 ). Later, H2  is separated from CO2  by physical or chemical means and used as fuel with an ultimate combustion product of water. Fig. 6   illustrates the scheme of a pre-combustion CCT utilizing pressure swing absorption and stripping. While pre-combustion CCT is very effective for mitigating pollution, the total cost of the plant is usually higher, with reduced overall performance. Chemical and physical absorbents are the two types of absorbents that are widely used for CC. Chemical absorbents react with CO2  forming products, as in the case of carbonate/bicarbonate, and hydroxide solutions, thereby highly stabilizing CO2  [71 ]. However, this is associated with energy requirements for regeneration, which raises the plant capital expenditure. Physical solvents absorb CO2  favorably at high pressures and low temperatures [72 ,73 ]. Many aqueous solutions, including polypropylene carbonate [74 ], methanol (Rectisol) [75 ], dimethyl ether polyethylene glycol DMEPEG (Selexol), and N -methyl-2-pyrollidone (Purisol) [76 ,77 ], have been utilized on a commercial scale for CCT. Physical absorbents strip out the absorbed gases by pressure swing, releasing pressure, and mild heating, hence reducing the energy consumption relative to chemical absorbents, where absorbent regeneration requires higher energy for bond breakage. The CO2  solubility, or absorption affinity, and physical propoerties (density, viscosity, vapor pressure,..) of the absorbent are crucial for the proper selection of the physical absorbent. Low mass transfer, validity up to low-temperature, reactive solvents, and economic inadequacy to attain high commodity gas purity are some of the drawbacks of industrial physical solvents. Ionic liquids have been studied as a physical absorbent for CC in recent years, showing to be a promising substitute for physical absorbents, since they need lower energy for regeneration and have low vapor pressures [78 ,79 ]. The cost of a CC integrated power plant is evaluated by many factors, such as: location, utilities, and separation process. Auxiliary expenses include absorbent thermal recovery, absorbent pumping, and liquid and gas stream heating/cooling. For CO2  absorption, the Selexol process has lower strength, heating, and cooling energy duties than the Rectisol and MDEA processes [80 ]. Dave et al. achieved 90.4% CO2  absorption from syngas in a packed tower using DMEPEG [72 ]. The pre-combustion CCT power plant using Selexol solvent reduced carbon emissions by 90.9%, while net electric power was reduced by 145 MW [81 ]. Another study showed that extracting 90% of CO2  in the Selexol process resulted in a 5–7% reduction in lower heating value LHV as an indicator for the thermal efficiency [82 ]. Table 1   provides a simple comparison among the three CCTs.   3 Materials for CO2  separation Post-combustion CCT is generally a well-established process, however, it results in increasing the overall energy consumption by about 25–40% [83 ]. The post-combustion CCT generally runs at atmospheric pressure with low CO2  concentrations (<15%) and can accommodate high flue gas flowrates [84 ]. Despite the advantages of oxy-combustion, it is still an energy-intensive process, particularly for ASU. Pre-combustion CCT reduces energy consumption in high-pressure and low-temperature systems to ensure high performance. In pre-combustion CCT, the increase in overall energy consumption relative to no CCT is only 7–9.5% [85 ]. The type of process and material or reagent used to separate and capture CO2  is very crucial for the overall performance and economics of CCS [17 ,86 ,87 ]. Amine processes, in which CO2  is being absorbed by an alkaline amine solution have been the typical processes used in gas processing for the purification of natural gas. However, this process is both energy- and material-intensive. Accordingly, alternative materials must be assessed for their CO2  capture performance and energy consumption, as well as the costs associated with recovery. Table 2   provides a simple comparison for the merits and demerits of different CC process of absorption, adsorption and membrane separation. Meanwhile, the most commonly used materials in post/oxy/pre-combustion CCTs are summarized in Table 3   and consequently discussed. In this section, the new processes developed for CC are being thoroughly discussed. Computer-aided modeling has been widely utilized for the evaluation of innovative CO2  capture materials. Simulations at the atomic and molecular scales have been known for their potential to contribute to the inception of new materials, or optimization of established materials quickly and at low cost [109 ,110 ]. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for screening out materials that could be used for CC. Different models must be used to perform a DFT study of various materials, such as sorbents and oxygen carriers (OCs) [111 ,112 ]. The DFT energetic effects may be modified to particular operational conditions utilizing the atomistic thermodynamic models, or via molecular dynamic simulations [113 ,114 ]. 3.1 Oxygen carriers Chemical looping (CL) has gotten attention recently because of its low energy requirements relative to other CC techniques [115 ,116 ]. In CL, an intermediate material acts as an oxygen carrier (OC), which undergoes oxidation by air to acquire oxygen. The OC then gives off the oxygen for fuel combustion, i.e., reduced, and the cycle of reduction/oxidation (redox) keeps repeating. There are two chemical looping schemes based on the reaction characteristics. The first approach involves the indirect burning of fuels. This is accomplished by adding OC, which decreases permanent entropy during the burning phase. Metal oxides are reduced in the first reactor (the reducer) to achieve complete oxidation of the fuel as shown in Fig. 7  (a). The reduced metal oxides are then removed to the second reactor for re-oxidation by air, completing the cycle. In the second approach, two reactors are used as well, namely a carbonator and a calciner. CaO is commonly used as a carrier, which is carbonated by CO2  to CaCO3 , while CaCO3  undergoes calcination to release CO2  in the calciner, as seen in Fig. 7 (b) [116 ]. The most desirable feature of OCs is their high reaction reactivity for redox reactions. Furthermore, high oxygen capacity, along with high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability for long-term reliability under harsh operating pressure and temperature conditions are desired [117 ,118 ]. OCs should be cheap, easy to use, and environmentally friendly. Over the last few decades, various OC products have been experimentally researched and examined [119 ]. DFT has been widely used to gain insight into reaction kinetics [120 ]. In this area, DFT analysis has mainly been used to examine the reactivity of OCs in the redox phase. Fe-based [89 ,121–130 ] and Cu-based OCs [131–134 ] are commonly investigated for CL applications utilizing DFT. Although NiO-based OCs are common for CL, only a few DFT studies were present [135–137 ]. Other OCs have also been studied in CO and CH4  transformations, such as Mn3 O4  (001) [90 ] and CaSO4  [138 ]. Mixed OCs, including various metal components such as Perovskites, have received a lot of attention as well [139–141 ].  3.2 Membrane N2 /CO2 , N2 /O2 , and H2 /CO2  separation are essential for post/oxy/pre-combustion, respectively. These are the common applications of membranes in CC. Membranes serve as filters throughout the separation phase, permeating only specific components in a mixture while retaining other components, resulting in an enriched stream of the intended gas product. The membrane separation has shown tremendous promise in CCS because it does not necessitate large-scale investments. Also, unlike conventional solvent-based systems, which need a lot of heat to regenerate the solvent, this system uses much less energy, hence lower operating and capital expenditures. Membranes may also be configured to suit various separation processes based on their particular layout. The permeability, as well as selectivity of a membrane, are the most critical considerations in its architecture for CC. Selectivity is the ratio of permeabilities across different gas types, while permeability is the flux of gas permeation per unit pressure. Inorganic, organic, and organic frameworks are the most common types of membranes used for CO2  capture [142 ]. H2 -selective membranes are mostly used in the pre-combustion CCT for H2 /CO2  separation [143 ]. Because of their possible infinite H2  selectivity, metal membranes are to some degree suitable for this kind of method [144 ]. Palladium (Pd) alloys have been widely studied for hydrogen purification membranes, but the main disadvantage of Pd membranes is being susceptible to H2 -induced embrittlement and surface contamination [145 ]. Pd-alloy membranes, on the other side, can tolerate surface poisoning while preserving the attractive properties of pure Pd membranes [146 ,147 ].  3.3 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered promising adsorbents for CC applications and have been the subject of several studies. MOFs have strongly arranged crystal structures, with both metal nodes and organic linkers, that resemble the naturally occurring Zeolites, enabling them to have a broad spectrum of properties for several applications [148 ]. Because of the large variety of MOFs, due to the different metal locations and different linkers, DFT has been used for materials screening for CC applications [149–151 ]. MOFs are recognized for their large surface area and pore volume, making them excellent adsorbents [152 ]. MOFs’ physical and chemical characteristics such as pore size (tunable pore diameter and length), and functional groups, may also be customized through varying building blocks and synthesis strategies, making them highly selective adsorbents [148 ,153 ]. When it comes to material power, MOFs have a high degree of stability, for adsorbent reactivation/regeneration, while preserving the crystal structure of MOFs [154 ]. MOFs are attractive candidates for CC in post-combustion technologies [155–157 ]. Adsorption properties of CO2  selectivity, adsorption capacity, and rate are keys for finding promising CO2  adsorbents [158 ,159 ]. Borges et al. studied CC selectivity among H2 , N2 , CH4 , and CO onto MOFs, concluding MIL-160 to be promising for CO2 -selective adsorbent [160 ]. DFT studies were used to determine the adsorption function of CO2 , finding that the Zr-metal cluster performs better [161 ]. DFT simulations may also be used to evaluate the impact of impurities on the CO2  adsorption phase [162 ]. The foregoing theoretical studies include instructions for optimizing MOFs or even developing new MOFs for CC [163–167 ].  3.4 Zeolites Zeolites are porous crystallized aluminosilicates with exchangeable cations. Zeolites have been utilized for post/pre-combustion CC applications due to their structural cages, pores, and exchangeable cations. Zeolites are appealing for carbon adsorption due to their unique adsorption capacity and selectivity. Exchangeable cations, pore sizes, and the Si/Al ratio are essential parameters in zeolite selection for CO2  adsorption [168 ,169 ]. Adsorption affinity, capacity, rate, and selectivity of zeolites can be predicted using DFT as CO2  adsorbents [98 ,170–172 ].  3.5 Ionic liquids (ILs) Ionic liquids (ILs) are deemed attractive in many applications for the separation of standard volatile compounds [173 ,174 ]. ILs are ionic compounds with melting points well below 100 °C, and so are mostly liquid at ambient temperature. They have outstanding thermal resilience, strong solubility, and the potential to exchange ions, making them appealing for many industrial applications, including CC [175 ]. ILs often allow for the mixing of various ions, enabling products to be fine-tuned for even better efficiency. This means ILs can be customized for specific purposes. Because of their experimentally recorded high CC capacities and attractive chemical or physical properties, ILs have been widely explored for CC [174–176 ]. Molecular dynamic and DFT simulations could predict complex properties of ILs, including CO2  diffusivity at particular pressures and temperatures [177–179 ]. CO2  absorption also improves the viscosity and molecular mobility of ILs in heterogeneous structures [180 ,181 ]. The interactions of anions and cations of the ILs with CO2 , SO2 , and H2 S were analyzed using DFT, indicating that for weak cation-anion interactions, ILs are more likely to associate with CO2  [182–185 ].   4 Pilot- and commercial-scale carbon capture facilities 4.1 Post-combustion carbon capture Although today most CCS plants use amine processes, the early stages of CC development utilized a range of novel solvents, membranes, and sorbents. While not yet widely installed at full-scale on power plants, post-combustion CC systems were being used commercially in other industrial processes for decades, mostly for natural gas processing [186 ,187 ]. The Mitsubishi Heavy Industries KM-CDR, Fluor Econamine FG Plus, Aker Carbon Capture Just CatchTM , Lummus Kerr-McGee, HTC Purenergy Inc., and Cansolv are among the industrial amine-based processes currently in use [187 ]. Lummus systems use a 20% aqueous MEA solution, while Fluor systems use a 30% amine [187 ]. The higher amine concentrations reduces the energy consumption and equipment size, hence also reducing the capital and operating expenditure of CC. However, since amines are corrosive, higher concentrations necessitate corrosion inhibitors or costly materials of construction. The captured carbon from gas processing has been usually vented to the environment. Currently, with the deployment of CC, such carbon emissions, along with carbon captured from power plants are being sequestered in deep geological formations. The Statoil natural gas facility in Sleipner, Norway, has been in operation since 1996 and is the world's longest-running commercial CCS plant [188 ,189 ].  4.2 Pre-combustion carbon capture Two commercial-scale pre-combustion CCT facilities are currently operational. The Selexol process at the Farmlands chemical plant in Coffeyville, Kansas, US captures and separates CO2 /H2  from the gasification of petroleum coke in the IGCC power plant. More than 93% of CO2  is collected at the Coffeyville site, equivalent to about 200,000 t-CO2  annually [190 ]. The second is at the Dakota Gasification Company's Great Plains synfuels plant in ND, US. This one uses coal gasification to produce syngas. The plants use the methanol-based Rectisol process at an annual capacity of 3 mt-CO2 . Previously, CO2  was released into the atmosphere; currently, it is compressed and sent to a Canadian oil field by a 205-mile pipeline for enhanced oil recovery. While a range of full-scale projects has been revealed, no full-scale pre-combustion CC has been implemented at a power plant to date [191 ]. At the pilot scale, there are currently very few pre-combustion CC plants. Two ventures at power plants in Europe, the Elcogas's Puertollano plant in Spain and Buggenum Nuon's plant in the Netherlands, are the first implementations of CC at operational power plant facilities, though on a limited scale and treating only a portion of the syngas stream [192 ].  4.3 Life cycle assessment of carbon capture technologies A recent study looked at two coal-fired IGCC power plants, using chemical looping pre-combustion CC. In terms of performance and environmental efficiency, the two plants were assessed and compared to conventional power plants without CCS at 440–610 MWe of net electricity [193 ]. CC rates of 99.5 and 91.6% were obtained for Fe-based and Ca-based CL. The work's primary emphasis was on the environmental analyses of the three plants, which were undertaken using the life cycle assessment LCA technique. Following a “cradle-to-grave” approach, the analysis looked at 1) power generation; 2) upstream processes; and 3) downstream processes. The study involved the commissioning, operation, and decommissioning phases of the power plant. Eleven environmental impact categories were evaluated among the different power plants with and without CCS. Many of the metrics were addressed, including: global warming potential GWP, acidification potential AP, and eutrophication potential EP, as the most significant environmental effect indicators. Power plant with CC had the major environmental advantages of reduced GHG and GWP, but other environmental metrics such as AP and EP have increased significantly. The rise is attributable to the inclusion of certain upstream and downstream processes, as well as the additional material and energy utilized in the CC unit. The environmental impacts of post/pre/oxy-combustion integrated with pulverized coal-fired power generation systems at all phases of the energy generation life cycle were evaluated as well [193 ]. The three processes shared the same infrastructure borders, which involved upstream and downstream power production processes such as coal extraction, energy generation plant building, service, and decommissioning, as well as CO2  capture and compression. Pre-combustion and oxy-fuel technology were found to outperform post-combustion in many environmental impact indicators. In comparison to post-combustion CC, pre- and oxy-combustion used less fuel to generate the same electricity output. Furthermore, pre-combustion CC had the least acidification impact, while the oxyfuel CC has the least eutrophication impact.   5 Carbon capture linked sustainable development goals CC has been widely considered and specifically developed as an effective mitigation measure of climate change. However, there is a critical need to look if the effect is sustainable and for this purpose, an assessment is highly needed to look upon the possibilities for the deployment of CCS that can positively participate in the accomplishment of the UN's SDG's set by 2030. Mikunda et al. have generally discussed the CCS and their relation to the SDGs, with the main focus on their relation to SDG-13 of "Climate action" as a direct outcome, with little emphasis on other goals [194 ]. Furthermore, CCS enables provisions of decarbonization of the industry and the provision of affordable clean energy utilization, as in SDG-7 of "Affordable and clean energy" as well [195 ]. Accordingly, it is paramount to map or network the interaction among CCT and different SDGs, given that the goals have high interdependency. Additionally, a technology or a solution might act as an enabler for one goal, and as an inhibiter for another. While evaluating against SDGs, CCS indicates several benefits as CCS is a sort of “indivisible” to SDG-13 in combating climate change. The primary ‘hindering’ factor is the necessity for additional energy per unit of power delivered and the natural effects related to the utilization of some catch frameworks. None of the restraining impacts distinguished had ‘dropping’ cooperation against the SDGs canvassed in this evaluation. CCS is in this way a reasonable alternative to battle environmental change and doesn't forbid the accomplishment of some other SDG. Moreover, the Paris agreement focuses on the need for sustainable development consideration in “low transitions and emissions”. Similarly, the special report of IPC's on SR1.5 constitutes a primary assessment on the synergies and trade-offs among sustainable development and mitigating options; it also includes the use of CCS in the industrial and energy supply sectors. Furthermore, the IPCC assessment looks into insights for the interaction of CCS with SDGs. However, for the number of SDGs, it has been seen that no assessment seems feasible, as no significant public narrative could be acknowledged [196 ]. A dedicated and in-depth assessment has been done to further help to sustain and complement the research findings of IPCC. Few studies have mapped the CCS technologies against specific climate and energy DGDs, i.e. SDG-7 and SDG-13 with the aim to improve the accessibility of information relevant to the contribution and achievement of SDG's [197 ]. The main findings can be summarized as follows:o CCS has many positive impacts on SDGs; the considerable potential for CCS to decarbonize the industrial and power sectors (SDG-13: Climate action).  o For the provision of sustainable, reliable, and modern energy, CCS plays an extremely important role; it plays a significant part in the decarbonization of the industry not only with the help of direct emission reduction but also ultimately with the help of low carbon power supply (SDG-7: Affordable and clean energy).  o CCS supports inclusive and sustainable economic growth for the productive and full employment of decent work contributing to the decoupling of the financial growth from the environmental degradation, through reduction of associated carbon emission (SDG-8: Decent work and economic growth).  o CCS has the capability of “enabling the infrastructure development”; it has the ability of inclusive and sustainable industrialization, which provides a boost for the innovation system (SDG-9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure), along with reduced carbon footprint of large cities (SDG-11: Sustainable cities and communities).  o CCS helps also the “Stabilization in the acidification” of the oceans, which is enabled through reduced carbon emissions (SDG-14: Life below water).    However, as with any human-developed technologies, CCS may have some negative interactions with the SDGs. On the basis of SDG-7, meeting the clean and efficient energy targets might be constrained by the additional cost of CCS, hence constraining the affordability target within the same SDG-7. This can be further expanded to SDG-6, clean water and sanitation, availability, and many other cases. The negative impacts of CCS are related to fuel consumption and energy/emissions penalties, and might have a counterfactual impact on the achievements of some other SDGs. Correspondingly, several knowledge gaps can be identified clearly, in which the present work is an effort toward highlighting and discussing such gaps. Also, the research on the “employment aspects of CCS” in comparison with the low emission technologies needs to be perfromed as well. CCT can contribute to most of the SDGs directly and indirectly, as shown in Table 4  . However, keeping in mind that the SDGs are interrelated, Table 5   and Fig. 8   summarize the direct contributions or impacts of CCT in the achievement of SDGs, which are to be discussed in more detail.  6 The contribution of carbon capture to sustainable development Being mindful of the fact that SDGs are interconnected [198 ], and they cover the three environmental, economic, and social pillars of sustainable development, as shown in Fig. 9   [199 ]. This section discusses the contribution of CCT in sustainable development together with related SDGs. Additionally, Fig. 10   summarizes the main benefits of CCT applications to the different sustainable development pillars. 6.1 Environmental contributions The environmental benefits of CC are clear, as they avoid carbon emissions to the atmosphere, which is the main GHG, as the major mitigation measure for climate change and global warming. According to the IPCC 2014 climate change mitigation report, the total anthropogenic GHGs emissions have reached a benchmark in human history, amounting to 49 ± 4.5 GtCO2 -eq/year in 2010 at an annual growth rate of about 1.0 GtCO2 -eq/year and reaching total estimated emissions of 2,000 GtCO2 -eq throughout 1750–2010 [200 ]. The CC, due to the avoided carbon emissions in particular and GHGs emissions, in general, will have huge environmental benefits to the whole nature, more specifically to the atmosphere i.e., air and hydrosphere, i.e., water bodies [201 ,202 ]. The main contributions of CCT to the different SDGs within the environmental pillar of sustainable development are critically discussed in this section. In Table 6   contribution of CC into the environment with their related SDGs are presented (directly and indirectly), adopted from Refs. [6 ,78 ,203–205 ]. The following section will explain this contribution in detail. 6.1.1 SDG-6 Clean water and sanitation SDG-6 targets providing clean water supplies and sanitation services to people worldwide. About ⅓ the world's population is affected by water scarcity, which is expected to increase along with global warming and erratic climate change. However, since 1990, approximately 2.1 billion people have gained access to water supplies and improved sanitation. Despite this, availability of safe drinking water is a major challenge that requires everyone's attention [206 ]. The implementation of CC has been viewed as an enabling factor for the utilization of locally available fossil fuel resources, which can help to provide the energy required to drive the production of clean water using the appropriate water treatment processes. Several studies discussing the environmental impacts of CCS deployment through LCA analysis, more specifically for power plants, as a major pollution source [18 ,207–209 ]. A significant amount of water is required by fossil fuel power plants for cooling and steam generation purposes, indicated by two key metrics of water consumption and withdrawal [210 ]. Although the majority of life-cycle water in fossil-fuel power generation is related to the plant infrastructure, upstream for coal mining and extraction, and processing, the added CCS increases all of: water use, consumption and withdrawal considerably [211 ,212 ]. Furthermore, the water discharged from power plants can pose some other environmental problems, which can affect the nearby water bodies used as a source of water for water treatment facilities and for the discharge of wastewater. Accordingly, a careful study and balance sheet has to be made considering the benefits-cost analysis of CC with respect to water use.  6.1.2 SDG-12 Responsible consumption and production SDG-12 emphasizes responsible consumption and production practices, with a focus on reducing the stress on natural resources and reducing the waste streams into the environment whether it be land, water, or air. In this goal, an important characteristic is the encouragement of sustainable lifestyles and business practices. The implementation of CC in the energy sector is considered as a direct enabler for the responsible utilization of fossil fuel resources, as well as energy production. CC enables the extraction of energy from fossil fuel resources, while still avoiding severe environmental consequences related to GHG emissions being sequestrated. As such, the ultimate products from the CC-integrated power plant are energy and much lower gaseous emissions. However, this still needs to be carefully considered, as CC still has to utilize considerable energy and materials, such as sorbents and membranes, which end up in waste streams of associated material [213–216 ].  6.1.3 SDG-13 Climate action CCTs are placed in the core of SDG-13 for climate action, aiming to reducing GHG emissions considerably, but without quantitative targets for such reductions. One of the major benefits of CC is also advantageous when addressing the mitigation of climate change and global warming, which result in rising sea level and many other extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and Tsunamies [217–219 ]. Rising sea levels and other extremes are believed to result from heavily populated coastal cities, which in turn lose their habitat and properties. Technically, the capture of up to 90% of carbon emissions is feasible for post-combustion CCT iron & steel, cement, steam reforming, and ethylene oxide production processes, according to the IEA. Additionally, slightly lower capture rates are expected for oil refineries, provided that the presence of a number of distributed point sources, as well as site space restrictions for CC equipment [220 ]. Considering a number of key industrial processes, CCT further shows to be the only technology capable of achieving considerable emission reductions in the near future. Obviously for effective CCS, it is important to have sufficient geological storage capacity, with the availability of various regional storage capacity assessments conducted for China, Europe, and North America [221 ,222 ]. There are many significant efforts for communicating CCS as a part of the development of demonstration projects. Project developers have been encouraged due to the generally low awareness of the technology, meaning they can make significant investments in public outreach as well as education activities [223 ].  6.1.4 SDG-14 life below water The SDG-14 emphasizes preserving the marine environment against pollution and over-exploitation of marine resources, such as overfishing through the sustainable use of such resources, along with strict pollution control measures. This also focuses on minimizing and addressing the impacts of ocean acidification, due to the increased concentration of atmospheric CO2 . When the anthropogenic carbon emissions are increased, they are then blamed for the increasing uptake of carbon dioxide by oceans [224 ]. This in turn, causes the seawater to become much more acidic, while having a detrimental impact on marine life. CC can have substantial benefits to aquatic life and marine environment, or the hydrosphere. This is simply due to the equilibrium between the atmospheric carbon dioxide and carbonate/bicarbonate/hydrogen system in the water bodies, such as oceans and seas. The equilibrium system can be described by reactions (2–4 ), with any additional CO2  affecting the equilibrium resulting in more bicarbonate ions according to reaction (5 ) [225 ]. The increase in carbonate concentration in the marine environment can result in the precipitation, and hence the change in concentration, of some essential and vital elements in water, such as calcium, magnesium, and many elements (M) to their solid mineral state as shown in reaction (6 ). This in turn increases the acidity of water bodies, i.e., decreases the water pH, leading to ocean acidification, as well as the elimination of essential elements for the growth of different aquatic species, thereby affecting the aquatic life severely [226 ,227 ]. These impacts are to be avoided upon the implementation of CCS, by controlling the concentration of atmospheric CO2 .(2) C O 2 ( g )    + H 2  O ( l )   ↔ H 2  C O 3      (3) H 2  C O 3  ↔ H +  + H C O 3 −      (4) H C O 3 −  ↔ H +  + C O 3 2 −       (5) C O 2 ( g )    + C O 3 2 −   + H 2  O ( l )   ↔ 2 H C O 3 −      (6) M 2 +   + C O 3 2 −   + H 2  O ( l )   ↔ M C O 3 ( s )         Due to the ability to influence the net marine toxicity impact of CC on power plants, it is important to substantiate the impact of the characterization score of hydrogen fluoride reduction by using the flue gas desulphurization [220 ]. Along with the removal of sulfur dioxide, flue gas desulphurization systems remove other substances present in flue gases, such as particulate matter PM, NOx , hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen chloride, thereby reducing the Marine Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential (MAETP) [228 ,229 ]. Taking the marine environment into account, the impact of developing CO2  transport infrastructure is highly site-specific. The identification of the environmental impacts of such activity, considering the displacement of seabed material for the shallow pipeline trench, the noise produced while drilling of the carbon dioxide injection well, and additional noise as well as disturbance made by ships, which are involved in realizing the project [230 ].  6.1.5 SDG-15 life on land The SDG-15 emphasizes life on land. It mainly covers both waste reduction and sustainable management of resources. These resources include soil, wetlands, and forests. The management of resources is made to help in maintaining good biodiversity and healthy ecosystems. This goal also aims in protecting both terrestrial as well as freshwater environments, along with a heavy overlap with the SDG-6, which focuses on clean water and sanitation. There are some impacts that interact with freshwater life, these include: AP, EP, and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential, which affect life on land. These are considered to be indicators that tend to affect water discharged from either the power or industrial plant. The wider implementation of CC should enable the capture of 10 or 2.8 GtCO2 -eq/year by 2050, to limit ambient temperature rise to 1.5 or 2 °C respectively [231 ,232 ]. This huge amount was to be released into the atmosphere, which would have resulted in huge pollution and increased CO2  concentrations. Furthermore, the CC will avoid the release of a huge amount of associated pollutants in flue gas, being removed during CC. These gases include SOx , NOx , and PM, which are common in flue gas, more specifically for coal-fired power plants. The IPCC 2005 CC report indicates that CCS system should enable avoiding 342, 704, and 720, kg-CO2 /MWh for natural gas NG, pulverized coal (PC), and IGCC power plants, respectively. This will be associated with 0.29, 0.13 kg-SOx /MWh for PC and IGCC power plants respectively [231 ,233 ,234 ]. During CCS, carbon carrying stream is being processed to meet either commercial use or storage specification, as such, the removal of such impurities is considered a must. However, CC is also associated with higher water usage, both consumption and withdrawal, and wastewater which is released with the potential trace metals and toxic substances [211 ,229 ,235–237 ]. Considering this evidence, it can further be concluded that the CC has both counteracting as well as reinforcing interactions with the objectives set by SDG-15 focusing on life on land. When CC is added, this will considerably cause a reduction in the GWP. In addition to this, the water is used significantly for CC and this can impact habitats. Taking this evidence into account, CC can have both counteracting and reinforcing interactions, as such, the balance needs to be carefully considered.   6.2 Economical contributions The main challenge for expanding the CC facilities is the high investment costs. The implementation of CC is expected to add a substantial cost associated with capture, transportation, and storage. The units and processes to capture CO2  in different schemes of post/pre/oxy-combustion, material, and energy used will be at a cost [238 ,239 ]. Additionally, there will be an added cost for CO2  transportation, and storage, which increase the overall CCS cost. The estimated costs for CCS are for individual sources, technologies, and site-dependencies, meaning a very wide range of estimations are available. According to the IPCC estimations of 2002, CC costs can vary over the range of $14–71/t-CO2  avoided (CO2  avoided = CO2  emitted without CCS–CO2  emitted with CCS), including $0–5/t-CO2  for transportation and $0.6–8.3/t-CO2  for geological storage [201 ,231 ]. The US National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) gives estimations of $43–75/t-CO2  avoided, while the US Electrical Power Research Institute US-EPRI provides $39–63/t-CO2  avoided, including $10/t-CO2  avoided for transportation and storage [234 ]. Sea level rise susceptibility has been related to substantially decreased construction activities in areas with high climate change vulnerability [240 ]. The value of properties in coastal areas was found to be highly affected by extreme weather events, which mostly included losing the property itself or significantly reducing its value [241 ,242 ]. Table 7   summaries the economic contribution of CCT with the related SDGs, adopted from Refs. [18 ,194 ,243–245 ]. 6.2.1 SDG-7 Affordable and clean energy SDG-7 aims to provide affordable and clean energy. The key objective for this goal includes increased energy efficiency, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy, and expanding access to energy [246–248 ]. This goal is connected to several other goals, including good health and well-being, economic growth, and climate action. The assumptions made on the affordability of a specific power generation technology can further be informed by an assessment of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). LCOE considers capital and operating expenditures CAPEX and OPEX, investments, and discount rate. CCS increases the cost of electricity production, along with these costs, presumably passed on to the customer to the detriment of affordability [220 ]. Considering reliability with this goal, interpretation is related to power systems meeting the power demand consistently. Fossil fuel power generation is considered reliable and dependable when compared to most of the renewable energy resources currently in place, with wind and solar energy having capacity factors of only 20–40% [249 ]. Accordingly, CC tends to improve the sustainability of a reliable power supply for the long-term basis at an increased, but still competitive cost. Applying CC both has enabling and counteracting relations to this goal [249 ].  6.2.2 SDG-8 Decent work and economic growth SDG-8 is focusing on decent work and economic growth. This goal covers different elements of economic growth, resource efficiency, and improved productivity, decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation and promoting decent work. The economics of CC has been widely studied in the Stern Review [250–252 ], the Garnaut Review for the Australian Commonwealth [253 ], and the International Energy Agency IEA [254 ]. The stern review estimates an investment of about $250 bn/year to be required by 2030 to achieve the IPCC goals. This in turn, will result in an avoided loss of about 5–20% of the global product from there on out. The Garnaut Review provides CCS cost of about 0.8% of the Australian gross national product (GNP) initially, dropping later to about 0.0–0.2% by 2050. In turn, this will result in about 0.2% of the GNP starting from 2050 onwards. Similarly, the IEA provides an estimate of about $4.1 tn over 20 years, resulting in annual savings of $7 tn in fuel cost alone. The preceding discussion shows the huge investments to be put into CC worldwide and the estimated return. By 2020, there were about 65 large-scale CCS projects, with 38 in the Americas, 13 in Europe, 10 in the Asia Pacific, and 3 in the Middle East with a total capacity of 40 mt-CO2 /year [255 ]. This capacity is expected to increase up to 5,635 mt-CO2 /year from about 2,000 CCS facilities by 2050 [256 ]. This huge investment and increased number of facilities would result in more economic developments and expansion in existing power plants and industrial sites to accommodate for CCS facilities, as well as the construction of stand-alone facilities. Furthermore, investments in fossil resources can witness an increase given the overcome of the main challenges to expand utilization of these resources, i.e., carbon emissions, hence higher economic growth may be enabled. There is very little literature that covers the economic impacts of the deployment of CC and this further limits evidence-based conclusions. Considering CC applications, there is no such particular evidence that has been identified related to the potential economic impacts [257 ]. Generally, the consensus on the relationship possessed by energy costs and economic growth is that when the energy costs go high, economic growth is inhibited [258 ]. For this reason, having CC available is considered an option that should be positive for economic growth, although it may result in having all important decarbonization options available for cost-optimized selection in comparison to any intrinsic characteristic of CC itself. Considering the CC application in industries, it can be said that there is no such evidence that has been identified, which explains explicitly the impact on economic growth. When the capture technology is applied to industrial sites, then it would represent a substantial investment that can be partially waved by energy and emission incentives. Nevertheless, there are many energy-intensive products (such as cement, steel) for which there are no substitutes available for many applications. Therefore, it becomes much simpler to predict how the increase in CC–driven cost would influence demand for the products [259 ]. Additionally, resource efficiency, such as economic productivity is much likely to be affected positively by the energy price reduction which is incurred by CC. Improving the resource efficiency in the energy sector would require the production of useable final energy products from a specific raw materials input [259 ,260 ].  6.2.3 SDG-9 Industry, innovation, and infrastructure The SDG-9 mainly targets sustainable infrastructure development, upgrades in industry, sustainable industrialization, and also, research and innovation which seem much likely to the CC. Economic sustainability is distinct from environmental sustainability. This refers to if an economic activity can be continued over the long term or not. In relation to CC, the question of finite resources and the concept of lock-in becomes relevant potentially. The goal has some other targets, which emphasize raising the share of employment and growth domestic product (GDP). Some studies are made on the economic impacts of CCS. These studies observe a clear difference in the impact between sectors, but their support to increase the industry share is shown [261 ]. One of the more interesting benefits of CC is in the technology innovation and associated research & development (R&D) activities. Given the technical and economical challenges associated with CC and the crucial need for the innovative processes of high efficiency and low cost, many innovative technologies, processes, and materials are expected to be developed. These innovative solutions might find further applications in many other fields, hence provide additional economic benefits and returns.  6.2.4 SDG-11 Sustainable cities and communities SDG-11 targets cover a large number of core issues that are relevant to cities and communities and this further includes disaster resilience, access to safe and affordable basic services, quality of life issues, and environmental impact. To consider the environmental impact of a city, it is important to include the LCA of these inputs. CC has both positive and negative environmental implications. The most tangible outcome of CC is to reduce GHG emissions by 60–80% [18 ]. This can make a substantial contribution by reducing the climate change associated with energy and products used by different cities and communities.   6.3 Social contributions The environmental and economic aspects of CC have been always the main focus for studies assessing and evaluating the different impacts and delivered benefits. However, CC delivers as well more societal and social benefits. Firstly, due to improved air quality and reduced air pollution, human health is improved, resulting in a healthier society and community. The second major benefit is job creation, due to the huge investment in CC projects, as well as enabled fossil energy projects, which help to reduce unemployment and increase human welfare. The third major benefit is the mitigation of climate change, and hence mitigation of global temperature rises that result in sea level rise and sinking of coastal areas. According to the IPCC and IEA, there is a need to establish up to 2,000 CCS facilities by 2050 to mitigate the climate change effects of carbon emissions [200 ,262 ,263 ]. It is estimated that the construction and operation of such a number of CCS facilities will help to create up to 100,000 employees by 2050, with more jobs associated with material and equipment supply, logistics, professional services, and many others. This will in turn, decrease the unemployment rate, along with the associated social and societal problems, thereby increasing human welfare. 6.3.1 SDG-3 Good health and well-being SDG-3 is about good health and well-being and majorly focuses on human health. This goal addresses a large number of health and well-being issues, which include neonatal, maternal mortality, disease epidemics, substance abuse, hazardous pollution, road accidents and injuries, and sexual health. Air pollution in general, including emissions from fossil fuels, such as COx , SOx , NOx , and PM have strongly related to many health problems, especially those associated with the respiratory system [264 ,265 ]. CC essentially removes most, if not all, of air pollutants as explained earlier as part of the environmental benefits of CCS. In Shanghai, China, it has been estimated that the low-carbon energy policy to reduce ambient air pollution car resulted in reducing the PM-related avoidable deaths by 2,804–8,249 and 9,870–23,100 in 2010 and 2020, respectively [266 ]. In China, a recent study has indicated that carbon and pollution control policies can provide a benefit of reducing nationwide mortalities related to PM and O3  by about 23% or 289,000 in most strict scenarios between 2015 and 2030 [267 ].    7 CCT barriers and related SDGs Implementing CC face several challenges and barriers [268–272 ]. These barriers are various and require full collaboration among the different stakeholders and shareholders in different energy utilization sectors such as heat and power, transportation, and industry. Table 8   presents the different barriers that face CC implimentation and their linkage to the related SDGs. The barriers are mainly economic, technical, and administrative in nature. The economic barriers are related to funding or finicial support required for R&D, support to wave the currently high cost of CC, and govermental incentives to CC. The technical bariers are related to capture efficiency, material and process development among many others. The administrative barriers are related to leglization and policies to encourage and support R&D and implementation of CC.  8 Circular economy and carbon capture In the recent years the movement towards the circular economy was raised. Circular economy aims at regenerating or reusing resources to produce new products. This to replace the conventional linear economy which starts from utilizing resources to products, which ends up as a waste that has to be properly managed. CC would have the capability to support this movement. Whereby circular economy focusing on turning goods at end of their service life into resources to other products [273 ], which can be achieved through the carbon capture and utilization CCU. In addition, the carbon capture has several contributions into the circular economy, which summarized and linked to the related SDGs in Table 9  . In CCU, the carbon emissions results from the utilization of fossil resources to produce fuels is turned back into fuels or chemical commodities in a circular economy approach.  9 Novel indicators for pre-combustion carbon capture and sustainable development Based on the discussion above, a set of indicators was developed to ensure that pre-combustion CC technology contributes to all SDGs, therefore, has a balance between the three pillars (economic, social, and environment) of sustainable development. The development of indicators was constructed based on a literature review and related guidelines [274–276 ]. The pre-combustion CC has been chosen specifically for its higher overall merits compared to other CC approaches, as discussed earlier and summarized in Table 1 . Most of the previous approaches used for assessing the CC impacts are focusing on measuring the environmental impact or social impact, using the LCA and social impact assessment (SIA). While, LCA is a good tool to analysis the environmental and social impacts of the products [277 ,278 ], it does not cover some aspects such as risk management, communications with stakeholder, data management, etc. The devleoped indicators for each SDG are shown in Table 10  . Moreover, the proposed indicators include those recommended in LCA as one of the current proposed indicators. These make the proposed indicators unique in their position, by including both technical and business indicators. Which would help the different stakeholders to ensure the positive contribution of the CC project in achieving the SDGs. In addition, the proposed indicators are unique in their nature as they can integrate the SDGs within the Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The proposed indicators covered all the SDGs and unlike the previous indicators, which were more technicality-oriented, the proposed indicators in the current work look at CC as a project with more focus on sustainable management. The proposed indicators could work as a guideline for the different stakeholders within the industry to ensure that CCT benefits are maximized, and the possible trade-off impacts are minimized. These indicators ensure that the decision-makers are aware of the different measures, policies, analyses, and actions that should be taken to avoid any possible trade-off impact on SDGs due to CC. Moreover, the proposed indicators provide a framework for the different stakeholders to develop strategies and allocate resources. They also measure the progress toward the attainment of sustainable development and SDGs. These indicators can lead to increased transparency and get the required feedback from the different stakeholders. Another important role of the proposed indicators is to provide a better means and basis of comparison between the different CCTs, from the perspective of sustainable development and SDGs. Similar to other indicators, they play a constructive role in recognizing problems, identifying trends, and contributing to the process of priority setting. One significant role of the proposed indicators is to help building knowledge and capacity, and provide a platform to communicate the complex issues of sustainable development and SDGs. At the beginning of each section, the relevant indicators were provided to ease the reading and discussion of the indicators. Table 10  summarizes the different SDGs, along with the developed indicators used to assess the contribution of CC to each goal. In the following discussions, power plants utilizing fossil fuel resources have been considered as typical carbon emissions sources, with CC being integrated into their operation. Besides, the main role of the proposed indicators in assisting and maximizing the achievement of the SDGs, they have several advantages [279 ,280 ] such as: providing information for the decision makers, enhancing and benchmark sustainability performance, improve risk management, enhancing data management and reporting practices, improving resource allocation and reduce the expenses, improve enviroemtnal perfomanrace, reduce social impact, and improve communications with stakeholder. Also one of advantages of the proposed indicators that they are applicable to both small and large scale industry. However, the cost and the resources required for the implementation wouldvary. The proposed indicators would help the policy makers and stakeholders in maximizing the benefits of the CC in achieving the different SDGs and minimizing the trade off, therefore, it would help them in supporting the implementation of the CC in both small and large scale industries. However, implementing and taking into the consideration the proposed indicators by the stakeholder have some limitations. The main limitation is coming from the cost and time that would be involved in such implementation [281 ]. Nevertheless, with the proper management of the financial resources and looking to long term benefits, this limitation could be overcome [282 ]. Another limitation or barrier might be involved in the implementation of the proposed indicators is the social resistance [283 ]. These barriers can be overcome by engaging the local community in the early stage of the project and throughout the different stages and also the intensive share the benefits with the different stakeholder would help to reduce the social resistance [284 ,285 ]. Furthermore, the proposed indicators would increase the workload of the sustainable development (social, economic and environment). In Table 11  , the indicators were grouped based on their related benefits (some indictors can be categorized under more than one benefits). 9.1 SDG-1 No poverty Image 1     Power plants consider that fossil fuels are still maintained as the primary energy sources involving mining activities that give benefits to the local community, in terms of getting revenue and improving quality of life. However, one important factor that must be considered is that the initial capital expenditure for such projects is still high due to the addition of CC [286 ]. Whenever this matter is not the constraint of the implementation of the project, the SDG-1 can be aligned, and most indicators of the SDG-1 can be easily expected. Funding is required to provide essential services and developing infrastructure. Governments make revenues required through taxes in exchange for the provided services, with proper taxation process to make this process efficient [287 ]. Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) tend to make more employment that lifts out people from poverty [288 ]. In the private sector, job creation has been the main driver in the fight against poverty. MSMEs contribute significantly to the employment creation process. Four out of five new jobs in the formal sector were created by MSMEs, while markets were emerging and this is around 90% of the total employment [289 ]. Labor productivity is increased through better nutrition, better health, and higher education levels, and also enhances the non-farming employment opportunities. There should be policies that encourage productivity and investment along with social protection interventions, targeting nutrition, health, and education to help smallholders to achieve a higher income generation [290 ]. The utilities price is one critical aspect of SDGs, therefore it important to ensure that tariff is dropping down.  9.2 SDG-2 Zero hunger Image 2     To boost the achievement of SDG-2, the policy that is made should be in favor of poor people or smallholders. Related to this point, the selection of land for the construction of projects should be taken carefully, especially in the productive fertile agricultural area. The priority of the recommended location for projects should be in the nonarable land so that it would not disturb and thus reduce the productivity of smallholders. The capacity of the local community should also be empowered through the creation of local community partnerships and collaboration. There should be disaster risk investigation and analysis, which could be spelled out in the form of risk management policy. The construction and operation of the power plant may involve the utilization and production of a hazardous material as well, so the balance of this hazardous material should be recorded. A fundamental role is played by safe water and sanitation in improving the nutritional outcomes. When there is a lack of clean water and appropriate sanitation services, this can result in diarrhea. If these conditions remain constant, this can then result in under-nutrition. Diarrhea, due to the absence of appropriate sanitation service, is considered to be one of the primary causes of child deaths below age 5 in developing countries [291 ].  9.3 SDG-3 Good health and well-being Image 3     It is an industry-standard that any activity should be explicitly indicated by hazard identification and hazard operability analysis and assessment. This is followed by health, safety, and environmental policies used as a reference or guideline for employees during different project phases of commissioning, operation, and maintenance. Job safety analysis and work permit procedures should be well documented as a part of the workflow, in addition to policies to maintain all employees in good health and well-being condition, such as pollution control measures. The risk assessment includes an understanding of both exposures, as well as effects that are required to characterize the risk for different situations [292–294 ]. The LCA can be used to measure the human toxicity potential (HTP), particulate matter (PM), photochemical ozone creation potential of pre-combustion CC. The measuring should follow the different guideline provide by a reputable organization, such as ISO 14040 [295 ], to reduce the uncertainty and increases the acceptance of the results.  9.4 SDG-4 Quality education Image 4     The power plant projects should prepare the provision of the employee carrier roadmap, complete with all required courses and assessment tools that can be used to know and test the skill level of employees. At each level, there should be recommended course lists, a timeline to take the courses, and the corresponding examination. Every employee should have equal opportunity in pursuing his/her training program to get a higher level of the carrier. Labor recruitment requirements should include strict policy not to admit child labor regarding age, as well as the prohibition of a child to work in any hazardous industry. Child labor is a type of economical abuse, and is a rising issue globally. It is important to take measures to prevent child labor and one of the important measures is education. Business and management schools have a critical role in shaping the mindsets of future business leaders [296 ]. Among the major responsibilities are increasing welfare and expanding education services to the whole community. The issue related to shaping education is a matter of concern, as changing educational policies should go hand-in-hand with the contemporary world's needs. Such kinds of changes implemented can result in children being ousted from school [297 ]. In addition to the focus on enabling environment for investment and market integration, policies should also focus on education and health.  9.5 SDG-5 Gender inequality Image 5     Generally, the power industry does not have a considerable effect on gender equality. However, it may have indirect and nonspecific effects, such as the possibility of promoting growth and development, which in turn may require increased options and opportunities for women's involvement in power projects. Whenever it is required to deliver SDG-5, it could begin with this promotion of the growth and development of women. Ensuring that woman fully and equally involved in decision process would be improve would reduce many issue that related to gender quality [298 ].  9.6 SDG-6 Clean water and sanitation Image 6     Power plants in general, and those with CC, in particular, should not be located in water scarcity areas, due to high water consumption and withdrawal requirements, which may become an issue and negatively affect SDG-6 realization. Water and wastewater management are required for this situation where the corresponding scope includes water pollution, water use reduction, wastewater minimization, etc. [299 ,300 ]. Furthermore, water quality, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential (FAETP), eutrophication potential (EP) before and after project implementation should be monitored as well, this can be achived using LCA or EIA.  9.7 SDG-7 Affordable and clean energy Image 7     The aim of pre-combustion CC is to produce clean fuel or hydrogen, as a direct contribution to SDG-7. This in turn, provides reasonable and sustainable clean energy that can be accessed by more people. This technology innovation aims to reduce much of the carbon emissions into the atmosphere to meet the universal goal of controlling global warming and climate change. Besides energy-related parameters, some additional indicators can be added to monitor and manage the performance of the technology implementation, such as the educational program for enhancing the awareness of energy usage, total investment to support the water initiatives, total investment for R&D in clean water, and cost of energy before and after the implementation of CC based coal IGCC power plant technology. Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and avoided CO2  cost should help to conduct an economic assessment [257 ].  9.8 SDG-8 Decent work and economic growth Image 8     The implementation of CC in the power plant is expected to enable positive community growth in the area of mining, employees involved in the transportation, and the community around the power plant. Community quality of life improvements should be created, which could be facilitated by the project policies. Some indicators could be set up and targeted, completed with the monitoring tools for monitoring and continuous improvement. These indicators include compensation of the resources which are used during: project execution and facility operation and maintenance, local procurement of goods and services, number of housing for temporary employees, and incentives given to employees. When a proper allocation of financial risks and return on investment are performed, it tends to enable the public and private sectors to earn returns commensurate to the risks taken through the 3Ts (Tariffs, Taxes, and Transfers) [301 ]. Additionally, the rise in local investments remains the key source to closing the financing gap in many projects. Governments can apply a range of policies to improve the financial viability of utilities, recover the investment costs, and provide an income stream for improving the risk-return profile. These investments, which are related to utilities include [302 ]: pollution taxes, tariffs for utilities, abstraction charges, public good charges, value capture mechanisms; and payments for ecosystem services [303 ].  9.9 SDG-9 Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Image 9     Since the beginning of CCimplementation, management should prepare the roadmap of related industry innovations, and the development of infrastructure for the surrounding community to get better living standards. This matter should be matched with local community potential for their sustainable development, while maintaining the consideration to reduce carbon emission and greenhouse effects. The social, economic and environmental benifits should take place in the local community with clear quantitative indicators, such as GHG emissions, level of compliance to government policies, number of convening powers employed, and total value-added created. It is important to have a more systematic and rational approach in order to plan sustainably. This need brought attention to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This is said to be a proactive method (or technique) that informs decision-makers of the possible impacts of their future actions. EIA tends to predict as well as minimize considerable environmental impacts before the implementation of the project. Usually, an EIA is said to form an integral part of the project feasibility study, planning and design, and also, the approval process [304 ,305 ]. EIA calculates direct, indirect, and induced aspects of a projects. The EIA further assumes that there will be an increase in employment which can be a result of a project, without either any wage or any price effects. This is said to be possible because previously, it was argued that resources that are unused or underused will become employed. The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) has guidelines and principles that consider social impact as consequences to human populations [306 ]. These consequences alter how people live, work, and organize relative to one another. Social consequences can be both either positive or negative. The purpose of the SIA is to analyze, monitor and manage such consequences, be it intended or unintended [306 ].  9.10 SDG-10 Reduced inequalities Image 10     The implementation strategy and policy of the power plant project should incorporate the actionable plan to elevate the lives of marginalized local communities to achieve the overall goals of sustainability. The project management should prepare some training programs for marginalized populations and also facilitate financing alternatives to realize prospective activities giving a better life for them. Project management or companies should consider the wage disparities among working groups and also levels of diversity and inclusion. This should be perfromed to support the initiatives for decreasing inequalities based on gender, race, wages, or any other relevant reason [307 ].  9.11 SDG-11 Sustainable cities and communities Image 11     Sustainable cities and surrounding communities should be considered in the project implementation of CC-based power plants. Some factors that should be considered and prepared are: disaster resilience plans, utility system models, and resource sustainability policies. The utilization of fossil fuels should be considered as a transitional phase during the driving of the increasing use of renewable energy resources. Whenever possible, the implementation of a microgrid or hybrid renewable energy system, including a battery system, may be better, as it can be considered as one performance indicator. Fossil-biomass cofiring might be possible as one alternative to introducing renewable energy or biofuel into conventional thermal power plants. Regarding the sustainable city, the generated waste should be included in the consideration for policy development. Resource efficiency is said to be a part of sustainable development. In the UK, over recent years, this has become embodied in governmental legislation, with different countries have similar programs [308 ]. Sustainable development can be defined as a dynamic process that tends to enable all people to know or realize their potential. This, at the same time, will protect and enhance the life support systems on Earth [309 ]. This is viewed as the feasibility of the sustainable development concept, which ranges from unrealistic, to unfeasible, to possible.  9.12 SDG-12 Responsible consumption and production Image 12     The project management team should take the responsibility for the resources and materials consumed during project and facility operation and maintenance, as well as the performance of the system in converting the input materials and energy resources into useful energy. This also includes system energy efficiency and its related pollution and waste generated. Reporting and tracking some indicators are also important, including their types of short-term and long-term pollution of air, water, and land [310 ]. The energy produced, energy efficiency, and all generated waste should be reported and tracked as important indicators.  9.13 SDG-13 climate action Image 13     Carbon capture is at the core of the climate problem abatement plan, as such can substantially reduce GHG emissions to avoid global warming and other climate changes. To strengthen and enhance the performance in reducing environmental impacts, other strategic actions should be planned and some indicators should be set up, monitored, and tracked. These include all types of pollution, the rate of the supply chain emission, portions of projects located in the area with emissions reduction potential, number of researches directed toward climate change solutions, and level of engagement in industrial climate dialogues as well. CCS/CCU would require the development of rules to manage risks and support policies for facilitating investment. Accordingly, legal and regulatory understanding are important factors that could promote or hinder CCS implementation [311 ].  9.14 SDG-14 Life below water Image 14     The CC project should assess the environmental and social impacts, tracking and reporting all water-related pollution. Wherever the location of the project is on the coastline, then marine ecotoxicity should be measured using an LCA tool. Many methods can generate the result of aquatic ecotoxicity impact; these methods include: EDIP 97, CML2001, IMPACT2002+, and TRACI [312 ]. The ecotoxicity has shown to increase in the new installations and retrofit of CC units in power plants in comparison to the no CC scenario, as heavy metals from the flue gas are released to the soil and water, instead of air [313 ].  9.15 SDG-15 Life on land Image 15     As a part of project implementation plans, there should be an EIA, a comprehensive baseline for EIA, assessment of projects located in brownfields and previously developed land, research initiative, and landscape planning related to life on land, which measure the impact on biodiversity and ecosystem. Aside from this, total resources required and total land occupied should be identified. Furthermore, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential (FAETP) and eutrophication potential (EP) should be measured using the LCA tool. These parameters should be clearly defined and monitored to verify the impact of the project on the surrounding life on land. The pre-combustion CC tends to reduce the GWP by 64 and 78% for natural gas- and coal-based power plants [314 ]. Nevertheless, such CC results in increased freshwater eutrophication impact and other toxicity categories in comparison to conventional power plants.  9.16 SDG-16 Peace, justice, and strong institution Image 16     To run the CC-based power plant successfully with peace and justice and to make the project or company a strong institution, there should be a development of robust anti-bribery management systems. In the project planning phase, management should encourage stakeholders to get involved to let them know well about the overall plan for the success of project implementation. Furthermore, compliance with the project's regulation and disclosure of information should be well kept and enforced. The regulatory requirements tend to provide the minimum assurance level at which stakeholders are not subjected to pre-identified harm. Attempts to cover up non-conformities with regulatory bodies that can result in a breakdown of credibility should be prohibited. Stakeholders, including customers and employees, fairly assume that an organization should be aware of governing necessities and are competent in meeting different obligations. For listed companies, disclosing the information is said to be a legal obligation. This directly influences transparency and pricing efficiency (that is an important basis for which investments decisions are made by the investors) on the securities market. Alongside this, it also serves as the legitimate basis of its ideologies of honesty, fairness, and impartialness.  9.17 SDG-17 Partnerships for the goals Image 17     The success of the CC project implementation also depends on other parties in the form of partnership. The collaboration required in the project includes working with other industrial, governmental, and local entities or authorities. In addition to this collaboration, the project management should allocate the financial resources and consider the incorporation and alignment of SDGs in the company policies. Related indicators should also be defined and monitored carefully. Without considering the size of the industry, all companies can contribute to the SDGs, as part of their sustainable development targets. On one hand, while the scope and scale of the global goals are unprecedented, then, there can be some fundamental ways in which any business can contribute, and these ways remain unchanged. Companies are being asked, by the UN Global Compact, to do business responsibly and to pursue the opportunities for solving the challenges using business innovation and collaborations [315 ]. The first and foremost step is to adopt accountable business practices and commit to sustainability in their operations. However, there can be situations or global challenges which can be tough and cannot be faced or solved by one company or sector alone. Most of the time, in such situations, partnerships and working in partnership help a lot and result in a greater impact. It has its reach and exceptional competencies to become a prevailing source of innovation. Moreover, the business community can work side by side with the public sector for developing cohesive solutions to global challenges [316 ].   10 Conclusions Carbon capture CC technologies in general, and pre-combustion CC, in particular, is viewed as an effective tool to significantly reduce global greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, which are at the heart of the global response to global warming and climate change challenges. Pre-combustion has shown to have an intermediate level of merits and demerits among different CCTs, making it an optimum candidate for CC. Building a new or retrofitting old power plant with CC, as one of the main sources of carbon emissions, and a good model for other carbon emissions sources is gaining huge environmental, economic, and social potential, as the main sustainable development pillars. In the current work, CC have been evaluated and assessed regarding their effectiveness in reaching the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The role of CC in achieving the SDGs was discussed and elaborated. The major contribution is coming from CC ability in reducing the climate change impact (SDG-13) and providing cleaner source of energy (SDG-7). In addition, the relations between circular economy and CC was presented together with the related SDGs. Additionally, the barriers facing the implementation of the CC with relevant SDGs were introduced. A total of 87 indicators have been identified for the 17 SDGs within this study, providing sustainability guidelines for different stakeholders. The provided indicators ensured that all possible trade-off impacts of the pre-combustion CC with all SDGs have been reduced or even eliminated, while also providing a set of balance between the three pillars of sustainable development. The developed indictors provide a guideline for decision-makers and policy-makers to maximize the benefits of the project. The other benefits are: providing information for the decision-makers, enhance and benchmark sustainability performance, improve risk management, enhance data management and reporting practices, improve resource allocation and reduce the expenses, improve enviroemtnal perfomanrace, reduce social impact, and improve communications with stakeholder. .
