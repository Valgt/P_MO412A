                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations create global awareness, political responsibility, enhanced measurements, and social feedback by organizing these priorities into seventeen goals and defining measurable time-bound targets. SDG7, “Affordable and Clean Energy,” aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Therefore, renewable energy is crucial for achieving the SDGs by providing sustainable, clean, affordable energy solutions. This study aims to identify the scientific production and its evolution related to concentrated solar power (CSP) and provide an overview of system hybridization towards accessing their role in achieving the SDGs. The study analyzes recent publications on hybrid CSP over the past decade using bibliometric analysis. The findings reveal that hybrid CSP systems directly and indirectly contribute to the SDGs. For example, hybrid CSP power is directly related to SDGs 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 12 Responsible Consumption and Production. In contrast, cooling applications are indirectly connected to SDGs 1, No Poverty, and 3, Good Health and Wellbeing. The study also highlights the increasing trend of publications on CSP, with the year 2020 marking the highest point. China has the highest number of publications on hybrid CSP, followed by the USA, Italy, the UK, Spain, and France. This study highlights the potential benefits of CSP hybridization in achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes the need to fully address the challenges of implementing these systems.

Table 2    Hybrid System Advantage Limitation   CSP-fossil fuel ⁃ Provides a reliable opportunity to achieve the renewable energy target.  ⁃A huge reduction in CO2 emission can be obtained as a result of CSP integration with fossil fuel.  ⁃The capital cost of CSP power plants can be reduced as a result of sharing equipments with fossil fuel power plant.  ⁃The natural gas consumption will be reduced due to hybrid system and that reduce the fossil fuel cost as well as increase the effeciency of the power plant. Hybrid systen can provide a reliable and flexible operation    ⁃The existing coal plants hinders the integration with solar equipment.  ⁃Incompatibility between the CSP output and the high operating temperature of the gas turbine.  ⁃CSPs are usually built in deserts and arid areas as per DNI requirements. However, fossil fuel power plants are constructed near water resources, and that limit the CSP–fossil fuel hybridization.     CSP-Biomass ⁃CSP and biomass both have the potential to deliver almost 100% clean power supply and meet the renewable energy target.  ⁃Major equipment can be shared, which leads to saving in a capital cost  ⁃Ability to obtain the required temperature and pressure of steam by injecting solar energy.    ⁃Highly technical operation and temperature limits are required.  ⁃Using CSP for biomass gasification to obtain high-quality syngas requires more effort and study.     CSP-Geothermal ⁃Hybrid systems of CSP and geothermal have the potential to meet the renewable energy target.  ⁃Hybrid system of CSP and geothermal can increase the efficiency of a geothermal power plant.  ⁃Several configuration and multigenerational opportunities are possible.  ⁃The high temperature of CSP contributes in enhancing the plant efficiency despite the low temperature on geothermal energy    ⁃Heat from geothermal is a low-level grade, which will lower the system capacity factor if solar radiation or a thermal storage system is absent, and that can affect the grid stability.  ⁃Incorporating thermal energy storage to ensure grid stability will increase the capital expenditures  ⁃The utilization of geothermal brine as a heat transfer fluid can increase the corrosion and scaling concerns.     CSP-Wind ⁃Hybrid system can reduce power fluctuation and cover peak demand.  ⁃Using thermal storage in the hybrid system considered cheaper and more stable solution compared to batteries, especially for big-capacity and small solar multiple.  ⁃Some locations have maximum average solar power in summer with minimum wind energy, and minimum solar power occurs in winter with maximum wind energy; this will enhance the integration concept to cover needed load.    ⁃The hybrid system's cost is higher than a standalone CSP or wind farm since no components are to be shared.  ⁃Power generated by wind energy is entirely different from that generated by CSP; therefore, incorporation is limited to the grid level.  ⁃Large land required for a standalone wind farm and standalone CSP plant  ⁃A significant proportion of suitable locations that possess the required solar radiation and wind velocity lack the essential infrastructure necessary for power supply.     CSP-PV ⁃Hybrid system can reduce energy production costs and offer a dispatchable power solution.  ⁃Stable electrical power supply can be provided because of TES.  ⁃The lower LCOE of the PV technology will add an economic benefit.  ⁃Hybrid system can lead to a lower cost solution, compared to CSP alone, especially in terms of baseload output requirements.  ⁃The capacity factor for hybrid systems can be over 90% for base load due to the thermal storage system  ⁃Hybrid system can reduce the LCOE by 5.6% and the loss of power by 90%.    ⁃Cost of the hybrid system is high compared to standalone CSP or PV, since there is no components to be shared.

SDG7, “Affordable and Clean Energy,” aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Therefore, renewable energy is crucial for achieving the SDGs by providing sustainable, clean, affordable energy solutions. This study aims to identify the scientific production and its evolution related to concentrated solar power (CSP) and provide an overview of system hybridization towards accessing their role in achieving the SDGs. The study analyzes recent publications on hybrid CSP over the past decade using bibliometric analysis. The findings reveal that hybrid CSP systems directly and indirectly contribute to the SDGs. For example, hybrid CSP power is directly related to SDGs 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 12 Responsible Consumption and Production. In contrast, cooling applications are indirectly connected to SDGs 1, No Poverty, and 3, Good Health and Wellbeing. The study also highlights the increasing trend of publications on CSP, with the year 2020 marking the highest point. China has the highest number of publications on hybrid CSP, followed by the USA, Italy, the UK, Spain, and France. This study highlights the potential benefits of CSP hybridization in achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes the need to fully address the challenges of implementing these systems.

Therefore, different electricity generation technologies should be selected, not only for the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) but also for the impact of the chosen technologies on the environment, global and local emission reductions, energy security, social inequality, and industrial development [4–7 ]. The power generation market using various renewable technologies has significantly increased worldwide [8–10 ]. The demand was 6890.7 TWh in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% in 2020–2027 because of the global energy crises [11 ,12 ]. Fig. 1   shows the renewable energy sources. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is a renewable energy technology that has gained significant attention. CSP technology uses mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight into a small area and convert it into thermal heat for electrical generation or industrial processing [13 ,14 ]. However, providing dispatchable power by solar energy faces some challenges due to the intermittent energy source [15 ,16 ]. CSP systems can provide dispatchable power because they have unique advantages as a renewable energy source; they can be incorporated with thermal energy storage (TES) [17 ], which is considered one of the cheapest storage technologies, and they can also be integrated with power plants [18–20 ]. In the global CSP market in 2019, 381.6 MW solar thermal projects were built worldwide, increasing the rate by 6.29% [21 ]. However, global CSP capacity is expected to reach 10–22 GW in 2025 and 70–256 GW in 2040 [5 ]. CSP has attracted attention for many reasons: i) it generates clean power from a free and non-exhausting source of energy, ii) many countries have direct normal irradiance (DNI) levels (>2000 kWh/m2 /year) for CSP applications, iii) it can be incorporated with thermal energy storage (TES), and iv) it can be hybridized with other power plant systems [22 ,23 ]. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) helped expand the renewable energy sector by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security [24–27 ]. The SDGs provide a solid framework for achieving social, economic, and climate objectives [28 ]. Among the 17 SDGs, SDG 7 is devoted to energy, with an objective “to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all” [29 ]. The SDGs include ending hunger and poverty, establishing equal rights and access to education, granting women's rights, developing clean, sustainable energy sources, boosting the economy and infrastructure, and improving the quality of life for people, animals, plants, and marine species [30 ,31 ]. To address the growing environmental problems resulting from the burning and depletion of fossil fuels, scientists are striving to develop sustainable and renewable energy generation methods. These techniques include carbon capture and storage [32 ] and renewable energy technologies [33 ]. He, Yang [34 ] presented a comprehensive overview of the historical and future directions of the global renewable energy footprint, highlighting both the progress and challenges of the SDGs. The authors also suggested that assessing the effects of renewable energy development would be necessary due to the complexity of the linkages between SDG7 and other goals. Additionally, renewable energy is crucial to achieving SDG 7 [35 ]. It also combats climate change by reducing environmental pollutants (SDG 3) and (SDG 13) [36 ]. It contributes to social and economic aspects by fostering economic growth and employment creation (SDG 8) [37 ]. Moreover, food production benefits from using renewable energy (SDG 2) [38 ]. It is consistent with SDG 6, which calls for desalination plants powered by renewable energy to provide clean water [39–41 ]. Therefore, incorporating renewable energy is crucial to the sustainability pillars and satisfies immediate energy needs. In addition, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) is related to environmental sustainability, human development, and sustainable growth [42 ,43 ]. Therefore, the link between SDG7 and other SDGs is crucial to maximizing co-benefits development. Many studies investigated renewable energy systems in the SDGs [35 ,44–48 ]. These studies often utilized bibliometric analysis to present the quantitative perspective, significant themes, and citation patterns. The research questions for this study are as follows.RQ1 What are the CSP hybridization methods?  RQ2 What are the significant themes and citation patterns in CSP technology?  RQ3 What is Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) research distribution within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? Therefore, this study aims to provide a bibliometric analysis overview of CSP hybrid systems and review the relation of hybrid CSP to the SDGs. These findings guide developers and researchers in this field of research. The article is organized as follows: first, a thorough CSP hybridization background has been presented, addressing its advantages and drawbacks; then, a detailed hybrid CSP and SDGs overview is provided; next, the bibliometric analysis of hybrid CSP is analyzed. Finally, publication trends, foremost journals, top authors, affiliations, and countries were presented. This study helps and guides researchers in this field and defines the current state-of-the-art technology.    2 Overview of CSP technologies CSP consists mainly of concentrator (reflectors), receiver, and heat transfer fluid (HTF). The primary objective of CSP is to enhance the thermal energy output. This can be accomplished by reducing the area of heat loss and incorporating an optical device between the radiation source and the receiver [49 ,50 ]. CSP system uses only the direct component of solar radiation known as direct normal irradiance (DNI). The reflectors direct DNI toward the receiver [51 ,52 ]. The receiver absorbs the heat and conveys it to the heat transfer fluid that flows inside the receiver, to be harnessed as thermal energy. Concentrating collectors showed several advantages [53 ].1. Higher thermodynamic efficiency due to the high temperature of the working fluid.  2. It is possible to match harvested thermal energy and the required application.  3. Less thermal heat losses due to evacuated media.  4. The economic feasibility of selective surface treatment is because of the relatively small receiver area per unit of collected solar energy.    The main four categories of CSP are parabolic trough (PT), linear fresnel collector, parabolic dish, and solar power tower, as shown in Fig. 2  . Variation between the four categories is mainly in terms of optical design, receiver shape, nature of the heat transfer, and capability to store heat. More technical and operational variations are listed in Table 1  , such as concentration ratio and operating temperature. As shown in Table 1 , the highest operating temperature is of the parabolic dish. This can be referred to as the high concentration ratio, point focusing, and dual axis tracking. Moreover, parabolic dish consumes the least amount of water, which is considered one advantage of CSP technology. However, despite all those features, a parabolic dish does not reach commercialization since it cannot be incorporated with a storage system.  3 CSP hybridization Hybridizing CSP with renewable and fossil fuels sustainably overcomes the intermittence of solar energy (RQ1 ). CSP hybridization can be categorized as light, medium, or strong based on the equipment and solar share involved. Considering hybridization, each energy source can function independently, and the integration is done to bridge the gap between generated electricity and the electrical utility demand with minimal coordination between the integrated power plants. In medium hybridization, the primary equipment is shared physically to achieve substantial cost reductions in investment. Thus, interaction and coordination between the CSP and another power plant can exist. Mostly, the solar share to CSP in the medium integration can be within a range that enables CSP to provide additional heat to supplement the fossil fuel combustion process. Finally, the significant elements are shared in strong hybridization, as in the medium option. However, a high level of cooperation will exist between CSP and the other power plant. The strong hybridization makes the plant more flexible and capable of providing continuous power. The solar share to CSP in this type of integration is high, enabling it to work alone and generate electric power [56 ]. Integrating CSP and fossil fuels fosters the idea of utilizing renewable energy, strengthens the dependability of solar energy, and diminishes the associated expenses. In fossil fuel plants, CSP can generate steam, feed water preheating, supply heat for heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), preheat air, and capture CO2  [57 ]. The incorporation of CSP into renewable energy plants enables the provision of dispatchable power while producing nearly zero emissions. The output from this hybrid system will enhance the ability to meet energy demand and reduce power fluctuations [58 ]. The possible CSP hybridizations are shown in Fig. 3  . CSP and other power plant sources exist at distinct points along the technological spectrum. Therefore, integrating CSP with other sources will reveal different technical, financial, and political issues. While the concept of CSP integration is not new and already exists, its practical implementation is somewhat limited by a range of obstacles and challenges outlined in Table 2  . The average net present cost of producing electricity is evaluated using the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) measure. The LCOE is used to assess technology and its investment planning. Fig. 4   shows the LCOE of different electricity generation technologies on a utility-scale. This comparison helps to shed light on how the cost of each technology changed over time and provides future insights into the economic trends. There is an overall decline in renewable energy technology costs. For instance, it is evident that for solar PV power plants, the LCOE will keep decreasing until 2021. However, the solar PV power plant significantly dropped among all renewable energies from 2012 to 2014. This phenomenon could have happened due to the enhancement of CSP power technologies. Furthermore, wind power (onshore) has maintained a low band of LCOE from 2011 to 2023.  4 Contribution of hybrid CSP to SDGs The concept of CSP hybridization is already established, but its implementation could be more robust. However, CSP has the potential to contribute significantly to achieving several SDGs, such as SDG 7, SDG 13, SDG 8, SDG 11, SDG 9, and SDG 17 [46 ,60–62 ]. Integrating CSP with renewable energy systems like PV and wind through hybridization can effectively mitigate power fluctuations, address peak demand through Thermal Energy Storage (TES), and offer consistent electrical power from renewable energy sources with a high-capacity factor [63 ,64 ]. This can lead to meeting the renewable energy target and SDGs. Several studies have demonstrated how CSP and other renewable energy can help attain different SDGs [65–68 ]. By enabling access to vital services, improving human health, and facilitating income-generating activities, it can contribute to human development. Moreover, it can foster long-term economic growth by creating job opportunities and advancing industrial development, offering economic advantages. The potential contributions of hybrid CSP to the three sustainable development pillars are presented in Fig. 5  . This visual representation shows the hybrid CSP in social, environmental, and economic aspects. Complementing this, Fig. 6   enhances the understanding of how hybrid CSP technologies can directly align with and support the broader objectives outlined in the SDGs. Furthermore, Table 3   summarizes the role of renewable energy and CSP in specific sustainable development goals.  5 Bibliometric analysis The field of research known as bibliometric analysis is essential for determining whether a particular research field is still relevant. Bibliometrics is a field that uses mathematical and statistical methods to measure and compare scientific research output. Individuals, research groups, institutions, nations, and regions can all gain from applying these methodologies. These evaluations have proven helpful to governmental and financial decision-makers formulate long-term strategic goals and monitoring research output [72 ,73 ]. Various methods explore the publication's trends and cover areas by publications. One of the main advantages of the bibliometric method is understanding trends of specific topics over a period [24 ,74–76 ]. It is a powerful tool for scholars to extend beyond numerical metrics and understand thematic clusters of top research in a specific field (e.g., by the citation numbers). Also, it sheds light on subjects and explores new research gaps and trends. For instance, Viglia, Kumar [77 ] have comprehensively viewed the Service Industries Journal over 40 years. The presented analysis has considered various viewpoints, including publication and citation patterns, significant themes, and methodological approaches. Specialized software tools are often used to perform this analysis. Bibliometrix is an open-source tool that allows scholars to conduct science mapping and network analyses [78 ]. Moreover, further details regarding the bibliometric research procedure can be explored through [79 ]. The methodology used in this paper is shown in Fig. 7  , while Fig. 8   shows the filtration process used to get the analyzed data. Three steps are applied for data filtration: i) eliminating duplicates, ii) keeping related publications on hybrid CSP systems, and iii) compiling the final data of the publications. Furthermore, biblioshiny via (RStudio) and VOSviewer was employed to perform network analysis and scientific mapping. Bibliometric performance analysis includes descriptive measures relating to scientific area publishing, citation, frequency, and trends (or "hot themes"). For example, Table 4   shows 1125 studies on CSP hybrid systems obtained from Scopus between 2011 and 2022. The hybrid CSP has significantly increased owing to several factors, such as the various government policies on climate change, renewable energy, and a call to meet SDG 7, which is focused on ensuring access to cheap, dependable, sustainable, and modern energy for everyone [5 ,80 ]. Therefore, the timeframe from 2011 to 2022 has been selected as our time frame. In addition, the Scopus database was chosen because of the limited access to other databases and because Scopus and other databases have the majority of the same publication in common [81 ].  6 Bibliometric discussion CSP implementation has been accelerating over the last decade. There are various studies in different decuples of CSP research on relevant journals and conference proceedings. Storing solar thermal energy is notably simpler than storing electricity, even when the thermal energy is converted into electrical energy [82 ]. CSP harvests solar energy and integrates it with thermal storage for high enthalpy applications (such as industrial heat or electricity generation) [83 ]. This bibliometric study offers an overview of the progress of CSP research and development using bibliometric approaches [84 ,85 ]. The findings can highly benefit developers and researchers in the solar thermal sector. Fig. 9  , Fig. 10  , Fig. 11  , and Fig. 12   show the results of the bibliometric analysis on Hybrid-CSP. The chosen keywords to obtain the below results are TITLE-ABS-KEY (“CSP” OR “Concentrated Solar Power”) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Hybrid”) from 2011 to 2022. The results show 1125 papers were published in hybrid CSP (RQ2 ). The main keywords in the word map, shown in Fig. 9 , include CSP, heat storage, thermal energy, economic analysis, hybrid systems, and CSP costs. These words are present in different searched parts (title, keywords, abstract, etc.), apart from publications that include at least one of the exclusion terms. As a result, the keyword map enabled the collection of a more trustworthy database of CSP articles. Fig. 10  shows the number of scientific publications from 2011 to 2022. The number of publications on linked topics has steadily risen throughout the years, with 2020 serving as the high point of this trend. In 2021, the number of hybrid-CSP papers has decreased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2022, the publications increased again. The number of publications in China is the most significant worldwide, followed by Italy, UK, Spain, and France. Several reasons have led to most publications emerging from these countries. First, these nations have implemented laws and programs to encourage the growth and widespread use of renewable energy technologies like hybrid CSPs. This has made conducting studies and making discoveries in the area easier. Second, hybrid CSPs supplying a significant amount of clean energy appeal to these nations' economic interests since many have a high electricity demand and actively seek methods to diversify their energy portfolio and lessen their reliance on fossil fuels. Therefore, businesses and academic institutions now have a financial reason to further CSP study. Third, the advanced CSP technologies developed and implemented in these nations directly result from the strength of their technology and engineering industries. Fourth, The world's major emitters of greenhouse gases—including the United States, China, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and France are looking for solutions to their climate change pollution. These nations have been investing in hybrid CSP research to reduce the impacts of climate change because of the widespread recognition of CSP as a crucial technology for decarbonizing the electricity sector. Fifth, the academic institutes in these nations are dedicated to studying renewable energy and have funded CSP studies. They have successfully recruited and retained top-tier scientists and engineers, which has fueled the advancement of CSP technology. Moreover, examining extensively cited articles can help identify areas for further investigation and potential research opportunities. Table 5   presents the top 10 publications, their corresponding journal titles, number of citations received, and country. Behar, Khellaf [86 ] comprehensively reviewed central receiver solar thermal power plants. The technology, design, operation, performance, and efficiency were highlighted. This review is valuable for researchers and industry professionals working in the field as it sheds light on the current state of knowledge, identifies research gaps, and suggests areas for future exploration. Correspondingly, Baharoon, Rahman [87 ] covered various topics, including the different types of CSP technologies, their performance characteristics, and their challenges. By examining the historical context, this review offers insights into the advancements and achievements in CSP technologies, providing a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and policymakers in the renewable energy sector. Also, Ju, Xu [88 ] investigated the potential of CPVT systems to improve solar energy usage by generating both electricity and heat. They address the operating principles, design considerations, and performance characteristics of CPVT systems, emphasizing the benefits and drawbacks of this technology. Most of the research was published in a variety of journals. Still, conference proceedings make up a significant portion of the publications, indicating the research's low quality. On the other hand, Fig. 12  shows the thematic clustering of the most frequently occurring index words in hybrid-CSP over the past decade. On the map, the size of the circles and the links between them reflect the frequency of the connections and the strength of the relationships. In addition, index terms with the same color belong to the same thematic cluster, reflecting how frequently those words appear in the same publications. The seven thematic hotspots hybrid-CSP clusters into are solar energy, concentrated solar power, hybrid systems, optimization, electric energy storage, common spatial patterns, and solar radiation (RQ2 ). Interestingly, the optimization cluster has a significant number of publications. An additional notable outcome was the large number of research that dealt with the energy storage inside the hybrid CSP. CSP has a distinguishing feature among other renewable energy sources, as it can integrate with TES and provide dispatchable energy. Fonseca, Domingues [31 ] have studied the correlation of different SDGs to understand the synergetic relationships of most goals. Their study showed a robust correlation between SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). However, they suggested that certain SDGs, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), show no significant correlation with other SDGs. As shown in Fig. 13  , which shows the distribution of hybrid CSP research within the SDGs, most of the related research was on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) (RQ3 ). However, a relatively lower number of studies were conducted to analyze the impact of CSP on other SDGs. For instance, no studies were found on SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and CSP. This demonstrates that more research is necessary on hybrid CSP and its effects on all the SDGs. Within SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), the research focused on using advanced energy storage systems, such as molten salt storage, to make hybrid CSP systems more flexible and reliable. Moreover, Combining CSP with other forms of renewable energy, such as wind and PV, to produce hybrid systems can provide electricity even when solar resources are in short supply. Deploying hybrid CSP for off-grid and decentralizing the uses and power production in developing economies with restricted access to the grid utilize hybrid CSP systems within the hybrid mini-grids and micro-grids. The publications on SDG 12 increasingly addressed the technical and economic performance of CSP technology and its potential contribution to sustainable development objectives. This covers research on integrating CSP with other forms of renewable energy sources, the potential for hybrid CSP to produce dependable and dispatchable electricity, and the use of hybrid CSP for industrial process heat and desalination [95 ]. Additionally, research on the environmental and social implications of CSP systems is being carried out so that the full potential of CSP technology may be understood to accomplish sustainable development objectives. Regarding SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), the trend of publications is increasingly focusing on how hybrid CSP technology might help achieve SDG 3 by expanding access to necessities like healthcare and clean water, decreasing the prevalence of air pollution-related illnesses, and fostering long-term sustainable development in underdeveloped regions. For example, studies exploring the potential health advantages of lowering reliance on fossil fuels and expanding access to clean energy are included in this category, as are those examining the use of electricity CSP produces to power healthcare facilities and water treatment systems. In addition, the contribution of hybrid-CSP to achieve the SDGs is discussed in Section 6 . The analysis shows that integrating CSP systems with other renewable energy sources, such as wind and PV, to produce hybrid systems has been the focus of a growing body of research and literature in recent years. These studies have focused on developing new technologies and methods to improve these hybrid systems' efficacy, dependability, and cost-effectiveness. The following are some of the most critical developments in this sector.1. Hybrid CSP-PV systems: Researchers are investigating different methods to combine CSP with PV to develop hybrid systems producing more consistent and dependable energy [96–98 ].  2. Hybrid CSP-Wind systems: Researchers are also looking at methods to merge CSP systems with wind power to develop hybrid systems. These hybrid systems have the potential to offer a source of energy that is more consistent and dependable [99 ,100 ].  3. Hybrid CSP-Other renewable systems: Researchers develop methods to optimize the integration of CSP with other renewable energy sources. Researchers are developing ways to maximize the integration of CSP with other renewable energy sources. These methods include utilizing advanced control algorithms and energy management systems to coordinate the operation of the various components of the hybrid system better [101 ,102 ].  4. Cost-benefit analysis of hybrid CSP systems with other renewable energy sources: Researchers are currently conducting economic and financial research on hybrid CSP systems with other renewable energy sources to evaluate the costs and benefits of these systems and determine the most cost-effective options for putting these systems into action [103 ].  5. Hybrid CSP in remote areas: Hybrid CSP systems and other forms of renewable energy are becoming increasingly popular in remote areas. This is also a growing area of research, as it has the potential to offer a long-term solution to the problem of supplying electricity to remote communities that are frequently cut off from the grid [104 ,105 ].     7 Research limitations The data has apparent limitations that should be considered while doing this research. For example, because of different targeted keyword usage and highly specialized paper content, not every single document produced on this subject has probably been recorded by Scopus. Also, it is essential to acknowledge that, despite the analysis of author contributions, a portion of the authors may be members of a broader team, which may not necessarily represent individual efforts but rather a more cooperative affiliation. As a result, bibliometric analysis is a helpful tool for analyzing the field, but it's essential to be aware of its limits.  8 Conclusion The world faces several problems: poverty, water scarcity, ignorance, pollution, and energy crisis. United Nations proposed SDGs to remedy these problems. Therefore, SDGs are essential criteria for any technology to measure its importance in solving global issues. Concentrated solar power (CSP) hybrid systems can fulfill several SDGs. The first research question investigates the CSP hybridization methods, showing different renewable energies that can be integrated with CSP systems. Hybridization is categorized into light, medium, and strong levels. Light and medium include different degrees of coordination between CSP and other power sources, while strong enables substantial collaboration that improves flexibility and uninterrupted power production (RQ1 ). The second research question deals with significant themes and publication patterns. The citation pattern and thematic hotpots have increased over the past ten years, according to the performance analysis (RQ2 ). The present study reports the advantages of CSP hybridization with renewable and nonrenewable energy systems. The number of publications steadily increased throughout the years, with 2020 serving as the high point of this trend. However, in 2021, there was a decrease in the number of hybrid CSP papers, which may refer to the pandemic caused by COVID-19. The number of publications in China is the most significant worldwide, followed by the USA, Italy, the UK, Spain, and France. The present study shows that some hybrid CSP applications directly contribute to SDGs. For example, the electricity generated from hybrid CSP is directly related to SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12, while the cooling application is indirectly associated with SDGs 1 and 3 (RQ3 ). Therefore, the applications of hybrid CSP have significantly increased due to various government policies on climate change and renewable energy. In addition, studies related to SDGs are currently a priority for publication. Moreover, the hybrid CSP system has significantly increased due to various government policies on climate change and renewable energy. Hybridization of CSP with renewable energy systems such as PV and wind can reduce power fluctuation and provide electrical power at a high-capacity factor from renewable energy sources. However, further research is needed to overcome high initial costs and intermittency issues. In conclusion, hybrid systems of concentrated solar power technologies offer a promising solution for meeting energy demands while addressing environmental concerns. Implementing these systems can contribute significantly to achieving sustainable development goals and help solve global problems such as poverty, water scarcity, ignorance, pollution, and energy crises. Possible research on hybrid CSP includes two aspects: CSP's relation to the SDGs and the integration of different renewable energies. Future research can consist of exploring the relationship of CSP technology with SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), and SDG 17 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) since it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, searching for possible synergies between CSP technology and other renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric and geothermal, is a promising domain for future research. Reducing the cost of its solar component can help boost CSP application, making it more economically favorable for decision-makers. Also, addressing storage challenges in CSP can significantly contribute to its overall economic feasibility.  CRediT authorship contribution statement Bashria A.A.
