                  Recently, sustainability guidelines such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or the EU Taxonomy Regulation have become legally binding, thus requiring enterprises to monitor, control and report their contributions in compliance with sustainable development goals (SDGs). Comprehensive sustainability assessment methods are, therefore, crucial for ensuring competitive advantages of enterprises in the near future. Yet, lack of tailor-made methods particularly for manufacturing SMEs is evident. To address this pathway of research, this paper proposes a comprehensive indicator scheme for measuring and monitoring sustainability performance of manufacturing SMEs aligned with the SDGs. The proposed method is based on a literature analysis of existing measurement approaches. It combines methods from quality and innovation management in a sustainability evaluation scheme especially designed for manufacturing SMEs. The method is demonstrated in excerpts from an industry case study. The preliminary results reveal plausibility of the approach towards enabling enterprises to systematically define sustainability roadmaps and conduct progress monitoring.

Introduction  The relevance of sustainability in all its dimensions is becoming a key factor for enterprises, especially when it  comes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) [1]. There are further  global initiatives focusing on sustainable transformation, inter alia, the Paris Agreement [2], the IPBES Global  Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [3], the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) [4] or the Addis Ababa Action Agenda [5]. In the European Union (EU), there are further  legal framework conditions that either currently apply to the member states or will gradually come into force in the  upcoming years. Based on the EU Green Deal published in 2019, which calls for, among other things, climate  neutrality by 2050 and sustainable growth, Europe has a clear strategic objective to achieve its ambitious sustainability  targets by the year 2050 [6]. More importantly, the introduction of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  (CSRD) for the first time legally obligates enterprises to report standardized sustainability performance [7]. Within  the scope of this reporting, the declaration of EU taxonomy conformity is required. Metrics such as CO2-equivalent or  energy consumption are used for this purpose [8]. The clear commitment of the EU to quantify sustainability with  measurable values and with those indicators set goals for enterprises to achieve, shows that sustainability metrics are  increasingly important for competitive businesses in the near future.   Moreover, its large number of SMEs characterizes the manufacturing industry in Central Europe. In Germany,  France, Italy, Switzerland, Hungary, and Austria, over 96% [9] of the enterprises fall into this category, according to  the European SMEs definition [10]. This has implications for the implementation of sustainability reporting, i.e. the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provides a procedure for introducing sustainability in enterprises. However, large  corporations primarily implement the regulations. As Neri et al. conclude [11], the main reason is that it requires  resources and capabilities that SMEs may not have, such as time, money, knowledge, skills, support, and guidance.  The GRI procedure may also not consider the specifics and needs of SMEs, e.g., their stakeholders, impacts, and  motivations for sustainability reporting. Hence, a holistic, tailor-made approach for SMEs is needed to steer the way  towards a sustainable transformation, especially in the European manufacturing landscape [12].  To accomplish this goal, this paper aims to provide an indicator scheme for SMEs aligned with UNâ€™s SDGs, as  these have a major impact at both local and global level [13]. The main objective is to design an indicator-based  assessment approach, similar to existing benchmark evaluation schemes from adjacent domains such as quality  management (EFQM) [14]. Pursuing this line of research, the key research question (RQ) is "How can an indicator  scheme be set up, to enable manufacturing SMEs to measure and monitor their sustainability performance, based on  the UNâ€™s 17 SDGs?â€�. A review of selected publications shows that extensive research in the field of sustainability  metrics or KPIs has already been conducted and the allocation to the three pillars of sustainability has taken place  (e.g., Contini and Peruzzini [15]; Calzolari [14]). However, its instantiation regarding the 17 SDGs has yet to be  presented in sufficient detail in the literature. This paper, therefore, contributes to this evolving research area with a  specific focus towards the needs of manufacturing SMEs.  The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In section 2, the state of the art is described, focusing on relevant  approaches and methods to define metrics and KPIs in connection with the SDGs. Section 3 introduces the approach  developed to define SDG-metrics and how they are used in a process driven sustainability monitoring. Finally, Section  4 discusses the main findings, potential limitations, and indicates future research avenues.  2. State of the Art  The literature research (cf. Table 1) shows that there are already various models to measure enterprise-specific  metrics in the field of sustainability. Despite merits, there is a major attention to economic factors [16] as the focus  historically had mostly been on competitiveness. Most of the reviewed papers share the common goal of measuring  and assessing organizational sustainability performance. Differences between these methodologies include i) specific  focus areas (inter alia circular economy, industrial supply chains, performance management systems, and SDGs in the  automotive industry), ii) research approach and underlying methodology (e.g. three-step methodology, literature  review, and survey), and iii) application context (e.g. forest and paper sector organization, different decision-making  levels, broad range of industries, and European automotive enterprises). The table additionally classifies the extent to  which the SME relevance of each approach is fulfilled.

In the above-listed references, that are categorized as "Not directly", SDGs are not directly addressed,  but can only be inferred. For example, GonÃ§alves [20] mentions â€œCarbon footprint per unit of productâ€�, that can be  referred to SDG 13 (i.e. Climate Action). However, not all SDGs are covered in this approach. Perello Marin [18]  identifies the SDGs most commonly reported by the car manufacturing industry with assembly plants in Europe. This  method also does not consider all SDGs. Further, it is not tailored towards SMEs as it is based on the fixed GRI system.  BanelienÃ¨ [19] offers a starting point for the field of SMEs with a nine-stage value chain model. The value chain  element of this approach is a suitable basis for the method developed in the paper at hand. In particular, sustainability  assessment of the value-stream-based approach can be extended using SDGs. Further, the approach of Perello Marin  can base the SDG-oriented metrics on elements of the SDG approach, with an added SME component. Considering  these limitations in existing frameworks, the present paper contributes to introducing a novel approach offering a  comprehensive and tailor-made method for assessing SDG achievement in SMEs through the integration of value- stream-based sustainability assessment, SDGs, and SME-specific components. In the following section, this approach  will be outlined.   3. Sustainability Check and Quantification Approach   3.1. Sustainability-Check approach  The "Sustainability Check" approach presented in this paper records the status quo of sustainability in  manufacturing enterprises in accordance with the SDGs. The focus is on enterprises that are categorized as SMEs. The  approach comprises the following three main steps, picking up suitable starting points from the literature analysis,  namely i) flexible value-stream aspect for a better SME fit, ii) sustainability metric approach for assessment, as well  as iii) road mapping technique from innovation management. The steps are implemented in a workshop format,  involving as many departments of an enterprise as possible, including but not limited to human resources, production,  maintenance, and management.  3.1.1. Step 1: Value stream mapping  Value stream mapping of an enterprise facilitates gaining deeper understanding of the overall production system  and associated process towards identifying improvement measures. The value stream mapping is carried out on a  meta-level to consider all processes from gate to gate. Performing this for each product, as in the standard value stream  design approach, is not necessary within this procedure to identify potential fields of action. By having the enterprise's  employees map, relevant SDGs along the value chain, every process step within the system boundaries can basically  be taken into account. Through the moderation of an external, independent domain expert, holding knowledge of  production systems, value stream design and sustainability, the process of self-evaluation is monitored and supported.  This ensures that the group of employees does their best (critical) thinking [26] and fields of action are not intentionally  defined, thus trying to avoid bias and aiming for a realistic and fair evaluation. Figure 1 illustrates the process model,  the value chain created, and an exemplary assignment of the SDGs to the respective sections in the process chain.  With the production processes defined and linked to the 17 impact areas of the SDGs, the impact fields are discussed  in a workshop with internal stakeholders to highlight challenges along the value chain.   3.1.2. Step 2: Identifying & Assessing Sustainability Projects and Measures  Systematic recording of past and current projects and associated sustainability measures enables identifying the  status quo. This shows in which areas of the SDGs, projects have been realized in the enterprise and where there are  still unexhausted potentials. Quantitative evaluation of these projects requires an indicator scheme, which is discussed  in more detail in Section 3.2. Notably, in order to gain a comprehensive overview, a manageable but relevant  stakeholder group covering employees across the departments and hierarchy levels of the enterprise is involved. This  promotes diverse perspectives regarding the developed measures and projects, as well as the reduction of biases.    Maximilian Nowak  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 232 (2024) 655â€“664 659  Maximilian Nowak et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000â€“000  5  3.1.3. Step 3: Road-mapping sustainability measures  To implement enterprise's sustainability goals in the long term, it is important to set short-/midterm goals towards  long-term success [27]. For this reason, the chronological order of the activities is shown in a roadmap to determine  the path for the enterpriseâ€™s short- and long-term future. Measurable values should, therefore, be developed to identify  required efforts and benefits of individual fields of activity within the enterprise. This is achieved using the SDG  metrics approach, described in more detail in the section 3.2. With the identification of sustainability drivers in the  value streams, challenges related to the SDGs can be raised. Figure 1 shows an example from an enterprise in the field  of injection molding. The analysis highlights the high consumption of water in the cleaning process (cf. SDG 6 â€“  Clean water and sanitation) or the lack of assistance systems in the assembly line (cf. SDG 8 â€“ Decent work). The  system boundary of the method presented here is the production site. This is because individual production sites can  be compared better than several enterprises' combined sites.    3.2. Quantification Approach - Developing an SDG metric  The SDG metric is needed to evaluate and assess the status of sustainability measures from step 2 of the  sustainability check, and also for the definition of concrete goals for measures in the roadmap in step 3. Based on the  presented literature review, specific SME requirements have been considered and an approach to match sustainability  metrics with the SDGs has been chosen. For the evaluation of such a SDG metric, an example from the social  dimension is presented, cf. section 3.2.2. Notably, the complete evaluation of all 17 SDGs is not the scope of this  paper and is part of further and ongoing research. Further, the industrial evaluation is part of an ongoing research  project that aims to build a specific SDG metric system focusing on 20 industrial partners in Austria and Germany  specialized in the production and use of injection molding tools for the plastics industry.    3.2.1. Step 1: Allocation of the SDGs to the dimensions of sustainability  The 17 SDGs are assigned to the respective economic, ecological, and social dimensions of sustainability. The  SDG-classification is based on the "SDG Wedding Cake" classification of the 17 SDGs into the categories economy,  society and environment/biosphere [28]. The wedding cake model organizes the 17 SDGs in different tiers, with the  most basic needs and priorities at the bottom (e.g., eradicating poverty, no hunger) and more complex goals at the top  (e.g., climate action, peace and justice). This classification facilitates understanding and communicating the overall  structure and hierarchy of the SDGs, making them more accessible to a wider audience, including policymakers,  businesses, and the public. Notably, the â€œSDG Wedding Cakeâ€� should be used carefully to avoid oversimplification,  misinterpretation, and neglection of the interconnectedness among SDGs. It is, therefore, important to recognize that  Figure 1: Mapping SDGs to production system in a value stream  660 Maximilian Nowak  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 232 (2024) 655â€“6646 Maximilian Nowak et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000â€“000  all SDGs are important and mutually reinforcing. In other words, efforts should be made to address them  comprehensively and in an integrated manner for sustainable and inclusive development.  3.2.2. Step 2: Linking metrics with the SDGs    In order to achieve a comparable value for each SDG based on its respective metrics, units of individual metrics  are set to a comparable basis. For the SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) this normalization approach is exemplified  while identifying associated challenges. From the literature review, the following metrics (cf. Table 2) have been  identified, that can be linked to the SDG 3. The selection of a limited number of KPIs is particularly relevant when it  comes to measuring sustainability goals in manufacturing SMEs. An excessive number of KPIs can lead to increased  administrative effort and make it more complex to implement sustainable measures [29].   Table 2: Set of metrics for SDG 3 â€“ Good Health and Well-Being  Description Unit Label  Ratio of employees to management at the site % Metric 1.3  Days per year employees commit to social institutions Days per year Metric 2.3  Days per year on sick leave per employee Days per year Metric 3.3  Amount disinfection stations Amount per /employee Metric 4.3  Daylight on the shop floor lm/m2 Metric 5.3  Average temperature over the year in production Â°C/m2*a Metric 6.3  Percentage of burnout in sick leave % Metric 7.3  Blood drives each year amount/year Metric 8.3    It is worth noting that the units of the respective metrics are very different and difficult to compare. Following this  step, steps 3 and 4 deal with metrics weighting and assigning scores.   3.2.3. Step 3: Metrics Weighting  Based on a method from quality management, a pairwise comparison is adopted [30]. Table 3 shows the procedure  as an example for SDG 3. The pairwise comparison of each metric to the others indicates the highest prioritization in  the context of investigation (aka the pilot enterprise). The resulting weights are then transferred to Table 4 for  assigning scores. As stated in the description of step 2 (cf. section 3.1), employing an external moderator attempts to  make sure that the group of employees is able to achieve comparable and realistic results.     Table 3: Pairwise comparison - metrics for SDG 3  Metric 1.3 2.3 3.3 4.3 5.3 6.3 7.3 8.3 Sum Weighing  Factor  1.3 X 0 1 0,5 1 0 0 0 2,5 0,089  2.3 1 X 1 0,5 0,5 1 1 1 6 0,214  3.3 0 0 X 1 0 0,5 0,5 0 2 0,071  4.3 0,5 0,5 0 X 0 1 0 0 2 0,071  5.3 0 0,5 1 1 X 0 0,5 0,5 3,5 0,125  6.3 1 0 0,5 0 1 X 0,5 1 4 0,143  7.3 1 0 0,5 1 0,5 0,5 X 0 3,5 0,125  8.3 1 0 1 1 0,5 0 1 X 4,5 0,161  Sum         28 1,0   Maximilian Nowak  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 232 (2024) 655â€“664 661  Maximilian Nowak et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000â€“000  7  3.2.4. Step 4: Assigning Points  A method from innovation management is adopted for this step, the so-called innovation scorecard [31]. This  facilitates assigning points (scores) to each indicator, including their relative weights defined in the previous step. The  evaluation of the individual metrics is meant to reveal the current status of the enterprise in this action filed. Hence,  assigning 0 indicates that the metric is not yet measured, whereas 1 indicates an already implemented solution for the  measurement. The values in the middle [0, 1] indicate that the metric is already on the enterprise's agenda but is not  yet systematically measured. The method is again self-evaluation combined with an external moderator. The result is  a factor between 0-100, representing the degree to which metrics are measured, grouped under a SDG. Table 4  provides an example of the method for SDG 3 by incorporating the results presented in Table 3. Applying the method  to the other SDGs can also define a weighted score for a larger set of metrics.   Table 4: Approach weighing metrics for SDG 3  Metric Weighing  Factor  No (0), Partly (0,5),  Yes (1)  Weighted Score  1.3 0,089 0,5 =0,089*0,5=0,0445  2.3 0,214 1 0,214  3.3 0,071 0,5 0,0355  4.3 0,071 0,5 0,0355  5.3 0,125 0,5 0,0625  6.3 0,143 1 0,143  7.3 0,125 0 0  8.3 0,161 0,5 0,0805   1,0 SDG 3 - KPI 0,6155=61,55%    Figure 2 depicts the proposed process for the entire SDGs. Comparing values of different units is only possible to  a limited extent since the units express the value in relation to a specific measured factor or standard. Furthermore,  due to the evaluation by the weighting factor and the evaluation according to the points (0; 0,5;1) there is an evident   Figure 2: The overall indicator scheme for improving measurability of SDGs in manufacturing enterprises  662 Maximilian Nowak  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 232 (2024) 655â€“6648 Maximilian Nowak et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000â€“000  inaccuracy. However, with the collection of sustainability metrics, the presented method lays the ground for measuring   attainment of SMEs towards SDGs. The indicator system enables quantitative recording of several metrics linked to  a defined SDG. The enterprise employees involved in the process conduct the evaluation of weighting and assigned  scores. This can potentially lead to vagueness and an internal enterprise bias. Based on the percentages, it is now  possible to determine which SDGs are already being monitored well. This is an indicator of which SDGs metrics still  need to be collected and which projects should be prioritized following step 3 (cf. section 3.1) to improve sustainability  performance. In step 2 of the sustainability check, the current state of sustainability projects and measures is evaluated  using these metrics, thus providing two views on sustainability readiness of an enterprise, i.e. i) assessing how well  the sustainability aspects are already monitored and ii) how the sustainability dimensions, according to the SDGs, are  developed comparing to an industry benchmark. Details of the latter evaluation and associated results will be reported  in the future works.  4. Conclusion and Future Research Agenda  This paper addresses the research question of how a systematic process-driven indicator scheme can be set up for  manufacturing SMEs. The goal is to measure and monitor sustainability performance, based on the SDGs, while  considering the limited resources of small and medium sized enterprises. Following a literature review on related  methods, a three-step approach is proposed to implement a sustainability check for manufacturing SMEs, involving  mapping SDGs to the enterpriseâ€™s value stream, identifying sustainability projects, and road-mapping sustainability  measures. The approach of combining and normalizing multi-dimension metrics creates better comparability between  enterprises. The method has been initially evaluated in a case study in a manufacturing enterprise in the field of  injection molding. Despite promising findings, this paper does not yet report an evaluation of the entire method.  In  the current state of research, the prioritization is in the foreground. This comprises the definition of the status quo, the  identification of fields of action, and the inclusion of all 17 SDGs. The intermediate findings suggest that the approach  and indicator scheme can help manufacturing SMEs to contextualize and match the requirements of the SDGs for  their specific production processes and businesses. The proposed approach can also help identifying SMEâ€™s strengths  and weaknesses in terms of sustainability performance, as well as opportunities and challenges for improvements.  Furthermore, the indicator scheme can provide a quantitative and comparable measure of sustainability performance,  as well as a basis for reporting and benchmarking. In sum, the paper contributes to the literature on sustainability  measurement and management in manufacturing SMEs by providing a comprehensive indicator scheme based on the  SDGs and a practice-oriented, systematic approach to implement it.  Despite merits, the proposed approach faces certain limitations. First, the indicator scheme has far only been tested  in part, i.e., for exemplary SDGs. The full evaluation of the method in a case-study has not been completed. Future  research will, therefore, demonstrate the method for all SDGs and for a complete SME use-case. A further aspect is  evaluating the approach with multiple SME partners, in particular to assess its generalizability. Third, the approach  neither considers potential trade-offs or  synergies among different SDGs or metrics, nor the dynamic and complex  nature of sustainability performance over time. Future research should incorporate these aspects into our approach  and indicator scheme by using more advanced methods such as multi-criteria decision analysis, system dynamics, or  agent-based modeling. Future research should also focus on testing and comparing the presented approach with other  methods and frameworks for sustainability measurement and management in manufacturing SMEs. In addition, the  feedback from the use-cases and the stakeholders involved should be systematically analyzed to ensure the method is  adjusted well enough for most SMEs and their preferences. This will likely result in iterative updates and fine-tuning  of the approach. Last but not least, an important field of research is to investigate how implementation of the approach  can result in better and more effective sustainability measures â€“ ideally, resulting in guidelines in how to systematically  convert the method findings to a more effective sustainability transition for SMEs.

Comprehensive sustainability assessment methods are, therefore, crucial for ensuring competitive advantages of enterprises in the near future. Yet, lack of tailor-made methods particularly for manufacturing SMEs is evident. To address this pathway of research, this paper proposes a comprehensive indicator scheme for measuring and monitoring sustainability performance of manufacturing SMEs aligned with the SDGs. The proposed method is based on a literature analysis of existing measurement approaches. It combines methods from quality and innovation management in a sustainability evaluation scheme especially designed for manufacturing SMEs. The method is demonstrated in excerpts from an industry case study. The preliminary results reveal plausibility of the approach towards enabling enterprises to systematically define sustainability roadmaps and conduct progress monitoring.
