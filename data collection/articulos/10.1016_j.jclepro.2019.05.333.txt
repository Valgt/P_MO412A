                  The lasting urbanization in China has moved to the ‘new-normal’ stage, in which rural-to-urban migration, inefficiency in land use, and insufficient public services are the key challenges. To prevent urban sprawl, the compact city design intensively focuses on the improvement of housing and transport services to increase urban accessibility, vitality and diversity. Clean water and sanitation is also an essential function of cities, but the impacts from China's future urbanization on unheeded water infrastructure were sparsely estimated, especially from a perspective of urban metabolism. This study examines the complex response in the water sector to Chinese urban policies taking resource efficiency into account GHG emissions. A hypothetical grid-city model was developed to connect technical parameters in urban water infrastructure systems to the socio-economic changes, such as population growth, housing blocks, and water end-use. The results show that the pipeline construction dominates material use and locks in significant GHG emissions in the water sector. The most efficient urbanization scenario can reduce 60% of GHG emissions from the water infrastructure, compared to the case of urban sprawl with residency restriction in large cities. A trade-off in scenarios was observed between the optimization for mega-cities and the optimization for the whole of China regarding the additional energy consumption for pumping in the water sector. As empirical evidence of China, this study shows the conflict between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate action) in the urban water sector can be largely alleviated by an efficiency-focused urban policy complying with SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). A loosen migration regulation and compact urban planning in the medium- and large-sized cities are recommended, along with advanced water technologies to promote sustainable urban water management in China.

To prevent urban sprawl, the compact city design intensively focuses on the improvement of housing and transport services to increase urban accessibility, vitality and diversity. Clean water and sanitation is also an essential function of cities, but the impacts from China's future urbanization on unheeded water infrastructure were sparsely estimated, especially from a perspective of urban metabolism. This study examines the complex response in the water sector to Chinese urban policies taking resource efficiency into account GHG emissions. A hypothetical grid-city model was developed to connect technical parameters in urban water infrastructure systems to the socio-economic changes, such as population growth, housing blocks, and water end-use. The results show that the pipeline construction dominates material use and locks in significant GHG emissions in the water sector. The most efficient urbanization scenario can reduce 60% of GHG emissions from the water infrastructure, compared to the case of urban sprawl with residency restriction in large cities. A trade-off in scenarios was observed between the optimization for mega-cities and the optimization for the whole of China regarding the additional energy consumption for pumping in the water sector. As empirical evidence of China, this study shows the conflict between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate action) in the urban water sector can be largely alleviated by an efficiency-focused urban policy complying with SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). A loosen migration regulation and compact urban planning in the medium- and large-sized cities are recommended, along with advanced water technologies to promote sustainable urban water management in China.   Keywords SDG 6  GHG emissions  Urban water systems  Sustainable urban water management  Urban policy  Material flow analysis (MFA)    1 Introduction Urbanization, as a condition at a time point or a process occurring over time, refers to the percentage of a population living in urban areas (United Nations, 2017 ). The ratio of urban inhabitants (referred as to urbanization level) in China has dramatically increased from less than 20% to more than 50% over the past 30 years (NBS, 2018 ) reflecting significant economic achievement in China. Urbanization is believed to become one of the core features to promote both the quantity and quality of socio-economic development in China in the following decades. Several institutions have projected that the urbanization level in China may reach around 70% as of 2050 (Shi et al., 2012 ). During this lasting urbanization, it is of concern how much greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are guaranteed to support China's urbanization and low-carbon transition in the next decades (Shan et al., 2018a ). China's carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions have grown from 3 gigatons (Gt) in 2000 to over 9 Gt in 2015 (Shan et al., 2018b ). Some studies from econometrics address that the elasticity of urbanization level and CO2  emissions is positive but depends on environmental policies among different countries (Ponce de Leon Barido and Marshall, 2014 ; Poumanyvong and Kaneko, 2010 ). Zhu et al. (2012)  found that there is a positive trend between income and CO2  emissions but the non-linear relationship between urbanization and CO2  emission in 20 emerging markets (Zhu et al., 2012 ), suggesting that it is complicated to discuss the future change of urbanization and GHG emissions. Recent evidence in China shows that the population density plays a crucial role in the elasticity of urbanization rate toward GHG emissions, which changes from positive to negative as the growth of regional affluence (Liu et al., 2017 ). Urbanization in China has been mainly driven by rural-to-urban migration for decades (Zhang and Song, 2003 ). Water resource becomes one of the control factors during the urbanization regarding the unbalanced water endowment and unsolved water pollution (Bao and Fang, 2012 ). There are some new directions in China's urbanization transition: harder to register and live in large cities and the constraint on excessively fast urban expansion, especially for mega-cities (Wang et al., 2015 ). Construction of the water infrastructure and consumption in operation and maintenance of water utilities can be expected as growing sources of carbon ‘lock-in’ in the future (Seto et al., 2016 ). The development of the water sector in China and the future growth of water and wastewater facilities cannot be independent of urbanization progress. In China's urban water sector, there is inequality among different types of cities (Long et al., 2018 ). Generally speaking, the smaller and less affluent city has the lower levels of wastewater treatment and water supply coverage and the poorer operation performance in key variables, including water supply reliability, water quality, and financial condition (Browder et al., 2007 ). Based on the information of over 600 water companies in cities, the GHG emissions from electricity consumption for water supply are estimated at 7.6 Mt CO2-e  in 2011 (Smith et al., 2015 ). China has more than 3000 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are dramatically constructed between 2000 and 2012 (He et al., 2019 ). The total methane emissions from municipal WWTPs are estimated at 29 Mt CO2-e  in 2014 (Zhao et al., 2019 ). The holistic evaluation of GHG emissions from water and wastewater facilities is reported at 41 Mt CO2-e  for China as an average between 2006 and 2012 including upstream indirect emissions (Zhang et al., 2017 ). Another feature is the upgrade of China's water utilities accompanying the growth of Chinese income. The performance of water utilities in China is estimated by experts to evolve from the below-the-average performance of OECD countries to a little above the average of OECD countries in less than 20 years (Browder et al., 2007 ). The impacts on future GHG emissions from the upgrade of performance in the water sector are left to be further evaluated. As surface water with the lower-energy requirement is no longer easily available, the GHG emissions from water supply will be more challenging at the global level (Hall et al., 2011 ; Rothausen and Conway, 2011 ). However, some technological innovation can significantly reduce GHG emissions from wastewater treatment and approach energy-neutral WWTPs (Sepehri and Sarrafzadeh, 2018 ; Shen et al., 2015 ). Sustainable urban water management encourages the transition of the urban water system to adapt the uncertain challenges from climate change, population growth, and other socio-economic and environmental pressures (Furumai, 2008 ; Hellström et al., 2000 ). Material flow analysis, footprint analysis, and life-cycle assessment are effective tools to evaluate the environmental pressures of urban systems in a systematic perspective (Chen et al., 2016 ; Goldstein et al., 2013 ). Integrating urban metabolism (UM) into impact assessment and decision support will enable policy implementation to promote resource efficiency and environmental quality in cities (Kennedy et al., 2014 ; Marlow et al., 2013 ). Previous studies mainly focused on the infrastructure of transportation and communication (Canning, 1998 ; Kennedy et al., 2015 ), while fewer studies pointed out the importance of unheeded water infrastructure (Bao and Fang, 2012 ). There are sparse studies on the assessment of material stocks of the water infrastructure (Maurer et al., 2013 ; Pauliuk et al., 2014 ), even fewer with dynamic estimation (Khalkhali et al., 2018 ; Tanikawa et al., 2015 ). However, investment in the water infrastructure can contribute to 15–30% of annual infrastructure investment in the developing world (Bhattacharya et al., 2012 ). China may consume up to 3.3 Gt of construction materials to build municipal water infrastructure, including 170 megatons (Mt) iron and steel and 380 Mt cement by 2050 (Wang et al., 2018 ). Not only material and energy inputs to the water infrastructure should be noticed (Pauliuk et al., 2014 ), but the carbon footprints of the water infrastructure are also significant among public sectors (Larsen and Hertwich, 2011 ). A previous study revealed that per capita material stocks of water and wastewater network tend to decline with growing urban density (Mü;ller et al., 2013 ). Therefore, there is scientific and practical value to reveal the material stocks and hidden GHG emissions under the process of urbanization, especially for the urban water sector (Zhang et al., 2017 ). To promote resource efficiency and mitigate GHG emissions from the urban water sector, it needs a systematic evaluation of how much improvement can be achieved under different scenarios regarding future urban policy and technology change (Poff et al., 2015 ; Smith et al., 2018 ). Sustainable development goals (SDGs) for the 2030 agenda can provide a multidimensional perspective on development, and there are synergies or trade-offs in the interactions among different SDGs (Bleischwitz et al., 2018 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). This study aims to reveal the complex response in China's water sector to the nationwide urban policy taking resource and energy efficiency into account GHG emissions as an empirical study to explore the interactions between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (Climate action) (United Nations, 2015 ). A hypothetical grid-city model was generalized to connect technical parameters in water infrastructure systems to socio-economic changes in cities, such as population density, residential block size, type of land use, and water end-use (Fig. 1  ). This model can help to analyze the material stock, energy consumption, and GHG emissions of the water infrastructure under different urbanization scenarios through the lens of urban metabolism (Zhang, 2013 ). The impacts of urban policies, water technology options, and carbon intensity changes in the energy sector were quantified and integrated into an overall assessment. It provides a broader vision and platform for the communications between water experts and urban planners to forge a new city leadership in sustainable governance (Acuto et al., 2018 ).  2 Materials and methods Fig. 2   shows typical urban water systems and illustrates the movement of water in the urban boundary, which includes water supply system that conveys, stores, and extracts water for purification and distribution, as well as wastewater treatment system that collects, treats, and (if any) reclaims wastewater including sludge treatment/disposal (Venkatesh et al., 2014 ). Operation of water infrastructure will generate GHG emissions directly, including GHG emissions from fuel consumption on site and on transport, methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions from the processes of wastewater and sludge treatment. There are also indirect GHG emissions from energy consumption embodied in (chemical) materials inputted into water/wastewater treatment processes. The operational system boundary is defined within the dashed box due to study objectives (Fig. 2 ). As a policy-orientated study, life-cycle thinking was applied to link substantial direct and indirect emissions to the water infrastructure. The method to estimate the inclusive GHG emissions from the operation phase can be found in a previous study (Zhang et al., 2017 ). Hereafter the approach to estimate GHG emissions from the construction activities is detailed. In a nutshell, there are four types of methods to estimate the stock of the water infrastructure for policy discussion and scenario analysis. (I) Input-Output (IO) model. One can monitor related investment by monetary unit from national or multi-regional Input-Output Tables and then transfer to the physical unit by simplified assumptions on material input intensity (Chen et al., 2009 ; Haimes Yacov et al., 2005 ). This type of top-down estimation could be too general for the water infrastructure if there are very limited numbers of IO sectors, which is holding essential function but not the main stock in cities. (II) Regression (econometric) model. This type of method requires time-series (or panel) statistical data of the water infrastructure and other important socio-economic indicators. One can build a multiple regression model linking the stock growth of the water infrastructure to socio-economic development (Dombi, 2018 ; Hou et al., 2014 ). (III) Generic UM model. This type of method requires deep knowledge of system-of-systems thinking on urban water systems and bottom-up data for physical parameters (Keating et al., 2003 ). One can build a generic UM model to estimate dynamic material stocks and energy consumption based on experimental or empirical parameters of the water infrastructure (Maurer et al., 2013 ; Pauliuk et al., 2014 ; Venkatesh et al., 2009 ). (IV) GIS-based hydraulic model. This method requires detailed hydraulic and geographic data as well as socioeconomic information to simulate the future change of urban form and requirement on the water infrastructure (Heeren and Hellweg, 2019 ; Tanikawa and Hashimoto, 2009 ). The developed tool is more accurate but only suitable if there is an available context-specific database (Makropoulos et al., 2008 ). To focus on the physical material and energy flows, as well as GHG emissions, this study was conducted by using type III method with limited data sources in the water sector for China. 2.1 GHG emissions from the construction of treatment facilities Embodied GHG emissions for construction of the water infrastructure consist of three parts: material and part manufacturing, on-site installation, maintenance and demolishment (Tables S1–S3 ). GHG emissions embodied in material and part manufacturing (p ):(1) E  C ,  f , p  C O 2 e q   = ∑ k   E F  p  C O 2 e q   × Q  k        (2) Q  k   ( t  )  = S  k   ( t  )  − S  k   ( t − 1 )      where E F  p  C O 2 e q      is GHG emission factor (EF) from material manufacturing for construction of per water or wastewater treatment capacity, Q  k      is the growth of treatment capacity, k refers to the water treatment plant (WTP) or wastewater treatment plant. Q  k      in year t equals the stock of k in year t-1 subtracted from the stock in year t. GHG emissions embodied in the on-site installation of the plants (i ):(3) E  C ,  f , i  C O 2 e q   = ∑ k   E F  i  C O 2 e q   × Q  k        where E F  i  C O 2 e q      is GHG EF from the installation phase in the construction of per water or wastewater treatment capacity, mainly referred to the energy use for earthwork and transport. Determination of embodied GHG emission factors E F  p , k  C O 2 e q      could be separated into two parts: carbon intensity (CI) in material manufacturing, and material intensity (MI) for construction of WTP or WWTP. Table S1  shows the summary of CO2  emission intensity for material manufacturing based on current technologies in China. The CO2  emission intensity of steel and cement are dominant compared with other the three materials. Table S2  shows the material intensity in the construction of WWTP based on unit treatment capacity (1 m3 /d). The data in the first row (Zhang et al., 2010 ) was derived from one case study of WWTP (secondary treatment A2 O, 1.5 × 104  m3 /d) and the data in the second row was from the technical guideline for construction of urban sewage treatment project (Hou et al., 2014 ; MCPRC, 2001 ). The differences between two datasets may reflect the change of technology or usual practice in construction since this guideline is a little out-of-date. The CO2  emission factor for WWTP construction were estimated at 181.4 kg CO2 /(m3 /d) based on the study by Zhang et al. (2010) , and 135.8 kg CO2 /(m3 /d) by Hou et al. (2014) . The former result was adopted in the estimation of WWTP for it was closer to the base year in this study.  2.2 GHG emissions from the construction of pipeline systems Estimation of GHG emissions for the construction of pipeline systems is very challenging because there is a gap between statistics on length of pipeline systems and GHG EFs based on the weight (Table S4 ). GHG emissions embodied in material and part manufacturing:(4) E  C ,  l , p  C O 2 e q   = ∑  d   ∑ k   E F  p , k  C O 2 e q   × δ  k   ( d )  × F  d , l   × L  l        (5) L  l   ( t  )  = S  l   ( t  )  − S  l   ( t − 1 )      where E F  p , k  C O 2 e q      is indirect GHG EF for production of unit weight of water pipe or sewer pipe using material k , δ  k   ( d  )     is the converter of weight/length based on the pipe diameter d , F  d , l      is the fraction of length of pipes with diameter d  in sub-system l , L  l      is the growth of pipe length, l  refers to the water pipe system or drainage system. L  l      in year t equals the stock of l  in year t-1 subtracted from the stock in year t. F  d , l      is difficult to estimate since there is no accessible data for China. This study modelled to profile the distribution of pipe diameter in order to convert the material intensity of pipe on the basis of weight into material intensity on the basis of length (Fig. 3  ). Two tiers of pipeline network were assumed in this model. Primary (trunk) network is connected to the treatment facilities (WTP or WWTP). Secondary (ancillary) network connects the private pipes with the primary network. Similar solutions can be found in limited studies (Maurer et al., 2013 ; Pauliuk et al., 2014 ), but the separate sewage system was assumed in this model. Accounting of private pipes is not included in this study due to the study boundaries and insufficient data availability. The key algorithm inside the grid-city model is summarized as equation (6) −(16) to decide the diameter of pipes at each knot, where the inflows and outflows are influenced by the demand from inhabitants (Fig. 1 ). Different population density will change the water demand and wastewater discharge at each knot, which finally impacts the size of pipes in the systems. As shown in Fig. 3 , the inputted information in this model include population density, service area of WTP/WWTP, the average size of unit block, per capita water use (including water leakage in distribution), the smallest pipe size and diameter intervals, mean flow velocity in each system, the ratio of wastewater discharge (to water supply), semi-empirical formula for probability of precipitation, and the shares of different types of land use. The population density, service area, per capita water use, the ratio of wastewater discharge, and the probability of precipitation are needed to estimate total water supply, wastewater discharge, and stormwater discharge, respectively. Block size, the smallest pipe size, diameter intervals, and mean flow velocity can impact the choice of pipe size in the establishment of pipeline systems. The building coverage of land use is required to estimate the average height of dwelling in a residential block. There are some necessary assumptions to reflect the reality for China with some simplification or generalization. For example, the determined service area, block size, the population density was based on the averages of statistics or the defaults in the technical guidelines. The pipeline network is annular, and the main trunk crosses the center of the city. The related parameters in hydraulics calculation were assumed on the homogenous condition of the environment. The outputs from this model mainly are the size (diameter) distribution of pipe, including water pipe, sewage pipe, and stormwater pipe. Distribution of pipe diameter derived from the grid city model depends on all features which can impact the water or wastewater flows. Maurer et al. (2013)  found that the size of catchment area and size of housing plot were two biggest significant factors on modelling results without changing the number of inhabitants (Maurer et al., 2013 ). In this model, the block size was assumed as 500 m for a primary network according to the technical guidelines in China (Beijing General Municipal Engineering Design and Research Institute, 2004 ; Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Insitute, 2004 ). The size of the housing plot for the secondary network was tested between 40 and 200 m. The default service area was set 25 km2  as the quotient of a total built-up area divided by the number of WTP in China. To simplify the estimation of diameter distribution of primary network, it was assumed that only one knot to intake water from the water trunk and one knot to discharge wastewater into the wastewater trunk in one module. The water use includes household use, commercial use, industrial use (linked to urban water systems), and other miscellaneous use. Size of pipes in the establishment of the primary network was determined as follows:(6) TW 0 = TWa × k  1   × k  2       (7) WW 0 = TW 0 × g     (8) ST 0 = φ × SA 0 × A  p   ( T  )   / ( t  p   + b  p    )   n         (9) At  any  knot  :  f  i n f l o w   + f  d i s c h a r g e   = f  o u t f l o w    o r  f  i n f l o w   = f  o u t f l o w   +  f  i n t a k e        Water pipes:(10) ( i )  / D N ( i )  = f  T W   ( j )  ( j )  2   / D N ( j )   5       (11) if  one  pipe  d ,  D N ( a − 1  )  < D N ( d  )  < = D N ( a  )   then  count  L ( a  )  = L ( a  )  + 1     (12) F  d , w p   = L ( d )  / ∑  a   L ( a )       Sewer or stormwater pipes:(13) S  w w   = f  w w    V  w w     / θ  or  S  S T   = f  S T    V  S T     / θ     (14) S ( b  )  = π × D ( b  )   2   / 4     (15) if  one  pipe  d ,  S ( b − 1  )  < S ( d  )  < = S ( b  )     then  count   L ( b  )  = L ( b  )  + 1     (16) F  d , w w / s t   = L ( d )  / Σ  b   L ( b )      where TW 0    is estimated water supply in one block, TWa is average water demand, k 1 : ratio of maximum daily water demand to average daily water demand, k 2 : ratio of maximum hourly water demand; WW 0    is estimated wastewater discharge in one block, g is the ratio of wastewater discharge to water supply; ST0 is estimated stormwater discharge in one block, SA0 is the drained area of one block, φ is the run-off coefficient of rainwater, A  p   ( T  )  / ( t  p   + b  p    )   n      is a semi-empirical equation to estimate rain intensity. f  is flow rate in section, V is flow velocity, S is section area of the pipe, and θ is filling ratio in sewage/stormwater pipe (for sewage pipe θ < 0.75, stormwater pipe θ = 1). DN is the nominal diameter of water pipe, D is the inside diameter of sewage/stormwater pipe, L (a ) means the number of pipe with the diameter a  in this model. equation (10)  was based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation for the estimation of head loss (Brown, 2002 ; Pauliuk et al., 2014 ). In this study, reinforced concrete (RC) pipe and ductile iron pipe were assumed as the default drainage pipe and water pipe in the primary network, respectively. The smallest size of pipe was assumed as follows. The size is 100 mm for water pipe, 200 mm for sewage pipe, and 300 mm for stormwater pipe based on the reality in China. In the ancillary network, PE pipe (20%) and ductile iron pipe were assumed for water pipe, and PVC pipe (20%) and RC pipe were assumed for sewer or stormwater pipe (CUWA, 2013 ). However, the density of pipe in the secondary network depends on the size of a housing plot in the block. If the housing plot is smaller, the pipeline will be denser. The average size of the block in foreign cities is mainly between 40 and 200 m (Huang and Sun, 2012 ), and the size of the housing plot is no larger than the block size which it belongs to. GHG emissions from energy use for the installation of the pipeline (Table S5 ):(17) E  C ,  l , i  C O 2 e q   = ∑ d   E F  i , d  C O 2 e q   × F  d , l   × L  l        where E F  i , d  C O 2 e q      is GHG emission factor from the installation phase in the construction of a unit length of pipe with diameter d . GHG EFs for the installation of pipeline system were collected from previous studies (Imura et al., 1995 ; Yokota et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ). The EF in Zhang et al. (2014)  was derived from a construction project of 400-mm pipe, and EF in Imura et al. (1995)  was based on 700-mm pipe. The regression model proposed by Yokota et al. (2012)  was utilized to estimate GHG emission from energy consumption in the installation phase: E F  C , i   = 0.00002 D  2   + 0.03733 D + 64.39136    for concrete pipe, and E F  C , i   = − 0.00008 D  2   + 0.12621 D + 39.12643    for plastic pipe (unit: kg CO2 /m). Maintenance and rehabilitation of the pipeline system were included in the evaluation. There is no sufficient data for estimation of emissions from the final disposal of the obsoleted pipeline. The additional activity data due to the rehabilitation of pipes was estimated as follows:(18) R  l   ( t  )  = β × S  l   ( t − 1 )      where β    is the ratio of rehabilitated length to the total length of the pipeline, as a simplification, β    is the reciprocal of a life time (LT) of pipes, and default LT = 50 yrs. The requirement of newly built pipeline systems was linked to the expansion of built-up areas in the urbanization.(19) S  i   ( t  )  = [ P  i   ( t  )  − P  i   ( t  '    )  ]  / Dc  i   ( t )      (20) L  i   ( t  )  = S  i   ( t  )  × DL  i   ( t )      where Si  is the growth of the built-up area in urban type i, i includes mega-cities, other cities, and towns. Dci  is population density, DLi  is pipeline density based on area, Li  is the requirement of the newly built pipeline.  2.3 Migration policy in megacities and compact urban planning The growth of new inhabitants in mega-cities, other cities, and towns was predicted by the following equations:(21) Pm ( t )  + Po ( t )  + Pt ( t )  = Pu ( t )      (22) Pm ( t’ )  + Po ( t’ )  + Pt ( t’ )  = Pu ( t’ )       With restriction policy, growth of new inhabitants in larger city is lower:(23) Pm ( t’ )  = Pm ( t )  + ( 0.5 *a 1 )  %* ( Pu ( t’ )  − Pu ( t )  )      (24) Po ( t’ )  = Po ( t )  + a 1 %* ( Pu ( t’ )  − Pu ( t )  )      (25) Pt ( t’ )  = Pt ( t )  + ( 1.5 *a 1 )  %* ( Pu ( t’ )  − Pu ( t )  )       Without restriction policy, growth of new inhabitants in larger city is faster:(26) Pm ( t’ )  = Pm ( t )  + ( 1.5 *a 2 )  %* ( Pu ( t’ )  − Pu ( t )  )      (27) Po ( t’ )  = Po ( t )  + a 2 %* ( Pu ( t’ )  − Pu ( t )  )      (28) Pt ( t’ )  = Pt ( t )  + ( 0.5 *a 2 )  %* ( Pu ( t’ )  − Pu ( t )  )      where Pu: total urban population; Pm: population in megacities, Po: population in other cities, Pt: population in towns, t, t’: observed year, a1, a2: the relative growth rate of new inhabitants. As shown in Table 1  , this assumption of different relative growth rates of the urban population in different sizes of cities and towns is reasonable as a demonstrating projection of global urban population suggests that the portion of the population in large cities with 5–10 million inhabitants is growing by 2030 (United Nations, 2014 ).  2.4 Energy requirement for elevating water in buildings Since the taller buildings require more energy to elevate water to the households living on the higher floors, the compact residential design may introduce additional energy requirement for lifting water. The estimation equations are as follows (Cheng, 2002 ):(29) Ep = ( 0.1635 *γ*Qp*Hp )  ( 1 + α )  ( 1 + β )  / ( 60 *η 1 *η 2 )      (30) Hp = H 0 * [ round ( ( Dc / Nh )  *Ah / ( Db*Pr* 1,000,000 )  )  + 1 ]      (31) GHGp = ( Pu ( t’ )  − Pu ( t )  )  *DWa* 365 *Ep *EF  g r i d       where Ep: unit energy consumption for elevating, kWh/m3 ; γ: specific water weight, 1 kg/L; Qp: pumping capacity, 1 m3 /min; Hp: the height of lift, m; α: safety factor of pump, 0.2; β: friction loss of pipes, 0.3; η1 *η2 : total efficiency of pump, 0.65; H0 : height of one floor, 3 m; Dc: density of population, capita/km2 ; Nh : persons in household, 3; Ah : average floor area per household, 100 m2 ; Db: building density, 20%; Pr: land use percentage for residential area, 40%; DWa: per capita domestic water use, 170L/d; EFgrid : GHG emission factor of electricity.  2.5 On-going water technology impacts To discuss the potential impacts from alternative water technologies, four emergent solutions were picked up as shown in Table 2  , referred to the changes in water supply, wastewater treatment, pipeline system, and sludge treatment and disposal, respectively. The growth of urban inhabitants in the city will increase the pressure for water availability. Now more than half of the cities in China rely on the over-extraction of groundwater (MOHURD, 2012 ). Therefore, it is not sustainable to increase the demands of groundwater in the future. There are several supplementary water sources like the recollection of rainwater, reuse of reclaimed water, or desalinated seawater/brackish water. Desalinated seawater was listed here as an additional water source since there were already several in-use desalination plants in China. The assumption was that growing water requirement due to new urban inhabitants is partially supplied by desalinated seawater by 10%–50%. This value is comparable with the government plan for desalination in 2020. The upgrade of wastewater discharge permits and rehabilitation of pipeline will increase the GHG emissions in wastewater treatment and pipeline subsystems, respectively, especially upgrade of wastewater discharge permits from standard IB/II to standard IA means that many WWTPs need to change their treatment techniques or install advanced treatment process. China faces severe eutrophication and must remove more nutrients in wastewater treatment processes. GHG emissions in sewage sludge disposal are significant but largely depend on treatment technologies (Yoshida et al., 2013 ). Different EFs were applied with or without anaerobic digestion of sludge, whereas incineration, landfill, or agricultural application also have different impacts (Yoshida et al., 2013 ). A detailed LCA result about sludge disposal in one sludge treatment plant in China suggested that anaerobic digestion process could release significant methane, which resulted in much higher EFs of anaerobic digestion (Xu et al., 2014 ) compared with the case in Japan (Hong et al., 2009 ). However, the estimated EFs in this study based on IPCC guidelines are close to Japan's EF (Table S6 ). Japan has limited land resource, and the incineration of sludge is a popular treatment, but there is no such high priority of incineration in other larger developed countries (like the U.S.). Therefore, two cases were estimated for the GHG emission variations from different sludge disposal options for China (Fig. S1 ). One is assumed that the market share of anaerobic digestion in sludge treatment does not change, but the incineration market share changes to 20%. The other is that the market shares of both anaerobic digestion and incineration increase, and the technique of anaerobic digestion combined with sludge incineration become the mainstream technique in sludge treatment and disposal. Currently, dewatering plus landfill is the dominant treatment in China.  2.6 Changing carbon intensity in electricity generation The projection of primary energy consumption by BP Energy Outlook was used in this study to evaluate the CI impacts on the GHG emissions (Fig. S2 ). It says that by 2035 China's energy production will rise by 47% while consumption grows by 60% and coal consumption in its energy mix will decline to 51% in 2035, and natural gas gets to 12%. It also predicts that coal in electricity generation will drop to 58%, and renewable energy will grow from 3% to 13%, and nuclear energy from 2% to 11% (BP, 2015 ).   3 Results and discussion 3.1 GHG emissions from the construction of the water infrastructure Direct and indirect GHG emissions embodied in the construction of water treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants were estimated by equation (1) . During 2006–2012, the annual average growth of water treatment capacity was estimated at 2.60 Mm3 /d, while annual average growth of wastewater treatment capacity was estimated at 8.09 Mm3 /d. Average annual GHG emissions from the construction of WTP and WWTP were estimated at 0.42 Mt CO2-eq  and 2.0 Mt CO2-eq  between 2006 and 2012 (Fig. S5 ). Emissions embodied in material manufacturing were dominant compared with the emissions embodied in installation. GHG emissions from pipeline construction vary significantly from the designed scale of population and end-user demand. Results about the sensitivity analysis are provided in the supporting information (Figs. S3–S4 ). Fig. S3  shows a sensitivity analysis of population density on a water pipeline. The diameter of the water pipe is significantly smaller than the diameter of a sewage pipe in general. When population density is high (D > 20,000), the peak in the distribution of pipe diameter was found at 250 mm, the same as statistical results by Pauliuk et al. (2014) . When population density becomes smaller, the peak of pipe diameter moves to 200 mm; whereas the population density is very low (D = 3,000), the distribution of pipe diameter changes to monotonically decreasing curve and most pipes are chosen as 100 and 150 mm, similar to one pioneer study (Venkatesh et al., 2011 ). The profile of pipelines is highly depended on the designed population density in the residential areas. Conversely, this indicates that when a small or medium city becomes more compact, it may need to rebuild a large part of the pipeline system. Other potential options to adapt the water demand from growing population to suit current centralized system may include regulation of urban land allocation to mitigate the growth of population density, investment on the systems for water reuse and alternative water resources, and deployment of decentralized water supply systems in some communities to increase the system resilience. As for the planning of the pipeline system, the trade-off between current demand and future demand is significant, because reconstruction requires more materials and energy than rehabilitation, inappropriately advanced construction will increase depreciation cost and maintenance cost leading to lower efficiency. Fig. S4  shows the sensitivity analysis on the distribution of sewer diameter. The modeling shows that when population density is high (D > 20,000), the distribution of pipe diameter is inverted U-shaped and most sewer pipes are between 400 and 800 mm; when population density becomes smaller, the number of small pipes (diameter less than 400 mm) is in larger fraction; when the population density is very low (D = 3,000), the distribution of pipe diameter changes to monotonically decreasing curve and the dominant sizes of pipes are 200 and 300 mm. As shown in Fig. 4  , the diameter distribution of the water pipe system is shaper than that of the sewerage system. Diameter distribution of water pipe system concentrates between 200 and 300 mm, while that of the sewer system between 400 and 800 mm. However, the larger pipes contribute significantly on the basis of weight, especially for the sewer system. For example, unit weight of 100-mm PE pipe (thickness, 6.6 mm), 200-mm PVC pipe (thickness, 4.9 mm) 300-mm PVC pipe (thickness, 7.7 mm) were estimated at 2.2, 4.6, and 11.4 kg/m, respectively, according to China's products. The corresponding GHG EFs of PE pipe (100 mm) and PVC pipe (200 mm, 300 mm) were estimated at 5.1, 10.9, 26.9 kg CO2-eq /m, respectively. GHG EFs for production of water pipes and drainage pipes were estimated by weighting different types of materials. In the modeling, the density of the primary (trunk) network was 3.4 km/km2  and the density of the secondary (ancillary) network was 8 km/km2 , which were determined by the size of housing plot (100 m), block (500 m), and service area (25 km2 ). The modelled density (11.4 km/km2 ) of pipeline networks was comparable to the general finding of the density of linear infrastructure as 10.4 ± 2.2 km/km2  in previous literature (Kennedy, 2012 ). Based on the linear regression on statistics between 2006 and 2012 (NBS, 2018 ), annual growth of water pipe system was estimated at 30,000 km/yr, while annual growth of drainage system was estimated at 28,700 km/yr. Average annual construction activity associated with GHG emissions from the water pipe and sewer systems were quantified and shown in Table 3  .  3.2 Urbanization impacts on GHG emissions of the water infrastructure To discuss urbanization impacts on the water infrastructure, acceptance of new inhabitants in mega-cities and compact urban planning were selected to be two key features. China central government tends to restrict new inhabitants moving into mega-cities, to release limited permits of new inhabitants in large cities (3–10 million inhabitants), and to encourage new inhabitants living in other smaller cities and towns. However, megacities usually have better public services and higher efficiency of production, the restriction of migration to larger cities may lose economic efficiency and vitality. Moreover, the compactness of urban development can reduce the growth of land use to impact the efficiency of public infrastructure and services. Options in the panel I was mainly targeted to discuss potential influences on GHG emissions from domestic migration policy and urban planning for China (Table 1 ). Seven megacities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) are grouped, other cities are the second group, and the towns below the criteria of the city (population density, industrial output, current public service level, the seat of local government, etc.) are the third group. Two trends of urban policies in the future were assumed: with restriction to mega-cities or not. Fig. S6  shows the estimated growth of the urban population under different policies. On the other hand, the impacts from high/moderate population density in the urban expansion was introduced in the options. It was assumed that the designed population density in compact cities was 30,000 capita/km2 ; density in dispersed cities (traditional urban sprawl) was 10,000 capita/km2 . The population densities in a built-up area of seven megacities now are between 14,000 and 25,000 capita/km2 . Similarly, population density in compact towns was assumed to be 10,000 capita/km2  and the density in traditional towns was 3,000 capita/km2 . In the model, the residential area was assumed to be 40% of the total land in each block according to the guideline of urban land use and planning standards in China. The building density in a residential area was assumed to be 20% based on the common practice in China. Based on the above assumptions, the weighted EFs for construction of pipeline systems were estimated with different population density (Fig. S7 ). The representative height of the property in the residential area was estimated to be 39 m, 15 m, and 6 m, when the population density was assumed to be 30,000, 10,000, and 3,000, respectively. The GHG emissions from new construction and the additional energy consumption for pumping the water to the high-rise buildings were included under each scenario. As shown in Fig. 5  , if the GHG emissions are controlled with a priority in mega-cities, the best policy is compact urban development with restriction (Option Ic). Although the energy consumption of pumping for lifting water in the compact city will be up to three times as that in a traditional city covered by multi-storey buildings, the energy and material saving in the construction of the pipeline in a compact city is more significant and can offset the disadvantage of additional electricity use. However, if taking the construction activities in all cities and towns into account, the best choice becomes compact urban development without restriction (Option Ia). Because of migration restriction, 170 million inhabitants have to move to towns with poorer public service, the total requirements of the water infrastructure in towns are much more than that in cities. Whereas in options without restriction, 78 million new inhabitants will move to towns, more inhabitants will live in cities due to larger economic and social attractiveness. GHG emissions in a compact city are lower than that in urban sprawl scenarios regarding emissions from urban water infrastructure.  3.3 Water technology impacts on GHG emissions of the water infrastructure Table 2  summarizes four on-going technological solutions from the urban water sector addressed in this study. Option IIa is to upgrade the water pipe system by replacing low-quality pipes with a ductile iron pipe to reduce the water leakage. If all the low-quality water pipes were replaced in the next 20 years, the annual emissions from replacement activities were estimated at 2.15 Mt CO2-eq  per year. However, this replacement could increase the use efficiency in the distribution network, if the leakage rate can be changed from 17% (2010) to 5% (2030), the benefits (avoided emissions) from energy saving due to the smaller water supply will be significant. The avoided emissions due to the reduction of water supply can offset approximately 50% of total emissions related to material manufacturing and installation during the replacement of water pipes (Fig. 6  (a)). Option IIb pertains to the impacts of desalination on the water supply system. Desalination is very electricity-intensive (Hancock et al., 2012 ), and it is usually a supplementary water source. The assumption is that the growing water requirement due to new urban inhabitants is partially supplied by desalinated seawater by 10%–50%. The assumed market growth of desalination is closed to China's government plan. This study found out that the GHG emissions from the operation of water supply will increase by 9%–45% (Fig. 6 (b)). Option IIc is to increase advanced sludge treatment technologies, like anaerobic digestion (AD) in sludge treatment and incineration in sludge disposal. Fig. 6 (c) shows the estimation of GHG variations due to different projections of sludge disposal for China. Increasing penetration of incineration does not change many GHG emissions, but an increase of anaerobic digestion without efficient methane recovery can significantly enlarge the GHG emissions from sludge disposal. Anaerobic digestion can be beneficial to both water and climate rather than a trade-off only under the condition of efficient methane recovery to avoid fugitive methane emissions during the AD and following processes. The best operation can merely release 1% of methane which is theoretically generated through the AD processes (Daelman et al., 2012 ). The utilization of biogas combustion and the collection of fugitive emissions from digested sludge tank and dewatered sludge storage tank are the crucial steps to reduce methane emissions from wastewater treatment (Daelman et al., 2012 ). Option IId is to follow the discharge permit change from China's II standard to IA standard (MoEP, 2002 ). Additional construction of an advanced treatment process and energy consumption is needed to fulfill the new standard (Zhang et al., 2010 ). Average electricity intensity in the wastewater treatment in China was lower than some developed countries that lower treatment level in China may be one of the reasons (Zhang et al., 2017 ). If China upgrades the discharge standard, GHG emissions from operating activities of WWTP will increase significantly (Fig. 6 (d)). This estimation does not include the on-site variations of nitrogen oxide (N2 O) emissions due to the advanced treatment of nutrient removal. Advanced nitrification-denitrification processes can double the GHG emissions from the wastewater treatment process (Soda et al., 2013 ), which calls for further evaluation.  3.4 Carbon intensity impacts on GHG emissions of the water infrastructure Electricity consumption contributes significantly to the total GHG emissions related to the water utilities, and the coal-based thermal power generation is the crucial factor (Peng et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ). Therefore, the change of primary energy consumption will significantly change the EFs in the estimation of energy-related GHG emissions. Based on the collected information of total energy consumption for power generation in China and the prediction by BP energy outlook (BP, 2015 ), this study predicted the temporal variations of total energy consumption for power generation in China. The corresponding CO2  EF will change from 0.806 kg CO2 /kwh to 0.505 kg CO2 /kwh in 2030 (Fig. S2 ). It implies that all the indirect emissions related to electricity consumption in water infrastructure will decrease by one-third in 2030. This will reshape the relative contribution of subsystems in water utilities, and mark non-CO2  emissions in a more critical role in the total GHG emissions. Fig. 7   shows the comparison of GHG emission variations in the panel I and II integrated with a change in the carbon intensity of electricity generation. In the panel I, option Id (urban sprawl, with restriction) with constant carbon intensity (CI) was regarded as a reference line. Other urban development pathways can lower the GHG emissions from 40 to 107 Mt CO2-eq  with the same urbanization level. It is a significant reduction potential. If the change in CI is combined into consideration, the GHG reduction potential will increase another 18–38 Mt CO2-eq . The compact urban design is profound to the sustainability of urban water systems in terms of GHG emissions. In the panel II, different technology options all lead to GHG growth in which promotion of sludge reduction and upgrade of water pipes have relatively small impacts on GHG emissions due to partially positive feedback, and it will be much beneficial to the resource conservation of land and water in the cities. Notably, the implementation of desalination and tightening wastewater discharge permits will significantly increase GHG burdens in urban water systems. Reduction of CI of electricity will only partially mitigate the carbon footprints. Other measures are needed to mitigate GHG emissions from the urban water sector, say, better design and materials to promote resource and energy efficiency, better management to save energy in end-users of electricity in urban water systems, and better application of water reuse (Mo and Zhang, 2012 ; Porse et al., 2018 ; Smith et al., 2017 ).   4 Conclusions and policy implication In this study, a hypothetical grid-city model was developed to connect strategic planning of water infrastructure systems to the outside socio-economic pressures in urban systems, such as population growth, housing and land use, and cleaner energy. This framework was able to project future GHG emissions from the water sector responding to the fast urban metabolism of China. Scenarios regarding three aspects were designed for the future, including changes in domestic migration policy and compact urban planning, alternative technologies in water and wastewater treatment, and the carbon intensity of electricity generation. As one of the trade-offs between SDGs, the conflict between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate action) in the urban water sector can be largely alleviated by compact urban design and an efficiency-focused urban policy (Fig. 7 ), which is within the scope of SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). Compact urban planning without the restriction of migration to mega-cities has a lower cost of GHG in pipeline systems, but too high density in the residential areas may lead to up to three times energy consumption in lifting water to high-rise buildings. The large scale of replacement of water pipe to reduce water leakage will increase GHG emissions, but the avoid emissions due to energy savings in the water supply can offset 50% of relevant emissions between 2010 and 2030. Utilization of desalination and tightening wastewater discharge permits can bring significant impacts on GHG emissions of water utilities in the future. Sustainable management of sludge treatment to recover as much methane as possible will be promising to reduce GHG emissions. Since China's coal dependence in the electricity generation may decline and be substantially replaced by renewable energy, it will reshape the relative importance of subsystems in the water sector and give priority to the regulation against non-CO2  emissions in the treatment. Nevertheless, there is still room to reduce energy-related carbon footprints from the operational management of the water infrastructure in China. This study provides insights dedicated to the sustainability assessment of the water infrastructure from the whole life cycle by using the theory and tools of urban metabolism. There is no transparent and detailed information about China's stock of the water infrastructure, especially for the pipelines. The proposed model can be a generalized prototype to enrich the methodology tools in urban metabolism and also useful to reveal insights into China's urban policy on the water sector for emphasizing the physical material flows and energy flows corresponding to the dynamic changes in the society. This work is an empirical study of China for the multidimensional dialogue under the framework of sustainable development goals. Particularly, SDG 6, SDG 11, and SDG 13 are all of growing importance for the developing world. The implication of this study can be applied to other developing countries as well.
