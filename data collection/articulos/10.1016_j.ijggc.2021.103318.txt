                  For carbon capture and storage (CCS) to be a truly effective option within the efforts being made to mitigate climate change, it must be sustainable. An assessment is therefore required regarding how the deployment of CCS will positively contribute towards the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. This assessment reviews current evidence regarding the interactions between CCS technologies and the SDGs to improve the accessibility of information regarding the relevance and sustainability of CCS as a climate mitigation technology. Implicit in the SDG logic is that the goals depend on each other and enablers for one goal may therefore also potentially act as inhibiters for another goal. When evaluated against the SDGs, CCS shows several positive ‘enabling’ interactions, and fundamentally CCS is ‘indivisible’ with SDG 13 regarding combating climate change. The main ‘inhibiting’ impacts are predominantly due to the requirement for extra energy per unit of electricity produced and the environmental impacts associated with the use of some capture systems. None of the inhibiting impacts identified had ‘cancelling’ interactions against the SDGs covered in this assessment. CCS is therefore a sustainable option to combat climate change and does not prohibit the achievement of any other SDG.

Princetonlaan 6 Utrecht 3584 CB the Netherlands   1 Present address/ affiliation: Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, The Netherlands.      For carbon capture and storage (CCS) to be a truly effective option within the efforts being made to mitigate climate change, it must be sustainable. An assessment is therefore required regarding how the deployment of CCS will positively contribute towards the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. This assessment reviews current evidence regarding the interactions between CCS technologies and the SDGs to improve the accessibility of information regarding the relevance and sustainability of CCS as a climate mitigation technology. Implicit in the SDG logic is that the goals depend on each other and enablers for one goal may therefore also potentially act as inhibiters for another goal. When evaluated against the SDGs, CCS shows several positive ‘enabling’ interactions, and fundamentally CCS is ‘indivisible’ with SDG 13 regarding combating climate change. The main ‘inhibiting’ impacts are predominantly due to the requirement for extra energy per unit of electricity produced and the environmental impacts associated with the use of some capture systems. None of the inhibiting impacts identified had ‘cancelling’ interactions against the SDGs covered in this assessment. CCS is therefore a sustainable option to combat climate change and does not prohibit the achievement of any other SDG.   Keywords CCS  Sustainble development goals  IPCC  Paris agreement    1 Introduction There is a growing body of literature concerning the mainstreaming of climate action into policies directed towards implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There is also a trend of material becoming available examining the interaction of technologies and sectors against SDGs. CCS continues to be perceived as a complex technological solution to climate change, and public understanding of the technology remains low (Pietzner et al., 2011 ). This study therefore aims to substantiate the wider value of CCS, but also to highlight points of attention/action on potentially negative interactions with specific SDGs. A few months prior to the Paris Agreement, in September 2015 ‘Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (United Nations, 2015 ). This resolution, consisting of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which cover a wide range of human development areas and broader environmental sustainability issues, is a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals. Both the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, although negotiated under different multilateral processes, are considerably interlinked. However, not all climate actions may be compatible with the SDGs and vice-versa. Policy makers may be faced with strategic choices where insights into climate-development interactions are key for successful development and implementation of policies and targets that serve both agendas. The IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5 °C has made an initial assessment on the synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options and sustainable development, including CCS use in the energy supply and industrial sectors (IPCC, 2018 ). The Special Report recognised that CCS plays an important role in all deep decarbonisation scenarios. In terms of synergies with the SDGs, it was stated that CCS can contribute to the provision of advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technology, in line with the targets of SDG 7 ‘affordable and clean energy’. The deployment of CCS can also contribute to industrial development, innovation and the provision of new infrastructure (SDG 9). However, alongside these ‘enablers’ of numerous SDGs, a number of trade-offs were also highlighted, leading to potentially ‘inhibiting’ interaction. Firstly, there is the potential for increased coal consumption, due to the increased energy requirements of CCS-equipped coal-fired power plants in comparison to business as usual high-emission operations (SDG 12, responsible consumption and production). There are also potential risks of carbon dioxide leakage from geological storage and CO2  transport infrastructure associated with CCS, although given that no leakage has occurred at a CO2  storage site to date these risks are considered low (SDG 3, good health and well-being). Finally there is also the associated price impacts of lower emission energy through the deployment of CCS, which may affect energy access and poverty due to the associated costs (SDGs 1, no poverty, and 7, affordable and clean energy). The IPCC assessment represents a useful first insight on the interaction of CCS with the SDGs. The review however does appear to place the focus on CCS use with coal-fired power plants, which could mean that SDG interactions of CCS on gas-fired power plants or in the broad range of potential industrial applications (e.g. in the cement, steel, refining and waste-to-energy sectors) have been overlooked. This study provides a dedicated, in-depth assessment which can help to further develop the findings of the IPCC to include both power and industrial CCS applications.  2 Assessment methodology 2.1 Approach There is no set methodology for assessing the interaction of sectors and technologies with the SDGs. Existing studies from the mining and oil and gas sectors are useful as reference documents (United Nations Development Programme, 2016 ) (IPIECA, 2018 ), but the approach taken in these assessments is unsuitable as a means of completing the objectives of this CCS assessment. The mining and oil and gas sectors involve wide-ranging activities with almost unquantifiable impacts across all themes of the SDGs. The breadth and scale of this interaction makes it challenging to include empirical evidence in the assessment. The approach taken in the assessment of Carbon Removal and Solar Geoengineering (Honegger et al., 2018 ) is more suited for CCS, given its technological specificity. However, the assessment includes a multitude of sub-technologies and does not provide sufficient detail to allow conclusions beyond either the presence or not of a technology/SDG interaction. It is therefore a significant challenge to link the complex and precise characteristics of CCS with the broad nature of the SDGs, even with consideration given to the 169 associated targets. An approach has been taken to focus this assessment on the interactions of CCS and SDGs where credible and quantifiable evidence is available. Taking this approach has meant that the authors have had to make a distinction between SDGs considered to have a direct potential interaction with CCS, and those considered to have indirect or limited interaction. 2.1.1 Direct and indirect interactions A direct interaction, either positive or negative, is present if a direct causal link can be identified between the deployment of CCS and a goal associated with an SDG. A direct interaction would generally be backed up with empirical evidence from literature. An indirect interaction, either positive or negative, is present if no direct causal link can be identified. Generally speaking, no empirical evidence is available in such instances. However, through justified extrapolation and expert judgement, some form of interaction is expected. By pre-identifying the potential direct and indirect impacts of CCS, the methodology has been streamlined and the risk of subjectivity in the assessment reduced. A preliminary overview of the outcome of this pre-identification process is provided in Table 1  .  2.1.2 Use of SDG targets Each of the 17 SDGs has a number of associated targets, with each contributing to the achievement of the overall goal. There are 169 targets in total2  2 Full list of targets can be found at: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/ .   . Some of the SDGs have quite a diverse range of targets, and many of the targets have no plausible link with CCS, even though the goal itself is relevant. This assessment focusses on individual targets that have possible interactions with CCS. The keywords contained in the target descriptions are used to constrain the inputs to the literature search.  2.1.3 Evidence collection Each of the direct interactions are subjected to a thorough literature review. Literature used to identify evidence of potential interactions between CCS and SDGs included:• Peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed scientific journal articles  • Official national and international governmental documents  • Other types of grey literature  • Relevant IEAGHG documents  • Use of the Ambition to Action SCAN-tool3  3 The SDG Climate Action Nexus tool (SCAN-tool) is designed to provide high-level guidance on how climate actions can impact achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). https://ambitiontoaction.net/scan_tool/ .      The results of the literature review were recorded in Excel-based literature trackers. A simple scoring matrix was used to assess the credibility and relevance of each piece of literature found. Each piece of information is assigned a score of 1–3 for credibility, and 1–3 for relevance, with the combined score representing the final result. The most credible sources of information can be considered as peer-reviewed literature, whereas least credible information sources would be unreferenced material on websites, for example. Indirect interactions were confirmed via an internal expert review process, which also included literature reviews to confirm the presence or not of direct and/or indirect interactions. For the SDGs identified as having limited interactions with CCS, no further assessment took place.  2.1.4 The Nilsson score assessment While existing SDG, technology and sector assessments, including the SCAN-tool, help policymakers identify synergies and trade-offs between climate actions and the SDGs, there is a need to move beyond these identified linkages and for policymakers to understand how to act upon knowledge of them. As a first step, the International Council for Science has developed a tool, or framework, whereby “interactions between SDGs and targets are classified on a seven-point ordinal scale, indicating the nature of the interaction with other targets, and the extent to which the relationship is positive or negative to help policymakers identify and test development pathways that minimise negative interactions and enhance positive ones” (Griggs et al., 2017 ). Seven possible types of interactions are identified from indivisible to cancelling which correspond to scores ranging from +3 to -3, see Table 2  . These scores can be applied at any level among goals and targets, to individual policies or to actions. Commonly known as ‘the Nilsson score’ (based on the author), its application allows the generation of comparable and robust outcomes. The Nilsson score is the most developed system for assessing SDG interactions, and it has also been applied for the assessment in Chapter 5 of the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5 °C. For these reasons, the Nilsson score has also been adopted for use in this assessment.   2.2 Framework and limitations Within this study, the interactions of CCS with the relevant SDGs are divided into two categories, those relevant for the power sector and those relevant to the industrial sector (e.g. cement and steel). They are assessed based on the comparison between a power or industrial plant with  and without  CCS. The same framework is used in most of the life-cycle assessments (LCAs), which have played an important role in this study, as they quantify the environmental impacts of deploying carbon capture and storage in a plant. The results of the LCAs are mainly reported per unit of electricity produced in power plants (kWh or MWh) and per unit product in industrial plants (kg or ton of cement or of hot rolled coil in the steel industry). This approach is justified since it allows for a comparison between different power generation technologies, fuels and solvents with  and without  CCS as well as the determination of the suitability of industrial plants for the implementation of CCS. When CCS is integrated into a power plant system, the production of 1 kW h of clean electricity then also carries the energy burden of the additional carbon capture and storage processes. This additional energy requirement needs to be satisfied with additional fuel, the supply chain of which is associated with waste and emissions, leading to negative associated impacts to the environment. Therefore, the production of 1 kW h of clean electricity with CCS will have higher associated environmental impacts (other than greenhouse gas emissions) than without CCS, despite dramatically reducing CO2  emissions. This applies under the premise that the power plants’ electricity generation is demand-driven, and not capacity-driven. In a capacity-driven scenario, the addition of CCS does not lead to increased fuel consumption but rather to a decreased electricity output, implying similar indirect environmental impacts as in the case of unabated power production. In a demand-driven scenario, the energy penalty of CCS means that it can be seen as a constraint on meeting energy efficiency targets (SDG 7) but this is only if the assumption that the additional electricity production due to the energy penalty will be supplied by fossil fuels with CCS. In a modern electricity system based on economic generation dispatch (merit order) this may not be the case. It should be noted that defining a suitable counterfactual situation upon which to make this assessment has a major impact on the outcome. Based on the with  and without  CCS-scenarios, CCS is treated as an additional industrial activity which subsequently compares unfavourably because of the additional energy requirement and the associated emissions, despite considerable CO2  emission reductions. To further understand the limitations that the chosen framework poses, one could consider also the ancillary services offered by employment of CCS, such as maintaining system’s frequency and reserving capacity for unexpected demand increases and disturbances, which are not available from intermittent renewables. This contribution for CCS technologies is not depicted on its scoring against the SDGs, which is based on the with  and without  CCS-scenarios. A total of 19 life-cycle assessments (LCAs) were used as references in this study covering both the power and industry sectors, and considering coal, natural gas and biomass (wood) as fuels. The LCAs’ distribution in terms of sector covered and fuel considered is shown in Fig. 1  . All of the LCAs considered coal as fuel. For those LCAs covering the power sector, half of the studies also considered natural gas-fired plants (7 out of total 14 assessments). Most of the studies which cover the industry sector assumed use of natural gas for the additional energy requirements of CCS (3 out of 5 studies). In the power sector LCAs, 4 of the studies investigating natural gas-fired plants (out of a total 7) reported on the environmental impacts, and indicated comparatively smaller impacts on NGCC plants than on coal-fired power plants with post-combustion capture. Similar trends were identified in the industrial sector. Only one LCA included another fuel for power generation, i.e. wood, and even found varying impacts between the three different cases studied: wood combustion with post-combustion capture; wood IGCC with pre-combustion capture; and wood gasification to produce synthetic natural gas with post-combustion capture. It is, therefore, clear that the environmental impacts can vary significantly depending on the fuel and technology used and that coal-fired power plants are better represented in this study. This study has taken a global perspective regarding the interactions between CCS and SDGs. Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that conducting a LCA requires inputs that are country- and region dependent, such the material supply chains and CO2  pipeline distance, and that specific characteristics, for example industrial development, may significantly differ between sectors, regions and countries.   3 Interactions between CCS and the SDGs The results of the literature review for the direct interactions between CCS and the SDGs was conducted by reviewing each SDG separately. The results of the assessment are presented here based on the categories identified in Table 1 , with each SDG being specifically focused on the environment, economy or society (although all are interlinked). 3.1 Environmental SDGs The aim of CCS is to prevent the release of large quantities of CO2  into the atmosphere from large emitters. It is a potential means of mitigating global warming and ocean acidification due to CO2  emissions from industry and heating. The main purpose is therefore directly related sustainable environment goals SDG 13 (combat climate change), SDG 14 (life below water, specifically the target regarding ocean acidification) and SDG 15 (life on land, specifically the targets related to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems’ use and degradation of natural habitats). 3.1.1 SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Since the release of the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC in 2007, CCS has been consistently highlighted as a key mitigation technology for achieving CO2  reductions in the energy supply and industrial sectors (IPCC, 2007 ). In the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, the importance of CCS was further reinforced as many of the global climate mitigation models used in the assessment could not constrain greenhouse gas emissions below 450 ppm CO2 eq by 2100 without the use of the technology. In the most recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C, a target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement, the use of carbon capture and storage, particularly in combination with biomass (BECCS), was again underlined as an unavoidable technology (IPCC, 2018 ). Although SDG 13 encourages action to address climate change and its impacts, it does not include qualitative or quantitative targets for the reduction of GHG emissions. SDG 13 includes a clear caveat acknowledging that the UNFCCC is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. In order not to encroach on the remit of the UNFCCC, SDG 13 focuses on broad policy related targets. Table 3   summarises the assessment of SDG 13 targets and the possible interactions with CCS. As the primary rationale for CCS is the reduction of CO2  emissions, in order to combat climate change, it is considered appropriate that this emission reduction potential is included as part of this assessment. From this perspective therefore, it has been chosen to broaden this assessment to include the potential of CCS to reduce CO2  emissions for the purpose of combatting climate change, consistent with the overall goal of SDG 13. CCS has a large emissions reduction potential. Applying post-combustion CO2  capture to coal and gas-fired power plants can achieve emission reductions per MWh of close to 90 % (Rubin, Davison, & Herzog, 2015). In theory, CO2  capture rates as high as 99.7 % can be achieved at low additional marginal cost in coal and gas-fired power plants equipped with CCUS (IEAGHG, 2019 ). Globally, it has been estimated that there is between 8,000 and 55,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of practically accessible geologic storage capacity, and that for most regions storage capacity will not be the limiting factor for CCS deployment (Kearns et al., 2016 ). There is also discussion regarding the impact of climate change on renewable energy potential (Solaun and Cerdá, 2019 ), highlighting that renewable energy generation may be less resilient to changes in regional climate in comparison to non-renewable energy production. CCS therefore may also strengthen resilience to climate change and allow for sustainable energy production. Overall, the considerable potential for CCS to immediately decarbonise both the power and industrial sector, and the clear expectation that much of the growth in global energy demand will continue to be met by fossil fuels, mean that the deployment of CCS is considered indivisible with SDG 13, combatting climate change, in line with the targets of the Paris Agreement.  3.1.2 SDG 14: Life below water SDG 14 is focused on the protection of the marine environment through the protection of the seas and oceans from pollution and overfishing. This goal also aims to minimise and address the impacts of ocean acidification. There is conflicting evidence regarding the impact of CCS on marine ecotoxicity, with literature suggesting improved performance due to the use of Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) units on capture systems, and on the other hand the use of potentially harmful chemicals, such as the benchmark post-combustion CO2  capture solvent, 30 wt% aqueous mono-ethanolamine (MEA), in the power sector. The impact of industry CCS is also reported negatively, though only two sources have been used. Regarding CO2  storage, there are a number of marine treaties in place to manage the activity and ensure that it can be implemented in an environmentally benign manner. Furthermore, there is no literature to suggest that either closed nor currently operational CO2  storage sites are leaking. This could warrant a re-examination of the IPCC’s findings which highlighted a counteracting interaction between CCS and SDG 14 due to the risk of CO2  leakage to the marine environment. Finally, CCS can contribute greatly to the stabilisation and reversal of ocean acidity. The literature review is summarised in Table 4   and shows that CCS has positive interactions enabling goal 14.3 to reduce ocean acidification but also potentially negative interactions with target 14.1.  3.1.3 SDG 15: Life on land SDG 15 relates to life on land covering both the reduction of wastes as well as the sustainable management of resources such as soil, forests and wetlands to help maintain good biodiversity and healthy ecosystems. Power or industrial CCS could interact with the freshwater ecosystems due to the water that is used for CCS and then released. Also, the atmospheric emissions other than CO2  could impact the surrounding environment. In addition, CCS deployment might reduce the need for other land-intensive low carbon measures (e.g. wind parks, afforestation, hydropower projects). By-products and emissions from the CCS systems could negatively interact with the surrounding habitats. Reducing CO2  emissions would reduce damaging climate effects on biodiversity. The relevant indicators, as described by (Korre et al., 2010 ), for life on land include:• Global Warming Potential (GWP) – impact of anthropogenic emissions on earth’s climate  • Eutrophication Potential (EP) – impacts from high levels of macronutrients on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems  • Acidification Potential (AP) – impacts from acidity in soil, water, and organisms  • Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential (FAETP) – impact of toxic substances on the freshwater ecosystem  • Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) – interaction of chemicals with sunlight to form certain air pollution, potentially interacting with plants  • Terrestrial Ecotoxicity Potential (TETP) – impact of toxic substances on the terrestrial ecosystem    The literature review is summarised in Table 5   and overall, LCAs show that for both power and industrial plants, adding CCS will significantly reduce the Global Warming Potential, yet this is accompanied by a general rise in emissions from the plants, impacting terrestrial ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems. The water usage also is significant for CCS, which could similarly impact habitats.   3.2 Economic SDGs CCS also directly relates to some of the economic SDGs, mainly relating to economic growth (SDG 8), industry and infrastructure (SDG 9) and responsible production and consumption (SDG 12). This assessment has approached the issue of interaction between CCS and SDGs on a global level. But, as the outcomes of the evaluations concerning employment, economic growth and industrial development highlight (particularly SDGs 8 and 9), the economic impacts of CCS may differ between region, sector and a country’s dependence on fossil fuels. 3.2.1 SDG 8 Decent work and economic growth SDG 8 aims to ‘Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all’. It includes targets that cover various aspects of economic growth, improved productivity and resource efficiency, the decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation, and achieving full employment and decent work. Because the development and deployment of CCS combines very substantial investment in innovation and infrastructure development, and because it has clear implications for the future role of fossil fuels (and the industries which extract, process, transport and use them) in low GHG energy system scenarios, CCS is likely to interact with SDG 8 in various ways, some more directly than others. The economic impacts of the deployment of power CCS are not well covered in the academic (or other) literature, which limits the evidence base that can be drawn on to support any assessment of the interactions with SDG 8. The only paper identified that focusses predominantly on the economic impacts of CCS is a 2015 paper by (Koelbl et al., 2015 ) which explored the employment, gross value added, and import dependency impacts of a mitigation scenario versus a scenario without CCS (for Europe) and focuses on bio-energy CCS. Regarding the US coal sector, one paper has investigated the role CCS could play in creating and retaining employment, but this paper also focuses on bio-energy CCS (Patrizio et al., 2018 ). An evaluation of the UK CCS investment scenarios, including the impact on identified linked economies, has also been undertaken to determine the potential for jobs, gross value added, and other benefits. This report concluded there are economic benefits to deploying CCS along the East Coast of the UK through the creation of jobs and from the import and export of CCS-related goods and services (Summit Power, 2017 ). The UK Government’s recent commitment to spend a minimum of £800million to promote the development of CCS has also been linked to positive impacts to the wider economy, as the investment can lead to almost 3,850 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs in the first year (Turner et al., 2020 ). For industrial CCS applications, no specific evidence has been identified about potential economic impacts (generally, there is less evidence about industrial CCS). The social value of various energy transition scenarios has also been investigated (Patrizio et al., 2020 ) which concluded that energy based systems on 100 % renewables provide the least socio-economic benefits. It was demonstrated that the deployment of CCS can add value and generate positive socio-economic impacts in the transition scenarios investigated. The assessment of SDG 8 is summarised in Table 6  , and overall, at sector level, positive impacts are associated with fossil fuel related sectors. CCS can also provide more jobs and allow more jobs to be retained. The net employment effects of CCS versus alternative energy sectors are unclear. CCS can contribute to decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, however it also leads to an increased energy requirement compared to the higher carbon intensity alternative. It is reminded that the counterfactual used in this study is the power/industry plant without CCS in a demand-based scenario, thus an additional power demand in order to capture the CO2  emissions is present.  3.2.2 SDG 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure SDG 9 aims to “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”. Four out of five primary targets seem likely to have synergies with CCS (though potentially trade-offs too), as targets relating to access to financial services and ICT are not relevant. No literature was identified which specifically explores whether CCS deployment has synergies with the thematic areas of industry, infrastructure and innovation, at least that could be broadly applicable outside specific country (or even sub-national) contexts. A summary of the literature review is presented in Table 7  . SDG 9 addresses several broad thematic areas, and overall, interactions between CCS and some of these may be difficult to measure or predict and are perhaps best considered qualitatively.  3.2.3 SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production SDG 12 deals with the consumption and production practices of companies. It aims to reduce the strain on natural resources, as well as reduce the waste streams that end up in the environment, be it on the land, air or water. Using CCS will positively impact the CO2  emissions from a power or industrial plant and could be a way for companies to adopt the sustainable practice of reducing CO2  emissions, therefore positively interacting with targets 12.4 (minimise chemical and waste release to air) and 12.6 (adopt sustainable practices). CCS requires energy and the operations generate chemical waste which may negatively interact with targets 12.2 (efficient use of natural resources) and 12.5 (reducing waste). Target 12.c is to rationalise inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances. Power CCS could be a positive option to reallocate inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies to help offset their environmental impact. The literature review, summarised in Table 8  , demonstrated that CCS is a positive way for companies to adopt responsible practices to maintain industrial production, while reducing CO2  emissions. The use of CCS does, however, lead to increased energy consumption and there is production of waste from the capture process.   3.3 Societal SDGs The majority of the SDGs relating to societal developments are not directly relevant for CCS. Direct interactions were identified for SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 3.3.1 SDG 3 good health and wellbeing The SDG 3 targets primarily relate to health issues that will not be influenced by CCS. Two, in particular, are relevant: targets 3.4 and 3.9. Target 3.4 relates to non-communicable diseases, which can be caused by environmental pollution, and target 3.9 relates to health impacts caused by environmental pollution. The latter is critical, since any impacts linked to CCS from target 3.4 would essentially be applicable for target 3.9 as well. Local environmental pollution may increase due to emissions from capture plants, though this varies with capture technology. Moreover, increased lifecycle pollution in fossil fuel supply chain is possible as a result of increased fuel requirement to run a capture plant. The overall conclusion of the papers reviewed is that deployment of CCS technologies in the power sector leads to increased negative human health impacts, though there are some important differences between fuels and technology types (with MEA generally performing worse than alternatives). For CCS in industrial applications, there is considerably less LCA literature available than for power CCS. Although the evidence base for health impacts from industrial CCS applications is small, the studies indicate that CCS leads to worse performance on Health Toxicity Potential (HTP) indicator, mainly due to emissions associated with coal production. Both positive and negative effects are shown on the two additional relevant indicators, the photochemical oxidant creation potential (POCP) and the particulate matter (PM) formation. The assessment of SDG 3 is summarised in Table 9   and is based on the overall conclusion that deployment of CCS leads to both negative and positive human health impacts depending on capture technology and fuel, this outcome both aids and clashes with the objective of the relevant SDG targets which are to reduce negative health impacts through reduced pollution (3.9) and non-communicable diseases (3.4).  3.3.2 SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation SDG 6 aims to ensure access to safe water sources and sanitation for all. Some CO2  capture systems use chemical solvents whose production and use could have an impact on water quality. The increased energy requirements in the CO2  capture system can increase pollution due to increased coal production (relating to target 6.3 on reducing pollution). Furthermore, CO2  capture at power plants needs additional energy (steam), which may mean that more cooling water is needed at the power plant (relating to target 6.4 on water-use efficiency). However, increasing published evidence shows that adding capture does not need to increase water consumption. CO2  capture at industrial installations will also need additional energy which could have an impact on water use. The assessment of SDG 6 is summarised in Table 10  . The increased environmental impacts on freshwater ecotoxicology of CO2  capture systems and the possible additional water use associated with CO2  capture indicate an overall constraining interaction between CCS and SDG 6. The possibility for reduced water consumption in modern plant designs could improve this scoring in the future (Magneschi et al., 2017 , Giannaris et al., 2020 , Zhu et al., 2021 ).  3.3.3 SDG 7 affordable and clean energy SDG 7 is focused on increasing the provision of affordable and clean energy. Key objectives include providing universal access to energy, increasing energy efficiency and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy. Adding CO2  capture technology onto a conventional gas or coal-fired power plant will increase the capital and operational costs to the plant, pushing up the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). These increases can be quite considerable. Adding CO2  capture to a new coal-fired power plant can increase the LCOE by between 35–40 %, and between 27–33 % for new natural gas combined cycle power plants (Rubin, Davison, & Herzog, 2015). These are by no means the only figures available for the levelised cost of CCS, however these can be considered as well-representative from literature. However, LCOE is not a sound measure when comparing baseload power plant with intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). So, to fully explore the issue of affordability, it’s important to look beyond individual LCOE of CCS at plant level, and to consider the role of the technology as part of a future energy system. Reliability in the context of SDG 7, is interpreted to be concerned with power systems being able to meet the demand for power in a consistent manner without the risk of shortages or interruptions. Fossil-fuel powered generation can provide reliable and dependable power generation that can be used to match demand. The addition of CCS to a coal or gas-fired power will not affect the dispatchable nature of these plants. Regarding energy efficiency, adding CCS to any power or industrial installation will lead to an inherent energy penalty, which is a direct trade-off with the climate benefits to be achieved, as also elaborated earlier. It has been reported that the heat required for the regeneration of amine-based solvents in a post-combustion CO2  capture system can reduce the overall efficiency of the power plant by as much as 25 % for coal-fired power plants and 20 % for gas-fired power plants (Ou et al., 2016 ). Similar impacts on energy efficiency are expected in the industry sector. Some industrial processes producing hydrogen, particularly those based on steam-methane reforming or gasification, already capture CO2 , which is expelled into the atmosphere as a by-product. Under these circumstances, the energy penalty for CCS would be limited to transport and storage of the CO2 . Whereas CCS offers a reliable, and in the long-term, cost-efficient power supply, the energy needed to operate CCS hinders energy efficiency goals. The assessment of SDG 7 is summarised in Table 11  .  3.3.4 SDG 11 sustainable cities and communities SDG 11 aims to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. The only SDG 11 target with clear direct relevance for CCS is 11.6 which focusses on environmental impact including air quality and waste management. The environmental footprint of a city includes the electricity and industrial products it consumes, whether these are produced near the city or not. The sustainability, or not, of these inputs thus contributes to the sustainability of the city itself. CCS reduces the GHG emissions of electricity and industrial processes, thus can help provide cities with sustainable inputs from a GHG perspective. However, some environmental impacts (especially air quality) are worse with CCS, and the energy penalty increases supply chain impacts, including mining waste. The literature review is summarised in Table 12   and shows that CCS applications in the power and industrial sectors have both enabling and counteracting interactions with SDG 11.    4 Overview of CCS interactions with SDGs Due to many of the individual targets being multifaceted, assigning a single Nilsson score to each SDG is not always appropriate or beneficial, as shown in the overview provided in Fig. 2  . For example, where CCS can be considered enabling for target 12.6 ‘encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices’, it is at the same time counteracting to target 12.2 which includes ‘the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources’, due to the associated energy penalty of the additional CCS processes.  5 Knowledge gaps identified The counteracting and constraining interactions between CCS and SDGs are generally informed by the negative scoring of CCS in LCAs found in literature. However, the bulk of these LCAs are focussed on the capture of CO2  from coal-fired power plants using conventional chemical sorbents such as MEA. This combination of capture technology and CO2  source leads to pronounced environmental impacts both upstream (additional coal mining), and also from the capture system (emissions to air, water, MEA production and waste disposal). Fewer LCAs are available for natural gas power plants (which could have less pronounced upstream emissions) or the application of CCS in other industries (see Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, few literature sources could be found which examine the life-cycle impacts of alternative CO2  capture systems, such as calcium looping or aqueous ammonia. These literature sources, (Petrescu et al., 2017 , Chisalita et al., 2019 , Bosoaga et al., 2009 ), indicated that such systems have reduced environmental impacts compared to those based on MEA. Additional LCAs examining these systems are therefore needed, with particular attention given to novel capture technologies expected to be able to compete with incumbent technologies. Particular attention should be given to so-called second-generation solvents, which are representative of commercially available technologies, and thus are likely to be the first technologies to be adopted when implementing CCS commercially. LCA material on the application of CCS in industry is limited. Many of the conclusions in this assessment regarding the application of CCS in industry and the potential environmental impacts of doing so have been founded on expert judgement based on assumptions of industrial processes. For example, post-combustion capture is considered as feasible for blast furnaces and cement kilns, and thus may have similar environmental impacts as applications of the same system in the power sector. However, there is a wide range of industrial processes, each with different CO2  capture possibilities and process configurations (ZEP, 2015 ). Specific LCA work completed on CCS applications in industrial sectors could be greatly beneficial to support the conclusions of this assessment, and to boost understanding of this topic in genera. More consistent and clear reporting of where in the life-cycle particular environmental impacts occur and clearer sensitivity analysis to show how important certain assumptions are, would be beneficial to this assessment. With regards to impacts on human health (measured using the indicator HTP), a relative assessment of the health impacts from CCS versus other current or potential contributors would help with contextual understanding of rather abstract indicators. Frequently in LCA studies, a description of the connection between the impact indicators and the degradation of the terrestrial or freshwater ecosystems is lacking, making it difficult to have a physical understanding of what the potential impacts are. Also, the specific interactions of some emissions are still ambiguous, and this can be seen by the variation in results from the LCAs, even for comparable activities.  6 Concluding remarks CCS has a number of direct positive interactions with ten out of the seventeen SDGs. Global modelling assessments from both the IPCC and IEA indicate that the significant deployment of CCS is a key enabler and indivisible in combating climate change (SDG 13), in line with the goals of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. CCS plays an enabling role in the provision of affordable and clean energy and can support the decarbonisation of industry, both through direct emission reductions and also indirectly through the supply of low carbon power (SDG 7). Evidence has been found that CCS can support the retention of jobs in certain sectors and contribute to a decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation through the reduction of CO2  emissions (SDG 8). Furthermore, CCS can enable sustainable infrastructure developments, provide a boost to innovation systems (SDG 9), and reduce the carbon footprint of cities to make them more sustainable (SDG 10). Through the reduction of CO2  emissions to the atmosphere and the subsequent lowering of the CO2  concentration in the atmosphere, CCS can enable the stabilisation of ocean acidification, a key target of SDG 14. In contrast to the IPCC Special Report 1.5 °C (IPCC, 2018 ), no evidence of leakage to the marine environment could be found, and CO2  storage appears to be adequately regulated in many parts of the world through extensive marine treaties. When evaluated against the SDGs, there are also a number of areas where CCS deployment may inhibit some targets. Capturing CO2  from the power and industrial processes has to be considered as a significant supplementary industrial activity which can have impacts on a range of environmental media. A primary cause of these negative environmental impacts are the waste and emissions in the coal supply chain, while the use of chemical solvents in conventional post-combustion capture systems (mainly their production and associated emissions) seem to also contribute. The majority of life-cycle assessments indicate emissions to air and water and the production of wastes through the use of CCS. These emissions result in the technology having counteracting or constraining interactions with SDGs 3, 6 and 15, which have a strong focus on reduction of any form of discharge to the environment. It is noted that natural gas and biomass show overall significantly lower impacts than coal. CCS technology could also be considered as constraining in meeting energy efficiency targets of SDG 7, due to the inherent energy penalty associated with operating CO2  capture systems. It is important to note, however, that the CCS did not score a -3, indicating a cancelling interaction, against any of the SDGs covered in this assessment. In conclusion, the construction and use of all low carbon technologies have various environmental impacts, incurring trade-offs with the targets of the SDGs. Evaluating these trade-offs in isolation is likely to have limited value for policy development, given that the deployment of not one single low-carbon technology will allow the achievement of both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. It is recommended that future assessments of low carbon technology interactions and the SDGs should take a portfolio approach, comparing diverse sets of technologies and actions with various degrees of application, and reflecting country-specific economic, geographic and environmental considerations, in order to minimise the inevitable trade-offs between climate action, energy security, energy efficiency, investment, trade and sustainable development for all.
