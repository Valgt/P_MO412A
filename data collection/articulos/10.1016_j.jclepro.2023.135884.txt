                  The establishment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 within 17 SDGs of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda operationalizes the discussion of how to tackle energy challenges for the delivery of energy sustainability. Few studies have yet produced composite indices to capture the multi-dimensional nature of energy development as well as a general and operational framework for the evaluation of countries’ overall performance on achieving SDG 7 remains absent. This hinders the quantitative assessment of interactions between SDGs at the specific target level. To address this gap, a composite SDG 7 index (SDG7I) was developed with the applications of the “STAR” (Straightforwardness, Transparency, Availability, and Readiness) protocol in pursuance of universal energy sustainability. Further, the correlation structure between SDG 7 for energy and SDG 6 for water was performed. The assessment showed that a majority of countries around the world are on course to achieve universal energy services, but the implementation pace of service coverage in Sub-Saharan African countries needs to be substantially augmented. It was also found that the SDG7I score differed considerably between countries and territories, with 8.6% (20 out of 232) of the countries in the world belonging to high levels and 34.1% (79 out of 232) located in medium-high levels. 86% (67 out of 78) of the total interactions had interrelationships statistically, and the synergies largely outweighed the trade-offs relations, which accounted for 70% (54 out of 78) of the total globally. These experiments evinced that the “STAR” protocol has the great applicability to facilitating the evaluation of synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their targets grounded in specific context with differential circumstances across the 2030 Agenda. The protocol also allows identifying the policy sensitivity of the SDG indicators and fosters multi-level governance and collaboration to leverage synergies and resolve trade-offs.

Handling Editor: Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida The establishment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 within 17 SDGs of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda operationalizes the discussion of how to tackle energy challenges for the delivery of energy sustainability. Few studies have yet produced composite indices to capture the multi-dimensional nature of energy development as well as a general and operational framework for the evaluation of countries’ overall performance on achieving SDG 7 remains absent. This hinders the quantitative assessment of interactions between SDGs at the specific target level. To address this gap, a composite SDG 7 index (SDG7I ) was developed with the applications of the “STAR” (Straightforwardness, Transparency, Availability, and Readiness) protocol in pursuance of universal energy sustainability. Further, the correlation structure between SDG 7 for energy and SDG 6 for water was performed. The assessment showed that a majority of countries around the world are on course to achieve universal energy services, but the implementation pace of service coverage in Sub-Saharan African countries needs to be substantially augmented. It was also found that the SDG7I  score differed considerably between countries and territories, with 8.6% (20 out of 232) of the countries in the world belonging to high levels and 34.1% (79 out of 232) located in medium-high levels. 86% (67 out of 78) of the total interactions had interrelationships statistically, and the synergies largely outweighed the trade-offs relations, which accounted for 70% (54 out of 78) of the total globally. These experiments evinced that the “STAR” protocol has the great applicability to facilitating the evaluation of synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their targets grounded in specific context with differential circumstances across the 2030 Agenda. The protocol also allows identifying the policy sensitivity of the SDG indicators and fosters multi-level governance and collaboration to leverage synergies and resolve trade-offs.

With the concern on energy poverty ( González-Eguino, 2015 ) and global warming associated with unprecedented extreme weather events (Reichstein et al., 2021 ), the exigencies of promoting energy sustainability have gained soaring attention. The establishment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 in 2015—one of 17 SDGs featured by a United Nations (UN) Resolution known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (the 2030 Agenda) (United Nations, 2015 )—resonates with these demands. Ever since then, SDG 7—Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all —has been one of the hubs of the 2030 Agenda (Madurai Elavarasan et al., 2021 ). There is strong evidence on interrelationships between SDG 7 and other SDGs, owing to the specificity of the SDG targets that enables maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs across domains (Malagó et al., 2021 ). Moreover, the announcement of Energy Compacts at the HLDE (High-level Dialogue on Energy) in 2021—the first global gathering to address energy challenges under the UN General Assembly over the past four decades (United Nations, 2021 )—signifies a universal commitment to accelerate progress towards the achievement of SDG 7 across the world (International Institute for Sustainable Development, 2021 ). Therefore, the question of how to deliver energy sustainably necessitates empowering adequate actions to tackle energy challenges in accordance with SDG 7 targets. SDG 7 entails three outcome-based targets embodying a variety of energy challenges—energy services (target 7.1), renewable energy (target 7.2), and energy efficiency (target 7.3)—and two means-based targets (targets 7.a–7.b). However, existing literature dominantly addresses one specific energy challenge at restricted spatiotemporal scales (Xu et al., 2020 ), and few studies have constructed composite indices to capture the multi-dimensional nature of energy development. For instance, Munro et al. (2017)  investigated modern and traditional tensions of cooking energy in Sierra Leone through the lens of energy justice. Acheampong et al. (2017)  scrutinized the biofuel debate in pursuit of SDG 7. Chirambo (2018)  unveiled how renewable energy investments have been promoted by climate finance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Schmidt et al. (2019)  explored the adverse effects of rising interest rates on the costs of renewable energy. Adom et al. (2021)  disclosed the energy efficiency-economic growth nexus conditioned on income inequality levels. O and Kim, 2019  presented a brief appraisal of the SDG 7 implementation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in view of limiting global temperature rise to 2 °C. Santika et al. (2020)  assessed the linkages of Indonesia's energy policies to the SDG 7 targets. Also, little progress has been made on developing a quantitative framework for composite SDG 7 or other SDGs. Elavarasan et al. (2022)  deciphered sound operationalization of SDG 7 by examining the convolutions of energy challenges. Herrero et al. (2020)  formed an inclusive green index circumscribed to SDG 7 based on the green economy measurement framework by PAGE (2017) . Kynčlová et al. (2020)  introduced one composite SDG 9 index to measure the progress towards achieving industry-related targets with a geometric mean using equal weights. Huan et al. (2021)  developed a composite SDG index to assess the progress in achieving SDGs across 15 ‘Belt and Road’ countries through entropy method and equal weights. These studies, however, failed to portray a general and easy framework for the evaluation of countries' overall performance on achieving SDG 7 or other SDGs. Moreover, SDGs should be regarded as systematical interacting components rather than simple collection of goals, targets, and indicators (Pradhan, 2019 ). Energy and water are fundamental resources in sustaining the Earth's life-supporting systems and cornerstones of socioeconomic well-beings (Irannezhad et al., 2022 ), it is therefore of great significance to quantify the interactions between SDG 7 and SDG 6 (water and sanitation) as well as their different characteristics at diver-levels of disaggregation (e.g., targets, indicators, and development groups) in a holistic manner. A growing body of studies has examined the interactions among SDGs on the basis of literature investigations and/or original SDG databases. Fuso Nerini et al. (2018)  made a formative attempt by employing a consensus-based expert elicitation process, when assessing the synergies and trade-offs between SDG 7 and other SDGs. Taka et al. (2021)  coupled cross-sectoral correlation analysis with peer-reviewed publications to manifest the potential of water security in leveraging the 2030 Agenda. Pradhan et al. (2017) , Kroll et al. (2019) , and Warchold et al. (2021)  combined original SDG databases with correlation analysis to evaluate the synergies and trade-offs among each SDG with limited data availability. Yet few studies laid a foundation for the quantitative assessment of the interactions between SDGs within the same universal framework at target level. Consequently, these knowledge gaps were bridged by unravelling the global SDG 7 implementation baseline in the light of relevant indicators, yielding a new composite index within a quantitative spatial analysis framework. In more detail, a ubiquitous composite SDG 7 index (SDG7I ) was developed with the applications of the “STAR” protocol in pursuance of energy sustainability. The “STAR” (Straightforwardness, Transparency, Availability, and Readiness) protocol offers standardized procedures of forming an indicator framework to construct a composite SDG index (Cai et al., 2021 ). The applications of the protocol allows the selected indicators to track the SDG 7 targets (energy challenges) as well as the composite SDG 7 index to monitor the holistic implementation progress globally by country (Cai et al., 2021 ). The standardized procedures facilitate mapping synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their targets across the 2030 Agenda. The specific objectives are to: (1) construct a composite SDG7I  by following the “STAR” protocol; (2) assess the country-level implementation baseline of each SDG 7 indicator and their contributions to the index; and (3) investigate the interactions of the indicators and indexes between SDG 7 and SDG 6 across countries and development groups.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sustainable Development Goal 7 index construction 2.1.1 The “STAR” protocol The “STAR” protocol encompasses four core principles—Straightforwardness, Transparency, Availability, and Readiness—of selecting and modifying the official UN-adopted SDG indicators for constructing a specific composite SDG index (Cai et al., 2021 ). Its application to the indicator framework of the SDG7I  was performed with the following standardized procedures (Cai et al., 2021 ).1. Straightforwardness:  the selected four SDG 7 indicators have well-established definitions and integrated monitoring methodologies (Table S1 ). They cover all three outcome-based targets that embody SDG 7 dimensions to portray holistic energy challenges for energy sustainability assessment.  2. Transparency:  the original data of SDG 7 indicators were obtained from open-access databases. Data sources of each indicator were listed in Table S1 .  3. Availability:  the indicator adjustment will be possible to fit to data requirements at country scale worldwide (Section 2.1.2 ).  4. Readiness:  the selected SDG 7 indicators are ready to provide direct feedback for policy implications (Section 4 ). Also, the implementation baseline of the indicators was examined at a starting point of the year 2015, which leads to an inclusive picture going beyond the results from the energy progress report on tracking SDG 7 (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, 2021 ).     2.1.2 Indicators 2.1.2.1 Indicator 7.1.1 – access to electricity Target 7.1 expects that people could access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030. Of which, the indicator 7.1.1 underlines the proportion of population with an access to consistent electricity supply (United Nations Statistics Division, 2021 ; Table S1 ). It is presented as(1) I 711  = P E  P t   × 100     where I 711   is indicator 7.1.1 (%), P E   is population with access to electricity, and P t   is total population.  2.1.2.2 Indicator 7.1.2 – clean fuels and technology The indicator 7.1.2 is defined as the proportion of population using clean fuels and technologies for heating, cooking, and lighting (the definition of “clean” is referred to Table S1 ) (United Nations Statistics Division, 2021 ). Its equation is expressed as(2) I 712  = P C F T   P t   × 100     where I 712   is indicator 7.1.2 (%), and P CFT   is population using clean fuels and technologies.  2.1.2.3 Indicator 7.2.1 – renewable energy Target 7.2 manifests substantial increases in the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. The indicator 7.2.1 denotes the percentage of renewable energy consumption in the total final energy consumption (United Nations Statistics Division, 2021 ; Table S1 ). It is presented as(3) I 721  = E C R   E C t    × 100     where I 721   is indicator 7.2.1 (%), EC R   is renewable energy consumption, and EC t   is total final energy consumption.  2.1.2.4 Indicator 7.3.1 – energy productivity Target 7.3 portrays the target to globally double the rate of improving energy efficiency. The indicator 7.3.1—the ratio of primary energy supply to GDP (United Nations Statistics Division, 2021 ; Table S1 )—addresses the contribution of technological innovation to energy sustainability. To keep this indicator in line with other indicators for aggregating the index, scaling is mandatory to allow the values within the range between 0 and 100% in ascending order (Cai et al., 2021 ). In this regard, energy productivity defined as the economic output per unit of primary energy supply is used to represent the level of energy efficiency. The equation is expressed as(4) { I 731  = 100 ( E P ≥ 0.26  )     I 731  = 100 − 0.26 − E P  0.26  ( E P < 0.26  )          where I 731   is indicator 7.3.1 (%), 0.26 is global average energy productivity of primary energy in 2030 (US dollars/megajoules), which is a doubling of that in 2015 (0.13) (International Energy Agency, 2021 ; Table S1 ), and EP  is energy productivity of primary energy, as(5) E P = 1 E I       where EI  is energy intensity of primary energy defined as megajoules of total energy supply per unit of purchasing power parity GDP in constant 2017 US dollars (United Nations Statistics Division, 2021 ), which was modified as megajoules of total energy supply per unit of GDP in constant 2010 US dollars in this study (International Energy Agency, 2021 ; World Bank, 2021 ).   2.1.3 SDG 7 composite index To obtain a composite SDG7 index (SDG7I ), it is crucial to weight and aggregate the constituent components into one integrated index (Sachs et al., 2018 ). Flexible methods of weighting (e.g., multi-criteria weightage algorithms and the Delphi method) may unintentionally encourage regions to prioritize the simple SDG indicators, while leaving behind those SDG factors that are more challenging to tackle, yet equitably significant, requiring extensive efforts and commitments. The United Nations stated that policymakers should treat all SDG targets equally and avoid improving one indicator in a short time to achieve their SDG overall score. In fact, it is of vital importance for countries to take all targets into account while they are promoting sustainable development policies to improve the comprehensive performance of SDGs. In this regard, the construction of the composite SDG7I  is done in alignment with previous SDGs studies (Cai et al., 2021 ; Huan et al., 2021 ), i.e., the approaches of fixed equal weights and arithmetic mean among different indicators in the same target as well as among different targets were employed for the index's weighting and aggregation respectively (Fig. 1  ). Thus, the SDG7I  was quantified as(6) S D G 7 I  = I 711  + I 712   2  + I 721  + I 731   3       In accordance with Sachs et al. (2018) , the SDG7I  was categorized into six levels—very low ([0, 10]), low (10[, 30]), medium-low (30[, 50]), medium-high (50[, 70]), high (70[, 90]), and very high (90[, 100])—used to interpret the SDG7I  score (the detailed rationale in Cai et al. (2021) ). Finally, the spatial analysis based on global databases (Table S1 ) was performed on a region and country scale, enveloping a total of 232 countries and territories (Fig. S1 ; Table S8 ).   2.2 Quantifying the interactions between SDG 7 and SDG 6 A cross-sectional correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the interactions between SDG 7 and SDG 6 given the fact that these two goals are the key foundations of other SDGs. The (anti-) correlations between pairs of SDG indicators and indexes were categorized as trade-offs and synergies, using country data (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Specifically, the correlation coefficient (r ) was estimated between each pair of SDG indicators and these indicator pairs are from the same or two distinct goals. The nonparametric Spearman's correlation coefficient was selected to examine the interrelationships among all possible combinations of SDG indicators (Spearman, 1904 ). This analysis is capable to capture the nonlinear correlation between two factors and is less sensitive to outlier values (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011 ), and has been widely applied to identify general relation beyond the linear trend between two objects in various disciplines, including SDGs (e.g., Kellner and Hubbart, 2017 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Sesnie et al., 2017 ; Warchold et al., 2021 ). The synergies and trade-offs were defined according to the relation's direction and the coefficient value, namely a plus sign (+) represents a positive relation (synergy) and a minus sign (−) denotes a negative one (trade-off). To avoid overinterpretation of correlation, Spearman's r  is marked as weak if r ε [−0.5, 0.5], otherwise strong or moderate relations are labelled, following the thresholds defined by Smarandache (2016) . To this end, an SDG interaction is interpreted with (1) r  ε [−1, −0.5) as ‘strong trade-off’, (2) r  ε [−0.5,0) as ‘weak trade-offs’, (3) r  ε [0, 0.5] as ‘weak synergy’, and (4) r  ε (0.5,1] as ‘strong synergy’, the correlation with a p -value less than 0.05 is considered as statistically significant. The SDG 7 indicators were calculated based on aforementioned approaches and derived SDG 6 indicators from Cai et al. (2021) .   3 Results 3.1 Indicator profiles Fig. 2   and Figs. S2-S5  portray the distribution of SDG 7 indicators by region and country. In the energy service field, the global average I 711   was about 83.5%, showing the high implementation level of electricity accessibility around the world. In line with the I 711   values varying between 4.6% (very low) and 100% (very high), a distinct spatial disparity was detected across countries and territories (Fig. S2 ; Table S2 ; Fig. S6 a). Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (with only 43.7% have access to electricity, medium-low) was the only SDG region struggling with the indicator implementation, while the rest of the regions had electricity access above the global average and mostly or fully implemented the indicator. To be specific, Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) had 100% access (very high), Europe and North America (ENA) (99.9%, very high), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) (95.9%, very high), Northern Africa and Western Asia (NAWA) (94.7%, very high), and Central and Southern Asia (CSA) (91.1%, very high), followed by Eastern and Southeastern Asia (ESA) (88.9%, high) and Oceania (OC) (88.9%, high) (Fig. 2 a). The global average I 712   baseline (65.6%) hit the medium-high implementation level of having access to clean fuels and technologies. Spatial heterogeneity was notable among countries and territories, as their I 712   values ranged from 0% (very low) to 100% (very high) (Fig. 2 b; Fig. S3 ; Table S3 ; Fig. S6 b). Four regions performed better than the global average, which were ANZ (100%, very high), ENA (95.4%, very high), NAWA (93.7%, very high), and LAC (83.7%, high). In comparison, other regions like CSA (64.0%, medium-high) and ESA (56.9%, medium-high) had generally adequate capacity, whereas the implementation was progressing in OC (49.1%, medium-low) and just embarked on in SSA (22.4%, low). In terms of renewable energy, the global average I 721  , only 27.7%, was the lowest, indicating a low implementation level of renewable energy (Fig. 2 c; Fig. S6 c). Yet a pronounced spatial diversity was divulged, with the I 721   values varying between 0% (very low) and 95.8% (very high) by country and territory (Fig. S4 ; Table S4 ). The best and worst cases were spotted in SSA (56.7%, medium-high) and NAWA (9.3%, very low), respectively. Most regions had a modest implementation level of renewable energy and placed in the low category, around or below the global average (Fig. 2 c). CSA had implementation level of about 28.2%, followed by ENA (22.7%), ESA (20.7%), ANZ (20.2%), OC (17.9%), and LAC (17.5%). When it comes to energy productivity, the average I 731   baseline reached 50.2%, denoting the medium-high implementation level of energy productivity (Fig. 2 d; Fig. S6 d). The palpable spatial characteristics of I 731   in countries and territories were captured by the polarized values from 9.9% (very low) to 100% (very high) (Fig. S5 ; Table S5 ). ANZ had the highest energy productivity with about 82.5% (high) contributed most to the global average, in conjunction with ENA (67.2%, medium-high), LAC (62.0%, medium-high), and OC (57.7%, medium-high) residing at the front lines of improving energy productivity. There were several regions below the global average, including ESA (48.3%, medium-low), NAWA (42.5%, medium-low), SSA (33.4%, medium-low), and CSA (29.1%, low).  3.2 SDG 7 index profile The global average SDG7I  baseline was 51.6 (medium-high), indicating that countries and territories showed, on average, an adequate implementation level for the SDG 7 indicators (Fig. 3  ; Table S6 ; Fig. S6 e). On a par with the notable spatial variety disclosed in the indictors, the SDG7I  score differed considerably between countries and territories (Fig. 3 ; Table S6 ). Specifically, Norway, Sweden, Spain, and Seychelles obtained the top four ranks with the scores of 86.0, 84.3, 84.3, and 82.5, respectively, followed by some European countries like Austria (78.3), Denmark (77.7), and Switzerland (74.7). This is mainly due to European countries having a high performance in nearly all SDG 7 indicators because of their advanced industrialization level and strong conscious on developing clean energy. In comparison, the bottom ranks were attained by South Sudan (9.3), Sierra Leone (9.4), and Somalia (12.9), followed by other African countries like Sao Tome and Principe (22.6), Benin (30.5), and Djibouti (30.5). This phenomenon was caused by the lower developed level and weak energy infrastructure. 8.6% (20 out of 232) of the countries scored high and 34.1% (79 out of 232) medium-high, whereas more than 50% fell below 50. On the regional scale, ANZ had the highest implementation level of the SDG 7 indicators with SDG7I  of 67.6, followed by ENA (63.0), and LAC (58.1) (Fig. S6 e). Yet OC (49.6), NAW (48.3), ESA (47.7), CSA (44.9), and SSA (41.8) dawdled at the medium-low category (Fig. S6 e). The development of the SDG7I  underscores the many-sidedness, complexity, and the need for comprehensive views on energy challenges as well as the country-level heterogeneity and temporal evolution of the various indicators that are included (Sachs et al., 2018 ). The baselines of I 721   and I 731   in general had worse performance than that of the SDG7I  score both regionally and globally (Fig. S7 ). This implies that the delivery of energy sustainability throughout the world is reliant on accelerating improvement in renewable energy and energy productivity, while advancing the implementation level of energy services. As the imbalance of national progress on SDGs is principally rooted in the country's socioeconomic development level (Cai et al., 2021 ), the HDI (Human Development Index)—the most commonly used approach for examining socioeconomic development (Varis et al., 2019 )—was heretofore applied to portray the extent of anthropogenic impacts on the SDG7I  and its indicators by four human development (HD) groups (very high, high, medium, and low) (Soergel et al., 2021 ; Fig. S8 ; Table S7 ). The variation in the implementation levels of the SDG7I  as well as I 711  , I 712  , and I 731   all manifested gradually decreasing trends from the very high HD group to the low HD group (Fig. S9 ). Being an outlier, a generally increasing trend was detected in the I 721  's implementation levels, which is in alignment with its regional baselines (Fig. S6 d; Fig. S9 ).  3.3 Interactions between SDG 7 and SDG 6 Fig. 4   illustrates the interactions between SDG 7 and SDG 6 based on results at country level. Within all 13 indicators, 86% (67 out of 78) of the total interactions had interrelationships statistically, and the synergies largely outweighed the trade-offs relations, accounting for 70% (54 out of 78) of the total. This finding implies that the indicators were more dominantly coherent than conflicting among the goals, which is a positive signal to implement the sustainable energy and water security in 2030. Moreover, more than half of synergies (16 out of 28) appeared strong between SDG 7 and SDG 6, which indicates broad compatibility, and a progress in one domain is also prone to advance another domain. For example, the accessibility to electricity and clean fuels (indicators 7.1.1 and 7.1.2) at homes, in publics or schools would directly support the targets 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 through upgrading the ways to collect water from distant sources and operating more advanced equipment to purify water quality. Another interesting phenomenon is that indicator 7.2.1 (renewable energy) had trade-offs linkages with all the indicators, which manifests that the progress in this target would have a high possibility to cause some obstacles in fulfilling other indicators and vice versa. In addition, the “STAR” protocol provides standardized procedures of constructing a composite SDG index to monitor the holistic implementation progress across the world's countries (Cai et al., 2021 ), the interrelationships between the index and the indicator were assessed to expound the extent of SDG interactions. The results showed that there were significant positive synergies between the composite indexes and indicators, which infers that capitalization on synergistic actions can enable cross-domain SDG targets to be implemented more quickly, efficiently, and effectively (Fuso Nerini et al., 2019 ).  3.4 Interactions among human development groups Beside from the global analysis, this cross-section analysis was also carried out among human development groups to assess variation in the interactions across different development spectra. For this, human development index (HDI) developed by UN (Table S7 ) was used to identify interactions across different development groups (Fig. 5  ), given the fact that SDG interactions could vary due to differences in economic, social, and environmental factors across the world. Among development groups, the interactions varied strongly between synergies and trade-offs (Fig. 5 ). The very high development group indicated the biggest synergies both in the absolute value (35 out of 78) and in the shares (44.9%), followed by high group (22 out of 78, 28.2%), but the medium and low development groups had the least and lowest shares of synergies (19 out of 78, 24.4%), this trend denoted that the co-evolutions between SDGs would be strengthened with the improvement in economic wealth and social welfare. In contrast, the development groups from high to low level had the biggest trade-offs (8 out of 78, 10.2%), and some sectors had strong trade-offs (e.g., 7.2.1 vs 6.3.2, 6.3.1 vs 6.4.2, 7.2.1 vs 7.1.1 in Fig. 5 c and d). However, this value was only 2 (6.1.1 vs 6.5.2, 6.2.1 vs 6.4.2 in Fig. 5 a) for the very high group. The variations in the shares of trade-offs underscored that the developing groups should pay more attention to transforming the current development paths to more sustainable ways for the achievement of the SDGs.   4 Discussion According to the key message—healthy environment is the basic foundation for economic prosperity, human health and well-being —conveyed by the sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), it is of significance to understand interlinked and interdependent dynamics among three cross-cutting issues—changing environments, people and livelihoods, and resources and materials (United Nations Environment Programme, 2019 ). Being the motive force in both natural and human affairs, energy is thereby a representative example to elucidate this intertwinement (United Nations Environment Programme, 2019 ). The quantification of the SDG 7 indicators and SDG7I  rendered which regions have taken the lead and which ones have fallen below the baseline in each of the dimensions (energy services, renewable energy, and energy productivity). The interaction analysis between SDG 7 and SDG 6 on the basis of the ‘STAR’ protocol highlighted the importance of co-evolution in water-energy nexus. These findings drew a sobering picture that decoupling of energy challenges from economic growth associated with production and consumption patterns, while taking into account synergies and trade-offs across the 2030 Agenda, is a prerequisite for the achievement of energy sustainability (Rao and Wilson, 2021 ). Our results imply that intensive interlinkages between energy and water sectors will feed more benefits than conflicts across these two goals, which is consistent with Warchold et al. (2021)  that found out that the synergy relations are stronger than the trade-off relations between SDG 7 and SDG 6 at global scale. Among the development groups, however, Warchold et al. (2021)  demonstrated different outcomes in comparison to our estimations. This difference can be elucidated by the fact that our inputs encompass a broader set of data than the original SDG databases, and our disaggregation include more information rather than a silo economic domain. This disparity leads to a different distribution of synergies and trade-offs, which also addresses the essence of a holistic SDG database to obtain more accurate results for supporting decision-making. 4.1 Implications and applications of the “STAR” protocol in evaluating SDGs The 2030 Agenda has become the world's most committed action plan for sustainable development. Each country needs a universal instrument to operationalize and track benchmarks and progresses towards achieving all goals, with all stakeholders to work together. This universal “STAR” protocol could be equipped to examine their own positioning towards sustainable development and overall performance relative to others globally and regionally, and the institutions or individuals could implement this framework into their development strategies and feasible action plans to achieve SDGs by 2030. Given the fact that a global SDG indicator framework is a multidimensional process that cannot be captured by a single indicator, constructing a composite index is the ideal solution for benchmarking exercises that scrutinize the performance of countries along the various dimensions. Following the “STAR” protocol, the SDG composite indexes make them comparable among SDGs from different domains. Thus, the “STAR” protocol has the great applicability of constructing the composite SDG indexes, especially when streamlining the quantification of complex SDG interactions. This gives succor to informing policy making how synergies and trade-offs between the SDG indexes will intensify or reduce as well as transformative pathways towards achieving SDGs require systemic innovation on policies and social practices through the lens of fostering multi-level governance and collaboration. Since countries have geographical disparities and development gaps as well as they have been facing different challenges and demands, a universal framework is particularly crucial for the evaluation at different scales. The procedures and principles of this “STAR” framework employed could ensure that it could dynamically change as the object varies. Researchers could review more specific indicators and make some adjustments based on their own needs and the data availability of these targeted regions from different geographic zones. In this regard, the “STAR” protocol has the great applicability of selecting and modifying the SDG indicators, particularly to facilitating the evaluation of their context-specific interrelationships across the 2030 Agenda with differential circumstances, which is still sparse in the existing literature.  4.2 Synergistic relations from SDG 7 to promote the achievement of cross-domain SDG targets The interaction quantifications between the indicators and indexes in SDG 7 and SDG 6 imply the synergies largely outweigh trade-offs relations. This finding is also consistent with the study from Fuso Nerini et al. (2018) .  In their study, the interconnections between energy systems—comprehensively comprising all components of natural and anthropogenic systems related to energy production, conversion, delivery, and consumption—showed that 113 targets (out of 169) necessitate actions engaged with SDG 7 and 143 targets (∼85%) have synergies with SDG 7. In addition, when taking a close look at the relationships between energy and climate, all the targets on energy (SDG 7) and climate action (SDG 13) are either enabling, reinforcing, or indivisible with each other (Fuso Nerini et al., 2019 ). It echoes the importance of the fundamentals—such as improving energy productivity and decarbonizing energy supply (energy services and renewable energy) (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2019 )—in curbing global warming to below 2 °C and accomplishing the net-zero emissions by 2050 goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change (Semieniuk et al., 2021 ). As a means of embracing and exploiting the interlinkages and interdependencies between water and energy jointly with their externalities (Cai et al., 2018 ), the water-energy nexus—a part of the broader water-energy-food nexus—not only constitutes a framework analyzing the dynamic interactions between water and energy systems with consideration to resource sustainability and governance effectiveness (Liu et al., 2018 ), but also articulates the significance of understanding the impacts of industrial transition (Cai et al., 2016 ; Zhao et al., 2021a ), urbanization (Niva et al., 2020 ), and especially climate change (van Vliet et al., 2016 ) on the energy sector through changes in the hydrological cycle (Pereira-Cardenal, 2016 ).  4.3 Multi-level governance and collaboration to leverage synergies and resolve trade-offs The essence of delivering energy sustainability stems from hastening the progress in other SDGs (Madurai Elavarasan et al., 2021 ). This assessment indicated that a continuation of current trends in many medium to low development countries (e.g., some One-Belt One-Road and African countries) would not be enough to meet energy sustainability by 2030. Furthermore, the trade-offs between indicator 7.2.1 and other indicators demonstrated some potential conflicts with water security while some renewable energies like biofuel and hydropower become dominant types. The results could provide some beneficial implications for policymakers. For instance, they could adjust the international initiatives towards a more nuanced target-setting at the population, income, and regional level. Moreover, countries can identify innovative SDG solutions by building partnerships within those development groups through peer-to-peer learning. The findings provide new insights for the successful implementation of SDG 7. On the one hand, synergies can be leveraged and trade-offs need to be resolved. On the other hand, water-energy SDG aspects are in particular highly specific to regions and income groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has been stalling—or even reversing—the progress of all SDGs around the world. According to International Energy Agency (IEA)'s scenario analysis, the pandemic-induced economic fallout would leave 660 million people—mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa—without access to electricity and approximately 2.4 billion people lacking access to clean fuels and technologies by 2030 worldwide (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, 2021 ). In this regard, systemic innovation on policies and social practices is of pivotality to eradicate regulatory and technical barriers for restoring and enhancing the implementation capacity of the SDG indicators. Fostering multi-level governance and collaboration lies at the heart of catalyzing innovative solutions (United Nations, 2021 ). For instance, roles and responsibilities of all governmental and non-governmental actors are enshrined in the HLDE's Energy Compacts by bringing an improvement on the traditional recognition template, i.e., voluntary commitments instead of binding commitments (International Institute for Sustainable Development, 2021 ). To this end, while governments are making decisions and setting measures in force, non-governmental actors are contemplating what actions they can and will take. This preponderantly matters more than ever in the context of promoting green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also notable that there are plentiful international programs and initiatives—including Power Africa, Sustainable Energy for All, South-South Cooperation Climate Fund, and Africa Renewable Energy Initiative—for advancing renewable energy technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa (Chirambo, 2018 ). Yet a horizontal partnership—intersectoral collaborations across a wide range of stakeholders (Cai et al., 2021 ; Zhao et al., 2021b )—calls for particular attention to not only ensuring these programs and initiatives operated in a complimentary and harmonized manner (Chirambo, 2018 ), but also encouraging the integration with the WHO/UNICEF joint WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) program at the same time (United Nations, 2018 ).  4.4 Limitations Some limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. First, by applying a ‘STAR’ protocol, the current SDG 7 indicators and indexes were quantified instead of future ones, and the current analysis did not cover the full spectrum of SDG 7 targets and exclude time-lag due to data unavailability. Second, the data unavailability is one of critical challenges for indicator selection, especially when the indicators are expressed in a qualitative way, which would further affect the subsequent evaluation and analysis to some extent. Third, the interaction quantified by the Spearman's correlation did not imply causality, since the correlation could be also relevant to other SDG indicators. In the future, more advanced approaches towards the identification of causal relations should be developed. Fourth, most of SDG studies including this one in general do not take the contribution of international trades into consideration. Globalization has not only led to an increasing geospatial separation of production and consumption (Du et al., 2022 ), but also brought about the displacement of SDG progresses through international trades. Fifth, although using thresholds are useful to differentiate synergy and trade-off relations effectively, missing data for some development groups would yet result in biased characteristics of the interactions. Lastly, the core of achieving SDGs comprehensively is transforming human's behaviors from unsustainable way to eco-friendly, thus, emerging eco-sustainability into teaching or education (in this case relating to energy management) is rather vital to the whole society, some eco-friendly teaching methods or courses should be involved into pedagogical training. In this regard, these limitations ought to be further investigated.   5 Conclusions With the application of the “STAR” (Straightforwardness, Transparency, Availability, and Readiness) protocol, a composite Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 index was developed upon the SDG 7 targets and indicators to scrutinize global energy challenges, and the interaction analysis between SDG 7 and SDG 6 based on the ‘STAR’ protocol underlined the importance of co-evolution in the water-energy nexus. The profiles of the indicators and index by 232 countries and territories unraveled the global implementation baselines of the SDG 7 dimensions (energy services, renewable energy, and energy productivity). Several key findings can be drawn from the analysis.● A majority of countries are on track to achieve universal energy services by 2030, apropos of population having access to either electricity or clean fuels and technologies. Yet Sub-Saharan African countries need to substantially augment the implementation pace of service coverage.  ● The SDG7I  score differed considerably between countries and territories, 8.6% (20 out of 232) of the countries belonged to high levels, 34.1% (79 out of 232) were located at medium-high level, but the SDG7I  values in more than 50% of the countries were lower than 50.  ● 86% (67 out of 78) of the total interactions had interrelationships statistically, and the synergies largely outweighed the trade-offs relations, which accounted for 70% (54 out of 78) of the total. Among human development groups, the very high development group showed the biggest synergies both in the absolute value (36 out of 78) and in the shares (46.1%), while the medium and low development groups had the lowest synergies (19 out of 78, 24.4%).  ● Significant positive correlations were detected either from an indicator or index perspective between SDG 7 and SDG 6, which demonstrated synergistic relations from SDG 7 can promote the achievement of cross-domain SDG targets.  ● The “STAR” protocol has great applicability to (1) facilitating the evaluation of synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their targets grounded in specific context with differential circumstances across the 2030 Agenda, (2) identifying the policy sensitivity of the SDG indicators for policy effectiveness assessment, and (3) fostering multi-level governance and collaboration to leverage synergies and resolve trade-offs.
