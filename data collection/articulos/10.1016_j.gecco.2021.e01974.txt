Graphical Abstract ga1       Keywords Soil conservation service  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Soil erosion  Ecosystem services  Socioeconomic needs    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, act as the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and provide a shared blueprint that incorporates social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability (UN, 2015 ). The goals are distilled into the five Ps (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership) and cover the most critical and urgent challenges of our time (Yang et al., 2020 ). They express the urgent need to end hunger and poverty, improve health and education, promote development and reduce inequality while addressing climate change and land degradation. Embedded in the SDGs agenda, there is a crucial aim to value ecosystem services (ESs) and restore and enhance their integrity and functions (Wood et al., 2018 ). Due to the multifaceted development vision covered by the 17 Goals, achieving the SDGs is an ambitious task that requires multidisciplinary efforts. The ESs that soils provide for agriculture, water conservation, and biodiversity are vital to achieving the SDGs (Bossio, 2017 ). ESs are the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems. ESs support human well-being from basic livelihood (e.g., water and food) to higher-level needs (e.g., garden cities and ecotourism), contributing directly or indirectly to SDGs’ achievement (Yin et al., 2021 ). As one of the fundamental ESs, the soil conservation service (SCS) is the capacity of ecosystems to control erosion and conserve soil (Zhao et al., 2018 ). SCS’s supply depends on ecosystem structure and processes and is affected by multiple factors, such as soil properties, topography, vegetation cover and anthropogenic disturbances. SCS promotes the storage of soil, water, and nutrients, playing a pivotal role in preventing land degradation and regulating ecosystem processes. It also provides the physical foundation of agriculture and numerous human activities, supporting socioeconomic functioning and SDG implementation (FAO and ITPS, 2015 ). SCS serves as a bridge linking nature to human well-being since many ESs and human activities depend on soils’ physical foundations and services (Yin et al., 2021 ). SCS’s roles have been studied from an agricultural basis to broader fields such as maintaining land carrying capacity (Gossner et al., 2016 ), ecosystem security (Bahram et al., 2018 ), and climate regulation (Friedlingstein et al., 2019 ). However, the coupling analysis of SCS and human needs from the perspective of SDGs is lacking (Chen et al., 2019; Schirpke et al., 2019; Yahdjian et al., 2015 ). As nature’s contribution to people, SCS is not only the soil’s biophysical function but related to socioeconomic issues, such as economic benefits, decision-making, social awareness, and land ownership (Hou et al., 2020 ). The SDG progress has been stalled or even reversed by many global crises (e.g., climate change, land degradation, and the COVID-19 pandemic). Its progress needs multidisciplinary efforts to get back on track, with soils and their conservation services playing an important role. SDGs also act as a chance for exploring SCS’s contribution to human development needs, as these 17 goals range from ending deprivation in all its forms to achieving prosperity and saving our planet and the species that inhabit it. The objectives of this work are to a) review the role of SCS in addressing the threat posed by soil erosion to the SDGs, b) analyse the SCS’s contribution to the SDGs based on a case study in China and a global expert questionnaire, and c) explore systematic strategies to improve SCS and therefore to promote the SDG implementation.  2 SCS supports the SDG implementation by addressing soil erosion SCS directly mitigates soil erosion, which improves ecosystem quality and land productivity and indirectly contributes to the SDG implementation (Montanarella, 2015 ). Due to human pressures and climate change, soil erosion rates exceeded soil formation rates. This accelerates land degradation and hampers sustainable development (FAO, 2019 ). Particularly, soil erosion impedes the progress of SDG 2 (Zero hunger). In agricultural areas, soil erosion is 10–100 times faster than soil formation (Amundson et al., 2015 ) and affects 10 million hectares of arable land each year (Gachene et al., 2020 ). Life on land (SDG 15) and climate action (SDG 13) also face the threat of soil degradation (IPCC, 2019 ). Between 2010 and 2050, 27 GT of soil organic carbon are estimated to be lost (UNCCD, 2017 ). Erosion also increases soil organic carbon’s lateral movement and affects the global carbon cycle and climate regulation process (Van Oost et al., 2012 ). In addition, soil erosion will cause cross-regional impacts through cascade effects (Albaladejo et al., 2021; Eekhout et al., 2018 ). For example, increased soil detachment and sediment transport will exacerbate local land degradation (e.g., reduced soil fertility and productivity) and affect downstream areas (e.g., pollutant transportation, reservoirs siltation, biodiversity reduction) (Pereira et al., 2020 ). Although soil erosion cannot be avoided, its threats to soil function, agricultural productivity, and socio-ecological sustainability must be mitigated. SCS is key to controlling soil erosion and its adverse effects and can produce environmental and cultural benefits ( Table 1 ). SCS also provides economic value by addressing erosion economically and saving on ecosystem restoration costs. For example, approximately $400 billion a year is spent on replenishing lost nutrients, preventing erosion, and repairing infrastructure damage caused by soil erosion globally (Kumawat et al., 2020 ). To restore soil and control erosion, soil conservation measures need to be implemented worldwide, including 1) vegetative conservation (e.g., grass strips, vegetative buffers, live fences, and grassed waterways); 2) terrain structural conservation (e.g., sediment ponds, terraces, and check dams); 3) agronomic techniques (e.g., cover cropping, conservation tillage and contour farming); and 4) overall management such as periodic closures and selective clearing (Keesstra et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020 ). SCS’s on-site effects can reduce overland flow and prevent sediment transport. Off-site SCS is key to reducing the sediment and pollutant transport in water bodies, thus improving regional ecosystem health and sustainable development (Mekonnen et al., 2015 ) (Table 1 ).  3 Contributions of SCS to the SDG achievement Since multiple factors affect the SDG progress, empirical data cannot ultimately show the multidimensional impacts of SCS on SDGs. Therefore, we assessed links between SCS and SDGs holistically through global expert questionnaire and literature review. As an example, we used the case of China. Among 17 SDGs, SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 15 (Life on land) showed significant relationships (p < 0.05) with SCS. SDG 15 presented the most significant and positive relationship with SCS. Soil conservation practices are crucial to improving life on land (Pereira et al., 2020 ). SDG 1, in contrast, showed a negative relationship with SCS. With the increase of SCS, the progress score of SDG 1 decreased among China’s 31 provinces ( Fig. 1 ). To reduce poverty, more resources are needed, and agriculture needs to be more intensive. Therefore, this is likely to decrease SCS (Pereira et al., 2018 ). According to the views of global experts on SCS’s contribution to SDGs, in addition to maintaining or enhancing land productivity and the ESs supply, SCS also supports socioeconomic sustainability and contributes directly and indirectly to the SDG achievement (Pereira et al., 2018 ) ( Table 2 ). The consensus of the global questionnaire is that improving land productivity is one of the core roles of SCS (81%), as mitigating sediment transport to dredge watercourses (69%) and controlling desertification (57%). SCS is also key to supporting biochemical cycles (48%), maintaining biodiversity (47%), reducing pollutant migration (47%), promoting carbon sequestration (41%), and mitigating geomorphological disasters (e.g., floods and landslides) (41%). In addition to these SCS’s local effects, several off-site tradeoffs are identified, such as the reduced water supplies and shrinking wetlands downstream (18%) due to upstream soil conservation projects ( Fig. 2 a). According to the respondents, SCS benefits the SDGs, especially SDG 15 (Life on land) (81%), through ecosystem restoration and biodiversity protection (Fig. 2 b). Due to soil erosion and land degradation, 78% of ESs have declined, and land productivity has fallen by 23% since 1970 (IPBES, 2019; UNEP, 2021 ). In this context, SCS is key to conserving soils that underpin all terrestrial ecosystems and promote soils’ services. SCS also contributes to SDG 13 (Climate action) by storing organic carbon and mitigating climate change (57%). For example, SCS can improve the function of soils that store about 1500 Gt organic carbon, exceeding the combined carbon of the atmosphere (about 750 Gt) and vegetation (about 560 Gt) (Amundson et al., 2015; Crowther et al., 2019 ). SCS can also support the natural land processes that capture a third of the CO2  emitted by fossil fuels and industry (https://www.ipcc.ch/2019/08/08/land-is-a-critical-resource_srccl/ ). SCS also contributes to SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) (54%) and SDG 2 (Zero hunger) (48%) by providing clean water and fertile land to feed an ever-growing global population (Fig. 2 b). Soil acts as the most important water filter and storage system on land (FAO and ITPS, 2015 ). The water stored in soils accounts for about 65% of the world’s fresh water and supplies almost 90% of the agricultural water (Sposito, 2013 ). Moreover, SCS retains sediments and prevents soil nutrient loss, reducing water contamination and its detrimental effects on aquatic biodiversity (SDG 6) (Amundson et al., 2015 ). As for SDG 2, soil degradation already threatens the livelihoods of at least 3.2 billion people worldwide (IPBES, 2018 ). Agriculture and food security rely on healthy soils and their services, especially in rural or agriculture-dependent areas. Fertile soils and productive lands contribute to higher crop yields, satisfying human livelihoods and thus providing the basis for achieving the SDGs (Pereira, 2019 ). SCS also benefits other goals, such as SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production), SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 14 (Life below water) (42%, 39%, 34%, 34%, respectively), by degrading waste, sustaining the poor’s livelihoods, supporting urban green spaces, and reducing sediment pollutants into the sea (Albaladejo et al., 2021; Tóth et al., 2018 ) (Fig. 2 b, Table 2 ). In addition to the SDGs (listed in Table 2 ) to which SCS contributes, soil quality and its services are also indirectly associated with human health and land rights (SDG 3), decent work and primary industry development (SDG 8, 10), and energy infrastructure (SDG 7, 9) (more than 10% respondents recognised this).  4 Promote SCS to support the SDG achievement Despite the importance of SCS in supporting SDGs, a focus on improving SCS alone is ineffective due to the lack of synergies with other ESs and socioeconomic needs. The SDGs encompass multiple social, economic and environmental goals, which require interdisciplinary efforts to support their achievement. Our analysis showed that SCS contributes to more than one SDG. Therefore, strategies for promoting SCS to support the SDGs need to be guided by SDGs’ needs in different dimensions, thus playing a holistic role of SCS in social, economic, and eco-environmental sustainability. To be goal-oriented, here we present an SDG-holistic guiding framework to promote SCS for the SDG achievement. 4.1 Social SDG-oriented strategy to promote SCS for the SDG achievement Although SCS is a natural process, its accelerated change since the Anthropocene is rooted in land users’ socioeconomic needs and cultural perceptions (FAO and ITPS, 2015; Hou et al., 2020 ). Integrating social sustainability needs into SCS improvements can facilitate the co-development of humans and nature － the core of SDGs. The demand for and management of SCS depends primarily on the direct land participants (e.g., farmers and pastoralists) and their soil use patterns (e.g., agriculture and animal husbandry) (Mugandani and Mafongoya, 2019 ). To make stakeholders consciously protect the soil and its conservation service, educational approaches (e.g., lecture, media publicity, and soil conservation guidance) need to be taken, which is key to strengthening soil conservation education (SDG 4) among soil users and awakening their social awareness about the SCS’s value. To foster the public acceptance and adoption, SCS beneficiaries should be involved in implementing, operating, and monitoring soil conservation initiatives. It is essential to increase the empowerment and participation of women in underdeveloped areas who undertake more soil-based work (e.g., planting and farming) as men earn their living outside the home (SDG 5). In addition to the grass-root role in maintaining SCS, top-down decision-making and management are critical to shaping a sustainable environment for SCS improvement. National/regional ministries of natural resources or the environment should establish strong institutions (SDG 16) and develop effective soil policies to ensure the implementation of conservation projects. Due to the inadequate recognition of soil conservation's contribution, soil conservation strategies often face political obstacles, such as the European Soil Thematic Strategy failure (Hou et al., 2020 ). Therefore, international organisations should lead soil thematic activities to reduce inequities among countries due to soil resource endowments (SDG 10) and strengthen trans-regional partnerships (SDG 17) for soil conservation and SCS improvement. For instance, the International Decade of Soils (2015–2024) is key to raising international awareness and strengthening cooperation on soil conservation across regions (https://www.iuss.org/international-decade-of-soils/ ).  4.2 Economic SDG-oriented strategy to promote SCS for the SDG achievement As the world’s population grows and economies develop, more soil areas will be used to build infrastructure, industry and cities, and demand for agricultural products (e.g., food, timber, feed, and energy crops) will increase by 30–80% by 2050 (UNEP, 2021 ). However, the economic benefits from SCS are often overlooked, and soil conservation projects have long faced financial constraints, although intensified soil erosion and SCS degradation constrain sustainable development. Therefore, integrating SCS into national/regional economic accounting and development planning should be standardised and adopted (SDG 8). The Beyond-GDP initiative and the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), for example, which attempt to integrate ESs and environmental quality into economy evaluation, are crucial to stimulating economic "development" rather than just "growth" and avoiding development at the cost of soil health. As for economic projects such as industry and infrastructure construction (SDG 9) and energy facility (e.g., wind farms, hydroelectric stations) (SDG 7), standardised environmental impact assessments, environmentally responsible production (SDG 12), and soil conservation measures should be implemented to reduce their disturbance to SCS. For communities whose livelihoods rely primarily on soil ecosystems and their services, their accelerated exploitation and abandonment of land leads to problems such as SCS degradation, soil erosion and frequent geological disasters, thus threatening regional sustainability. Therefore, the SCS protection and restoration should prioritise resolving the contradiction between the finite soil and the growing living and productive needs of direct land users (SDG 1, 2). Emerging development patterns such as Eco-economy, “grain for green”, ecological benefit compensation, and capitalisation of natural resources have been proved feasible to alleviate the contradiction between soil restoration and economic development.  4.3 Environmental SDG-oriented strategy to promote SCS for the SDG achievement While social equity and economic efficiency can correct profit-oriented soil and SCS exploitation, SCS improvement depends directly on land policies and soil conservation measures (FAO, 2002 ). Past soil conservation aimed at improving soil provisioning services－mainly through physical engineering measures－often came at the cost of soil regulating and supporting services (MEA, 2005 ). Under SDGs’ requirements, the focus of soil conservation initiatives should shift from short-term improvement of soil physical properties to soil structure, function, and long-term conservation effectiveness. Soil conservation should be carried out mainly by biological/vegetative measures and supplemented by engineering/structural measures. Soil’s hierarchical structure, including aggregates, pores and distribution channels, allows the exchange of different substances (e.g., water, energy, and oxygen) (Albaladejo et al., 2021 ), which is critical for purifying and transporting water (SDG 6), providing nutrients to ecosystems (SDG 14, 15), and regulating the climate (SDG 13). Traditional soil conservation through afforestation is considered unsustainable due to the homogeneousness of monoculture plantations－usually with low biodiversity, simple niches, and inadequate soil retention capacity (Yin et al., 2021 ). To improve soil structure and SCS, measures that protect biodiversity and the resilience of soil organisms should be strengthened. Planting native vegetation is also key to balancing natural soil erosion and soil production rates (Pereira, 2019 ). Agronomic measures (e.g., crop rotation and crop cover to restore soil organisms and promote soil particle deposition) and conservation tillage techniques that suit local soil properties and climatic and topographic conditions should also be studied and promoted.   5 Conclusions Soil underpins almost all physical human activities, and its conservation service supports multiple human development needs. In addition to conserving ESs and land productivity by mitigating soil erosion, SCS also benefits multiple SDGs by regulating ecological processes, producing food and products, and providing social and cultural values. The SDGs agenda is a systematic project that asks for more interdisciplinary efforts. To be SDG-oriented, SCS should also be restored and improved in an interdisciplinary way that benefits both soil functions and socioeconomic needs. This study highlights the associations between the SDGs and SCS, which is key to recognising and harnessing the contribution of soils and ESs to sustainable development.
