                  Sustainable development policies trigger a shift in the global development paradigm by aligning economic, social, and ecological goals. Concurrently, the rapid surge in digitalization is transforming business processes and communications across all sectors and levels. As a result, the integration of e-business and e-governance becomes a critical component in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this context, the aim of this article is to analyze the effects of digitalization, specifically e-governance and e-business, on the attainment of SDGs in European Union (EU) countries. The method used is a panel of corrected standard errors and feasible generalized least squares models to identify the impact and significance of e-governance and e-business on SDG achievement. The e-governance indicators considered by this study were found to significantly impact SDG achievement. Moreover, e-business indicators were also found to positively impact the attainment of SDGs, with some exceptions. The findings suggest that EU countries should continue to intensify digitalization across all sectors as it enhances the transparency accountability of all business processes and communications and increases trust in government services, which are the core drivers of achieving SDGs.

Sustainable development policies trigger a shift in the global development paradigm by aligning economic, social, and ecological goals. Concurrently, the rapid surge in digitalization is transforming business processes and communications across all sectors and levels. As a result, the integration of e-business and e-governance becomes a critical component in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this context, the aim of this article is to analyze the effects of digitalization, specifically e-governance and e-business, on the attainment of SDGs in European Union (EU) countries. The method used is a panel of corrected standard errors and feasible generalized least squares models to identify the impact and significance of e-governance and e-business on SDG achievement. The e-governance indicators considered by this study were found to significantly impact SDG achievement. Moreover, e-business indicators were also found to positively impact the attainment of SDGs, with some exceptions. The findings suggest that EU countries should continue to intensify digitalization across all sectors as it enhances the transparency accountability of all business processes and communications and increases trust in government services, which are the core drivers of achieving SDGs.

In response to this, world leaders adopted the agenda on Sustainable Development at the “Earth Summit” in 1996 to safeguard the planet for future generations (United Nations, 2023 ). Notably, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) underwent modernization starting in 1992. As per the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the global community accepted the responsibility to achieve 17 goals, as measured by 169 targets, by 2030. Researchers (e.g., Yi and Thomas, 2006 ; Gavkalova et al., 2022 ) highlight that SDG achievement necessitates consolidation and effective communication among businesses, government, and society (Saura et al., 2022a, 2022b ). Simultaneously, the increased development of industry 4.0 drives the transformation of business processes and communications across all sectors and levels (Miskiewicz, 2020 ; Kwilinski et al., 2021 ; Ramadania et al., 2022 ), thereby increasing the penetration of digital technologies in everyday life and boosting innovation processes (Saura et al., 2023a, 2023b ). Choi (2017)  posits that the digital revolution has altered the global development paradigm from total government surveillance and control protocols to an economy where citizens play a vital role in economic growth (Lan and Tang, 2023 ). In this regard, the enhancement of e-business and the improvement of e-governance should be prioritized within the pursuit of achieving SDGs that cover all aspect of respecting human rights and sustainable activities in society (Anand et al., 2018 ). Authors such as Yi and Thomas (2006)  note that the rapid development of digital technologies triggers a range of social (Saura et al., 2022a ), economic, and ecological effects (Saura et al., 2023a ), influencing a country's development and societal life. They also highlight the contentious impact of digitalization on the environment, both positive and negative. Thus, while the enhancement of digital technologies may result in negative environmental externalities in the short term (increased energy consumption, waste generation, etc.), it also yields positive social and economic effects (simplified communications, increased efficiency of marketing communications (Barbosa et al., 2023 ), reduced labour usage, etc. (Pérez Zabaleta et al., 2022 )). In this context, the use of digital technologies in business and governments enhances global market competitiveness and creates value for public institutions (Fonseka et al., 2022 ; Lee et al., 2023 ). Ukko et al. (2022)  emphasize that the e-business concept prioritizes the quality of goods and services in online markets and facilitates information sharing throughout the supply chain, accommodating and integrating the interests of all stakeholders (Ogunrinde, 2022 ). Contrary to traditional business models, e-business allows for a more effective synchronization of social and sustainability goals (Ukko et al., 2019, 2022 ; Oliveira and Martins, 2010 ). Alyahya et al. (2022)  demonstrate that the quality of institutions (through governance pressure) significantly affects government sustainable development goals. Simultaneously, the Industry 4.0 (Saura et al., 2023a, 2023b ) and digital penetration (Ribeiro-Navarrete et al., 2021 ) enhance the quality of institutions by improving e-governance (Todoruţ and Tselentis, 2018 ). For example, more than 80 % of United Nations member countries have already implemented incentive programs to expand e-governance (Palacin et al., 2021 ). Also, e-participation becomes a central dimension in making political decisions (Troilo, 2023a, 2023b ), including those pertaining to incentives for SDG achievement. However, Hasan and Rizvi (2022)  underline that e-governance requires the enhancement of relevant knowledge and digital infrastructure, which in turn leads to the attainment of SDGs (Troilo, 2023a, 2023b ). Mohammadian et al. (2022)  argue that digitalization is conducive to the development of e-business among small and medium enterprises, which forms the basis of SDG achievement (Zuazua Ruiz et al., 2023 ; Suárez Giri and Sánchez Chaparro, 2023 ). Also, the European Union being committed to implementing unified environmental, social, and economic policies, places a focus on achieving the SDGs as a solution to common issues. The new digital tools (e.g., artificial intelligence-based applications) (Saura et al., 2021 ) enhance governmental transparency and effective e-governance, fostering economic growth, trade, and export by improving industry productivity and creating fundamentally new sectors in the digital economy (Ríos-Pérez et al., 2022 ) with increased the value added. Moreover, digitalization simplifies business development conditions, attracts investments, and provides more opportunities to fulfil stakeholders' interests and protect their rights, thus positioning digitalization as a key element in achieving the SDGs. In this context, despite relevant findings in existing literature, there is a gap of deeper understanding of the collected contributions of e-commerce and e-business as drivers to the attainment of SDGs in the EU. Therefore, based on the above this article aims to analyze the effects of digitalization, specifically through the implications of e-governance and e-business, on achieving SDGs in EU countries. The article contributes to the literature as it addresses a research gap by providing theoretical justification for the impact of digitalization on SDG achievement and future research implications. In terms of methods, the study applies Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) (Zakari et al., 2022 ) and Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) (Bai et al., 2021 ) to validate the effects of e-governance and e-business on SDG attainment. As a result, the study provides empirically justified recommendations for policymakers and businesses on expanding and applying digitalization to achieve the specified SDGs. This study makes a contribution to the discourse on sustainable development by elucidating the integral role of digitalization, specifically through the lenses of e-governance and e-business, in advancing the SDGs. It offers empirical evidence that underscores the positive impact of enhanced digital governance services on SDG achievement and highlights the transformative potential of e-business practices in fostering sustainability. These insights not only enrich the academic understanding of the digitalization-sustainability nexus but also provide actionable guidance for policymakers and business leaders seeking to harness digital transformation for a more sustainable future. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. The literature review section explores the theoretical landscape regarding the link between e-governance, e-business, and the attainment of SDGs to justify the proposed hypotheses. This is followed by the materials and data section, which outlines the methodological basis for testing the hypotheses and provides an explanation of the data used for analysis. The results section then presents an analysis of the empirical results, examining the effects of e-governance and e-business on achieving SDGs. Finally, the discussion and conclusions section interpret the obtained results, compares them with previous studies, identifies the limitations of the study, and suggests directions for future research.  2 Literature review 2.1 The impact of e-governance on SDGs As the application and development of e-governance strategies are deployed by public institutions, some of the existing literature emphasizes that the implementation of e-governance is one of the strategies that can enhance the achievement of SDGs. For instance, as highlighted by Abuljadail et al. (2023)  digital communications strategies simplify communications between local governance and stakeholders, therefore boosting sustainability due to the use of less vehicles or logistic strategies. Also, Das and Harekrishna (2018)  and Misra (2012)  underscore the pivotal role that information and communication play in the domain of SDGs. They highlight the positive effect of implementing E-Gov 2.0, which allows for the transformation from ineffective government to effective governance. This assertion is corroborated by Dalela et al. (2020)  who confirm similar conclusions for the agricultural sector in India. In this context, Ramasamy (2021)  stated that e-governance facilitates the sharing of knowledge and information, which consequently, spurs sustainable agricultural development and the attainment of SDG2 related to Zero Hunger. Also, ElMassah and Mohieldin (2020)  demonstrated that digitalization propels the development of e-governance in several developing countries. In turn, it promotes various SDGs in specific locations: SDG1 – No Poverty (in Cambodia and Kenya), SDG2 – Zero Hunger (in Kenya), SDG3 – Good Health and Well-being (in Kenya), SDG4 – Quality Education (in Cambodia, Kenya, Tunisia, and Egypt), SDG5 – Gender Equality (Egypt), SDG8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth (in Cambodia and Egypt), SDG9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (in Cambodia and Kenya), SDG10 – Reduced Inequalities (in Cambodia), SDG11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities (in Cambodia, Kenya, and Tunisia), SDG16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (in Cambodia, Kenya, and Egypt), and SDG17 – Partnerships for the Goals (in Cambodia, Tunisia, and Egypt). Simultaneously, Ufua et al. (2021)  assert that in Nigeria, e-governance positively contributes to SDG4 – Quality Education and SDG9 – Industry Innovation and Infrastructure due to the use of new digital platforms and tools that increase the efficiency of educational activities locally. Furthermore, Malhotra et al. (2018)  and Morales and Robalino-Lopez (2020)  argue that enhancing e-governance can help to reduce digital gaps in communications between stakeholders, including the government, local society, business, and society at large. This new accessibility to digital environments allows public institutions and governments to develop new and effective e-governance system that fosters transparency and accountability for SDG achievement (Myeong et al., 2014 ; Morales and Robalino-Lopez, 2020 ; Ufua et al., 2021 ). Building on this, Myeong et al. (2014)  established a relationship between the quality of e-governance and trust in the state, highlighting that trust in the government can be influenced by digital inequalities among different social groups (Nadirov and Dehning, 2023 ). Regarding this new digital paradigm, improving e-government requirements could decrease information gaps through free information circulation among all stakeholders (Zhghenti and Chkareuli, 2021 ). Authors such as Miskiewicz (2022)  provides further evidence for the positive effect of e-governance on SDG7 – Clean and Affordable Energy in EU countries, confirming that countries with high-quality e-governance activities tend to have high SDG7 index scores. On the same line of research, Mureşan (2010)  underscores the potential of the Web 2.0 concept, which integrates e-voting, e-consultation, and e-knowledge, to improve the quality of regional institutions and facilitate societal involvement in decision-making on regional development within the SDG framework. This fact allows governments to continue boosting and deploying digital-based strategies to make e-democracy the next generation of data-driven governance (Chopra et al., 2022 ). Eventhood this fact increases governments efficiency, authors such as Ribeiro-Navarrete et al. (2021)  indicate that privacy of citizens should be also a priority as surveillance capitalism and collective intelligence strategies may are applied linked to the use of new e-governance processes and services. Regarding the development of sustainable activities, Krishnan and Teo (2011)  provide evidence that e-governance can positively impact a country's environmental performance, contributing to SDG11 and SDG8. More recently, Ullah et al. (2021a, 2021b)  indicated that ineffective e-governance hampers the attainment of SDGs in Belt and Road countries. However, Yu (2015)  did not confirm a statistically significant relationship between e-governance and environmental performance as part of the SDGs. Moreover, Ha (2022)  empirically justified the relationship between e-governance and the energy security of countries (Marti and Puertas, 2022 ), suggesting a complex relationship between these variables that should be further studied. Consequently, the prevailing literature suggests that the expansion of e-governance could initially have a positive impact, which could later transition into a negative effect after a certain period. Given the contributions presented above, this study proposes the following hypothesis:Hypothesis 1 e-Governance deployment positively affects the attainment of SDGs.    2.2 The impact of e-business on SDGs Complementary to e-government, initiatives by companies in the digital domain are also expected to play a relevant role in attaining SDGs (Sharma and Mishra, 2017 ). The analysis of the theoretical framework of sustainable development shows that the business sector is a crucial force in attaining SDGs (Choi and Jin, 2015 ; Alharthi et al., 2019 ; Arefieva et al., 2021 ; Wang and Ge, 2022 ). Wang and Ge (2022)  demonstrated that digitalization facilitates this process and enhances e-business. Furthermore, e-business development should be founded not on short-term benefits, but on sustainable long-term development, due to improved relationships with all stakeholders (Bhattacherjee, 2001 ; Choi and Mai, 2018 ). Simultaneously, Dewan et al. (2012a, 2012b)  stated that a sustainable e-business model should consider three core aspects: (i) customer value, (ii) business value, and (iii) lifecycle value, and coordinate the interests of all stakeholders by promoting the necessity of sustainable development. Furthermore, the promotion of high-tech industries is generally expected to reduce businesses' ecological footprint (Shahzad et al., 2022 ). Drawing on the fashion industry, Gonçalves and Silva (2021)  conclude that digital technologies increase trust in e-commerce websites and business performance (To and Chau, 2022 ). These researchers emphasize that implementing the concept of e-business allows for the improvement of accountability and transparency in business operations, which are fundamental determinants of sustainable development. Similar conclusions are reached by Dal Forno et al. (2023)  for the textile industry and by Vaníčková and Szczepańska-Woszczyna (2020)  for the exhibition industry. In addition, digital marketing enhances trust in business (Martínez-Navalón et al., 2023 ), which positively affects e-commerce sales (Kwilinski et al., 2020 ). A study conducted in the United Kingdom by Ahmed et al. (2019)  confirmed that digital technologies increase the performance of marketing communications between workers and stakeholders (managers, consumers, counterparties, etc.), thereby stimulating an increase in e-commerce sales. Likewise, enhancing e-business could lead to a reduction in poverty and income inequalities in society if big corporations offer discounts and hire local citizens for their logistics strategies (Ahmed et al., 2019 ). Authors such as Kwilinski et al. (2020) , Miskiewicz (2020)  and Almansour (2022)  have confirmed that e-business and digital marketing could positively affect SDG promotions and benefit reorientation toward sustainable business models. For example, Chmielarz and Zborowski (2022)  analyze the digitalization of the banking industry and its impact on SDG achievement. Based on empirical results, they stated that enhancing digitalization increases web sales, promoting fintech literacy among consumers and decreasing knowledge gaps. In the same way, Cao et al. (2021)  demonstrated that providing digital technologies, particularly digital finance, could stimulate positive effects on energy and ecological performance due to the reduction in the use of resources that could pollute the environment such as traveling to the office or managing portfolios in person. Also, it is important to note that expanding e-business allows for the improvement of environmental performance due to declining air emissions and effective resource use (Krishnan and Teo, 2011 ; Miskiewicz, 2022 ; Shahzad et al., 2022 ). This contributes to SDG8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, SDG10 – Reduced Inequalities, and SDG11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities. Simultaneously, the e-business concept contributes to increasing web sales, consequently strengthening business competitiveness (Cai et al., 2023 ). Yi and Thomas (2006)  suggest that e-business development could provoke a negative effect on a country's environmental performance, which could be mitigated by relevant governance policies. However, e-business could also limit SDG achievement. An analysis of companies by Li et al. (2020)  confirms that e-business has both positive and negative effects on ecological and social development. Therefore, effective state policies could compensate for the negative effects of e-business and enhance the positive impact. Thus, based on the analysis of the theoretical framework of e-business development, the following hypothesis is proposed:Hypothesis 2 e-Business strategies positively affect the attainment of SDGs.     3 Methodology 3.1 Data sampling Considering the research hypotheses proposed for this study, the dependent variable is defined as attainment of SDGs. For the purpose of this study, it is measured by the SDG Index, which is calculated by specialists from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN). This index allows countries to compare their success in attaining SDGs (Sachs et al., 2022 ). According to Sachs et al. (2022) , the SDG Index is calculated as integrated indicators that estimate 17 goals under 169 indicators. Additionally, this study considers two explanatory variables: e-business and e-governance. Based on previous studies (Oláh et al., 2018 ; Šaković Jovanović et al., 2020 ), e-business is estimated within three core indicators: enterprises with e-commerce sales; enterprises with e-commerce sales of at least 1 % turnover; and enterprises with web sales (via websites, apps or marketplaces). All indicators are measured as the percentage of enterprises. Also similar to prior studies (Ha, 2022 ; Nham, 2022 ; Secundo et al., 2022 ; Scutariu et al., 2022 ), e-governance is estimated by the following indicators: the composite indicator that measured the quality level of the services to businesses and citizens: eID, eDocuments, Authentic Sources and Digital Post; digital public services for businesses, the extent to which a service or information concerning a service for businesses is provided online and via a portal; digital public services for citizens, and the extent to which a service or information concerning service for citizens is digitally provided. In line with previous studies (Khan et al., 2019 ; Sabir et al., 2019 ; Alsaleh et al., 2021 ; Lyeonov et al., 2021 ), this study applies the following control variables: 1) institutions' quality (WGI) is measured by the World Governance Indicators (Thomas, 2010 ), which are developed and calculated by experts from the World Bank (DiLorenzo, 2023 ); 2) industrialization of the country (IND) is estimated as manufacturing added value as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP); and 3) research and development (RD) is measured by total patent applications in the country. The object of investigation is EU countries in the period 2011–2020. The explanations of the variables, sources, unit measures and descriptive statistics of the data are presented in Table 1  . The data are compiled from the analytical report of the SDGs' achievements (Sachs et al., 2022 ), the statistical office of the European Union Eurostat (2023) , and the World Bank Open Data (2023) .  3.2 Empirical model As previously highlighted, this study employs a panel data methodology encompassing EU member states. This approach facilitates a precise quantification of economic impacts while concurrently addressing fundamental dimensions that elude direct encapsulation by discrete variables. Moreover, the utilization of panel data enables the discernment of interrelationships among e-governance, e-business, and the achievement of SDGs, notwithstanding the constraints posed by the limited dataset pertaining to the parameters under scrutiny. In the first stage, this study checks the collinearity between selected variables. This issue could be caused by high correlation between explanatory variables, which provokes inadequate model results. The study applies the variance inflation factor (VIF) (Cheng et al., 2022 ) to check the collinearity (formula 1 ):(1) VIF = 1 1 − R j 2       where R j 2    determination coefficient of j-explanatory variables. The threshold value of VIF   is 10. If VIF is higher than the threshold value, the variable with high collinearity will be eliminated from the model. It should be noted that the EU implements coherent social, economic, political, and ecological policies involving policy on attaining SDGs. It provokes the issue that data could be subject to pervasive cross-sectional dependence. This is explained by the effect of some unobservable general factors common to all countries and affecting each of them. The presence of cross-dependence between the selected countries is checked by the Pesaran cross-dependence test (Pesaran, 2021 ):(2) CD = 2 T  N N − 1     ∑ i = 1  N − 1   ∑ j = i + 1  N  ρ ij  ̂      → N 0 1     where N – the cross-sectional dimension; T   – time dimension; ρ ij    – pairwise correlation coefficients of the OLS residuals:(3) ρ ij =   ̂  ∑ t = 1  T  e it  e jt   ∑ t = 1  T  e it 2    1 / 2   ∑ t = 1  T  e Jt 2    1 / 2        where e it    – the OLS residuals for country i. In the next stage, the study analyses the features of time series data, as using panel data model estimation techniques for nonstationary panel data series could lead to misleading results. To check this assumption, the study applies unit root tests. It allows checking if the data are stationary at level or integrated at the first difference. The features of the data explain the application of Levin–Lin–Chu (Levin et al., 2002 ), Im–Pesaran–Shin (Im et al., 2003 ), and augmented Dickey–Fuller (Dolado et al., 2002 ) tests. The null hypothesis is H 0    – data are nonstationary, and the unit root exists; the alternative hypothesis is H 1    – the data are stationary, and the unit root does not exist. In addition to the above tests, the second-generation CIPS test (Westerlund et al., 2016 ) is also applied. It is reliable when there is heterogeneity and cross-dependence between sample countries for the analysed variables. The cross-correlation in the panel regression means that the values of the explanatory variables could depend on each other. Consequently, it could provoke autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, which affects the regression results. The abovementioned justifies applying panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) (Zakari et al., 2022 ) to check the research hypothesis:(4) SDG it  = α 0  + β 1  DT it  + β 2  WGI it  + β 3  IND it  + β 4  RD it  + φ t  + ω i  + ε it     where DT it    – digital transformation in country i at time t estimated by e-governance and e-business; α 0    – constant of the panel regression β 1  … β 4    – searching parameters of the model; φ t    – country fixed effect; ω i    – year fixed effect; ε it    – the error term. The value of PSCE allows generating unbiased assessment results. In addition, feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) (Bai et al., 2021 ) are provided to check the validity of the results and control the fixed effects.   4 Analysis of results At the first stage of the investigation, all data are checked on correlation. In this way, the correlation analysis of the selected variables is shown in Table 2  . In the next stage of the investigation, the multicollinearity among independent variables is checked by calculating the variance inflation factor. Considering the findings (Table 3  ), the value of the variance inflation factor exceeds the threshold value – 10 for enterprises with e-commerce sales (e 1   ) and enterprises with e-commerce sales of at least 1 % turnover (e 2   ). The analysis of e-governance and e-business impact on SDGs' achievements separately from each other is justified. The empirical results of cross-sectional independence among the analysed variables with Pesaran's test are shown in Table 4  . The results of Pesaran's test are statistically significant at 1 %, which allows rejecting the null hypothesis that the data are cross-sectionally independent. These results in Table 4  are coherent with the chosen method to analyze the effect of e-governance and e-business on attaining SDGs. The existence of cross-sectional dependence is caused by the object of investigation – EU countries that have similar features within economic groups, involving trade, capital mobility, integrated financial systems, etc. The findings of checking the unit root in panel data for e 1   , e 2   , e 3   , eGov ke   , eGov busin   , eGov citz   , WGI, IND, and RD are shown in Table 5  . The null hypothesis for Levin–Lin–Chu, Im-Pesaran-Shin and augmented Dickey–Fuller tests is the existence of a unit root in panel data. It should be noted that empirical results allow rejecting the null hypothesis at level only for eGov ke   , eGov busin   , WGI, IND, RD only within the Levin–Lin–Chu test. However, at the 1st difference, all tests allow rejecting the null hypothesis on unit root tests for all variables. Despite the fact that most unit root panel tests indicate that the data are integrated to the first order, these tests of the first generation provide inconsistent results overall. The findings of the CIPS test allow rejecting the null hypothesis on stationarity at the level for e 1   , e 2   , eGov citz   , WGI, IND, and RD. However, after implicating the first difference, all variables become stationary at 1 % and 5 % statistically significant levels. The first order I (1) of integration among the variables allows determining their long-term relation. The findings in Table 6   allow us to conclude that during the analysed time, the following indicators positively impacted the attainment of SDGs: enterprises with e-commerce sales, enterprises with e-commerce sales of at least 1 % turnover, the quality level of the services to businesses and citizens, digital public services for businesses, and digital public services for citizens. The statistical significance of that indicator was 1 %, and the relevant coefficients of the analysed variables were positive. The effect of enterprises with web sales on SDG achievement was not statistically significant. The values of the coefficients in Table 6  confirm that countries with enterprises with e-commerce sales of at least 1 % turnover, enterprises with e-commerce sales and the quality level of the services to businesses and citizens achieve better results in attaining SDGs. Furthermore, the changes in the following variables are conducive to SDGs achievement: quality of institutions, industrial structure, and innovation development, which is measured by patent applications. In all analysed models, these indicators have a statistically significant impact on attaining SDGs at the 5 % level. Thus, the countries that promote innovation activity intensify the attainment of SDGs. It confirms the compensatory hypothesis that enlarging international competition prompts countries' governments to increase spending on innovative activities to increase the inflow of foreign direct investments, enhance business energy efficiency, modernize carbon-neutral fixed assets, etc. Mainly it is caused by the EU's acceptance of ambitious goals to decline emissions to the environment. Furthermore, the provision of quotas for greenhouse gas emissions in the EU determines the positive impact of IND on the SDGs. Thus, the income from the sale of permits for GHG emissions provides financial accumulation, which could be directed toward green projects to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase renewable energy (the core dimensions of the SDGs' achievements). The positive impact of WGI on SDGs reveals the institutional capabilities and availability of countries for adaptation to negative external factors, overcoming ecological, social and economic and energy issues, etc., during the attainment of SDGs. Applying the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) model allows for confirming conclusions on e-governance and e-business effects on attaining SDGs. The calculated coefficients for model (4) are unchanged, which indicates the reliability and validity of the obtained results (Table 7 ) . These results are coherent with the research hypotheses defined for this study, since globalization in EU countries, particularly e-governance (Hypothesis 1  ) e-business (Hypothesis 2  ) adoption, is generally shown to be positively associated with the attainment of SDGs. However, Hypothesis 2  is only partially supported, as the effect of enterprises with web sales (via websites, apps or marketplaces) was only confirmed when considering the control variables Estimate of governance (WG1), Manufacturing value added (IND), and Patent applications (RD). A discussion of the findings is included in the next section.  5 Discussion As highlighted before, existing literature underscores the positive influence of e-governance on the attainment of SDGs. By simplifying communication between government and stakeholders, e-governance not only enhances transparency and information dissemination (Misra, 2012 ; Das and Harekrishna, 2018 ) but also plays a crucial role in reducing digital gaps (Myeong et al., 2014 ; Morales and Robalino-Lopez, 2020 ). These improvements, in turn, foster the accountability and transparency that are critical for the attainment of SDGs. Consequently, the enhancement of e-governance is generally considered to be crucial in achieving SDGs (Krishnan and Teo, 2011 ; Ullah et al., 2021a, 2021b ; Miskiewicz, 2022 ). Nevertheless, the intricacies of this relationship are potentially affected by factors unique to each country, a notion substantiated by certain investigations that have yielded disparate outcomes, as documented in Yu (2015) . The empirical evidence amassed in this research offers a substantive contribution to the extant discourse, by more comprehensively delineating the anticipated affirmative effects of e-governance on the trajectory of sustainable development. This underscores the multifaceted nature of the e-governance-sustainable development nexus and signals the need for nuanced analyses that account for the heterogeneity of national contexts. In fact, this study found that a one-point improvement in e-government, specifically in terms of the quality level of services to businesses and citizens (i.e., eGov ke  , which combines eID, eDocuments, Authentic Sources, and Digital Post), promotes the attainment of the SDGs by 0.057. This confirms that the impact is both positive and statistically significant. Likewise, a one-point increase in digital public services for businesses (eGov Busin  ) and digital public services for citizens (eGov citz  ) enhances the attainment of the SDGs by 0.035 and 0.016, respectively. These findings are consistent with the results of previous studies (Dalela et al., 2020 ; ElMassah and Mohieldin, 2020 ; Ramasamy, 2021 ). The transformative potential of digital technologies in catalyzing a shift toward sustainable business paradigms is well-recognized in the academic sphere (Kwilinski et al., 2020 ; Miskiewicz, 2020 ; Almansour, 2022 ). Furthermore, these technologies significantly bolster accountability and transparency within business operations, which are acknowledged as pivotal factors underpinning sustainable development (Ahmed et al., 2019 ; Vaníčková and Szczepańska-Woszczyna, 2020 ; Gonçalves and Silva, 2021 ; Dal Forno et al., 2023 ). In alignment with this perspective, there is a burgeoning corpus of literature that coherently posits the digitalization of enterprises, particularly through the integration of e-business practices, as a lever for fostering long-term sustainable development. This digitalization not only propels efficiency and resource optimization but also engenders novel pathways for stakeholder engagement and value creation that are essential for the attainment of sustainability objectives. Further supporting these contributions, our study found that the growth of the share of enterprises with e-commerce sales (e 1 ) by one point increases the SDG index by 0.077. Similarly, the growth of the share of enterprises with e-commerce sales of at least 1 % turnover (e 2 ) by one-point accounts for an increase of the attainment of SDGs in 0.110. These findings are consistent with the conclusions of previous studies (Choi and Jin, 2015 ; Kwilinski et al., 2020 ; Miskiewicz, 2020 ; Almansour, 2022 ). However, the growth of the share of enterprises with web sales (via websites, apps, or marketplaces) was non-significant. In addition, digitalization contributes to knowledge sharing (Ismail et al., 2020 ), transparency in cooperation and communications between business, government, and local communities, which is the core element of sustainable development. The empirical findings of this research delineate a clear trajectory wherein the enhancement of institutional quality, as indicated by the WGI, precipitated by digitalization, facilitates a marked augmentation in the SDG index. This observation resonates with the conclusions drawn in prior studies (Todoruţ and Tselentis, 2018 ; Palacin et al., 2021 ; Mohammadian et al., 2022 ), which collectively underscore the salutary impact of robust institutional frameworks on the achievement of SDGs. Intriguingly, the analysis further reveals that a nation's level of industrialization, alongside its commitment to research and development—proxied by the volume of patent registrations—not only independently contributes to SDG attainment but also amplifies the positive effects emanating from institutional quality. This suggests a synergistic interplay between institutional integrity, industrial prowess, and innovative capacity in driving sustainable development. 5.1 Theoretical contributions This study makes a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on the role of digitalization in achieving sustainable development, with a specific focus on e-business and e-governance. Existing literature covers various aspects related to this field, including the role of e-governance in sustainable development (e.g., Misra, 2012 ; Myeong et al., 2014 ) and the positive influence of digital technologies on economic and environmental performance (e.g., Li et al., 2020 ; Cao et al., 2021 ). These studies contribute to understanding the complex interplay between digitalization, governance, innovation, and sustainable development across different sectors and regions. However, our study goes beyond by emphasizing the complementarity of e-business and e-government initiatives in attaining SDGs. Moreover, it provides compelling evidence of the more impactful effect of e-governance, based on data from the European Union, and highlights that governance performance, industrialization, and research and development act as facilitators of this process, fostering the studied impacts. As a result, the study offers a relevant framework for comparing the sustainable development of different countries or regions, and it can be instrumental in guiding the planning efforts of various stakeholders, including companies and policymakers. Overall, this study demonstrates that digitalization, especially when manifested through e-governance and e-business practices, occupies a central role in the promotion of sustainable development. The nuanced findings of this study elucidate the intricate and multifaceted relationship between digitalization initiatives and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Additionally, this study illuminates the previously observed incongruities regarding the influence of e-governance on sustainable development, emphasizing the significance of contextual factors specific to individual countries. By delving into these complexities, the research provides robust evidence that substantiates the advantageous impact of e-governance on sustainable development, thereby reinforcing its vital contribution to the realization of SDGs. Furthermore, this study accentuates the synergistic potential when e-governance initiatives are complemented by the digitalization efforts of the private sector. Collectively, these intertwined strategies potentiate the efficacy with which the objectives of the SDGs are pursued and ultimately achieved, offering a comprehensive and integrated approach to fostering a sustainable future through digital transformation.  5.2 Managerial and policy implications The present findings demonstrate that e-business has a positive impact on the attainment of SDGs, providing essential insights for managers. As businesses face increasing pressure to incorporate sustainability into their models (Hsu and Chen, 2023 ), this study reveals that leveraging digitalization, particularly by further developing e-commerce, can help foster sustainable development. As such, investing in this sales alternative and enhancing the role of e-commerce in overall sales can be an effective strategy for promoting sustainability and achieving corporate social responsibility goals of companies. The expansion of e-business can lead to improved environmental performance by reducing air emissions and optimizing resource utilization (Krishnan and Teo, 2011 ; Miskiewicz, 2022 ). However, it is crucial to acknowledge that while e-business may boost web sales and enhance business competitiveness, it could also pose challenges in achieving SDGs if not adequately managed. Appropriate governance policies are necessary to mitigate potential negative impacts on a country's environmental performance (Yi and Thomas, 2006 ; Li et al., 2020 ). This study also offers valuable insights for policymakers. As noted by Sinha et al. (2020) , certain countries have encountered difficulties in achieving SDGs. The present findings underscore the significance of government-led digitalization initiatives. Specifically, digitalizing services for citizens and businesses can expedite SDG attainment. Governments hold a dual responsibility in promoting e-government while simultaneously creating an environment conducive to increased e-business adoption through technological resources, financial support, incentives, and legislative measures. Preparing the workforce for the gradual adoption of e-business and e-government, and equipping countries with effective and affordable technological means, are other critical steps in harnessing the positive effects of e-government and e-business for sustainable development. Furthermore, policymakers should prioritize and promote innovation activity within their countries, recognizing its positive impact on SDG achievement. Encouraging research, development, and patent applications can attract foreign investments and drive eco-friendly practices and contribute to sustainable development. Additionally, strengthening institutional capabilities through effective governance and regulation is crucial to adapt to external challenges and address environmental, social, and economic issues while pursuing SDGs. Embracing sustainable industrial structures and incentivizing eco-friendly practices can further support the attainment of SDGs.   6 Conclusions The synthesis of empirical evidence from this study highlights the pivotal role of e-governance and e-business in promoting sustainable development within the EU. Digitalization, particularly through enhanced e-governance, has been found to substantially advance the attainment of SDGs. Quality improvements in e-governance services for businesses and citizens directly correlate with significant strides in SDG achievement, reaffirming the vital role of digital transformation in fostering transparency, efficiency, and stakeholder engagement. This study also reveals the transformative potential of e-business in driving sustainable development. The integration of digital technologies in business models not only optimizes efficiency and resource utilization but also creates new opportunities for stakeholder involvement and value creation. Empirical data indicates that an increase in e-commerce sales significantly boosts the SDG index, underscoring the synergistic impact of e-business practices on sustainability objectives. Moreover, the research findings underscore the importance of robust institutional frameworks in achieving sustainable development. The enhancement of institutional quality, facilitated by digitalization, results in notable improvements in the SDG index. A country's level of industrialization and commitment to research and development further amplify the positive effects of institutional integrity on SDG attainment, suggesting a synergistic interplay between institutional quality, industrial prowess, and innovation capacity. Finally, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the complex relationship between digitalization, e-governance, e-business, and sustainable development. It underlines the centrality of digital transformation, particularly through e-governance and e-business practices, in achieving SDGs. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and business leaders aiming to leverage digitalization for sustainable development, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach that considers the unique contexts of different countries. 6.1 Limitations and future research directions Despite the valuable findings, this study is not without limitations. Firstly, it is confined to a recent time span and focuses solely on countries within the European Union. Consequently, contextual factors, such as political initiatives that promote sustainability, cannot be dissociated from the findings, and different conclusions may arise from diverse regions, encompassing both developed and developing countries. Therefore, it is recommended to compare these findings with data from other regions for a more comprehensive understanding. Moreover, relevant variables that could provide further insights into the achievement of SDGs, such as green innovation and green knowledge, were beyond the scope of this study and should be considered in future research. Additionally, considering previous studies (Bharadwaj and Deka, 2021 ; Ayub Khan et al., 2022 ), it is worth exploring how digitalization may lead to the proliferation of cryptocurrencies, which could serve as investment capital for attaining SDGs. It is also pertinent to analyze how digitalization influences trust in e-governance and its implications for achieving SDGs. Furthermore, future investigations should consider the nonlinear effects of digitalization and other inhibiting factors on the success of attaining SDGs. Additionally, while this study analysed the impact of e-governance and e-business on the integrated SDG index, further analysis should explore the specific impact of digitalization on individual goals of sustainable development. It is essential to consider the potential causal relationship between digitalization, the quality of institutions, and the achievement of SDGs in more depth.
