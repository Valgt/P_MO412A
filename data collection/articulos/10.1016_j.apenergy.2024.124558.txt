                  The literature widely recognizes the importance of effective economic policies in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). However, existing research fails to examine how these policies synergistically affect the achievement of SDG 7 targets. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a configurational analysis to identify various combinations of economic policies through which countries can reach SDG 7 targets. Drawing on empirical evidence from 41 OECD and European countries, the findings suggest that governments must (1) enhance coherence of their economic policies through collaboration among and within government bodies, (2) promote prosperity and innovation opportunities by fostering inclusive labor markets, and (3) implement international financial regulations to facilitate energy investments. Policymakers can utilize these findings to identifying key policy levers, enhance innovation in policy making, and develop appropriate strategies for achieving sustainable development goals.

The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) — one of 17 sustainable goals of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development— was established in 2015 as a global plan to ensure universal access to affordable and clean energy by 2030 [1 ,2 ]. SDG 7 highlights the urgent need for all United Nations member states to develop and implement policies, initiatives, and investments geared toward providing equitable access to affordable and clean energy sources. Despite growing efforts, progress toward achieving SDG 7 has been uneven both globally and within specific regions. The 2023 edition of Tracking SDG 7 [3 ], a global reference point for monitoring its realization, highlights that 675 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity, and over 2.3 billion do not have access to clean cooking facilities [4 ]. Even within European and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, significant disparities exist in meeting SDG 7 targets. While countries such as Finland, Sweden, and Germany have made substantial progress due to effective economic policies, others continue to face persistent challenges [5 ]. A key challenge in these countries is the persistence of policy silos, which hinder progress toward SDG 7 by preventing the integration of various policy areas. As noted in the literature, ‘such policy silos may thwart robust policy responses and deprioritize important policy goals and values’ ([6 ], p. 32). This situation underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the policy environments within OECD and European countries, considering their diverse economic, social, and infrastructural contexts. Despite the importance of this issue, existing literature reveals two major shortcomings. First, it has not sufficiently identified the policy voids and opportunities that are critical for accelerating progress toward SDG 7 in these developed regions, especially given their significant reliance on fossil fuels [7 ,8 ]. Second, while many studies establish a clear link between economic policies and SDG 7 outcomes [9 ], they often adopt a “net effects” approach. This approach evaluates the impact of individual policies in isolation, contributing to the very policy silos that hinder progress, and failing to consider how different economic policies interact or combine to influence outcomes [10 ]. As a result, these studies overlook the potential synergistic effects of coordinated economic policies, which could significantly accelerate the achievement of SDG 7 targets. To address these gaps, this research poses the following research questions: (1) “What economic policy pathways, specific to OECD and European countries, are most effective in overcoming policy silos and achieving SDG 7 targets?”, and (2) “How can the identification of necessary, complementary, and substitutionary economic policies to reach SDG 7 targets in these regions be accomplished?” This paper aims to address these questions through a configurational analysis using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). fsQCA is an algorithmic methodology that leverages fuzzy set theory and Boolean logic to explore the core principles of configuration theory [11 ]. This method is employed to identify multiple pathways that are equally effective in achieving SDG 7 targets across 41 European and OECD countries. Specifically, it examines various configurations of economic policies that contribute to these targets, even when a specific policy has a neutral or minimal impact. Moreover, this approach allows for a detailed understanding of the different roles economic policies can play by categorizing them into three distinct groups: (1) necessary policies, which are essential for achieving SDG 7 targets and cannot be substituted; (2) complementary policies, which alone are insufficient to achieve these targets but contribute when combined with other policies; and (3) substitutionary policies, which can effectively compensate for the absence of other policies [12 ]. This study advances the methodological approach to sustainable energy research by addressing the limitations of conventional statistical methods. In energy policy research, data relationships are inherently asymmetrical [13 ], meaning that factors contributing to the achievement of SDG 7 targets in one country may not apply, or may even work inversely, in another [14 ]. For example, an economic policy promoting renewable energy might be crucial for progress in one country but could yield different results—or even hinder progress—in another due to varying economic conditions. Traditional statistical methodologies, which are symmetric by design, often overlook these complex, context-dependent interactions between policies [13 ]. As a result, they fail to accurately capture such asymmetrical relationships. By employing fsQCA, this study directly addresses these asymmetries, examining how different economic policies interact and collectively impact the attainment of SDG 7 goals. Unlike traditional methods that analyze policies in isolation, this research emphasizes the synergistic effects of various policies, providing a detailed understanding of energy sustainability as a causally complex phenomenon. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the extant literature on the connection between economic variables/policies and sustainable energy. In Section 3, a detailed discussion of the data and methods used for this research is provided, followed by a discussion of the results in Section 4. Section 5 presents the policy implications emerging from this research. Finally, the paper is summarized in Section 6, which also suggests avenues for future research.  2 Literature review 2.1 Prior research on economic approaches to sustainable energy The literature has widely adopted an economic approach to address issues related to access to clean and affordable energy [15 ]. Existing literature can be categorized into three streams based on similarities in scope and methodology. The first stream, predominant in the literature, examines how various economic factors or variables influence the achievement of sustainable energy. This research often focuses on specific aspects of sustainability, such as energy affordability or access to clean energy sources. For example, Legendre and Ricci [16 ] developed a logistic regression model to assess the correlation between household income and fuel poverty, defined as the inability of citizens to heat or cool their houses adequately on their current incomes. Burlinson et al. [17 ] proposed a multinomial logit model to evaluate how income, housing, and energy costs might affect the level of fuel poverty in England. Using statistical matching techniques, Romero-Jordán and del Río [18 ] analyzed the interplay between various socioeconomic factors, such as household income and electricity consumption. Indeed, much of the literature in this stream has conducted correlation analyses to examine the relationships between energy choices and economic factors, such as the price of alternative energy sources [19 ], household income [20 ], and ownership of goods [21 ]. The second stream extends beyond economic-driven variables and focuses on economic policies. Specifically, this stream explores the impact of economic policies on factors such as energy efficiency, energy access, and renewable energy. For instance, Troncoso and da Silva [22 ] examined how subsidy policies affect the use of solid fuels for cooking in Latin America. Marianti et al. [23 ] utilized empirical data from rural areas in Indonesia to assess the impact of government funds programs on enhancing access to renewable energy. Building on literature reviews, Mushafiq et al. [24 ] described the role of three economic policies — subsidies, tax incentives, and market-based mechanisms — in promoting energy efficiency. Cheng et al. [25 ] conducted a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate the effect of green finance policy on renewable energy utilization in five pilot zones in China. The third stream focuses on economic policy uncertainty (EPU), defined as unpredictable regulatory and policy frameworks for the near future [26 ,27 ]. The literature in this stream has examined the nexus between EPU and the achievement of sustainable energy. For example, Yu et al. [28 ] investigated the impact of EPU on the intensity of carbon emissions of manufacturing firms and found that EPU leads to an increased use of fossil fuels. Pata et al. [29 ] evaluated the effect of economic policy uncertainty on investment in renewable energy in G7 countries, concluding that such uncertainty significantly reduces investment levels. Based on empirical observations, Wang et al. [30 ] found that EPU hinders the transition to sustainable energy. The authors highlighted the need to increase the flexibility of economic policies to address uncertainty and accelerate the energy transition. The review of existing literature on the relationship between the economy and sustainable energy reveals a tendency to focus narrowly on the impact of EPU on sustainable energy, or to adopt a net effects approach that isolates the direct relationships between specific economic policies and elements of energy sustainability. However, these studies have largely neglected to examine how various economic policies might interact synergistically to influence the achievement of SDG 7 targets. In other words, the prevailing research predominantly relies on conventional correlation-based methods, which inherently assume symmetrical relationships between variables. This assumption is problematic, as complex systems like energy systems often exhibit asymmetrical relationships [14 ]. Such asymmetry implies that economic policies effective in promoting SDG 7 goals in certain contexts may not have the same impact, or could even produce opposite effects, in different contexts. As a result, the use of symmetrical correlation-based methods can lead to significant inaccuracies and misinterpretations [13 ]. Therefore, there is a critical need for methodologies that can account for the complex and asymmetrical nature of these relationships to more accurately assess the impact of economic policies on sustainable energy outcomes.  2.2 Policy development and implementation in OECD and European countries The literature indicates that fossil fuel consumption in OECD and European countries continues to increase [31 ]. Several studies have explored how policy development and implementation, particularly economic policies, contribute to achieving SDG 7 goals in these regions. For instance, Verschaeve et al. [32 ] suggested that policy coherence could provide a foundation for developing an international policy framework to achieve sustainable development goals in OECD countries. The authors further examined factors that could enhance such coherence, such as aligning national policies with international environmental standards and encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration. Athari [7 ] analyzed the impact of environmental policy stringency—defined as the degree of strictness and demands of environmental regulations—on renewable energy consumption across 27 OECD countries. Similarly, based on empirical data from 24 OECD countries, Pata and Karlilar [8 ] investigated how environmental policy stringency affects the fossil fuel material footprint, offering insights into how more stringent regulations might alter fossil fuel consumption patterns. Additionally, Bakhsh et al. [33 ] examined the role of green finance policies in achieving SDG 7 targets by channeling capital toward renewable energy projects in OECD countries, highlighting how financial incentives can drive the transition to sustainable energy sources. Despite the critical role of OECD and European countries in global energy consumption and policy development, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the policy voids and opportunities in these regions. Most existing studies tend to focus on isolated policies, such as green finance initiatives or environmental regulations, and assess their impact on achieving SDG 7 goals independently. However, the comprehensive scope of energy sustainability, as outlined by SDG 7—which includes a wide array of interconnected policies—has not been sufficiently explored. Table 1   presents a comparison of this study with existing research on economic approaches to sustainable energy and policy perspectives for achieving SDG 7 targets, as discussed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. As shown, most studies focus narrowly on the impact of specific policies or rely on correlation-based methods that assume symmetrical relationships between variables. This approach overlooks the complex, asymmetrical interactions in energy systems. This study addresses the gap in understanding these interactions, particularly in OECD and European contexts, by exploring how economic policies synergistically influence SDG 7 targets in these regions.   3 Materials and methods 3.1 Data sources This study examines a sample comprising 41 members of both OECD and European countries, as illustrated in Fig. 1  . These countries exhibit a relatively high level of dedication to sustainable development. This commitment is notably enforced by the OECD and the European Union (EU), which require member states to enhance their legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to align with OECD and EU sustainability principles. Consequently, the dataset offers an opportunity to benchmark countries against those with best practices in attaining SDG 7 targets. Two publicly available datasets were used to obtain data for this research. The first set of data is related to success in achieving economic policy outcomes, which was collected from the Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI) dataset. The SGI dataset, maintained by the Bertelsmann Foundation, can be accessed at (https://www.sgi-network.org/2022/Data ). The second set of data was obtained from the 2023 edition of tracking sustainable development goals prepared by the SDG Transformation Center [5 ]. The report evaluates the progress made on attaining SDG 7 targets by analyzing data collected from multiple international organizations and research centers such as the World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), and International Energy Agency (IEA).  3.2 Variables and measures 3.2.1 Economic policy indicators The SGI dataset offers a comprehensive survey of indicators that measure the effectiveness of economic policies in the OECD and European countries, constructed based on a cross-national survey of 35 economic indicators. These indicators can be classified under six main dimensions (shown in Fig. 2  ). More explicitly, these dimensions demonstrate the extent to which each country has achieved economic policy outcomes, assessed through six metrics including [35 ]:1. Economic policy coherence:  This metric evaluates how effectively institutional frameworks align and function to create a stable and consistent economic environment. It measures the success of these frameworks in ensuring coherent and reliable economic governance [36 ]. Indeed, coherent policies reduce uncertainties and contradictions that could otherwise hamper economic growth, especially in complex regulatory systems [37 ]. This metric is crucial for achieving SGI 7 targets as it ensures that institutional frameworks and regulatory environments are stable, consistent, and supportive of sustainable economic practices.  2. Inclusive labor markets:  This dimension evaluates the effectiveness of labor market policies in reducing unemployment and fostering inclusivity. It assesses how well these policies promote workforce participation, particularly for vulnerable groups. Specifically, it measures the extent to which labor market regulation is balanced and successful in addressing unemployment and ensuring broad-based participation. The sub-indicator “employment participation” highlights the impact of policies aimed at not only lowering overall unemployment but also increasing participation among marginalized groups, including older workers, immigrants, and individuals with disabilities [35 ]. Effective labor market policies that reduce unemployment and promote inclusivity directly support SGI 7 targets related to equitable access to clean and affordable energy.  3. Tax policies:  This metric evaluates how well tax policies promote social equity and fairness within the country. Additionally, this dimension emphasizes the extent to which taxes on economic activities align with the damage caused by pollution, ensuring that polluters bear the true cost of their environmental impact, thus promoting both fiscal responsibility and environmental sustainability [38 ]. Tax policies that promote social equity and align with environmental damage are essential for achieving SGI 7 targets.  4. Budgetary policies:  This dimension examines the sustainability of budgetary policies, with a focus on fiscal responsibility and long-term economic stability. It measures It assesses how well governments manage their budgets and financial resources to ensure not only immediate fiscal health but also enduring economic sustainability. Sustainable budgetary policies are fundamental to achieving SGI 7 targets as they ensure that financial resources are managed effectively to support long-term economic stability and sustainability [35 ].  5. Capacity for research and innovation:  This metric evaluates the effectiveness of policies aimed at fostering research and development (R&D) and driving innovation. It encompasses various dimensions, including R&D expenditure, innovation policy frameworks, scientific output, human capital development, and infrastructure investment. By assessing these facets, this metric provides a comprehensive view of how well a country is equipped to advance technological advancements and innovative solutions. This capacity is crucial for addressing sustainable development goals, particularly in the energy sector, where breakthroughs and improvements are necessary for progress [39 ].  6. Effective global financial systems:  This dimension assesses a country's success in implementing and adhering to international financial regulations, highlighting their global financial integration and stability. It encompasses several critical aspects of a country's financial system, including capital ratios, financial secrecy practices, external debts, non-performing loans, and overall integration into the global financial network. This indicator assesses how well national financial systems align with international standards, manage financial risks, and contribute to global financial stability and transparency [35 ]. Indeed, the effectiveness of a country's global financial system is directly related to SGI 7 targets through its impact on financial stability, transparency, and integration.    Each of these metrics is scored on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 represents the highest level of effectiveness, and 1 reflects minimal or ineffective performance.  3.2.2 SDG 7 score The SDG 7 score of a country serves as a comprehensive indicator of its overall performance in achieving equitable access to affordable and clean energy. This score is calculated using data collected from both official sources—such as national government reports and international organizations such as the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and the International Energy Agency (IEA)—and non-official sources, including private research institutions, universities, and NGOs [40 ]. The SDG 7 score ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest possible performance and 100 signifies that the country has fully met the SDG 7 targets. Essentially, the score can be interpreted as the percentage of the SDG 7 targets that a country has achieved. Therefore, the difference between a country's SDG 7 score and 100 indicates how much progress remains for the country to successfully achieve the SDG 7 targets.   3.3 Configurational analysis To find various combinations of economic policies leading to achieving success in reaching SDG 7 targets, this study developed an fsQCA model by following three consecutive steps. In the first step, the model variables were calibrated by converting them into fuzzy sets. Subsequently, the second step constructed a truth table using the calibrated data. The third step involved assessing the predictive validity of the proposed model. Fig. 3   depicts the procedural steps of this study, outlining the objective of each step. 3.3.1 Step 1-data calibration This step involved calibrating both the economic policy metrics (discussed in Section 3.2.1) and SDG 7 scores (discussed in Section 3.2.2) by transforming them into fuzzy sets. Calibrated measures are considered superior to conventional non-fuzzy measures because they capture the nuances of categorical membership more effectively. For example, consider the proposition: “The global financial system in country X  is highly effective.” Using a non-fuzzy measure, we might assign a precise value, such as 0.95, to this proposition, indicating that the system's effectiveness is relatively high compared to a value of 0.80 or an average effectiveness score of 0.85. However, while 0.95 is a precise numerical value, it lacks precision in meaning because the term “highly” can be subject to varying interpretations—such as “certainly highly,” “likely highly,” or even “uncertain.” Data calibration addresses this issue by converting these precise values into fuzzy set membership values within the interval [0,1] [41 ]. Fuzzy values represent the degree to which an observation belongs to a particular category, where a membership score of 1 indicates full membership in the fuzzy set, and a score of 0 indicates full non-membership [42 ]. A score of 0.5 suggests partial membership, indicating that the case is equally affiliated with both membership and non-membership categories. To calibrate the economic policy metrics, a quartile split of the sample was used. Specifically, breakpoints of 7.5, 5, and 2.5 were selected for model inputs, representing full membership, partial membership, and full non-membership, respectively, within a range of [0,10]. Similarly, for the output variable (SDG 7 scores), breakpoints of 85, 67.5, and 50 were utilized.  3.3.2 Step 2- constructing the truth table The second step constructed a truth table to identify the frequency of all possible configurations and causal conditions leading to the achievement of SDG 7 targets. The Quine-McCluskey technique was employed to develop fuzzy truth table algorithms. Subsequently, the truth table was organized based on consistency and coverage scores. The overall consistency score serves as an indicator of solution strength, while the overall coverage score indicates the extent to which a desirable outcome can be explained by existing configurations. The results of the configurational analysis revealed an overall consistency score of 0.8139. This score surpasses the minimum thresholds of 0.75, as suggested by the literature [13 ,10 ]. The configurational analysis yielded two configurations (shown in Table 2  ). In the table, solid circles (●) signify the presence of a core condition, X-circles (⊗) indicate the absence of a condition, and blank spaces represent a “don't care” condition. This indicates that neither the presence nor the absence of the condition is linked to the achievement of SDG 7 targets.  3.3.3 Step 3- evaluating predictive validity The third step assessed the predictive validity of the proposed method. To evaluate how effectively the model predicts the achievement of a desirable outcome, it must demonstrate its fitting capabilities with new data, in addition to expected data. This study adopted the validation method outlined by Pappas et al. (2020) to test the predictive validity of the model. Initially, the sample was divided into a subsample and a holdout sample by randomly excluding 20 countries from the original dataset. Consequently, the subsample comprised 20 countries, while the holdout sample consisted of the remaining 21 countries. A configurational analysis was then conducted for the subsample to identify various causal conditions leading to the achievement of SDG 7 targets. Subsequently, the resulting configurations were tested using data from the holdout sample. Fuzzy XY plots were generated to provide evidence of the predictive capability of the proposed method, with Fig. 4   illustrating the fuzzy XY plots corresponding to the identified configurations. The tests for configurations 1 and 2 revealed consistency scores exceeding 0.75, indicating that both the subsample and holdout sample effectively describe the outcome at a comparable level.    4 Discussion 4.1 Data analysis The configurational analysis, as shown in Table 2 , reveals two equifinal pathways to achieving SDG 7 targets through distinct policy configurations. These configurations highlight the complex interplay between various economic policy dimensions and their roles in attaining sustainable energy goals. In the first configuration, the combined influence of most economic policy dimensions can lead to high success in reaching SDG 7 targets, even without effective tax policies (TAX) and regardless of the effectiveness of policies for enhancing research and innovation capacity (RII). The second configuration demonstrates that SDG 7 targets can be achieved even when budgetary policies (BUD) are not sufficiently effective, provided other policy dimensions are robust. These findings underscore the substitutionary nature of certain economic policies within these configurations. Crucially, the analysis identifies three policy dimensions as essential for reaching SDG 7 targets: economic policy coherence (ECO), inclusive labor market (LBM), and effective global financial system (GFS). The necessity of these dimensions implies that SDG 7 goals cannot be achieved without their presence. However, the analysis also reveals that no single policy alone is sufficient to accomplish SDG 7 targets, indicating the complementary nature of these economic policies. This suggests that a combination of policies is required to secure the achievement of SDG 7 targets. Table 3   synthesizes these findings by categorizing economic policies and their configurations into three groups: necessary, complementary, and substitutionary. This categorization provides a deeper understanding of how different policy dimensions interact and contribute to achieving sustainable energy goals. In this context, the tilde symbol (⁓) is used to denote the absence of a condition in causal conditions.  4.2 The importance of economic policy coherence Policy coherence, as defined by the OECD, is “the systematic promotion of mutually reinforcing policy actions across government departments and agencies creating synergies towards achieving the agreed objectives” [43 ]. It is especially crucial for the OECD and European countries, where diverse and often complex economic policies must be aligned to avoid inefficiencies and contradictions [37 ]. Economic policy coherence—the extent to which institutional frameworks successfully create a reliable and consistent economic environment—is particularly vital in these regions[44 ]. These frameworks need to ensure alignment across various economic dimensions, such as energy, labor, and finance, to promote a coherent approach to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 [36 ]. Configurational analysis results emphasize the necessity of policy coherence in achieving SDG 7 targets, supporting previous literature that emphasizes the integrated and indivisible nature of sustainable development goals [45 ]. Given the multifaceted economic landscapes of OECD and European nations, coherent economic policies are vital for balancing various economic dimensions, such as energy, labor, and finance, to drive progress toward SDG 7. SDG Target 17.14 specifically highlights the importance of enhancing policy coherence to maximize co-benefits and minimize trade-offs among sustainable goals [46 ]. In the context of OECD and European countries, where policy silos often create significant barriers, fostering coherence among a broad array of economic policies is not just beneficial but necessary. This coherence enables these countries to exploit synergies, thereby accelerating their progress toward clean and affordable energy objectives [47 ]. Moreover, involving key stakeholders, such as NGOs, citizens, and independent supervisory bodies, is crucial in these countries, where public participation and transparency are often expected as part of the governance process. Enhanced policy coherence facilitates stakeholder engagement in decision-making, thereby fostering broader support for the implementation of SDG 7 [48 ]. This alignment of policies not only builds public trust but also enhances transparency, which is essential for maintaining public support for sustainable development initiatives [49 ].  4.3 The effect of fostering an inclusive labor market When examining the relationship between the labor market and SDG 7, most researchers and policymakers have traditionally focused on how the energy transition impacts the labor market rather than considering the reverse influence [50 ]. However, the results of configurational analysis offer new insights that challenge this one-dimensional perspective. The analysis identifies fostering an inclusive labor market—where labor policies effectively reduce unemployment and promote workforce participation across all segments of the population—as a necessary condition for achieving SDG 7 targets, a factor that has not been sufficiently explored in previous studies. This finding can be explained by two key factors that are particularly relevant to OECD and European countries. First, having an inclusive labor market is crucial for a strong economy and prosperous society. Such a market, characterized by policies that address unemployment and promote workforce participation across diverse groups, including older workers, immigrants, and people with disabilities, leads to higher household incomes and a more equitable distribution of wealth [35 ]. In the OECD and European contexts, where social welfare systems and economic equity are prioritized [51 ], higher-income households are more likely to have access to clean energy. This helps to reduce energy poverty, which is a critical aspect of achieving SDG 7 targets [52 ]. The reduction of energy poverty is widely recognized as a significant driver in attaining SDG 7. Second, an inclusive labor market that provides opportunities for citizens from diverse backgrounds to secure stable employment, especially in the energy sector, is essential for fostering social innovation. In countries where labor market inclusivity is a policy priority, this inclusiveness promotes creative solutions to the challenges faced by the energy sector [36 ]. By harnessing a diverse workforce, OECD and European countries can stimulate the innovation needed to overcome barriers in the energy transition and make progress toward SDG 7 targets [53 ].  4.4 The role of an effective global financial system The energy market in OECD and European countries is closely interconnected with the global economy, as these nations often rely on energy technologies and resources sourced from various parts of the world [54 ]. SDG Target 7.a emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in advancing research, technology, and investments in clean energy, highlighting the global dimension of SDG 7 [48 ]. To enhance their international cooperation, OECD and European countries must develop robust infrastructure to facilitate economic interactions on a global scale. This infrastructure depends on the integration of international regulations into their financial practices, enabling these nations to effectively address technological challenges related to emerging alternative energy sources [55 ]. The configurational analysis of OECD and European contexts underscores the necessity of strong economic interactions among these countries by identifying the need for an effective global financial system as a critical condition for achieving SDG 7 targets. A well-functioning global financial system ensures the seamless flow of capital across borders, which is essential for fostering technological transfer and attracting foreign investments [56 ,57 ]. By strategically leveraging foreign investments and integrating cutting-edge technologies, OECD and European countries can transform their energy systems and make progress toward achieving SDG 7.   5 Implications for policy This research offers three key implications for policymakers, particularly in the context of OECD and European countries striving to achieve SDG 7 targets. First, the findings from the configurational analysis underscore the need for policymakers to prioritize the most effective economic policies by identifying key policy levers. The study reveals that certain economic policies may have a more significant impact on achieving SDG 7 targets than traditionally acknowledged. This contrasts with the current practice in many OECD and European countries, where policies such as environmental tax measures are often viewed as indispensable for reaching SDG 7 targets [58 ]. However, the results of this analysis suggest that it is possible to meet SDG 7 objectives even in the absence of highly effective budgetary and tax policies. Consequently, an overemphasis on these policies may divert attention and resources from other critical areas. This research provides a framework for policymakers to identify the minimally required combinations of policies, enabling more strategic allocation of resources toward policies with the greatest potential for success in the context of SDG 7. Second, this study's findings offer insights not only into identifying necessary policies but also into recognizing complementary and substitutionary policies. For instance, while economic policy coherence and an effective global financial system are highlighted as essential, they alone are not sufficient to guarantee the successful achievement of SDG 7 targets. The analysis reveals that in OECD and European contexts, inclusive labor markets and effective budgetary policies serve as critical complements to these dimensions. This implies that policymakers need to consider the interactions among various economic policies to craft strategies that effectively support sustainable development goals. The research thus provides a nuanced understanding of how different policy dimensions can work together to achieve SDG 7 targets. Third, the study has significant implications for the diffusion of innovations in policymaking within OECD and European countries. It is well recognized that many innovations in national policymaking are often inspired by practices and ideas originating from outside the country. Furthermore, international incentives play a crucial role in shaping national policy agendas [59 ]. This research is pioneering in its empirical examination of the relationship between the economic policies of OECD and European countries and their performance in achieving equitable access to affordable and clean energy. Policymakers can leverage these findings to benchmark their countries' policies against those that have successfully implemented best practices in achieving SDG 7 targets. This comparison can stimulate innovation in domestic policymaking, enhancing the capacity of OECD and European countries to meet their sustainable development goals effectively.  6 Conclusion This paper emphasizes the critical role of economic policies in achieving SDG 7 targets of access to affordable and clean energy by 2030. Through a configurational analysis using fsQCA, it departs from conventional correlation-based methods that are symmetric by design. Accordingly, it utilizes empirical evidence from 41 OECD and European countries to investigate how various combinations of economic policies in these nations contribute to the attainment of SDG 7 targets. The findings of configurational analysis accentuate the necessity of policy coherence, which can be accomplished by fostering collaboration and coordination among government bodies. Additionally, nurturing an inclusive labor market emerges as a crucial factor in accelerating progress toward SDG 7 goals by promoting prosperity and innovation. Furthermore, the study highlights the significance of an effective global financial system in facilitating energy investments, thus supporting countries in attaining SDG 7 targets. Policy implications drawn from this research underscores the need for policymakers to identify key policy levers, and recognize necessary, complementary, and substitutionary policies. By pinpointing the minimally required combinations of policies, policymakers can allocate resources more effectively toward policies with the greatest potential for success. Moreover, this highlights the importance of learning from best practices in achieving SDG 7 targets. Specifically, policymakers are encouraged to benchmark their countries against those with best practices to foster innovation in policymaking, thereby accelerating progress toward achieving SDG 7 targets. This paper contributes to energy policy research by providing a deeper understanding of how different economic policies synergistically affect the achievement of SDG 7 targets. By offering practical insights and policy implications, this research can guide policymakers in formulating effective strategies for advancing sustainable development and ensuring universal access to affordable and clean energy for all. However, there are some limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, this paper exclusively focuses on economic policies, which, while important, are insufficient on their own for achieving affordable and clean energy solutions. For instance, rising poverty can significantly undermine the effectiveness of economic policies, as highlighted by Sinha et al. [60 ]. This underscores the need for policymakers to not only develop but also for governments to enforce policies that address social imbalances. Future research could extend the proposed configurational approach to explore how social dimensions, such as inequality and access to education, shape energy-related policies and outcomes. Second, this study concentrates on OECD and European countries, which ensures a reliable representation of governmental efforts to meet SDG 7 targets. These countries have binding commitments under the OECD and European Union frameworks that require them to enhance their legal, regulatory, and institutional structures. However, future research could explore whether the findings of this study hold in developing countries, where legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks may be less developed. Such an investigation would offer valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities for achieving SDG 7 in different global contexts. Finally, this research emphasizes the relationship between higher-level policy indicators and the achievement of SDG 7 targets. These higher-level indicators aggregate a broad range of policy measures and contextual factors, offering a comprehensive view of policy effectiveness. However, future studies could investigate how lower-level policy indicators—such as quality of financial infrastructure, redistribution effect of tax policies, or budget consolidation—interact to influence higher-level outcomes. Understanding these synergies could provide deeper insights into how targeted policy measures can be better integrated to create broader systemic effects, ultimately optimizing efforts to achieve SDG 7 targets.
