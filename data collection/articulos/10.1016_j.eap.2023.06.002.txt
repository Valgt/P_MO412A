                  In the light of China’s synergistic need to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 10 and 13, it is necessary to consider the potential nexus between common prosperity and carbon reduction. Therefore, this work proposes a new comprehensive measure to assess the degree of common prosperity in 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2019. Furthermore, we examine the impact of common prosperity on carbon emissions applying the system-generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) approach. All major conclusions are as follows: (1) the level of common prosperity has continued to increase between 2006 and 2019; (2) common prosperity and carbon reduction are compatible with each other, i.e., common prosperity significantly reduces carbon emissions; (3) common prosperity reduces carbon emissions indirectly by improving labor productivity and upgrading industrial structure; (4) carbon emissions are indirectly increased by common prosperity through the expansion of gross fixed capital formation and higher levels of urbanization, and (5) in provinces with higher levels of common prosperity and lower levels of carbon emissions, common prosperity has a considerably greater influence on carbon emissions. Finally, we suggest several policy implications for promoting China’s sustainable development.

In the light of China’s synergistic need to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 10 and 13, it is necessary to consider the potential nexus between common prosperity and carbon reduction. Therefore, this work proposes a new comprehensive measure to assess the degree of common prosperity in 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2019. Furthermore, we examine the impact of common prosperity on carbon emissions applying the system-generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) approach. All major conclusions are as follows: (1) the level of common prosperity has continued to increase between 2006 and 2019; (2) common prosperity and carbon reduction are compatible with each other, i.e., common prosperity significantly reduces carbon emissions; (3) common prosperity reduces carbon emissions indirectly by improving labor productivity and upgrading industrial structure; (4) carbon emissions are indirectly increased by common prosperity through the expansion of gross fixed capital formation and higher levels of urbanization, and (5) in provinces with higher levels of common prosperity and lower levels of carbon emissions, common prosperity has a considerably greater influence on carbon emissions. Finally, we suggest several policy implications for promoting China’s sustainable development.

China’s per capita GDP exceeds US$12,000 in 2021, which is close to the World Bank’s threshold for high-income countries (Cai, 2021 ). Nevertheless, despite the economy’s rapid expansion, there are many problems related to unbalanced development, leading to a widening gap between economic and social development. As the world’s most populous country, China has long embraced the concept of sustainable development, and has carefully considered who the development is for, who is responsible for such development, and who enjoys the fruits of this development (Blaxland et al., 2014 ). Indeed, China has been committed to sustainable development for many years, recognizing that economic growth cannot come at the expense of social justice. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 requires countries to reduce social and economic inequalities and enhance inclusivity. China is also committed to above actions. For example, the government invests heavily in education and healthcare, and implements poverty alleviation programs to improve the welfare of its citizens (Hussain and Lee, 2022; Wang et al., 2022c; Xu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2019 ). In 2020, China won the battle against poverty and successfully realized its goal of creating an all-around moderately prosperous society (Xi, 2017 ). In the next development process, finding ways to share the fruits of development with the people and achieve a more equitable distribution of income and wealth becomes an urgent problem to solve. Therefore, the Chinese government proposes common prosperity for all people as one of its goals for 2035 (Zakić, 2021 ). Common prosperity is an important characteristic of China’s modernization. It means that all people in society share in the country’s economic and social development, and enjoy both material and spiritual wealth. Common prosperity is not just about the prosperity of a few, nor is it about uniformity or egalitarianism. It aims for the prosperity of all people, where everyone can enjoy a good quality of life, both materially and spiritually (Xi, 2017 ). Common prosperity embraces the important goal of improving residents’ income level, which requires the creation of more material wealth and sustained economic growth (Zesen Qian et al., 2021 ). More material output is required to accomplish this target, and this output may increase carbon emissions and energy use (Tong et al., 2020 ). The SDG 13 also requires that to address climate change, the entire human race must work together to reduce carbon emissions. However, while achieving the goal of common prosperity requires the growth of residents’ income, it also emphasizes the efficiency and equity of development, and seeks to narrow the income gap and achieve sustainability of development, which may promote carbon reduction (You et al., 2020 ). This raises the question of whether common prosperity and carbon reduction are mutually compatible. In other words, can we achieve the goal of reducing carbon emissions while achieving common prosperity? Can common prosperity significantly reduce carbon emissions? The purpose of this research is to answer the aforementioned issues and attempt to provide some helpful references for the achievement of common prosperity and carbon reduction. Despite the importance of this topic, few studies investigate how common prosperity affects carbon emissions. Numerous studies are conducted on how income growth, geographical inequality, and income disparity affect carbon emissions (Saidi and Hammami, 2015; Shao et al., 2019; Wu and Xie, 2020 ), and some scholars explore the impact of poverty on carbon emissions (Baloch et al., 2020 ). But few studies focus specifically on how common prosperity affects carbon emissions. In more detail, the mechanisms of common prosperity on carbon emissions are not garnered enough scholarly attention. Furthermore, the rich connotation of common prosperity makes it difficult to assess it accurately and effectively, leading to fewer empirical articles. In addition, China’s provincial carbon emissions possess substantial spatial heterogeneity, as shown in Fig. 1 . Therefore, the heterogeneity of common prosperity on carbon emissions deserves further study. This study quantitatively assesses the degree of common prosperity in 30 Chinese provinces from 2006–2019 by advancing a new comprehensive evaluation index, and uses the SYS-GMM technique to evaluate the influence of common prosperity on carbon emissions under the common requirements of SDG 10 and SDG 13. Moreover, this study covers the disparities between different locations and the distinct impact methodology of common prosperity on carbon emissions. Accordingly, Fig. 2  presents the corresponding research framework.   This paper makes significant contributions in four main areas. First, it offers a comprehensive assessment approach for a comprehensive index of common prosperity, by carefully examining the three components of common prosperity—development, shareability, and sustainability. This approach will be invaluable for assessing the degree of common prosperity in China and guiding the government in promoting it. Second, the relationship between common prosperity and carbon emissions is explored, elucidating how achieving common prosperity can also contribute to reducing carbon emissions. This insight can assist governments in gaining confidence in pursuing both objectives simultaneously, while also contributing to China’s achievement of the SDGs. Third, the paper discusses the impact mechanism of common prosperity on carbon emissions. By doing so, it provides new ideas on how to promote carbon reduction through common prosperity. Finally, the paper formulates appropriate carbon-reduction policies based on heterogeneity analysis, which determines the regional variations in the effect of common prosperity on carbon emissions. This approach is vital in ensuring that policies are tailored to local conditions and effectively address the issue of carbon emissions. Overall, this paper offers valuable insights that can inform policymaking in China and beyond. This essay’s remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2  examines the relevant literature, while Section 3  evaluates the common prosperity comprehensive index. The influence of common prosperity on carbon emissions is advanced in Section 4 , and Section 5  presents the data and model. Section 6  deals with the main results, and Section 7  examines the mechanism and heterogeneity. We present the conclusions and policy implications in Section 8 .  2 Review of the literature 2.1 The introduction of common prosperity In recent years, academics have paid increasing attention to common prosperity because of its crucial role in ensuring a healthy society. Zhang (2013)  decomposes common prosperity into affluence and commonness in terms of income distribution. Another study divides the indicator system of common prosperity into three parts: the first are the basic indicators used to reflect the overall level of China’s development, covering economic, social, and other aspects; the second part are the core indicators used to reflect the existence and elimination of the gap, including income gap, regional gap, and social security; the third part are the auxiliary indicators used to reflect comparisons with the global level, such as the degree of development and people’s feelings (Song, 2014 ). In addition, Yun and Li (2020)  divide common prosperity into material and spiritual dimensions. The material living conditions include income level, living convenience, and quality of life; the state of spiritual life includes social security capacity and science, education, culture, and health services. Some scholars comprehensively measure common prosperity from three aspects: development, shareability, and sustainability (Chen et al., 2021 ). Specifically, common prosperity has the developmental characteristics of increasing overall social wealth and people’s income. Common prosperity first emphasizes prosperity and narrowing the gap, which means that the total welfare and well-being of the whole society should be continuously improved at a high level of development. This is the material foundation and prerequisite requirement of common prosperity. Second, common prosperity has the sharing characteristic of enabling the fruits of reform and development to benefit all people more fairly. Common prosperity is situated between egalitarianism and polarization, ensuring that different groups have equal rights to access wealth and quality public services. Finally, common prosperity has the sustainability of coordinated development, long-term interests, and ethnic reproduction. Common prosperity is a dynamic concept that is a continuous process of good governance that changes with society. Development must be coordinated with the carrying capacity of the population, resources, and environment and must be adapted to social progress. Intergenerational fairness must also be considered in the time dimension. In general, several existing evaluation studies on common prosperity place different emphases on evaluation contents, and have not yet formed a comprehensive common prosperity evaluation index system with Chinese characteristics.  2.2 The common prosperity-carbon emissions nexus With the escalation of climate change and the growing focus on sustainable development, scholars shift their focus to carbon emissions (Kuhn, 2018; Lee et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022 ). They examine the impact of sustainable development on reducing carbon emissions by investigating factors such as various policy measures, technological innovation, and behavioral changes (Fan et al., 2013; Gu, 2022; Zhang and Wang, 2017 ). More specifically, some scholars investigate the promotion of renewable energy, the advancement of energy-efficient and emission-reducing technologies, the adoption of carbon taxes, and shifts in social ideology and values to assess the effects of sustainable development on carbon reduction (Fang, 2023; MaduraiElavarasan et al., 2022 ). As for common prosperity, it not only emphasizes the importance of increasing residents’ income level, but also seeks ways to narrow the income gap. Therefore, we isolate the effects on income level and income disparity on carbon emissions. Many scholars emphasize the income level-carbon emissions nexus, but their conclusions are inconsistent (Acheampong, 2018; Bakhsh et al., 2017 ). For example, Hashmi and Alam (2019)  show that income level growth significantly promotes carbon emissions in OECD. In contrast, some studies demonstrate an inverse U-shaped relationship between wealth and carbon emissions (Awaworyi Churchill et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2021 ). Moreover, many studies explore the connection between income disparity and carbon emissions, and reach mixed conclusions. On the one hand, many scholars believe income disparity aggravates carbon emissions. Knight et al. (2017)  use panel data from 26 developed nations to demonstrate the benefits of a more equitable and sensible income distribution for lowering carbon emissions. Using data from a large sample of 174 countries, Ridzuan (2019)  finds that the delay in the environmental Kuznets curve inflection point caused by income disparity increases the likelihood that larger carbon emissions might arise from increasing income inequality. However, some academics believe the extent to which income disparity affects carbon emissions depends on income levels. To be specific, in contrast to affluent countries, where income disparity has little impact on carbon emissions, developing countries benefit from lower per capita carbon emissions when income inequality is more widespread (Chen et al., 2020 ). Although the influences of income level and income disparity on carbon emissions are thoroughly researched, the effects of common prosperity on carbon emissions received little attention.  2.3 Literature gaps The literature review highlights several limitations in the current research on the topic of common prosperity and its relationship with carbon emissions. One major issue is the lack of a widely accepted method for measuring common prosperity, and there are few studies that examine its geographical distribution and trends over time. Given China’s development objectives in the coming decades, it is essential that more attention is paid to the impact of common prosperity on carbon emissions. Furthermore, the specific mechanisms through which common prosperity affects carbon emissions are not well understood, and this knowledge gap must be addressed to inform effective policy development. Overall, there is a need for further research in this area to inform policy decisions and promote sustainable development in China and beyond.   3 Assessing common prosperity in China 3.1 The concept of common prosperity Based on the discussion on common prosperity in Section 2.1  and referring to Chen et al. (2021) , this paper contends that common prosperity has three characteristics: development, shareability, and sustainability. 3.1.1 Development index Common prosperity is characterized by the growth of overall social wealth and people’s income. The development index prioritizes affluence and reduces disparities, i.e., ensuring sustained economic growth while achieving increased well-being for society as a whole. Therefore, to achieve common prosperity, China should first aim to improve residents’ income, consolidate, and grow total economic volume, and focus on narrowing the gap between regions and reducing inequality.  3.1.2 Shareability index As for the shareability index, common prosperity implies sharing the fruits of development fairly so all people benefit in an equitable manner. Common prosperity lies between egalitarianism and polarization, and is designed to ensure that different groups have an equitable right to wealth and quality public services. The realization of common prosperity requires the design of a set of basic public service systems, including employment, education, social security, health services, living services, and environmental protection to ensure equal opportunities for all in the construction of the social system.  3.1.3 Sustainability index Common prosperity has the sustainability of coordinated economic, social, and ecological development. It is a dynamic concept that requires development to be in harmony with resources and the environment, to accommodate social progress, and to consider inter-generational equity in the time dimension. At the same time, it cannot be achieved only by constantly increasing the burden of personal taxes, introducing too many social policies, and making too much commitment to social security. Common prosperity necessitates the realization of a social environment system and a natural environment system, as well as balanced development between production systems and reproduction systems, which encompass high-quality economic development, high-level governance, and environmental sustainability.   3.2 Measure procedures for a common prosperity index To comprehensively measure common prosperity’s effects on carbon emissions, a quantitative assessment of common prosperity is necessary. Referring to Chen et al. (2021)  and the definition in Section 3.1 , we quantify common prosperity into three sub-indicators: development, shareability, and sustainability. The development index includes three secondary indicators: affluence, group commonality, and regional commonality. The affluence index is a basic requirement for the attainment of common prosperity. The group commonality index measures the disparity between wealth and poverty among populations and generations, and is expressed by the Gini coefficient. Regional commonality is measured by the regional coefficient of variation in per capita GDP development and the coefficient of regional per capita disposable income of variation to measure the wealth gaps between regions. There are six secondary indicators under the shareability index: education, healthcare, social security, public infrastructure, digital applications, and public culture. Education includes three tertiary indicators, which are used to reflect the country’s average level of education as well as the distribution of education resources. Medical health is used to reflect the overall level of health of members of society. Social security refers to the level and popularity of medical and pension insurance. Public infrastructure is employed to evaluate the degree of public infrastructure construction. Digital application is employed to evaluate the progress of information technology. Public culture is used to reflect the level of public cultural services as well as the spiritual affluence of the public. The sustainability index includes three secondary indicators: high-quality development, finance, and ecology. The subject of China’s economic and social development, as measured by total factor productivity, is high-quality development. Fiscal provides a guarantee for high-quality development to build common prosperity. To guarantee the sustainability of fiscal expenditure, it is necessary to have stable fiscal revenue and a stable fiscal structure. Ecology reflects the extent to which the development process protects the environment. Table 1  shows the specific indicators. In conclusion, as shown in Table 1 , the comprehensive evaluation index of common prosperity is made up of three categories and 44 indicators. The complete common prosperity index is evaluated in this research using the improved entropy method (IEM) in accordance with the features in Table 1 .    3.3 Analysis of common prosperity in China This study creates a time-trend chart after computing the comprehensive common prosperity index (see Fig. 3 ). In addition, to distinguish the three sub-indicator types of common prosperity (i.e., development, shareability, and sustainability), we also evaluate the indicators of these three sub-indicators.  The common prosperity index demonstrates a substantial upward trend from 2006 to 2019, as seen in this graph, indicating that common prosperity is continuously improving. Regarding the three secondary indicators, the development index experiences a relatively stable trend in the first few years, then increases at a faster rate. The reason for this phenomenon may be the 2008 financial crisis, which slows down economic growth and the increase in residents’ earnings. On the other hand, depending on the improvement of balance, coordination, and sustainability of growth, China proposes in 2012 to double GDP and the per capita income of populations by 2020 compared to 2010. Furthermore, the trend of the shareability index and sustainability index are similar to that of the common prosperity comprehensive index, which increases between 2006 and 2019. This outcome is in line with China’s development ideology, which emphasizes innovation, collaboration, conservation, openness, and sharing. To further explore the spatial distribution of common prosperity, this research plots the distribution of common prosperity in 2006, 2010, 2015, and 2019, as shown in Fig. 4 . Common prosperity clearly shows an upward trend in the above figure. In addition, prosperous areas, such Beijing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, are situated mostly along the east coast. On the other hand, in the central and western areas, such Shanxi, Henan, and Yunnan, the level of common prosperity is quite low because of their relatively low economic development levels and low per capita disposable income. Although the central and western areas have experienced rapid economic growth in recent years, the related supporting facilities, such as public infrastructure, medical care, education, and other safeguards, have not yet adapted to this development, which results in some inequality problems.     4 Theoretical mechanisms and hypotheses 4.1 The overall impact of common prosperity on carbon emissions The promotion of common prosperity can have significant impacts on the environment, leading to the development of a green economy and contributing to the improvement of the ecological environment (Hao et al., 2021 ). On one hand, the promotion of common prosperity can lead to the development of a green economy, which can reduce carbon emissions. This is because common prosperity can encourage economic transformation towards a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable model. This shift can reduce the carbon emissions pressure caused by reliance on high-carbon economic activities, while promoting the adoption of low-carbon technologies and clean energy (Hepburn et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, common prosperity can also contribute to the improvement of the ecological environment, thereby reducing carbon emissions. Achieving common prosperity can enhance efforts in environmental pollution control and ecological environment protection. This can help maintain the stability and safety of the ecosystem, thereby reducing the negative impact of human activities on the environment (Wang et al., 2021 ). Overall, the promotion of common prosperity can lead to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly society, reducing carbon emissions and promoting ecological protection. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1 Common prosperity has a detrimental effect on carbon dioxide emissions.    4.2 The mediating mechanism of gross fixed capital formation The promotion of common prosperity may lead to an increase in fixed capital, which could potentially result in an increase in total carbon emissions (Lin and Xu, 2018 ). This is because common prosperity initiatives typically involve rapid economic development and acceleration of the industrialization process, requiring significant investment in infrastructure, real estate, transportation, and other areas. The construction and operation of these fixed assets require substantial energy consumption, which in turn leads to a rise in carbon emissions (Shuai et al., 2018 ). For example, urbanization often involves the construction of large numbers of buildings and infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and subways, all of which require significant energy consumption and result in increased carbon emissions. Similarly, the manufacturing and transportation industries, which also require substantial fixed capital investment, including machinery, equipment, vehicles, and ships, also contribute significantly to carbon emissions (Wei and Chen, 2020 ). Consequently, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2 Common prosperity indirectly increases carbon emissions through promoting gross fixed capital formation.    4.3 The mediating mechanism of labor productivity Common prosperity aims to achieve equity in wealth and economic opportunity in society, which can positively impact labor productivity. It encourages more people to participate in economic activities, including employment and entrepreneurship, motivating individuals to learn and improve their skills to take advantage of opportunities. Moreover, common prosperity promotes technological innovation and R&D investment, improving production efficiency and quality (Raziq and Maulabakhsh, 2015 ). With better education and training opportunities, employees can improve their skills and abilities, contributing to improved labor productivity (Tzenios, 2019 ). Overall, common prosperity can create a more productive workforce with greater access to economic opportunities, education, and technological advancements. Improving labor productivity can promote carbon emissions reduction by reducing energy and material waste and lowering carbon intensity through the adoption of energy-saving and emission-reducing technologies in the production process (Li et al., 2020 ). Additionally, improving labor productivity encourages enterprises to continue technological innovation and improve production methods, promoting the development of a low-carbon economy. The adoption of low-carbon production methods and the promotion of clean technologies can contribute positively to carbon emissions reduction while achieving sustainable economic and social development. The same findings have also been verified in the Chinese textile and construction industries (Lin et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2020 ). The corresponding hypothesis is: Hypothesis 3 Common prosperity indirectly reduces carbon emisssions through improving labor productivity.    4.4 The mediating mechanism of industrial structure upgrading The promotion of common prosperity can facilitate the upgrading of industrial structure by enhancing people’s economic power and diversifying market demand. This will urge enterprises to pay more attention to innovation and research and development to meet the diverse needs of consumers, thereby driving industries towards high-end, personalized, and quality-oriented directions. In addition, common prosperity can also promote investment in technological innovation and research and development, as well as education and training, providing more talent and intellectual support for industrial upgrading. Therefore, common prosperity can promote economic transformation and sustainable development. Many academics confirm that improving industrial structures can minimize carbon emissions (Li et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2022 ). Due to their minimal energy use and emissions, knowledge-based and technology-based industries may contribute to reducing emissions and preserving energy in contrast with conventional resource- and energy-intensive industries (Yu et al., 2018 ). Moreover, upgrading the industrial structure would stimulate resource allocation that is as efficient as possible and make the distribution of production factors more reasonable. To be specific, this process of upgrading the industrial structure, labor, capital, and other factors in sectors with higher production capacity boosts the economy’s overall factor productivity, decreases energy consumption, and reduces carbon emissions. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 4 Common prosperity indirectly reduces carbon emissions through industrial structure upgrading.    4.5 The mediating mechanism of urbanization Common prosperity can promote the increase of urbanization rate. It can improve people’s education, training, and employment opportunities, promote the construction of urban infrastructure and public services, and enhance the quality of urban life. These factors, along with people’s desire for better living and development opportunities, are expected to drive the increase in urbanization rate. Many academics explore the effects of urbanization on carbon emissions at various scales. From an international perspective, Wang et al. (2016b)  explore the extent to which urbanization affected carbon emissions in the BRICS countries between 1985 and 2014. The conclusions suggest urbanization may cause carbon emissions to rise. The same conclusion applies to Africa and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Hussain et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2016a ). Zhang et al. (2015)  take Beijing as a research object, using the ARDL method to test carbon emissions as a result of urbanization. According to the research, both the short- and long-term effects of urbanization on carbon emissions are positive. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 5 Common prosperity indirectly increases carbon emissions through urbanization.     5 The model of estimation & information 5.1 The model of estimation Because traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression might lead to inaccurate outcomes, delayed variables and random error components may interact (Aisen and Veiga, 2013 ). It is generally believed that the dependent variable (carbon emissions) has a significant time lag effect. In other words, carbon emissions in the previous time period will significantly affect the current carbon emissions. From a theoretical perspective, the time lag effect of carbon emissions can be explained as a lag in market mechanisms’ reaction. That is to say, reducing carbon emissions requires some time to respond to policy, market, or technological changes, which leads to the time lag effect of carbon emissions. Therefore, SYS-GMM technique is used to measure the impact of common prosperity on carbon emissions. To test Hypothesis 1  and to objectively investigate the relationship between carbon emissions and common prosperity, we develop the following estimation equation: (1) l n c e  i , t   = α  0   + α  1   l n c e  i , t − 1   + α  2   l n c p  i , t   + ∑  k = 3  6   α  k   l n X  i , t   + ɛ  i , t        To exclude potential heteroskedasticity, we log all the variables and add the carbon emissions lag term to the independent variable (l n c e  i , t − 1     ), taking into account the effect of past carbon emissions (Wang et al., 2022b ). In the equation, i  represents province, t  represents year, the dependent variable is lnce , which represents carbon emissions, and lncp  represents the independent factor as well as the common prosperity index. X  represents a vector containing a set of controlling factors, namely economic expansion (lngdp ), energy consumption (lnenergy ), electricity generation (lnele ), and foreign direct investment (lnfdi ). α  0     stands for the intercept term, α  1   , … , α  6      represent the estimated coefficients, and ɛ  i t     is the random error term.  5.2 Model of the mediating effect To test Hypotheses 2–5 , which explore the extent to which common prosperity affects carbon emissions, we construct the following models: (2) l n M  i , t   = β  0   + β  1   l n M  i , t − 1   + β  2   l n c p  i , t   + ∑  k = 3  6   β  k   l n X  i , t   + ɛ  i , t      (3) l n c e  i , t   = δ  0   + δ  1   l n c e  i , t − 1   + δ  2   l n c p  i , t   + δ  3   l n M  i , t   + ∑  k = 4  7   δ  k   l n X  i , t   + ɛ  i , t         where lnM  represents the mediating variable, which is indicated by gross fixed capital formation (lngfcf ), labor productivity (lnlabor ), industrial structure upgrading (lnind ), and urbanization (lnurb ), respectively. If the coefficients β  1     and δ  3     are significant, lnM  acts as a mediator in the relationship between common prosperity-carbon emissions.  5.3 Multiple settings and information sources lnce  (i.e., carbon emissions) is the dependent variable. The information on carbon emissions comes from Carbon Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADS, 2022 ). The common prosperity comprehensive index is the independent variable, and is computed using the approach described in Section 3.2 . The sub-indices are derived from the China Statistical Yearbook (CSY, 2020 ). Economic expansion and carbon emissions are closely related to the control factors (Cutlip and Fath, 2011; Wang and Jiang, 2019 ). In this research, economic expansion is represented by gross domestic product (Khan et al., 2021 ). Carbon emissions is also affected by the consumption of energy (Acaravci and Ozturk, 2010; Lee et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2020 ). Foreign direct investment, which is calculated as the sum of all investments made in foreign-owned businesses, is also a significant driver in determining carbon emissions (Abid et al., 2022 ). Electricity production is also an important factor affecting carbon emissions. Power supply in China is a production system dominated by coal power which generates excessive carbon emissions. Four mediating variables are selected, namely lngfcf , lnlabor , lnind , and lnurb . lngfcf  is total fixed capital formation of the whole society. lnlabor  is the ratio of GDP to the average annual number of employees. lnind  is expressed by the proportion of tertiary industry’s contributed value to secondary industry. The ratio of the urban population to the overall population can be described as lnurb.  The statistics come from the China Statistical Yearbook (CSY, 2020 ). Table 2  provides thorough explanations and descriptive data for each of the selected variables.     6 Methods of estimation and empirical findings 6.1 Benchmark regression We must consider the Arellano–Bond (A–B) and Hansen’s tests before delving into the findings of the dynamic panel estimate. When both AR (1) and AR (2) are more than 0.1, the estimated outcomes pass the autocorrelation test. Additionally, if the p  -value in Hansen’s test is larger than 0.1 it demonstrates that the IV is valid for this study.  Table 3  displays the effect of common prosperity and its sub-indicators on carbon emissions. The common prosperity indicator is noticeably negative, i.e., common prosperity significantly reduces carbon emissions. Specifically, a 1% improvement in the common prosperity comprehensive indicator would lead to a 0.071% decrease in carbon emissions. The conclusion is in line with Golley and Meng (2012)  and Hao et al. (2016) . The sub-indicators of common prosperity also show significantly negative correlations with carbon emissions to varying degrees. Common prosperity continuously narrows regional disparities in development by increasing public infrastructure and popularizing digital applications, thus reducing carbon emissions (Hao and Cho, 2021 ). In addition, the government pays increasing attention to environmental protection, provides sufficient financial support for research, restructures the energy system, increases the effective use of energy, and significantly reduces carbon emissions (Xiaoman et al., 2021 ). The aforementioned findings also attest to China’s efforts towards achieving SDGs, whereby the attainment of common prosperity and the promotion of carbon emission reduction would be conducive to the advancement of China’s current and future sustainable development objectives, as well as the establishment of a green society. This is also in line with China’s promotion of ecological civilization construction, which emphasizes strengthening ecological environment construction while creating material wealth and achieving common prosperity, thereby realizing green development. Regarding the control variables, the lngdp  coefficient is negative. China experiences a shift from crude growth, which focuses on quantitative growth and development speed, to intensive growth, which relies on the improved quality and efficiency of production factors. This adjustment in growth is beneficial for reducing carbon emissions and is in line with China’s carbon peak and carbon-neutral aims (Zheng et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, at the 1% threshold of significance, the energy coefficient is positive, demonstrating that energy usage can increase carbon emissions (Waheed et al., 2019 ). The effect of FDI on carbon emissions is favorable because it boosts energy-intensive businesses with finance and technology while degrading the environment (Liu et al., 2021 ). Moreover, increased electricity production can significantly boost carbon emissions. China’s coal-based power system uses a lot of fossil fuels, which increases carbon emissions (Ang et al., 2011 ).  6.2 Robustness results 6.2.1 Alternative estimation technique To evaluate the robustness of the benchmark results, this paper uses the instrumental variables generalized method of moments model (IV-GMM) as an alternative estimation method (Wang et al., 2022a ). The IV-GMM findings are in line with the benchmark results, as shown in Column (1) of Table 4 . The instruments are not under-identified, as shown by the p-values of the Kleibergen–Paap rk Lagrange Multiplier statistic for the estimated outcomes being less than 0.1 (Kleibergen and Paap, 2006 ). The Kleibergen–Paap rk Wald F-statistics, which are more than 10% Stock–Yogo weak ID test critical values (19.93) indicate that the instruments are not underpowered. The Hansen J statistics’ p-values are also higher than 0.1, indicating that none of the IV variables are over-identified (Lee and Moumbark, 2022 ). The foregoing experiments show that the IV-GMM outcomes are reliable. Additionally, the coefficient of common prosperity comprehensive index is noticeably negative. The aforementioned findings show that the benchmark regression is reliable.    6.2.2 Replacing the independent variable This work further conducts a robustness test by introducing another alternative common prosperity indicator. The alternative indicator is calculated by using the Theil coefficient (Zhao et al., 2020 ). The Theil index is calculated as follows: (4) Theil  i t   = ∑ I  i j t    I  i t       ln I  i j t    I  i t        p  i j t    p  i t               where i  indicates province, t  stands for the year, j  is employed to differentiate between urban and rural areas, with j = 1    indicating urban and j = 2    indicating rural areas. I  and P  indicate total income and population, respectively. Typically, the Theil index is used to gauge the degree of social and economic inequality, while common prosperity pursues the equal and fair development of residents, so there is an opposite relationship between the two indicators. It also implies that the higher the Theil index, the lower the amount of common prosperity and the greater the inequality. The estimated outcomes in column (2) of Table 4  show that the Theil index has a favorable impact on carbon dioxide emission, and its benchmark outcomes are robust.  6.2.3 Replace the dependent variable We also substitute the dependent variable with sulfur emissions. Because sulfur dioxide also represents an important level of environmental pollution, it can, to some extent, replace carbon dioxide in confirming the effect of environmental management (Liu et al., 2018 ). Column (3) of Table 4  demonstrates that the benchmark findings and the correlation between common prosperity and sulfur dioxide emissions are identical, and that common prosperity greatly reduces sulfur dioxide emissions.  6.2.4 Remove the special samples Significant differences between local governments directly controlled by the central government (including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) and ordinary provinces in terms of administrative status, economic development, and residents’ living standards. In this regard, Examples of municipalities that are within the purview of the national government are excluded from regression testing, and only the samples of ordinary provinces are retained for regression testing (Wang et al., 2022a ). Column (4) reveals that the common prosperity comprehensive index coefficient is negative at the 5% significant level, indicating that common prosperity has a limiting effect on carbon dioxide emissions, while the benchmark result remains consistent.  6.2.5 Endogeneity analysis To address the potential issue of reverse causality between common prosperity and carbon emissions reduction, we employ the instrumental variable method. Specifically, we use the Lewbel two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation technique, as proposed by Lewbel (2012) , to further examine the robustness of our benchmark results. The findings, presented in Column (5) of Table 4 , demonstrate that the coefficient of lncp  remains significantly negative, thereby supporting the robustness of our initial results.    7 Further discussion 7.1 Mediating effects According to Section 4 , common prosperity affects carbon emissions through four aspects: gross fixed capital formation, labor productivity, industrial structure upgrading, and urbanization. Then, we discuss these four mechanisms separately. 7.1.1 Mediation effect of gross fixed capital formation Columns (1) to (3) of Table 5  show the estimated results of the mediating influence of lngfcf  in the effect of common prosperity on carbon emissions. Column (1) displays the effects of common prosperity on carbon emissions, while column (2) indicates the influence of common prosperity on lngfcf . The conclusions show that common prosperity effectively increases the level of lngfcf . The vision of common prosperity strongly motivates the government to focus on economic development and build infrastructure to provide public services to more people, a process that results in an increase in gross fixed capital formation (Stupnikova and Sukhadolets, 2019 ). Column (3) shows the influence of gross fixed capital formation on carbon emissions. The findings indicate that gross fixed capital formation significantly increases carbon emissions. The rise in gross fixed capital formation indicates that there are more investment and production activities in society, all of which consume large amounts of fossil energy, thereby contributing to increased carbon emissions (Gao et al., 2020; Lin and Wang, 2021 ). Therefore, Hypothesis 2  is confirmed; that is, gross fixed capital formation serves as a mediator between common prosperity and carbon emissions.  7.1.2 Mediation effect of labor productivity Columns (1), (4), and (5) of Table 5  present the indirect influence of common prosperity on carbon emissions. According to the estimated outcomes in column (4), common prosperity raises worker productivity. More specifically, every 1% rise in the common prosperity comprehensive index results in a 0.442% rise in labor productivity. The shareability of common prosperity includes a focus on education. Common prosperity increases labor productivity by increasing the labor force’s average years of education, enabling workers to master skills and use machines more proficiently. The coefficient of lnlabor  is negative, as seen in column (5), which suggests that labor productivity can significantly reduce carbon emissions. The rise in labor productivity indicates that the production technology level, management level, and technical proficiency of employees also improved, thus promoting energy conservation and environmental protection by reducing carbon emissions (He et al., 2021 ). Many scholars support this conclusion (Isiksal et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2020 ).  7.1.3 Mediation impact of industrial structure upgrading The estimated outcomes of the mediating role of lnind  in the influence of common prosperity on carbon emissions are displayed in columns (1), (6), and (7). Column (6) demonstrates that common prosperity promotes industrial structure upgrading and tertiary industry development. The pursuit of common prosperity necessitates a greater emphasis on the development of high-tech industries, as represented by the digital economy, thus promoting industrial upgrading. Furthermore, column (7) suggests that industrial structure upgrading negatively affects carbon emissions, which accords with several academics’ conclusions (Dong et al., 2020; Han et al., 2021; Zhu, 2022 ). All statistics shown above demonstrate that improving industrial structure can reduce carbon emissions.    7.1.4 Mediation effect of urbanization Column (8) shows the effect of common prosperity on urbanization. Furthermore, column (9) shows that the estimated findings are positive (0.094) at the 1% significance level. The findings indicate that accelerating urbanization can increase carbon emissions, which is in line with the research outcomes of Ding and Li (2017) . The goal of common prosperity is to provide equal public services to the entire population, which leads to a greater flow of rural people to the cities and towns. Furthermore, urbanization brings about a rise in energy consumption and thus increases carbon emissions (Li and Lin, 2015 ). Based on the above research, we conclude that urbanization plays a contributory role in increasing carbon emissions. Moreover, according to all the conclusions in column (1), we can conclude that compared to the reduction impact, the growing effect is weaker. Consequently, the decreasing impact of common prosperity on carbon emissions outweighs the promotion effect, resulting in a reduction effect. Fig. 5  depicts a schematic of the impact mechanism demonstrating the consequences of common prosperity on carbon emissions.     7.2 Heterogeneity analysis The provincial spatial distribution of carbon emissions and common prosperity demonstrates the enormous regional variation in China’s carbon emissions and common prosperity across different provinces. Consequently, to accurately and completely assess the distinctive effects of common prosperity on carbon emissions reduction, the entire sample is split into low common prosperity areas (LOW-CP), high common prosperity areas (HIGH-CP), areas of low emissions of carbon dioxide (LOW-CE) and areas in which there are high emissions of carbon dioxide (HIGH-CE), according to the mean scores of carbon emissions and common prosperity in each province. After the area is divided, we further evaluate the possible impact of common prosperity on carbon emissions in different places. The connected results are shown in Table 6 . The coefficient in the LOW-CP zones is −0.040, while in the HIGH-CP areas, the coefficient is −0.075. Compared with the LOW-CP areas, common prosperity in the HIGH-CP areas has a greater influence on reducing carbon emissions. Urban & rural regional development in the HIGH-CP zones moves to a high degree of economic growth, coordination, and sustainability. These regions are more committed to green, low-carbon cycle development, and their high-tech industries are more established, thus they are more involved in reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, only in LOW-CE areas, common prosperity can significantly reduce carbon emissions. This demonstrates that common prosperity is ineffective in reducing carbon emissions in areas that rely heavily on heavy industry and fossil fuels due to the lagging economic transformation process in these areas.     8 Conclusions and policy implications This paper utilizes the indicator system of China’s common prosperity developed by the IEM to conduct an empirical study on the relationship between common prosperity and carbon emissions. Using a panel dataset from 2006 to 2019 of 30 Chinese provinces, the study finds that China’s common prosperity experiences significant growth over this period and that high common prosperity areas are primarily concentrated in the provinces on the east coast, while most provinces in the center and west exhibit lower levels of common prosperity. The paper further assesses China’s potential for sustainable development by integrating common prosperity (achieving SDG 10) with carbon reduction (achieving SDG 13). The primary finding is that common prosperity and carbon reduction are compatible, with common prosperity having a significant negative effect on carbon emissions. Specifically, the comprehensive index of common prosperity has a negative impact on carbon emissions, with a 1% increase in the common prosperity index leading to a 0.071% reduction in carbon emissions. The three sub-indicators of common prosperity, namely, development, shareability, and sustainability, also demonstrate negative influences on carbon emissions. The robustness of these findings is confirmed by alternative estimation techniques, variable replacements, and sample rejections. According to the mechanism analysis, common prosperity indirectly reduces carbon emissions by gross fixed capital formation, labor productivity, industrial structure upgrading, and urbanization. Specifically, common prosperity reduces carbon emissions by promoting labor productivity as well as upgrading the industrial structure while raising emissions of carbon dioxide by encouraging the creation of gross fixed capital as well as urbanization. In addition, the impact of common prosperity on carbon emission is significant according to the analysis of the heterogeneity of numerous Chinese areas. Overall, the study highlights the potential for common prosperity to facilitate a reduction in carbon emissions and offers valuable insights into the development of policies aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth in China. Common prosperity is one of the essential requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics and an important policy objective that the country has been pursuing for a long time. When considering the relationship between common prosperity and carbon emissions, we should adhere to the concept of green and low-carbon development, actively promote the development of the green economy, and promote resource conservation and environmental protection. First, the government can establish more stringent environmental protection laws and regulations, strengthen supervision and law enforcement of enterprises, crack down on environmental violations, protect the ecological environment, and promote the development of a low-carbon economy. At the same time, the government can encourage and support enterprises to increase their research and development and application of environmental protection technology, improve energy utilization efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and promote sustainable economic development. Second, the government can develop more active energy policies, promote clean energy, and achieve the transformation and upgrading of the energy structure. The government can use various means such as finance and taxation to encourage enterprises to invest in the field of clean energy, support the development of the clean energy industry, and increase the proportion of clean energy in the whole society. Finally, the government can actively carry out publicity and education, enhance public awareness of environmental protection and low-carbon, and encourage the public to adopt more environmentally friendly and low-carbon lifestyles. The Chinese government also needs to strengthen the construction of ecological civilization, adhere to the proposition that “green mountains and clear waters are as valuable as gold and silver”, and strengthen policy implementation and measures to serve China’s sustainable development goals. Second, the mediating role of labor productivity between common prosperity and carbon emissions can improve the current situation of carbon emissions. On the one hand, governmental institutions need to focus on the accumulation of human capital. By consolidating guarantees for investment in education, the government can expand educational access and increase the labor force’s average years of schooling. On the other hand, the government needs to speed up the advancement of a contemporary vocational education system, strengthen the combination of industry and education, and train more high-quality technical and skilled individuals. Furthermore, the government should enhance urbanization development, facilitate the construction of emerging industries, expand employment opportunities, achieve economic vibrancy, promote income equality, and facilitate sustainable construction for green development. Third, minimizing carbon emissions can be achieved by upgrading the industrial base. The administration should encourage the growth of high-tech industries, advanced manufacturing industries, the digital economy, and other emerging industries. Specifically, it can introduce relevant industrial policies, provide tax incentives and financial services, and improve infrastructure and the business environment. The government should also speed up the low-carbon restructuring of traditional industries, the gradual restriction of high-pollution growth and high-emission industries, and gradually eliminate backward production capacities, such as the implementation of tiered electricity prices, energy conservation supervision, environmental protection law enforcement, and other restrictive measures. The government aims to ultimately fulfill its role in promoting sustainable development by strengthening the regulatory oversight and collaborative development of local governments, thereby achieving the dual objectives of shared prosperity and climate change mitigation. This research offers compelling proof of the connection between common prosperity and carbon emissions. Nevertheless, our paper has the following drawbacks. One such limitation is that we concentrate specifically on common prosperity in Chinese provinces. Future research should consider the differences between several cities at the prefecture level from the same province. There is still another flaw in the influencing process. We examine the underlying effects of gross fixed capital formation, labor productivity, industrial structure upgrading, and urbanization using the model of the mediation effect; additional influencing elements such as the structure of energy consumption and financial development need further study as well.
