                  <ce:para id="p0025" view="all">The global community has been engaged in sustainable development for decades, even before the official definition of sustainable development, given to us by the now widely circulated Brundtland Definition, “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib51" id="crosref0120">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</ce:cross-ref>) Much of this work has happened behind the scenes, seemingly unrelated to the world of management education. However the latest push, in the form of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a series of 17 goals with 168 related targets that the global community has set to reach by 2030, is different. Unlike its predecessors, including the Millennium Development Goals which expired at the end of 2015, the SDGs were developed through the largest international consultation ever with a range of stakeholders, including governments, NGOs and, importantly, business. There is a growing recognition that sustainability as a global issue needs a global response, hence all groups are, and need to be, engaged in making the goals a reality at the local, national, regional and international level.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0030" view="all">Although governments and NGOs play a key role in advancing the goals, it is the business sector that will be instrumental in the success of the individual targets, through the way they operate, develop new business models, invest in communities, innovate, and collaborate. For companies, successful implementation of the SDGs will strengthen the enabling environment for doing business, minimizing risks while also providing a myriad of new opportunities (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib5" id="crosref0010">Weybrecht, 2015</ce:cross-ref>). As the CEO of Unilever, Paul Polman put it, “There is no business case for enduring poverty. We have the opportunity to unlock trillions of dollars through new markets, investments and innovation. But to do so, we must challenge our current practices and address poverty, inequality and environmental challenges. Every business will benefit from operating in a more equitable, resilient world if we achieve the SDGs.” (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib3" id="crosref0015">Unilever.com, 2017</ce:cross-ref>)</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0035" view="all">The business environment has changed significantly, in particular in the past couple of decades. As Walmart's CEO Lee Scott put it (already more than 10 years ago), “We thought we could sit in Bentonville, take care of customers, take care of associates, and the world would leave us alone. It doesn't work that way any more.” (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib2" id="crosref0020">Grow, 2005</ce:cross-ref>) Perhaps the same can be said of business schools who are still, to a certain degree hiding undisturbed behind closed doors and who, despite being crucial in the implementation of the SDGs, have not yet been as engaged as they could, and need to be.<ce:cross-ref refid="fn1" id="crosref0025">

                     </ce:footnote> When we talk about the SDGs, and sustainability more generally, we don't usually talk about the currently undervalued role, and impact, of business schools in making that vision a reality. Management practices are pervasive. When we change the way employees, managers, CEOs and leaders think and act, this will lead to broader changes across industries around the world (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib4" id="crosref0035">Weybrecht, 2010</ce:cross-ref>). Every year hundreds of thousands of students graduate from business schools internationally, both from degree and non-degree programmes. They then go on to lead and influence virtually every type of organisation, and each and every one of them has the opportunity to impact what our future will, or will not look like.

Considering the number of business schools globally, this impact should not only be significant, but relatively rapid.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0040" view="all">Sustainability provides a unique opportunity for management education, and should be seen as such. The broad nature of the term has been beneficial in so far as it provides an open platform to begin discussions, and schools have been free to explore the topic in a variety of ways. However, this flexibility is perhaps also the reason why sustainability has not yet taken the place it needs to within management education. Many approach sustainability as a broad topic, and fail to dive in deeper in order to explore the complexity of the issues, or the relevance of these issues to their work. Additionally, terms regularly used by management education such as ethics, CSR, responsible management and sustainability are being used to differentiate these issues from core business as usual, rather than recognising them as the glue that ties business together and drives it forward. They are used, wrongly, interchangeably. The sooner we can break down these terms into their individual parts, focus in on these and make them relevant for those concerned, the sooner we can move forward.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0045" view="all">The SDGs present us with a common language around sustainable development, one being used by governments, NGOs, and business. Business schools have a responsibility to translate this important global plan into something that resonates with their community. This can then be used to mobilize support internally, to coordinate curriculum, research and operations on campus. But perhaps more importantly, they can also be used externally as a platform to engage stakeholders, and in particular business in a common set of goals and targets. The opportunity is there for business schools to use these terms to bring people, ideas and research together, not to separate them. But beyond having a positive impact through teaching and research, the SDGs provide another opportunity for business schools who are able and willing to engage; that of being a true driver and enabler of change.</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0055" view="all">Management education, despite being positioned to play a key role in the SDGs and take advantage of these opportunities, is generally speaking not doing so, at least not at the speed that one might have hoped or expected. Progress is being made but is not proving simple because of the underlying culture in and surrounding business schools, how they operate, what they teach, how they teach it, who they teach it to and what is expected of them. It isn't just the global community that doesn't necessarily recognize the important role that management education could play in moving the SDGs forward; perhaps management education itself does not fully recognise its role.</ce:para>

                     <ce:para id="p0065" view="all">There is much to be excited about when it comes to management education's current role in moving sustainability forward. This is in part thanks to a growing number of individual champions pioneering and developing new approaches at their schools, and a rapidly growing number of students not just supporting and starting but demanding sustainability opportunities. Academic institutions vary greatly between themselves, and even within their own institutions in regard to how and to what extent they are incorporating sustainability, making it hard to assess exactly where we stand. The sustainability champions are not necessary whole schools but rather individual programmes, individual courses, faculty, groups of students, particular events and research projects exploring these topics within a school, sometimes with limited support from the rest of their organisation. In many cases, there is actually more happening on campus than the school as a whole, or even the individual employees of that school may realise themselves. Sometimes, a lot less.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0070" view="all">A regular audit of what is happening, what is missing, what is working and what is not, is a crucial step to enable schools to fully engage in these topics and these should be revisited continuously.

                     <ce:para id="p0120" view="all">Once a school understands where they currently stand in terms of the initiatives already happening on campus, the next step is to explore how a school, or the individual initiatives at the school, can become more impactful. Each initiative should aim to integrate the following three points: to embed sustainability throughout in useful and relevant ways, to collaborate with a range of different partners and disciplines, and to contribute to local, national, regional and global efforts in this space.</ce:para>

                        <ce:para id="p0125" view="all">Although an increasing number of students, faculty and staff are interested and engaged in sustainability, not all are, and certainly not all to the same degree. For most it is a choice they make themselves. Interested individuals are self-selecting, and are often found to be driving a lot of the work in this area. They have a growing number of initiatives to tap into as the terms are applied to a range of activities across business schools, some more relevant than others.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0130" view="all">But the reality is that although increasingly students are aware of sustainability issues, most students have limited exposure to sustainability topics during their programmes, and more importantly, how they are applicable and relevant to their chosen specialities and careers. A significant number are being left behind altogether. This is because sustainability topics are often presented in a way that is not connected to the key messages and frameworks covered in the curriculum. Students are also often not given any opportunities to put this knowledge into practice. The result is that they can be seen as separate, not a core part of business; a nice to have, an add on. This in turn sends messages to students to separate themselves and society from their business decisions, and in the worst case, giving them the tools and excuses to disregard these topics in their careers. If it is important to business or the disciplines and cases they are learning about, and projects they are involved in, students would expect sustainability related topics to be included as part of a quality, and relevant, educational programme.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0135" view="all">It is important to embed sustainability topics across all of a schools programmes and initiatives and, in particular, those that influence and impact students throughout their time at the school (see <ce:cross-ref refid="fig2" id="crosref0065">Fig. 2</ce:cross-ref>
                           <ce:float-anchor refid="fig2"/>). Schools send strong signals to students about what is and what is not important to them as graduates in the business world from the minute they first interact with the school. This starts through the recruitment process, the messages communicated online and in person presentations, even the application questions themselves and the kinds of students that are admitted. Students’ interactions on campus can reinforce or cause them to disregard sustainability talk as just that; talk. Even items handed out during events or to speakers at a conference, which may seem unimportant, contribute to that message.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0140" view="all">Sustainability should be embedded into the business side of the business school – its operations and its relationships with internal and external stakeholders. In the same way that a sustainability class or an ethics oath is of little use if the messages aren't reinforced across the curriculum, a discussion about gender equality will have questionable impact if the school itself is not practicing what it is teaching.<ce:cross-ref refid="fn5" id="crosref0070">

                        <ce:para id="p0145" view="all">In order to prepare new generations of business leaders to embed this into their everyday thinking, management education needs to embed sustainability across the curriculum in a way that is useful and relevant to all students. Sustainability cannot be approached in isolation away from the other business decisions they are making in finance, in marketing and in strategy. It needs to be broken down into its individual parts for a more targeted response and put into a context that students can use moving forward.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0150" view="all">Embedding sustainability goes beyond simply presenting definitions and issues of relevance to business. It is also about developing a number of key skills in graduates that will enable them to put these into practice. Graduates increasingly need to have the ability to question assumptions; to understand that the way things have always been done is not necessarily the best way for business or for society to continue, and to explore alternatives. Students should be open minded, culturally aware, willing to listen and learn. They should be able to ask the right questions, deal with complexity, recognise opportunities, explore these, communicate these and take action on these in collaboration with other individuals, teams, companies and a range of stakeholders. These often undervalued ‘soft’ skills and courses are what will allow graduates, and the schools themselves, to have a more meaningful role in the global agenda.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0155" view="all">Business partners need to better communicate how pertinent sustainable business practices are to companies within the business school environment, and be able to identify, seek out and build capacity to recruit students and work with schools that place a value on this. Career services needs to recognise that the way they approach these topics, often by separating ‘social’ related careers out, reinforces the messages that everything related to sustainability is a specialty, and instead shift their approach to one that recognises that these topics are part of all careers.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0160" view="all">Finally schools need to continue to communicate with and engage alumni and other external stakeholders about sustainability topics. As this is a rapidly changing field, alumni can and will provide their schools will a steady stream of opportunities if they themselves are exploring these topics in their post graduate careers, as they have been trained to do. Alumni become business partners, who become recruiters, who become the source of potential new students and the cycle continues.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0165" view="all">The common approach to embedding sustainability is to create new programmes, new centres and new initiatives. However, of equal or even more importance is to integrate it across all existing offerings and processes at the business school in relevant ways. A school can have a sustainability specific strategy, but to be effective it needs to be part of its core strategy. The whole student lifecycle discussed above needs to be thought of with both streams in mind. Without that, one could very well undermine the efforts of the other. It is important that schools take both equally seriously.</ce:para>

                        <ce:para id="p0200" view="all">A business school's staff, students, faculty and management will all need to become more adaptive to working outside of the boundaries of the campus walls. Business schools themselves should represent and support the development of these types of abilities in their students to enable maximum impact on both an individual and collective level. Schools can work internally to facilitate connections within and across departments. They can shift the culture of the school from one of competition to collaboration.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0205" view="all">As previously mentioned, one of the challenges to moving forward is that the wider community, including but not limited to government, NGOs and even business, often fail to recognise the potential impact of management education and the benefits of collaborating with them on sustainability topics. Added to this, differences in operating practices can make these types of collaborations seemingly impossibly complicated. Because of this it is important that business schools create a more enabling environment to engage outside stakeholders, not only by clearly communicating their potential as collaborators but doing so in mutually beneficial ways.</ce:para>

Everything that a business school does, the messages that they send and how they send them all connect to create a culture on campus that communicates clearly to students how they will be expected to act in the business world. By creating a more dynamic, relevant and multidisciplinary programme, this business school of the future will not only become a more effective laboratory for moving the global community forward in sustainability issues, it will hopefully also attract a much wider range of individuals, regardless of their sex, age, background or business experience. Without this diversity within and throughout the programme, schools will be challenged to effectively train the next generation of leaders that we need, or attract the diversity they need to do it.</ce:para>

Management education has the opportunity to be at the forefront of business innovation in this space. For example, what are the challenges that business is dealing with when it comes to moving forward in the current environment? How can business schools tap into these challenges and drive them forward? The answers to these questions are what can drive research, curriculum and partnerships.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0220" view="all">The way classes are taught, who is teaching the classes, the content taught and how those teachers are trained and rewarded needs to shift to become more action and impact focused. Students hear about world and business challenges and problems on a daily basis, and often the focus of these messages in the classroom is negative. But increasingly students want to know what they can do, how they can engage and have a positive impact during their programmes and in their careers, whether they choose to start a social enterprise or work for a bank or consulting firm. How do you take these challenges and transform them into opportunities? It is the role of higher education to not only talk about these issues, but to give students the tools to make this part of their careers, to understand how they can bring their values to work, regardless of what kind of work they choose to do, rather than keeping them separate. We need to create a generation of leaders that not only know how to manoeuvre in the world as it is today, but can see where we need to go and then get us there.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0225" view="all">The impact that schools have is not only through these graduates. All a school's activities should aim to contribute to local, national and global discussions and goals in some way, and ideally even lead them. Business schools can tap into their constantly changing group of interdisciplinary students, faculty experts and outside partners to explore opportunities and devise and implement solutions in the field of sustainability, both internally within their own operations, as well as externally with a number of collaborators. This in turn will provide opportunities for learning, for research and to develop deeper relationships with external stakeholders. It will also allow schools to position management education more generally, and schools more specifically, as action centres for moving business forward on current and future issues. Schools have the opportunity, and the ability to push the boundaries on campus, in their teaching and research, and to enable and encourage students to do the same. The business school will become a test lab for new ideas, at the forefront of environmental and social standards on campus and constantly pushing these forward. It could become not just a model, but an indispensable tool for the business sector and the wider community in making sustainability a reality.</ce:para>
                        <ce:para id="p0230" view="all">The impact that business schools could have is potentially massive. In addition to the number of students graduating with these tools and skills, there are hundreds of thousands of business schools around the world who, along with their students, faculty, alumni, staff and partners, could become a powerful force for bringing about positive change at the local, city, national, regional and international levels. They can, and are, contributing in more meaningful and impactful ways to the environment that they operate in. They have the power to create movements, to bring people and knowledge together quickly and efficiently to make things happen, and they should prepare their students and graduates to be able to do the same in their daily lives and careers.</ce:para>

As such, business schools are not looking for a standard checklist when it comes to embedding sustainability. They value flexibility in implementation in order to develop unique programmes based on their strengths and interests. Given these vast differences, no single model to implementing sustainability in management education is going to work, or is even desirable.

This could be through training, resources, support, frameworks and clear and consistent communication and application of a chosen strategy. But just as important as creating and communicating a school's approach to sustainability, the school also needs to create a workplace that not only allows but encourages and rewards individuals for engaging and carrying out this strategy. This includes eliminating de-motivating factors.</ce:para>
                     <ce:para id="p0285" view="all">The biggest emphasis needs to be put on engaging and empowering faculty who are not only the ones influencing students, but doing research that is influencing, or could further influence, businesses’ ability to reach the SDGs. Obtaining faculty buy-in is a widely shared challenge to integrating sustainability within business schools, in part because of the way faculty are rewarded and promoted as well as the general awareness of these issues. Empowering faculty internally, as well as identifying system wide challenges relating to faculty incentives, needs to be addressed in order for schools to truly move forward.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0300" view="all">Business schools are yet to reach their full potential as agents in moving the SDGs forward. The challenge is in part that the wider community isn't alone in underappreciating the role of management education in sustainability and the SDGs. Business schools themselves often fail to fully recognise the role that they have and the opportunities that exist, and when they do, as a school or as individuals within the schools, they are often not equipped to play that role. This is in part why, despite growing interest from business schools and in particular their students, the pace of change has been relatively slow to date, especially compared to the business sector that these students are being trained to enter.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0305" view="all">The management education sector has important choices to make regarding how it decides to proceed over the next 10 years. They can do nothing and risk disappearing or being replaced. Many of the business schools we know today will gradually become irrelevant and struggle to exist if they fail to adapt and change. Others will change so much that they will bear little resemblance to what they look like today. Schools can choose to do the minimum, enough that it may ensure their survival, but not true success. Or management education can be transformative, to dive into this role and responsibility, to educate the kinds of graduates that we need today and in the future, and to be an innovative force in this field by embedding, collaborating and contributing both collectively and in their own unique ways. This is a future that benefits the student, the school, recruiters and society at large. The real success of a business education programme will increasingly be judged on whether it is able to train graduates to think about business and making money in different ways, aligning social and environmental objectives with financial gains.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0310" view="all">Sustainability and business are continually, and rapidly, changing. Business schools will need to find ways to be more adaptable and entrepreneurial in order to keep up, to identify opportunities for themselves, tap into these and ultimately lead the way. They will need to think outside the box, be willing and flexible to experiment and test out new ideas. And there are a growing number within management education at all levels, that are willing and actively working to bring about change. They are questioning traditional approaches to management education and putting in place new programmes, courses, experiences and partnerships (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib6" id="crosref0105">Weybrecht, 2016</ce:cross-ref>).

                  <ce:para id="p0315" view="all">The next 10 years are a time to take the responsibility, whether as faculty, deans, students, staff or business leaders, to understand our roles in turning management education into a powerful tool to reach the SDGs. Business schools aren't just creating future business leaders, they are creating global leaders. Once they themselves recognise and act on this, not only will they reap the rewards but the global community will be better able to move forward as well. The impact that business schools can have over the next 10 years is indeed a powerful one.</ce:para>
