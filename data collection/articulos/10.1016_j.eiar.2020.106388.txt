                  This article extends previous sustainability literature by demonstrating the effectiveness of good governance in rebalancing the economic, environmental, and social components of sustainable development. Good economic, political, and institutional governance are considered as conditional variables, which allow rebalancing these three components in the case of 20 selected MENA economies for the period 1996–2014. Using simultaneous-equation modeling approach, we find that (i) political and institutional governance positively contribute to the three components of sustainable development; (ii) there exists a two-way linkages between human development and economic growth, meaning that they are interrelated and may very well serve as complements to each other; (iii) increased economic growth conducts to further emissions, which, in turn, decreases economic growth; (iv) enhancing human development conducts to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, which, in turn, negatively affects human development; (v) improving both political and institutional governance permits MENA governments to moderate both the negative impacts of carbon emissions on economic growth and human development and the positive impact of economic growth on increasing emissions, and as a result sustainable development.

Good economic, political, and institutional governance are considered as conditional variables, which allow rebalancing these three components in the case of 20 selected MENA economies for the period 1996–2014. Using simultaneous-equation modeling approach, we find that (i) political and institutional governance positively contribute to the three components of sustainable development; (ii) there exists a two-way linkages between human development and economic growth, meaning that they are interrelated and may very well serve as complements to each other; (iii) increased economic growth conducts to further emissions, which, in turn, decreases economic growth; (iv) enhancing human development conducts to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, which, in turn, negatively affects human development; (v) improving both political and institutional governance permits MENA governments to moderate both the negative impacts of carbon emissions on economic growth and human development and the positive impact of economic growth on increasing emissions, and as a result sustainable development.   Keywords Good governance  Sustainable development  Simultaneous-equation models    1 Introduction As governments and global institutions around the world adopt policies and initiatives designed to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), still exist significant shortcomings in our knowledge of how and whether this objective could be achieved in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In this regard, the contribution of governance quality on attaining sustainable development becoming a worldwide subject of great importance (Güney, 2017 ). Compared to the previous studies on the link between governance and sustainable development, the main goal of this inquiry is to check the effectiveness of good governance to assure the complementarity among growing the economy, protecting the environment, and enhancing human development in 20 selected MENA economies. The positioning of this article is motivated by at least four strands of research: (i) why focusing on MENA countries, (ii) the interconnections between the three components of sustainable development, (iii) the impact of governance on sustainable development, and (iv) gaps in previous literature. First, we choose the MENA economies as a context of this inquiry because little empirical studies have been focused on this group of economies, which its characteristics are very well adapted to the case of this inquiry. For instance, despite the geopolitical challenges that they currently face, these economies have several advantages: a privileged geographical position at the crossroads of Africa, Asia, and Europe; a well-educated population; and significant potential in sectors, such as tourism, business development services, and green energy. Recently, some countries in the region have established reforms to increase openness and diversification of their economies and reinforce the development of the private sector. These reforms have first led to more investment, trade and economic growth, but they have remained incomplete and have not adequately addressed broader economic, environmental, and social structural issues. To deal with these issues, Tang and Abosedra (2014)  argue that governments in the MENA region should take steps to enhance governance quality, including the quality of public services, property rights, and fighting corruption. They also suggest that the countries in this region should accelerate structural reforms affecting such fields as trade policy, business climate, and governance. Second, the UN World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) defines sustainable development as a development “which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs”  (WCED, 1987 : 43). In fact, it has been acknowledged as a key channel for redirecting development towards a more inclusive model, which seeks to balance desirable economic, social, and environmental conditions for both present and future generations (Dhahri and Omri, 2018 ). This objective was born from the idea that these conditions are interconnected and cannot be considered separately (Strange and Bayley, 2008 ). A large par of the existing studies show this interconnection. For instance, many scholars, such as Grossman and Krueger (1991) , Ang (2007) , Ben Youssef et al. (2016) , Omri et al. (2019) , among others, have interested on examining the linkage between environmental quality and per capita growth via the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Following the seminal work of Grossman and Krueger (1991) , the growing interest in the validity of this hypothesis shows a range of contradictory results. Four results are, thus, identified: an inverted U-shaped relationship (e.g., Ben Youssef et al., 2016 ; Omri et al., 2019 ) or even an N-shaped relationship, meaning that the environmental degradation would come back in high levels of growth (e.g., Chandran and Tang, 2013 ; Ozcan, 2013 ), and others show a linear relationship (e.g., Bertinelli and Strobl, 2005 ; Omri, 2013 ). Other scholars have interested in the growth-human development nexus. For example, Ramirez et al. (1998)  find a positive interrelationship in both directions. According to Ranis (2004) , two causal chains that explain this interrelationship: one goes from economic growth to human development (Chain A) and the second goes from human development to economic growth (Chain B). The authors argue that better nourished, healthier and educated people increases economic growth, which, in turn, enhances human development. Some other scholars have also interested in examining the environment-human development nexus. Costantini and Monni (2008) , for example, analyse the impact human development on sustainability, confirming that adopting a human development perspective provides a sustainable economic development path. Similarly, Alam (2012)  investigates the nexus between environmental quality and human development in Pakistan, proving that human development improves environmental quality through adaptation and using clean technologies. Also, in the case of 20 developing countries, Dhahri and Omri (2018)  show that an increase in environmental degradation reduces human development, measured by the sum of education and life expectancy indices. Third, the concept of governance is defined by the World Governance Indicators (WGI) as the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them . In this context, as governments worldwide still search for solutions to advance sustainable development, the importance of good governance as a critical tool for achieving this objective has recently become a popular subject in the policy and academic circles (e.g., Bos and Gupta, 2019 ). The concept of good governance includes the capacity to plan and create organisations that are required for achieving the SDGs (Güney, 2017 ). It also ensures the participation of the State, non-state actors, private sector, and the civil society in the decision-making process, promotes transparency, accountability, and the rule of law at all levels, and permits efficient management of economic, natural, human, and financial resources for equitable and sustainable development (Hallegatte et al., 2011 ). The interest in good governance for achieving sustainability is also detected from the previous empirical literature. For instance, using a modified version of EKC, Costantini and Monni (2008)  examine the impact of human development and governance quality, measured by the rule of law, on sustainable development. There finding confirms the positive relationship between them. Using data for 110 countries for the 1996–2007 period, Aidt (2011)  examine the relationship between different indicators of corruption and sustainable development measured with genuine investment. He concludes that corruption negatively affects sustainable development. Fourth, the present article also discusses pertinent shortcomings in the previous studies. First, previous empirical works have only examined the impact of governance on sustainable development as a whole or on each one of its three dimensions, but do not perform the three in a unified framework. Thus, there is still a significant gap regarding the effectiveness of governance to rebalancing these dimensions. Second, in the previous study, the link between governance and sustainable development has been individually analyzed in terms of corruption, political stability, or bureaucratic quality; yet, the quality of governance is a complex phenomenon that includes different indicators (Kaufmann et al., 2010 ). Based on the four strands of literature discussed above, this inquiry contributes to the existing sustainability studies in the following ways. First, while some of the existing studies discussed the importance of governance on achieving sustainable development, none of them has interested on examining its ability to rebalance the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainable development. In this study, good governance is considered as a conditional variable, which allows balancing these three dimensions for 20 MENA countries. Second, according to the current literature on the necessity to disclose governance measures to provide room for robustness, we consider six measures of good governance classified into three categories—economic governance  (government effectiveness & regulatory quality); political governance  (political stability & Voice and Accountability); institutional governance  (control of corruption & rule of law). The analysis by category of governance allows us to understand who is the best category in achieving this complementarity. Third, we use simultaneous-equation modeling approach, estimated by the generalized method of moments (GMM), to simultaneously examine the interrelationships among the economic, environmental, and social components of sustainable development by taking into account the conditional role of good governance. Specifically, we use three structural equations allowing to simultaneously analyse the effect of (a) carbon emissions, human development and good governance on economic growth, (b) economic growth, human development and good governance on carbon emissions, and (c) economic growth, carbon emissions and good governance on human development. The rest of the article is organised as such: Section 2  outlines the methodological approach and describes the data. Section 3  discusses the obtained main results. Conclusion and recommendations are reported in Section 4 .  2 Methodology and data 2.1 Models construction and estimation method To demonstrate the effectiveness of good governance in achieving sustainable development, we firstly use a Cobb–Douglas production function by which par capita GDP depends on capital, labour, human development, CO2  emissions, governance quality, and other inputs. The extended production function allows us to analyse the complementarity among per capita GDP, CO2  emissions, and human development by taking into account the conditional impact of good governance on achieving this complementarity. The three considered variables of Sustainable development are in reality endogenous, which require to explore their interconnections simultaneously in a one modeling framework. Capital and labour factors are introduced into the Cobb-Douglas production function as additional inputs. Per capita GDP could also be affected by energy use, who is directly linked to environmental degradation (e.g., Omri et al., 2015 ). Other scholars, such as Weil (2014) , Dhahri and Omri (2018) , show that per capita GDP is positively influenced by human development (education and life expectancy). So, we consider the following extended production function:(1) Y = AK α 1   L α 2   E α 3   HD α 4   e ε     where Y is per capita GDP, K, L E, and HD denote, respectively, domestic capital, labour force, energy use, and human development. A is the technological level and e is the error term. α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , and α 4  are the production elasticities for capital, labour, energy use, and human development, respectively. Given the technological levels at a given point in time, there exist a linear link between the consumption of energy (E) and environmental degradation (CO): E = b CO. Then, we have(2) Y = bAK α 1   L α 2   CO α 3   HD α 4   e ε      According to Omri et al. (2015) , the technological level can be endogenously influenced by trade and the financial sector development. These laters increasesthe inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which, in turn, facilitates the transfers and production of advanced technologies. Therefore, we have(3) A = δ T β 1   FD β 2       Where T and FD are, respectively, trade openness and financial development, and δ  is time-invariant constant. By including Eq. (3)  into Eq. (2) , we find(4) Y = δ . CO α 1   HD α 2   T α 3   FD α 4   K β  L β ‐ 1       We rewrite Eq. (4)  in growth form and panel data as follows:(5)  gY it  = α 0  + α 1 i   CO it  + α 2 i   HD it  + α 3 i   FD it  + α 4 i   T it  + α 5 i   gK it  + α 6 i   L it  + ε it      Where the subscript i (i  = 1, ….., N) indicates the countries included in this analysis (20 countries1  1 Includes Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Tunisia, UAE, and Yemen.  ) and t (t  = 1, ……, T) indicates the time period considered in this study (19 years), gY is per capita GDP growth, CO is CO2  emissions per capita, HD is human development measured by inequality-adjusted human development index, FD is financial development defined by domestic credit provided by financial sector as % of GDP, T is trade openness, gK is the growth rate of gross fixed capital formation, L is the labour force, and ε  is the error term. We then transform the production function in Eq. (6)  into three regression-models to simultaneously examine economic growth, environmental quality, and human development as endogenous. Accordingly, we consider the following simultaneous-equation models to demonstrate the complementarity among the economic, environmental, and social components of sustainable development by taking into account the conditional role played by good governance (Gov) to achieve this objective. In analyzing the three-ways linkage among these three dimensions, some other variables are included in these models as instruments, such as domestic capital (gK), labour force (L), financial development (FD), trade openness (TO), per capita energy use growth (gE), FDI (F), foreign aid (A), and Government expenditure in health and education (EX). To demonstrate the effectiveness of good governance in balancing the three components of sustainable development, we consider the following system of equations:(6) gY it  = α 0  + α 1  HD it  + α 2  CO it  + α 3  Gov it  + α 4  Gov it  ∗ CO it  + ∑ j = 1  K  δ j  X jit  + τ i  + ε it     (7) HD it  = α 0  + α 1  gY it  + α 2  CO it  + α 3  Gov it  + α 4  Gov it  ∗ CO it  + ∑ j = 1  K  δ j  X ′ jit  + τ i  + ε it     (8) CO it  = α 0  + α 1  HD it  + α 2  gY it  + α 3  Gov it  + α 4  Gov it  ∗ gY it  + ∑ j = 1  K  δ j  X ′ ′ jit  + τ i  + ε it      In Eq. (6) , gY indicates per capita GDP growth, HD is the human development; CO is per capita CO2  emissions; Gov*CO is the interplay between governance and emissions; X is the other control variables introduced in the model as instruments (consists of the growth rate of gross fixed capital formation, labour, trade openness, and financial development). The coefficients of carbon emissions and governance are expected to be negative and positive, respectively. The coefficient of the interaction effect is expected to be positive. In Eq. (7) , human development (HD) could be affected by per capita GDP growth (gY), per capita CO2  emissions (CO), the interplay between governance and emissions (Gov*CO), and X' control variables, namely: government expenditure in health & education (EX), and foreign aid (Aid). The coefficients of economic growth and governance are expected to be positive (Dhahri and Omri, 2018 ), while the coefficient of carbon emissions is expected to be negative (Shafei and Salim, 2014). The coefficient of the interplay between governance and emissions is expected to be positive. Regarding the two control variables, we expect positive impacts of government expenditure on health & education and foreign aid on human development (Asiedu, 2014 ). In Eq. (8) , carbon emissions (CO) could be affected by human development (HD), economic growth (gY), governance (Gov), the interplay between governance and economic growth (Gov*gY), and X" control variables, namely: the growth rate of per capita energy use (gE) and FDI (F). The coefficients of human development and governance are expected to be negative (Omri, 2013 ; Ben Youssef et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2019 ); however, the coefficient of economic growth is expected to be positive (Dhahri and Omri, 2018 ). The coefficient of the interplay between governance and economic growth is expected to be negative. For the two control variables, we expect positive impacts of energy use and FDI on increasing carbon emissions (Omri et al., 2014 ; Shabaz et al., 2015; Abdouli and Hammami, 2017 ; Omri et al., 2019 ). As mentioned above, Eqs. (6) to (8)  were estimated simultaneously using the GMM estimator. This later is most commonly applied for panel data and multiple-way relationships among variables (Omri, 2013 ). Several reasons allows us to apply this method: (i) it permits o avoid the endogeneity issues that may emerge from independents variables by considering a set of instrumental variables, (ii) since it is compatible with a panel data context, cross-country chnages are not excluded in the regressions, and (iii) it offers efficient and consistent estimates in the presence of heteroskedasticity. According to Omri (2013) , two specific tests are required to run simultaneous-equation estimates: Hansen and Durbin–Wu–Hausman tests. The first one is used to validate the instruments. Its null hypothesis states that the instrumental variables are uncorrelated with the error term. The second diagnostic test is used to verify the existence of the endogeneity problem in the estimated models. The null hypothesis is that instruments as a group are exogenous. The rejection of this hypothesis means that the instrumental variables method is required.  2.2 Data and descriptive statistics Using a sample of 20 selected MENA countries with data from the World Governance Indicators (WGI), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the World Development Indicators (WDI), this inquiry investigates how balancing economic growth, protecting the environment, ensuring human development through good governance during the period 1996–2014. This periodicity and the 20 selected countries have been chosen based on the availability of data on the governance indicators and per capita CO2  emissions. The used indicators are per capita GDP (constant 2010 US$) as measure of economic growth; human development index (HDI) as measure of human development; per capita CO2  emissions (in metric tons); political governance, economic governance, and institutional governance as measures of good governance; per capita gross fixed capital formation as measure of domestic capital (constant 2010 US$); labour force (% of total population); per capita energy use (kg of oil equivalent); domestic credit provided by financial sector (% of GDP) as measure of financial development; total export and import (% of GDP) as measure of trade openness; FDI net inflows (% of GDP) as measure of FDI; total official development assistance (% of GDP) as measure of foreign aid; government expenditure in health and education (% of total government expenditure). The descriptive statistics and correlation are reported in Table 1  . We can observe from this table that, during the sample period, per capita GDP and energy use have the highest average values and the highest volatility compared to the other variables; the average values of the indicators of good governance range from −0.78 to −0.04; human development and the indicators of governance quality have the lowest volatility, which indicates that they are stable during the 1996–2014 period. From the correlation results, we can observe, on the one hand, that per capita GDP growth is positively connected to per capita CO2  emissions and human development, which means that economic growth increases environmental degradation and human development; however, a negative connection is found between human development and CO2  emissions, meaning that an increase in human development reduces CO2  emissions. On the other hand, the correlation coefficients show that all the indicators of governance quality have the highest positive connections with economic growth and human development, and highest negatively connections with CO2  emissions. These results indicate that good governance can be used as a tool to rebalance the economic, environmental, and social components of sustainable development.   3 Empirical results We begin this empirical part by verifying the stationarity of the variables to identify which variables must be introduced into the models in their level form and which variables must be introduced in their growth form. Before running these tests, it is recommended first to check the presence of cross-sectional dependence in the panel using the Pesaran (2004)  CD-test, which allows us to choose between the first- and second-generation panel unit root tests. The results of Pesaran (2004)  CD-test, presented in Table 2  , indicate that the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence is not rejected in the panel, meaning that we cannot use the second-generation of tests in our analysis. Therefore, we used two-first-generation tests suggested by Im et al. (2003)  and Levin et al. (2002) . The results of these tests are also presented in Table 2 , which show that the null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected for per capita GDP, per capita gross fixed capital formation, and per capita energy use, meaning that they are not stationary in their level form and they should be transformed into growth form by differencing them. However, the null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected for the rest of the variables, meaning that they are stationary in their levels and they could be included in the models without being changed into growth form. To estimate the three-way relationships among economic growth, human development, and carbon emissions, capital, labour force, financial development, trade openness, foreign aid, government expenditure on health & education, FDI, and energy use are used as instrumental variables. As mentioned above, before estimating our models, some diagnostic tests should be used to test the instruments' validity (Hansen-j test) and the existence of endogeneity problem in the estimated models (Durbin–Wu–Hausman test). Tables 3-5     confirm, through the Hansen j-test, that the null hypothesis that instruments are appropriate cannot be rejected, and they also confirm, through the Durbin–Wu–Hausman test, that the null hypothesis that instruments as a group are exogenous has been rejected, indicating that instrumental variables technique is required. In light of these prerequisite tests, the results of Eqs. (6) to (8)  are reported in Tables 3 to 5 , respectively. Table 3  shows five principal findings. First, except for specification 4 (VA) belonging to political governance human development increases significantly per capita GDP, going from 0.099 to 0.129%. The positive impact of human development on economic growth is also confirmed by Bloom et al. (2004)  who find that life expectancy and education both contribute positively to economic growth. They also document that a good quality of health increases capital accumulation and labour productivity, which, in turn, promotes economic growth. In the case of twenty developed economies, Dhahri and Omri (2018)  also indicate that higher levels of human growth stimulate economic development by strengthening the capacity of individuals, their creativity and productivity. The authors also argue that when a population is well healthier and educated, this will lead to growing the economy via higher labour productivity, attracting more financial investment, and improving technology. Second, except for specification 1 (GE) belonging to economic governance, all the indicators of governance have positive impacts on economic growth, going from 0.079 to 0.109%, confirming the findings of Liu et al. (2018)  who show that governance quality increases economic development in the eastern region of China, while it leads to a high-speed of economic growth in the western region; however, it contradicts the finding of Mira and Hammadache (2017)  for 45 developing economies who believe that growth in developing nations cannot be only determined by the indicators of governance as contended by the institutionalist authors. Third, in all the estimated models, carbon emissions negatively affect economic growth, ranging from −0.99 to −0.317%, confirming the finding of Omri et al. (2015)  who also show a negative effect of carbon emissions on economic growth in the MENA region; yet, it contradicts the finding of Azam et al. (2015)  who show a positive linkage between the two variables. According to Omri (2013) , energy consumpion is the most critical determinant of carbon emissions in the MENA region and, in terms of particulate matter concentrations, this region is classified among the most polluted in the world and has the top carbon dioxide producers per dollar of output. Fourth, we focus on a significant shortcoming in the existing studies, i.e. analyzing the effectiveness of economic, political, and institutional governance in mitigating the negative consequences of emissions on income growth. Accordingly, except for the models pertaining to economic governance, the coefficients of the interactions between the indicators of governance quality and CO2  emissions are positive and significant, going from 0.106 to 0.130%, meaning that governments in MENA region could improve political and institutional governance to mitigate carbon emissions and control energy without loss of economic growth, confirming the finding of Lau et al. (2014)  who analyse the effect of governance and environmental degradation on the Malaysian's economic growth for the 1984–2008 period. Their findings reveal that the combination of good governance and carbon emissions increases economic growth, indicating that governance quality can work for reducing carbon emissions while improving economic growth. They also suggest that good governance should, therefore, be considered as inputs to put in place strong legislation that, when applied effectively, will help mitigate environmental risks throughout the economy. Finally, as expected, economic growth is positively influenced by the increase of trade, the development of financial sector, domestic capital, and labour force. Table 4  identifies five principal results. First, as expected, per capita GDP growh has a positive effect on human development in all estimated models, ranging from 0.096 to 0.387%. Economic growth is necessary for human development because only an increase in GDP makes it possible to release the resources needed for establishing a social policy based on health, education and the enhancement of standard of living. For example, during the 30 Glorieuses, the strong growth (diversification of the production and consumption) allowed to finance social security as well as education. Economic growth can, therefore, influences human development in two different ways: via the improvement of the purchasing power of households or through the increase of State resources. An improvement in the standard of living also conducts to a variation in the structure of their consumption, towards the satisfaction of secondary needs, such as spending on leisure, cultural goods, education, health (changing attitudes). For the State, economic growth also increases the State's resources, which allows a positive intervention of the latter on human development. It provides the State sufficient resources to finance public investments in education, health, and the infrastructure required to enhance the well-being of the citizens. The state may also set up social policy, aiming in particular to reduce inequalities between individuals. Second, except for model 2 (RQ) pertaining to economic governance, all the coefficient of governance indicators have, as expected, positive impacts on human development, going from 0.102 to 0.297%, confirming the findings of Khan (2015) who analyse the relationship between six indicators of governance qualiy and human development for eight South Asian economies. The author argues that the progress towards human development in these economies is conditioned by improving the six indicators of governance proposed by Kaufmann et al. (2010) . He also documents that with well-defined governance system, these economies can develop sound policies on human well-being. Third, in all the estimated models, CO2  emissions have, as expected, a higher negative impact on human development, ranging from −0.203 to −0.369%. Within this context, the World Health Organization (2009)  states that carbon emissions represent a significant environmental health risk and cause an estimated two million premature deaths worldwide each year. Reducing carbon emissions is expected to lessen the global burden of diseases caused by heart disease, respiratory infections, and lung cancer. Similarly, in a recent study carried out by Asongu and Odhiambo (2018)  for 44 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, the authors also confirm the negative impact of carbon emissions on human development. Fourth, we focus on another shortcoming in the existing literature, i.e. the effectiveness of good governance in reducing the incidence of carbon dioxide emissions on human development. The coefficients of the interactions among the indicators of good governance and carbon emissions are positive and significant in all the estimated models expect the models pertaining the economic governance, ranging from 0.092 to 0.136%, indicating that political and institutional governance can work for reducing CO2  emissions while promoting human development. This result confirms the finding of Asongu and Odhiambo (2018)  who document that Sub-Saharan African economies need to enhance governance quality for moderating the negative impact of environmental pollution on human development. They suggest that improving the governance system is crucial for governments dynamic to moderate carbon emissions for a better human development. Finally, as expected, human development in the MENA region can be affected by foreign aid and government expenditure on health and education. The following main results are drawn from Table 5 . First, except for model 2 (RQ) and model 4 (VA) pertaining, respectively, to economic and political governance, all the models show that carbon emissions are negatively affected by human development, going from −0.046 to −0.092%. These results contradicts those of Dhahri and Omri (2018)  who show an insignificant affect of human development on carbon emission. However, in the case of Pakistan, Alam (2012)  show that human development improves environmental quality through adaptation and using clean technologies. Second, as expected, economic growth increases emissions in all the estimated models, ranging from 0.173 to 0.419%. This result is also supported by Omri et al. (2015)  who find that increasing economic growth deteriorates environmental quality for 9 of 12 MENA countries, and an insignificant impact is found in the rest of countries. To reduce the incidence of economic growth on environmental quality in these economies, the authors argue that carbon emissions could be mitigated at the cost of economic growth or via the encouragement of using efficient energy technologies to improve domestic production with the support from the financial sector and by the import of environmentally friendly technologies from the developed economies. Third, except for model 1 (GE) belonging to economic governance, all the estimated models show that good governance negatively affects carbon emissions, ranging from −0.283 to −0.538%. This result confirms the findings of Danish et al. (2019)  who use the six indicators of Kaufmann in the case of BRICS economies and find that they contribute significantly to reduce carbon emissions. They indicate that this contribution will be achieved if governance is sufficiently strong and efficient to deal with environmental concerns. Fourth, we focus on another shortcoming in the existing literature, i.e. the effectiveness of good governance in modulating the incidence of economic growth on carbon emissions. The coefficients of the interactions among the indicators of good governance and economic growth are positive and significant in all the estimated models except those pertaining to economic governance, going from −0.093 to −0.201%, indicating that MENA countries need to enhance the quality of political and institutional governance to moderate the negative impact of economic growth on human development, which confirms the finding of Abid (2016)  who examines the impacts of institutional, financial sector and economic growth on environemntal degradation for 25 SSA economies and confirms that carbon emissions could be directly mitigated via institutions quality or indirectly through the economic growth-institutions nexus. Finally, as expected, both FDI and energy use increases carbon emissions. In light of the above results, the following are the main findings: (i) good governance has positive impacts on economic growth, human development, reducing carbon emissions; (ii) a two-way linkage between economic growth and human development is found, i.e. that they are interrelated and may very well serve as complements to each other; (iii) economic growth deteriorates environmental quality, and on his side this later negatively affects economic growth; however, the results of the interactions between good governance and economic growth and between good governance and CO2  emissions show that good political and institutional governance can be used as a tool to balance between growing the economy and mitigating carbon emissions; (iv) Human development contributes positively to the reduction of carbon emissions, whereas this later has a negative impact on human development; however, the result of the interaction between good governance and CO2  emissions show that good political and institutional governance can moderate this negative impact and achieve; as a result, the complementarity between human development and protecting environment. These findings allow us to said that improving political and institutional governance is a crucial channel through which governments in the MENA region could balancing the economic, environmental, and social components of sustainable development.  4 Conclusion and policy implications Growing concerns about climate and environmental issues and disappointment with development efforts to improve human and economic well-being have prompted policymakers to rethink their economic growth model towards a new model of sustainable development, who calls for rebalancing the economic, social, and environmental goals while respecting the interests of future generations. In spite of this new orientation, the question of how rebalancing these objectives remains. Accordingly, the role of good governance in answering this question has recently become a fashionable debate in the policy and academic circles. As a contribution to this debate, this inquiry aims to re-investigate the effectiveness of good governance in achieving sustainable development by addressing the following question: Does good governance effective to assure the complementarity between growing the economy, protecting environment, and enhancing human development in 20 selected MENA countries? By answering this question, our empirical analysis offers the following main findings: (i) political and institutional governance positively contribute to the three components of sustainable development; (ii) there exists a two-way link between economic growth and human development, meaning that they are interrelated and may very well serve as complements to each other; (iii) increased economic growth conducts to further environmental degradation, which, in turn, reduces economic growth; (iv) enhancing human development leads to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, which, in turn, affects negatively human development; (v) improving both political and institutional governance permits MENA governments to moderate the negative impact of carbon emissions on economic growth and human development, and the positive effect of economic growth on environmental degradation, and as a result sustainable development. The followings are some policy implications arising from these findings aimed at rebalancing the three components of sustainable development in the MENA region. First, to moderate the negative impact of carbon emissions on economic growth and human development, policymakers in the MENA region should strengthen their governance institutions and then allow them to work effectively. The effective functioning of these institutions will provide the appropriate regulations, laws, and property rights, as well as means to fight corruption, which, if consistently monitored, will reduce carbon emissions and improve the level of environmental conditions. Besides, continued improved governance in the MENA region will further reduce carbon emissions, as good governance means greater political freedom and access to information, which strengthens citizens' desire for a cleaner environment and raise public awareness for environmental legislation. Consequently, public demand for better environmental quality leads to the enforcement of environmental regulations, reducing environmental degradation and the risk of harm to human health. Moreover, protecting the environment, for example by integrating the environment into development plans and adopting appropriate environmental legislation that could encourage the consumption of green energy that has few environmental problems, is essential to reduce poverty, increase human development, and promote long-term economic growth. It can also contribute to improving gender equality because women in developing economies are more vulnerable to the negative externalities of the degradation of natural resources (Hallegatte et al., 2011 ). Second, as our finding emphasises a robust positive relationship between economic growth—in combination with good political and institutional governance— and environmental improvement and, consequently sustainable development, policymakers in MENA countries should, therefore, strive to improve their governance system. As these economies develop, their governments should establish and enforce appropriate laws and regulations to support economic growth, foster technological innovation, and offset any market failure that may lead to increased carbon emissions. In particular, an economy with a good governance system, avoiding the arbitrary exercise of State power and establishing property rights is an economy capable of efficiently mobilising resources and providing its citizens with opportunities to reach a more productive economy accompanied by a better quality of the environment. In addition to these implications and contributions outlined above, we note that our analysis suffers from two main limitations. First, as an inquiry on the linkage among governance and the three components of sustainable development in the MENA region, this article only selects typical formal institutions/governance in the analysis, and more informal institutions could be also considered as important indicators of governance to examine the relationships above. Second, the scope of this analysis is limited to only one indicator for each component of sustainable development; however, regarding the SDGs, many other environmental, social and economic indicators could be used in the future research studies.
