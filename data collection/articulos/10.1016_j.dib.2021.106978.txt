                  The data article presents a dataset and a tool for news-based monitoring of sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. The presented dataset was created by structured queries of the GDELT database based on the categories of the World Bank taxonomy matched to sustainable development goals. The Google BigQuery SQL scripts and the results of the related network analysis are attached to the data to provide a toolset for the strategic management of sustainability issues. The article demonstrates the dataset on the 6th sustainable development goal (Clean Water and Sanitation). The network formed based on how countries appear in the same news can be used to explore the potential international cooperation. The network formed based on how topics of World Bank taxonomy appear in the same news can be used to explore how the problems and solutions of sustainability issues are interlinked.

Therefore, monitoring and analyzing the multiple indices to intervene is critical. News play a significant part in conveying objectives and major focus areas of both governmental as well as public interests [1] . News analysis can play an active role in terms of defining the status of the roadmap for implementing the SDGs [2] . The localization of the SDGs is critical as social spaces are vital factors of the successful implementation and preservation of the goals [3] . GDELT uses natural language processing, data mining, and deep learning algorithms to extract and monitor news of the world. The Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) is a part of GDELT which records people, organizations, locations, themes and taxonomies, sources, tone and events of news into a network storage. Included tables will be listed as: name of the table, description of the table, value of dataset, name of the column in the table, type of column and the description of the column.- world_bank_to_sdg.csv:  World Bank categories have been matched with the keywords of sustainable development goals. The matching was done manually by the authors who are experts of the field. One element can be matched to more sustainable development goals. All other results are dependent on this matching.

It defines the connections (co-occurrence) of countries in regard to the SDG13-related news and their tone.     2 Experimental Design, Materials and Methods Governmental policies are operated in long-term planning horizon by reflecting socioeconomic as well as environmental development focused visions. We aim to combine the advantage of the news analysis through The GDELT Project as well as the network analysis models to reveal interconnection. The following steps of news-centered network analysis of sustainability issues can be distinguished:- Determination of search words connected to SDGs:  Search words are basis on the World Bank Group's Topical Taxonomy [5]  and the My World 2015 [6]  survey contributed to the formulation of Agenda 2030. The selection of search words and their association with the sustainable development goals (see table world_bank_to_sdg.csv ) was done manually by the authors who are experts of the field, however, the methodology allows them to validate through the joint occurrences of the topics.  - Development of the related SQL (Structured Query Language) Queries:  GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) database records people, organizations, locations, themes, taxonomies, sources, tone and events of news and makes this huge amount of data available as a quaryable dataset in the Google BigQuery (GBQ). Therefore, the systematic queries are based on a schematic SELECT query which captures the main details of the GKG database, namely location, date, topics and tone of news.  - Generation of networks:  A labelled multilayer network is created, which enables to identify the profiles of countries or regions as well as examine their overreaching national relationships based solely on news appearing. The network is generated using GDELT geolocation, topic recognition and sentiment analysis. Based on the location mentioned in the article GDELT geolocates the articles to countries and cities. The multidimensional network can be defined as nodes (V), edges (E) and dimensions (D). The edge represents the connection between two nodes (u and v) in a dimension (d). It is express as the following:G = ( V , E , D  )      E = { ( u , v , d  )  , u , v ∈ V , d ∈ D  }          Furthermore, the categories of the article define which layer the previously mentioned edge appears in. An article includes characteristics as article's id (i), publication date (ti ), the identified set of locations mentioned within it (Li ), the dimensions and tags of the article (Di ) and also its sentiment (si ).a i  = 〈 i , t i  , L i  , D i  , s i   〉       Two types of networks are built, one is when the nodes are the topics, the edges are the news and the dimension of the edges is the countries or groups of countries and the weight of the edges is the number of pieces and/or tone. The other option is when the nodes represent the countries and edges are the news of a topic and the weight of the edges can be determined from the number of articles. This methodological development allows continuous monitoring throughout the world through online queries, therefore measuring the social acceptance of SDGs and encouraging participation in terms of their implementation, as well as helping countries around the world to share experiences concerning their problems and successes, which is essential for the implementation of the Agenda [7] . 2.1 Validation of the applicability of the data We categorized the news gained about according to the 17 sustainable development goals. In the following we will only consider for an example analysis the 6th goal of the UN sustainable development goals, which is the “Clean Water and Sanitation” goal. This covers 5 624 192 articles, from 226 countries. The overview of the top 10 most mentioned countries by the news already creates an impression that this topic in these countries is fairly natural, tone is around 0, however, there are certain outliers in the number of positive and negative articles. An article is positive if the overall tone is above 10 and negative if it is below −10. The distribution of global news related to SDG6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all) is shown in Fig. 1  . The map cutouts were selected based on the Global Burden of Disease Study by Fullman et al. [8] . Fig. 1  shows the darker countries are discussed the Clean Water and Sanitation topic more detailed. It can be seen, that in Norfolk Island (NFK) from the overall news is occupied 0,8% percent of the news related to SDG6. In Pitcairn Islands (PCN), the 0,75% of news talks about Clean Water and Sanitation. Fig. 2   shows the connection between the topics of SDG6. The edges are colored with red having bad tone when connecting two topics, and green with good tone connecting them. The thickness represents the number of connections between the topics. It can be seen, that “Water Treatment” and “Water, Sanitation and Hygiene” are the most common topics appearing together in the news, with an overall bad tone. While “Water, Sanitation and Hygiene” is connecting to Ecosystems with an overall good tone. The ever increasing social participation and environmental awareness can be achieved primarily through news, therefore, their monitoring is essential. We presented a dataset that supports the news-based analysis of sustainable development goals. We have demonstrated the applicability of the data by presenting how the news related to the 6th SDG “Clean Water and Sanitation” goal are distributed among the countries and how the topics of World Bank taxonomy are connected to this critical issue. Thanks to the intelligent functions behind the studied GDELT Knowledge Graph the proposed tool overcomes the limitations of geographical coverage and language barriers. With the proposed Google BigQuery SQL scripts the global media is discoverable and thematically analyzable in terms of the SDGs, which was not possible before.   Ethics Statement Not applicable.
