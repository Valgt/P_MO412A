                  The global community has aligned themselves with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Airlines could play an important role in achieving these as they facilitate air travel, offer employment opportunities, and provide other socio-economic benefits. On the other hand, air travel generates a series of socially and environmentally adverse effects. Finding a way to magnify the positive impacts and mitigate the negative ones is crucial given the projected growth of this sector. Action towards the SDGs might be a path forward but at present little is known about how individual airlines engage with the SDGs, a gap this research seeks to fill. Using the membership of the International Air Transportation Association (nearly 300 airlines), we examine airline reports, websites, and other published documents for explicit mention of the SDGs. Findings indicate that ∼30% of airlines show various levels of engagement and ∼50% refer to sustainability more broadly. Combining these results with a wide range of variables related to airline action and basic descriptors as well as government policy and regulation, we find that existing sustainability related actions taken by airlines (e.g., reporting to prominent sustainability indices and producing a CSR report) are strongly correlated with higher levels of SDG engagement. In addition, geographical location as well as ownership structure seem to impact engagement. These findings lead us to our main recommendation of developing partnerships across the sector to overcome clear barriers to engaging with the SDGs.

Airlines could play an important role in achieving these as they facilitate air travel, offer employment opportunities, and provide other socio-economic benefits. On the other hand, air travel generates a series of socially and environmentally adverse effects. Finding a way to magnify the positive impacts and mitigate the negative ones is crucial given the projected growth of this sector. Action towards the SDGs might be a path forward but at present little is known about how individual airlines engage with the SDGs, a gap this research seeks to fill. Using the membership of the International Air Transportation Association (nearly 300 airlines), we examine airline reports, websites, and other published documents for explicit mention of the SDGs. Findings indicate that ∼30% of airlines show various levels of engagement and ∼50% refer to sustainability more broadly. Combining these results with a wide range of variables related to airline action and basic descriptors as well as government policy and regulation, we find that existing sustainability related actions taken by airlines (e.g., reporting to prominent sustainability indices and producing a CSR report) are strongly correlated with higher levels of SDG engagement. In addition, geographical location as well as ownership structure seem to impact engagement. These findings lead us to our main recommendation of developing partnerships across the sector to overcome clear barriers to engaging with the SDGs.   Keywords UN SDGs  Aviation  Sustainability  Reporting  Industry partnerships    1 Introduction In September 2015, United Nation Member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a 15-year framework centered on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the face of unprecedented global social, environmental, and economic challenges, this commitment marks a historic turn of events in collaboration of the global community. The agenda commits to a more prosperous and resilient future where the three dimensions of sustainable development are advanced in a balanced and integrated way, ‘leaving no one behind’ (United Nations Sustainable Development Group, 2022 ). Successful achievement of the SDGs demands progressive and systematic partnerships with the private sector. To date, there are several sectors that have actively been engaged with the SDGs. The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) lists just under 14,000 companies which have committed to take actions from various industry sectors globally including: Oil and Gas, Chemical, Food and Beverage, Automobiles, Financial Services, Natural Resources, Telecommunications, Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Construction, Technology and Healthcare (United Nations Global Compact, 2019 ). However, in committing to support the SDGs, aviation trails behind in their support with approximately twenty airlines being active in their commitment to the SDGs through the UNGC (United Nations Global Compact, 2019 ) . The lack of involvement from the aviation sector through the UNGC is particularly problematic as the sector is in a unique position to support the achievement of virtually all the SDGs, including those associated with economic and social development, connecting goods with markets, supporting agricultural productivity and access to services (Air Transport Action Group, 2019 ). It should be noted that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic which spelled disaster for the aviation sector (IATA, 2020b ) there is a renewed focus on some aspects of sustainability and the SDGs as the sector begins to rebound. For example, at the 2021 International Air Transport Association (IATA) General Meeting, those gathered committed to striving towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2025 (IATA, 2021 ), which is clearly linked to SDG 13 – Climate Action. This suggests the time is right to begin big conversations in the sector around engagement with the SDGs and sustainability. 1.1 Implications Given that there is relatively little known about how airlines themselves engage with the SDG framework or the individual goals, and because the sector is increasingly acknowledging its role in sustainability-related issues, this research is timely and important. The study builds upon work by Tegizbekova (2019)  and the Air Transport Aviation Group (ATAG) (2017) who suggest that 15 of the 17 SDGs are relevant and material to airlines and are places they could help advance global efforts. It is the first study to systematically look at individual airlines in the context of the SDGs and does so with two main objectives:i. To Fill the knowledge gap about individual airline engagement with the SDGs and to understand factors influencing different levels of engagement, and  ii. To provide recommendations based upon the results that can further grow this engagement across the sector.    We have narrowed our focus to IATA members to align with the global scope of the SDGs and because our focus here is not on national approaches, but rather on action by airlines themselves. This paper proceeds in four parts. First, a review of relevant literature is provided focusing on the aviation sector's existing action on issues relating to sustainability, including previous work on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and environmental reporting by airlines. We then proceed to outline our methodology, which focused on data collection from IATA members and statistical analysis of relationships between different factors influencing action and engagement with the SDGs. The results are then presented alongside an analysis and then the article finishes with some concluding thoughts and recommendations to improve airline engagement with the SDGs.   2 Background and literature 2.1 Aviation and sustainability impacts While air travel facilitates international business, enables citizens to connect with each other and travel the world, and is at the core of the economic future of many countries, the social value from this sector is largely untapped, and the negative environmental impacts widely uncontrolled. Airlines are essential for global business and tourism and play a vital role in facilitating economic growth and generating employment opportunities. Prior to the pandemic, the total economic impact of the aviation industry was estimated to be some 3.6 per cent of the world's GDP, USD  2.7 trillion, which supports 65.5 million jobs worldwide (Air Transport Action Group, 2018 ). We also know that air transport contributes to positive social change through, for example, improving the quality of life by broadening people's leisure and cultural experiences and it provides social value through capabilities to visit distant friends and tour the world (Air Transport Action Group, 2004 ). Furthermore, airlines facilitate the transport of goods and services to locations that are otherwise inaccessible. Air cargo is essential to many facets of modern life, for example in northern Canada or small island developing states where many citizens live in remote locations (Widener et al., 2017 ). Yet, such benefits do not come without costs. For starters, many studies have found that actual air travel is only engaged in by a small percentage of the population (CNBC, 2017 ; Göosling et al., 2009 ) and that those who do travel by air have higher incomes (Brand and Boardman, 2008 ; Brand and Preston, 2010 ; Gössling et al., 2020 ; Korbetis et al., 2006 ) leaving us with a situation of inequity where the number of people enjoying the benefits of air travel is low while the entire planet and its population bear the consequences of these frequent, and increasing, flights and associated emissions. For example, Gössling and Humpe (2020)  demonstrate that the difference between low-income countries and high-income countries in terms of flights averaged over the population is 0.03 per person compared to 2.02 per person. They go on to clarify, that even within countries, distribution is not equal and cite numerous surveys showing percentages of the adult population that do not fly in high-income countries often exceeds 50% (Gössling and Humpe, 2020 ). In essence, the sector as it stands contributes to inequities of benefits and consequences, something which must be addressed to truly progress towards the SDGs. Further, energy use and emissions from air transport have increased significantly and this trend is only expected to increase. While economic benefits are widely acknowledged, the potential social benefits and the negative environmental consequences of the aviation sector are much more poorly understood and must be considered to align the sector with the SDGs. From a health perspective, aircraft pollution and noise negatively impact the health of residents in the vicinity of airports and under flight paths (Schubert et al., 2019 ). Specifically, chronic aircraft noise can impair cognitive development and cardiovascular health in children (Van et al., 2003 ) and influence cardiovascular disease and strokes (Correia et al., 2013 ; Hansell et al., 2014 ; Kempen et al., 2018 ; Seidler et al., 2017 ). Further, excessive noise interferes with people's daily activities at school, at work, at home and during leisure time. It can disturb sleep, cause cardiovascular and psychophysiological effects, reduce performance, and provoke annoyance responses and changes in social behaviour (World Health Organization, 2019 ). Environmentally, the most recognized sustainability challenges of the sector relate to climate change and air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2017) estimates that aircraft emissions of carbon dioxide represent 2.4 percent of total fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide or two percent of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. However, Rothengatter (2010)  argues that airlines are apportioned 6 percent of the blame when other GHG are also considered. They cite the fact that commercial aircraft fly at altitudes of 8–13 km, with the effect that emissions in the upper atmosphere could have greater impact than the emissions at ground level. In addition, the airline industry has been cited for the lack of reuse and recycling of its on-flight products. Research by IATA indicates that the airline sector generated 5.7 million tonnes of cabin waste in 2017 (IATA, 2018 ). Further, the impacts of airlines are not limited to the aircrafts themselves. Land use by airports is also significant. Land take (the utilization of land by airports for the purpose of building and operating airport related activities) is commonly associated with the destruction of habitats and natural ecosystems and the building process can have significant environmental impacts through the contamination of groundwater and erosion of land (International Airport Review, 2019 ). Additionally, de-icing and anti-icing is commonly performed to remove or prevent frost, snow or ice from accumulating on aircraft surfaces or paved areas including runways and when performed, especially without discharge controls in place, can result in adverse environmental and human health impacts (Environmental Protection Agency, 2000 ).  2.2 Current action to address sustainability impacts from aviation As evidenced above, the aviation sector clearly has the potential to impact sustainability, and as a result, the UN SDGs, in both positive and negative ways. This is certainly not a new idea, though historically there has been lethargy within the sector to engage in actions addressing some of these challenges. That the international community charged the ICAO with the task of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from international flights in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and it was not until 2015 that there was agreement over a large-scale mechanism - the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) - is clear evidence of this. That said, there has been some action that deserves recognition and can provide useful insights, before we dig more deeply into the engagement of individual airlines with the SDGs. The focus here is twofold: on the use of environmental/CSR reporting by airlines and existing action on sustainability or the SDGs by the sector. 2.2.1 Aviation sector and environmental reporting Literature on airline reporting, engagement, and action with the SDGS is limited, with the notable exception of Tegizbekova (2019)  who examines aviation's impact on sustainable development and its role in realizing the UN SDGs. According to Tegizbekova (2019) , aviation's role in facilitating the global mobility system makes it a critical player in realizing sustainable development. However, aviation also contributes to a trajectory of unsustainable development, through intensive fossil fuel use and the release of greenhouse gas emissions, air-traffic fatalities, as well as noise and air pollution. Tegizbekova argues that the UN SDGs provide an excellent framework and roadmap for the aviation sector to advance its delivery of environmental, social and economic benefits by demonstrating its inherent contribution to a subset of the goals. However, the article does not detail the current strategies undertaken by airlines in working towards this development pathway. There is much more known about sustainability and aviation more generally (Lutte and Bartle, 2017 ) and also sustainability or CSR reporting by airlines (see, for example: Chang et al., 2015 ; Cowper-Smith and de Grosbois, 2011 ; Karaman et al., 2018 ; Kemp and Vinke, 2012 ; Lynes and Andrachuk, 2008 ; Mak and Chan, 2006 ; Stevenson and Marintseva, 2019 ). While the broader ideas around sustainability of the aviation sector are certainly important and worth further study, the focus here is on engagement with the SDGs measured by reporting and statements made by airlines, so the literature on CSR and environmental reporting is more closely aligned and is presented below. In analysing recurring themes around motivations for airlines to engage with CSR reporting, creating a positive environmental image ranked high in importance. Lynes and Andrachuk (2008)  focus on its impact related to government and industry bodies while others are more focused on image and benefits from customers and investors (D'Amore, 1992 ; Graham et al., 2005 ; Karaman and Akman, 2018 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ; Lynes and Dredge, 2006 ). Lee and Park (2016)  found that a sustainable brand can be a significant driver in the business performance of airlines, which could serve as a motive for the engagement with CSR reporting as well. Perception of employees is an additional motivating factor (see, for example, Graham et al., 2005 ; Ilkhanizadeh and Karatepe, 2017 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ; Upadhaya et al., 2018 , among others). Efficiency gains was another theme that emerged in the literature related to reporting and included reduced long-term costs through investments in energy conservation, water conservation and waste reduction. According to Herremans et al. (2011) , efficiency gains are an important motivating factor for both improvements in performance and the reporting of performance as ensuring proper monitoring and management of environmental impacts can lead to controls that reduce costs and improve value for a firm. In addition, the role of government should not be underestimated as a motivating factor for reporting by airlines. According to Kuo et al. (2016) , airline representatives believe that government is the most important reader of CSR reports and evaluator of environmental performance. Several other authors also highlight that government will be a key player in promoting sustainability in the airline sector (Coles et al., 2014 ; Hooper and Lever, 2002 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ). Some of the main barriers to the use of environmental and CSR reporting relate to data collection (Kuo et al., 2016 ) and definitions and content reported (Coles et al., 2014 ; Cowper-Smith and de Grosbois, 2011 ; Herremans et al., 2011 ; Hooper and Lever, 2002 ; Karaman and Akman, 2018 ) as well as definitions of the suite of functions embraced by the term “airline” (Graham et al., 2005 ). Of course, this leads to a lot of difficulty with comparability of data, as Hooper and Greenall (2005)  found in their analysis of IATA member airlines environmental reporting. An additional barrier to CSR reporting in the airline sector is the perception that it is very time consuming and requires a lot of resources, making it difficult to justify the value of the report (Kuo et al., 2016 ). As a result, CSR reporting is not seen by many as a priority action.  2.2.2 Airlines sector and SDGs While the extent to which aviation companies themselves are actually engaging with the SDGs is uncertain, the broader sector has not been completely inactive as it relates to these same themes. In fact, there are several examples of developments in frameworks for sustainable aviation. In October 2017, the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) released ‘Flying in Formation’, a report providing suggestions for how individual aviation industry organizations can contribute to the SDGs and sustainable development. According to the report, the global aviation sector has a role to play in 15 of the 17 SDGs, some with much more significant influence (Air Transport Action Group, 2017 ). This report is evidence that corporate social responsibility and sustainability reporting is becoming a priority within the global airline community, specifically in relation to the SDGs. Further, together with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), IATA and the International Airlines Group created a sector-specific reporting handbook connected to the SDGs called the “Airline Sustainability Reporting Handbook” (IATA, 2020a ). It remains to be seen whether these initiatives have been successful in stimulating action by airline companies themselves. ICAO has also been active in promoting and monitoring progress towards the SDGs and has a vision to achieve sustainable growth of the global civil aviation system to support SDG targets (ICAO, n.d. ). Accordingly, ICAO has set strategic objectives to advance sustainability within the global aviation sector, making strong connections to 15 of the 17 SDGs, with the exception of SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation and SDG 14 – Life Below Water. These strategic objectives are used to guide ICAO in promoting the global airline sector's adoption of the SDGs. This is in addition to the active work being done by ICAO with regards to climate change (SDG 13), and specifically their recent implementation of CORSIA (ICAO, 2016 ). Further, as an official observer on the Inter-agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators, ICAO continuously contributes to monitoring efforts to determine progress towards SDG targets (ICAO, n.d. ). The challenge here is that ICAO has limited enforcement ability on airlines themselves, rather they work with countries which in turn work with aviation companies operating in their jurisdiction. While the SDGs are an excellent guide to promote sustainability in the aviation sector, they have also been met with criticism. According to some authors, the SDGs lack specificity and clarity which makes them difficult to interpret, implement and monitor (Kenny, 2015 ; Nyasimi and Peake, 2015 ). The authors claim the goals and accompanying targets are confusing and use ambiguous language that could be constructed more clearly. Several authors also claim the SDGs are overly ambitious, encompassing a broad and unrealistic agenda (Easterly, 2015 ; The Economist, 2015 ; Swain, 2018 ). Similar criticisms focus on the finance gap and the impractical investments required to achieve the goals, specifically for developing countries who lack the capacity (Campaginolo et al., 2015 ; Lagoarde-Segot, 2020 ). The reality of this criticism is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals Progress Chart published in 2021, highlighting that several goals are not adequately progressing, if not deteriorating at a global scale (United Nation, 2021 ). Further criticisms point towards the belief that economic growth fulfils socio-economic goals, while simultaneously hindering environmental goals within the SDGs. The inconsistency between ecological sustainability and socio-economic progression has been cited by several authors (Jorgenson, 2010 ; Nyasimi and Peake, 2015 ; Pao and Tsai, 2010 ). However, Forsyth (2011)  argues that environmental and financial sustainability can be achieved together in the air transport industry through developments in climate change policy. While the SDGs are universal, comprehensive, and transformative, they are also constrained by the above characteristics. Yet despite these criticisms, the international community has chosen to rally around them in the pursuit of sustainable development and that the aviation sector has demonstrated some indication - at least at the broad, sectoral and international level - of the importance of airlines working towards SDGs. That said, the actual uptake of these ideas from airlines remains somewhat unknown and that is what the remainder of this article investigates.    3 Methods This research looks at the engagement of individual aviation companies with the UN SDGs and, further, considers factors which may influence this engagement. In order to provide the most robust results, we chose to canvass and collect data from all IATA member airlines because at any given time, this organization represents approximately 80% of total air traffic (IATA, n.d. ). When our data collection began in April of 2020, the IATA membership list included 299 member airlines (IATA, n.d. ). With a vision to shape the future growth of a safe, secure, and sustainable air transport industry, member airlines were identified as study participants of great importance. In addition, airlines across the international landscape were chosen because to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies to date exploring the relationship between the SDGs and airlines on this scale. Using IATA members as our starting point, we conducted an extensive scan of the companies’ web pages, annual reports, CSR/Sustainability reports and other official documentation published by the member airlines. This is methodologically similar to previous work done on the aviation sector (Cowper-Smith and de Grosbois, 2011 ; Kemp and Vinke, 2012 ; Kılkıs and Kılkıs, 2016 ). While it is certainly possible companies are undertaking actions not available in these sources, given what we know about the role of environmental and sustainability action in terms of investor, customer, and employee demands and image perception (detailed in section 2.2.1 ), it seems likely that any actions on sustainability and the SDGs would be promoted by the airline as a way of putting their best foot forward. To determine airline values on our SDG engagement scale, we used available data on SDG engagement presented by IATA members themselves in their publicly available materials. Using this data, two members of the research team analyzed and assigned engagement levels for all 299 of the airlines. Where there was disagreement, they discussed their choices and came to a decision which was consistent with the rest of the ranking. Engagement was classified on a scale of 0–3 with the major distinguishing factors being evidence of/language around action/initiatives and evidence of measurement/tracking of metrics. Airlines assigned a value of ‘0’ had no visible action/measurement of action with regards to the UN SDGs and 3 being assigned to those both action and measurement (the categories of 1 and 2 fall in the middle). It was the quality and depth of engagement with the SDGs, rather than quantity or number of SDGs engaged with, that was assessed for all airlines. For example, where an airline discloses both actions and progress on 3 SDGs, and another does so for 5 SDGs, both airlines would receive the same score given the advanced level of engagement with the SDGs they have identified as those they are able to have the greatest impact upon. Airlines' engagement scores were strictly determined based on their integration of SDGs into company reporting. Considerations of other sustainability issues identified by airlines through materiality assessments were beyond the scope of this paper and was not factored into an airline's assigned score. Importantly, airlines that are members of the UNGC automatically were rated at least '1' on the scale, but their exact score depended on their depth and quality of engagement with the SDGs. That said, scoring above '0' did not necessarily require UNGC membership as some airlines are highely active in terms of the SDGs but are not UNGC members. See Table 1   for more details on how the categorization was done. A variety of independent variables were used to get a better understanding of what may be influencing higher levels of engagement with the SDGs. Based upon existing research which has found a relationship between environmental reporting by airlines and positive environmental image (e.g. D'Amore, 1992 ; Karaman and Akman, 2018 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ), we concluded that ownership structure as well as size of airline (measured by fleet size)1  1 Finding fleet size data was difficult for many airlines, so we supplemented fleet size data found on airline websites with reported fleet size data on the website www.planespotters.net . In the case of three airlines, fleet size data was only available on Wikipedia and therefore this was the source used.   was an important variable to investigate since public companies as well as those which are large may well be more concerned with their image. Size of airline might also relate to capacity and resources which connect to reported challenges around data collection generally (Kuo et al., 2016 ). Government factors have been shown to influence environment and CSR reporting by airlines (Coles et al., 2014 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ; Hooper and Lever, 2002 ) so two variables were chosen to help understand if such a relationship exists with SDG engagement. To that end, the presence of a government mandate for CSR reporting and the presence of a national SDG strategy, both in the airlines home country were chosen as they relate to the SDGs and reporting and also government pressure. Data for the two government action variables was drawn from the Voluntary National Reviews on the UN Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform and government webpages, respectively. Finally, a set of variables related to existing action in sustainability and environmental reporting were chosen to better understand whether challenges with data collection, definitions, and content (Hooper and Greenall, 2005 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ) might be overcome by existing engagement in similar areas. These variables include whether the airline currently publishes a CSR report, the existing use of sustainability reporting frameworks (Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)) and clear mention of sustainability claims on the airline website. Geography is also clearly important for such a global industry, so home continent of the airline was also included as a further independent variable. Using the described variables, and based upon existing research, we hypothesize that higher levels of engagement with the SDGs would be present in airlines more concerned about corporate reputation which we might think of as being publicly owned and/or large airlines. In addition, the role of government requirements, interventions, or mandates might well indicate an increase in engagement by airlines. Efficiency gains and cost reductions are clearly important motivators, though differences between airlines in this area are more challenging to consider. In terms of barriers, we might expect to see more engagement with the SDGs by those familiar with other forms of sustainability or reporting action as they might already have employees dedicated to similar practices. Again, size of airline (in this case likely related to the number of resources available) might also be a relevant factor. We test these ideas below in our empirical study. Basic descriptive statistics and results were first completed and then to provide a closer examination of the correlates of airline SDG engagement, we use ordinal probit regression models to determine relationships. Ordinal regression is used because the dependent variable has a natural order, but not necessarily equivalent increases in degree. Conducing a multivariate regression analysis is important because some of the variates are quite likely to be confounded – for example, few North American airline are state-owned, and European countries are much more likely to have reporting mandates. To do this we run a set of four regression models with our dependent variable being engagement with SDGs.  The first model, ‘airline demographics’, investigates this variable alongside independent demographic variables of the airlines (size, ownership, geographical location) . The second model adds actions taken at the national level (mandated CSR reporting, national SDG strategy)  – here we call it ‘country action.’ Model three, or ‘airline action’, includes variables related to other sustainability actions an airline could be doing, including producing a CSR report, having reference to sustainability on their website, and mentioning/using a sustainability reporting framework.  The final ‘full’ model brings all the independent variables together to evaluate their impact on the dependent variable.  4 Results & analysis Results indicate that the majority of IATA member airlines are not engaged with the UN SDGs. That is, 213 (71.2%) of airlines are coded as ‘0’ – no engagement, or having no action or measurement connected to the SDGs. This is in comparison to 18 (6%) which are considered to have minimal engagement, 20 (6.7%) moderate engagement and 48 (16.1%) with high engagement. Interestingly, Arampou et al. (2019)  found a similarly low degree of engagement with the SDGs in their analysis of the banking sector. This same study also found engagement was focused on specific SDGs – SDG 4, SDG 8, and SDG 16 (Avrampou et al., 2019 )– which suggests industry effects in SDG disclosure and engagement. Conducting a similar analysis, we also find evidence for industry effects with results showing the SDGS that were most common were SDGs 1: No poverty, SDG 3: Good Health & Wellbeing, and SDG 13: Climate Action (66 mentions each); followed by SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth (63 mentions); and finally, SDG 2: No hunger and SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production (61 mentions each). While Tegizbekova (2019)  notes which SDG indicators under each goal are relevant to the aviation industry, the article does not note which are of highest priority to airlines, so our findings begin to unpack some of these issues of priority and materiality. The emphasis on SDG 13 is not surprising, given that attention has been paid for some time to aviation's contribution to climate change (for example, one of the first well known pieces of work on this topic was published almost 25 years ago (IPCC, 1999 ) and increasingly there are calls for further action to reduce the impact of this sector on global GHG emissions (e.g., IATA, 2021 ; Renshaw, 2021 )). Focus on SDG 8 is not surprising given the emphasis that is often placed upon employment in the sector and the sector's contribution to global GDP. SDG 12 might more clearly align with recent concern about waste onboard flights (IATA, 2019 ). While SDG 1, 2 and 3 do not seem as clearly connected, the ATAG has suggested that in the case of SDG 3 the sector may have broad influence and with SDG 1 and 2 that aviation can provide support functions despite limited direct involvement (2017). In addition to SDGs 8, 12, and 13 (discussed above) there are a number of goals which the ATAG identifies as fully relevant to the sector – SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities – which do not show up in our results in terms of goals most commonly mentioned. Considering this breakdown, it seems those engaging with the SDGs are considering both ways which they can engage with the socio-economic SDGs that seek to improve conditions (poverty and hunger for example) and environmental SDGs that look to reduce the impact of the sector through, for example, action on climate change and increasing responsible consumption. Expanding our investigation to looking at mentions of sustainability more broadly, we see close to 50% of IATA airlines do this (n = 140, 46.8%). This means perhaps, that there is more of an appetite for the use of SDGs than it appears at first glance. Why those engaged with sustainability are not actively using or acting on the SDGs is something we consider below. Analysis of initial descriptive statistics also show clear differences in airline demographics, existing action on environmental/sustainability factors, and actions within home countries of airlines (Table 2   provides details). For example, public ownership of airlines is the most common form of ownership structure with twenty more airlines operating in this fashion than the next largest category which is state-owned. Asia has by far the largest number of airlines. In terms of airline action, whether companies mention sustainability on their websites is almost evenly divided between yes (∼47%) and no (∼53%). This contrasts with the other two airline action measures which show that airlines engaged with an existing sustainability reporting framework represent ∼34% of the total and those that do not represent ∼66% and those producing a CSR report are 37% of the total and those that do not are 63%. Interestingly, almost all airlines are headquartered in countries with a national SDG strategy (∼92%) whereas only 35% of airlines are headquartered in countries with CSR reporting mandates. Next, we show a series of bar charts (Figs. 1-3    ) to look at the relationship between the airline demographic variables and the dependent variable of engagement. Notably, the modal category is No Engagement (0) in almost all cases. However, there are also some clear differences across categories: public airlines and large airlines, are more engaged with SDGs than any other ownership structure (Fig. 1 ) or size (Fig. 2 ). Airlines in Europe and in South America are also more engaged than those in other parts of the world. Oceania also has higher engagement, although this only includes 15 airlines (see Table 2 ). We then estimate a set of four multivariate ordinal probit models with engagement with SDGs  as the dependent variable.  As detailed in the methods section, there are four models estimated (Table 3  ). In terms of key findings, first, let us turn to some of the airline demographics and focus on the impact of ownership. Ownership type, specifically, being a public corporation, is clearly important. Fig. 1  provides a visual depiction of the differences in SDG engagement across the different ownership structures and demonstrates that publicly owned companies clearly have higher engagement than the other ownership structures. In terms of the models, in two of the four there is a statistically significant relationship between all types of ownership and increased engagement in the SDGs, and in the other two models with additional controls, only “Other” is statistically significant. Public is the reference category, and the other coefficients are of similar (negative) magnitude. This tells us that public airlines are more highly engaged with the UN SDGs than the others, but when controlling for other airline actions related to sustainability/CSR, ownership structure is no longer significant. The fact that publicly owned airlines are the most engaged with SDGs supports previous findings about motivations for airlines to engage with other forms of environmental action, such as reporting. That is, pressure from consumers and investors is certainly a key factor in these decisions (D'Amore, 1992 ; Graham et al., 2005 ; Karaman and Akman, 2018 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ; Lynes and Dredge, 2006 ) and it seems this is also quite possibly the case here. Even though UN member states have adopted these goals and the majority of countries represented in our data do have national SDG strategies in place, state-owned airlines show essentially the same level of engagement as private ones. In terms of geographical location, one striking finding was that across all models, companies based in North America showed levels of engagement statistically significantly lower than those in Europe (the reference category). While airlines in Asia and Africa are also less engaged than European airlines, North American airlines clearly show the lowest engagement of any region. In related research on airport reporting activity, results from both Karagiannis et al. (2019) , and Skouloudis et al. (2012)  demonstrate partial geographic agreement with this data. Karagiannis et al. (2019)  find that Europe and Asia are where airports with high reporting activity can be found. Skouloudis et al. (2012)  also found that Europe and North America are the locations of airports with CSR reports. The consistent finding here is that Europe seems to have higher levels of reporting on sustainability and CSR within their airports (Karagiannis et al., 2019 ; Skouloudis et al., 2012 ) as well as having airlines with higher engagement with the SDGs as demonstrated by the results of this research. That Europe has higher levels of engagement could be linked to ideas of legitimacy theory which considers companies operating within the societal norms (Guthrie and Parker, 1989 ) since it is well known that Europe tends to be more advanced in terms of action on sustainability (see, for example the results of the 2020 Environmental Performance Index where the top 11 countries are all found in Europe while Canada ranks 20th and the United States 24th (Wendling et al., 2020 )). The conflicting geographic findings between results of airline engagement and existing research on airline reporting could have to do with the type of travel on airlines headquartered in different locations. For example, business travellers may care less about SDG engagement of the airline they are travelling on (since they are often less engaged with the overall travelling process where their trips tend to be managed by others (Leiper et al., 2008 )) and this might then reduce the desire of these airlines to actively engage if they are not getting benefits of positive environmental/sustainability images (e.g. something we know does influence airlines in terms of airline reporting (Karaman and Akman, 2018 ; Lee and Park, 2016 )). In this context, it is relevant that in a study of business tourism spending across the G20, the top three countries in terms of spending in 2019 and 2020 are the United States (North America), Japan (Asia) and China (Asia) (Statistica, 2022 ). This might help explain the findings that airlines headquartered in both North America and Asia are shown to have lower engagement than those in Europe (though EU countries combined are considered to be the second largest spender). Relatedly, we might have expected that airlines in South America have higher levels of engagement than other parts of the world due to their tourism focus on natural and environmental sites and experiences (e.g. Patagonia, the Amazon, the Galapagos Islands) which might be something which airlines seek to align themselves with and/or issues of environment and sustainability might be more material to these airlines. That said, we did not find a statistically significant difference between engagement in Europe versus South America. Further, airlines in Africa are also shown to have lower engagement scores relative to Europe, and in some of the models, this relationship is significant. This may well have to do with capacity challenges in terms of being able to actively engage in reporting and action on SDGs (we know that many African countries are being provided assistance through the CORSIA Buddy Partnerships program to help align them with CORSIA reporting requirements) (ICAO, 2019b ) Clearly it is possible that a number of factors are at play here which are influencing the different levels of engagement between continents – further discussion on this as a factor influencing SDG engagement could be the focus of additional research. Turning to country-level variables, we find no clear relationship between SDG engagement and a country having a national SDG strategy. While bivariate models show a relationship between SDG engagement and each country action variable – mandated CSR reporting (p = 0.005) and national SDG strategy (p = 0.014) - neither are statistically significant in either Model 3, with limited ‘demographic’ controls, nor in Model 4 with additional variables. Despite previous research that identified the role of government as a significant motivating factor in reporting for airlines (Kılıç et al., 2019 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ), there is limited evidence of that effect here. This is perhaps not surprising, though, given the climate change adaptation and mitigation goals and plans which nations and the international community have had in place for years, and yet the lethargic movement of the airline sector in this same area. This suggests that government targets are no guarantee of progress. Further, it is possible that the government SDG strategy has not been able to clearly connect with airlines and therefore there is difficulty in trying to understand actions that could be taken and how to report. Jurisdictional complexities may also play a role in the seemingly sluggish uptake of the SDGs by airlines. While our research here is unable to unpack this question further, additional investigation using surveys or interviews with aviation sector members could go a long way towards understanding this gap. Finally, existing airline actions are examined in Model 3 and the full Model 4, and both show a clear positive relationship between a number of existing actions being taken by the airline and level of engagement with the SDGs. These include the production of a CSR report as well as using/making mention of existing sustainability reporting frameworks and the presence of sustainability material on the company website. The analysis above shows that companies which already issue CSR reports are more engaged with the SDGs. This relationship is statistically significant in both models where this variable is included. The related variable of reporting to/mentioning use of one of five key internationally recognized sustainability reporting frameworks (GRI, DJSI, TCFD, SASB, CDP) had strong statistically significant relationships with higher engagement in both Model 3 and 4. The presence of sustainability-related material on company websites is also shown to have a statistically significant relationship with SDG engagement level. To examine these results in more detail, Fig. 4   plots the marginal effects. We look at three variables2  2 Plots for ownership, fleet size, and geography are not shown here since most of the categories are not statistically significant in the full model but are available in the appendix. The general conclusion, of clear difference between engagement and non-engagement but not higher levels of engagement, is the same as the variables here.   that are statistically significant in the full model (Reporting Frameworks, CSR Report, and Website Sustainability), and show average marginal effects (other variables set to their means). These are generated using the results of Model 4, and therefore control for the airline demographic and country-level variables. The plots show the effect of the variable on the probability of each level of SDG engagement. For example, having a CSR report is negatively correlated with not engaging with the SDGs at all, but there is not much difference in the probability of higher levels of SDG engagement. This pattern is quite similar across the different variables: they do a good job explaining the difference between SDG engagement (1+) and non-engagement (0) but are less useful for explaining the distinction between some and high engagement. To be clear, there is variation in SDG engagement, with some airlines more engaged than others, but the results show that the factors examined here are not more strongly correlated with high engagement than moderate engagement (controlling for other variables). Consistent with the discussion above, the marginal effects of having sustainability discussed on the website is smaller in magnitude, though still significant, while Reporting Frameworks and CSR Reporting have larger and roughly equal effects. The results presented in Fig. 4  fit with what we know about identified barriers and opportunities for the airline sector to engage in CSR or environmental reporting. Specifically, one identified barrier to CSR reporting is resources and challenges of expertise (Kuo et al., 2016 ; Sheldon and Park, 2011 ), so it does seem to make sense that those who overcame these barriers feel better equipped to move beyond CSR reporting and to begin to step into a new form of sustainability engagement. Still, Karagiannis et al. (2019)  discovered that CSR reporting in the aviation sector has proliferated with the passage of time, peaking at over 100 CSR reports published in 2016. Yet despite the expansion, they determined it is not a widespread practice, finding only 38/1280 international airports published a CSR report on the GRI's database in 2017. However, they also found there is an increasing trend to issue CSR reports that do not comply with GRI's guidelines or just follow GRI's guidelines as a general guide. Similarly, Skouloudis et al. (2012)  found that CSR reporting is not a common practice among international airports and where it is done, there is considerable variability in the disclosure practices. That said, this is certainly something which must be further investigated, if the SDGs are to be successful, as currently only 37% of airlines publish CSR reports and even less, 34% are engaged with sustainability reporting. In summary, it appears that existing sustainability reporting, production of a CSR report, sustainability on the website, geographical location and to a lesser extent, public ownership, significantly influence engagement with the UN SDGs. These factors are linked to engagement vs non-engagement, but do not clearly differentiate between higher levels of engagement. On the other hand, being headquartered in a country with a national SDG strategy does not show a statistically significant correlation with SDG engagement, and neither does the presence of mandated CSR reporting.  5 Conclusion At a time when the aviation sector is trying to relaunch following the crippling impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been calls from academics (Dube et al., 2021 ; Gössling et al., 2020 ) and organizations alike (IATA, 2021 ) for the sector to build back more sustainability and considering the UN SDGs. Further, research and organizational guidance demonstrate a clear connection between the aviation sector and the UN SDGs (e.g., Air Transport Action Group, 2017 ; ICAO, n.d. ; Tegizbekova, 2019 ) but what is not clear is how the aviation sector – specifically individual airlines themselves – is reacting to these goals, and specifically if and how they are engaging with them. The only clear indicator of this is the knowledge that ~20 airlines are members of the UNGC and if this is the extent of engagement by the sector with the SDGs, that means ∼6% engagement, which is troubling especially given the emphasis on moving the entire sector towards these goals. The research presented in this article is a first step in filling this knowledge gap around engagement by airlines with the SDGs. Our findings show that 29% of airlines are engaged with the SDGs at varying levels (6% loosely engaged, 7% moderately engaged, and 16% very engaged) which is at a higher level than if we considered only those with membership in the UNGC. But these findings also clearly demonstrate that there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of further engagement by the sector with the SDGs. What is promising, though, is that approximately 50% of airlines do have some mention of sustainability more broadly on their website and in their publicly accessible reports, demonstrating an interest from a larger group within the sector. With the right encouragement and support, we might expect these airlines to move towards engagement with the SDGs. It is the remaining half of the airlines where the real challenge seems to be which brings us to a main recommendation of this research: developing partnerships across the sector. Other key findings also support the recommendation for developing partnerships. For example, we found that existing experience in environmental reporting and/or sustainability actions more generally are strongly correlated with increased SDG engagement and that the big gap is between no engagement at all and some level of engagement, not between the different levels of engagement. This is not surprising given that we know barriers to environmental reporting in general exist around data collection (Kuo et al., 2016 ) and if an airline has already overcome such a challenge, modifying focus or adding other factors for analysis may well be easier than for those with no experience. Partnerships between those already engaged in these types of action and those lagging behind could well increase overall sectoral engagement. Again, this finding aligns with ideas of partnerships across airlines where those with experience could perhaps guide those lagging. Further, results indicate a relationship between location of airlines and SDG engagement – that is, airlines headquartered in Europe are shown to be more engaged than others, again an indication that there could be lessons learned transferred from one group of airlines to another. 5.1 Policy and practice recommendations As already established, this study finds a key connection between existing environmental reporting/sustainability practices and current SDG engagement, suggesting that overcoming initial barriers to data collection and resource constraints which previous authors have identified as being detrimental to environmental reporting generally (Hooper and Greenall, 2005 ; Kuo et al., 2016 ) can allow better engagement with the SDG goals and targets. In practice this could look like training and education targeting airlines with limited resources as well as partnerships between airline leaders and laggards. Neither are particularly unique suggestions generally (Herremans et al., 2011 ) nor specifically within the sector (ICAO, 2019a ) and yet the results could be significant if clear emphasis was placed on SDG engagement. Practically speaking, the infrastructure does seem to exist – through industry networks such as IATA – to help facilitate such an approach. We know that the complexities of reporting and the financial and personnel resources it takes to understand and constantly report on commitments and actions is a major barrier for airlines, therefore having guidance and help from those who already engage in such actions seems likely to help minimize or at least reduce some of these challenges. This may well look like public airlines, airlines leading the way in CSR reporting, or those from Europe being paired with others as we see their level of engagement is significantly higher, but despite the likely differences in these types of operations, a standardized reporting and action framework, should lead to easier partnerships and teaching-learning relationships. Interestingly, the idea of partnerships is also well-embedded in the SDGs themselves with SDG 17 calling for global partnerships, so this approach can be seen to connect to the overall global goals. It should also be noted that given what previous studies have found about challenges faced by airlines with regards to environmental reporting generally (Kuo et al., 2016 ), and the SDGs more specifically (Kenny, 2015 ; Nyasimi and Peake, 2015 ), ensuring the SDG reporting framework is clearly focused on the aviation sector is critical so those using it are best equipped to understand and engage. It is true that in 2019 the GRI developed the ‘Airline Sustainability Reporting Handbook’ which is sectoral guidance for the sector on sustainability that includes the SDGs, yet it is still possible that the expertise required to use this reporting framework might be challenging for airlines, especially those which are smaller and have less experience. One potential work around is that the sector might start to think about focusing on goals and targets which have relatively easy reporting metrics and are more material to airlines and then build expertise to others which are more difficult. With the adoption of CORSIA by ICAO, reporting on greenhouse gas emissions and SDG 13 is becoming standard, so this is a logical starting point to build off.  5.2 Future research extensions This research presents just a beginning look at airline-specific engagement with the SDGs and the results importantly point to key directions for future research. Specifically, the variables used in this study are useful in explaining engagement with SDGs, but as the results show, they are less useful in understanding what causes airlines to increase their engagement to higher levels. Given this, future research might explore other ways to define and measure SDG engagement. Further, various other extensions are possible including the inclusion of domestic only operators in order to give an even more comprehensive picture of the sector's engagement with these global goals. In addition, future research could also consider those goals most material to aviation which could be defined based upon this study's findings of most commonly mentioned SDGs (SDG 1, 2, 3, 8, 12,13) or another metric such as ATAG's scale of direct global relevance (with SDGs 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 identified as being fully relevant) (Air Transport Action Group, 2017 ). In addition, the study could also extend to other aspects of the air transport system, including airports. In so doing research could employ a similar empirical model of looking at airport engagement of the SDGs perhaps comparing against the theoretical analysis done by Sperry and Bender (2020) .  5.3 Limitations As with any study, there are limitations and in this case one of these related to fact that we used data from publicly accessible sources and did not actually speak to those in the sector. Further, some airlines may be actively engaging with the content of the SDGs but without making specific mention of these global goals and targets. This complicates data collection but poses the same problems with comparability as have been mentioned in the literature and highlights the importance of trying to come up with a standard sustainability framework – perhaps the SDGs – that all airlines report under. Finally, it should be noted that data collection was done during the first year of the COVID pandemic and therefore the conversations within the industry around building back more sustainability were likely not covered.
