                  Territorial spatial planning serves a primary instrument for optimizing the utilization of production, living, and ecological spaces (PLEs), significantly influencing on social, economic, and ecological sustainability. The correlation aligns with the objectives outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To comprehensively grasp the impact of territorial spatial planning on SDGs, particularly how changes in land use types and functions shape sustainable development, our study employed data encompassing land use and SDG scores across 31 provinces in China from 2000 to 2015. Utilizing Spearman coefficients, we meticulously examined the relationship between PLEs and SDGs. Our findings illuminated that PLEs based on land function (PLEs-LF) wield a more substantial influence on SDGs compared to those grounded in the proportion of land use types (PLEs-LUT). The former exhibited synergistic or trade-off relationships with 16 SDGs, whereas the latter demonstrated associations with 14 SDGs, underscoring the importance of concurrently considering both land use space and function in land sustainability research. Moreover, the positive impact of living space and function on social SDGs, particularly in poverty reduction, health, and gender equality, contrasts with ecological space and function, which exhibits trade-offs. The economic realm manifests no significant synergy or trade-off between production space and economic SDGs. Additionally, it is imperative not to overlook the preservation of fostering sustainable development in the oceans while simultaneously terrestrial ecological diversity. Our research imparts valuable insights, particularly for developing countries like China, facilitating a more effective implementation of SDG practices in land and providing guidance for territorial spatial governance and planning.

The correlation aligns with the objectives outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . To comprehensively grasp the impact of territorial spatial planning on SDGs, particularly how changes in land use types and functions shape sustainable development, our study employed data encompassing land use and SDG scores across 31 provinces in China from 2000 to 2015. Utilizing Spearman coefficients, we meticulously examined the relationship between PLEs and SDGs. Our findings illuminated that PLEs based on land function (PLEs-LF) wield a more substantial influence on SDGs compared to those grounded in the proportion of land use types (PLEs-LUT). The former exhibited synergistic or trade-off relationships with 16 SDGs, whereas the latter demonstrated associations with 14 SDGs, underscoring the importance of concurrently considering both land use space and function in land sustainability research. Moreover, the positive impact of living space and function on social SDGs, particularly in poverty reduction, health, and gender equality, contrasts with ecological space and function, which exhibits trade-offs. The economic realm manifests no significant synergy or trade-off between production space and economic SDGs. Additionally, it is imperative not to overlook the preservation of fostering sustainable development in the oceans while simultaneously terrestrial ecological diversity. Our research imparts valuable insights, particularly for developing countries like China, facilitating a more effective implementation of SDG practices in land and providing guidance for territorial spatial governance and planning.

Nonetheless, these activities have concurrently engendered formidable challenges for Earth's systems (Reichel & Perey, 2018 ), including climate change, depletion of natural resources, biodiversity loss, environmental pollution, and social inequality (Lee et al., 2017 ). To secure sustainable development for present and future generations, the United Nations, with 193 member states, endorsed “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” in 2015 (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017; U.N., 2015 ). This agenda delineated 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) addressing economic, social, and environmental dimensions, encompassing a total of 169 specific targets. However, the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022  (U.N., 2022 ) highlights a substantial gap in progress toward achieving these goals by the target year of 2030. Events such as the global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 (Wang & Huang, 2021 ) and the Russo-Ukrainian conflict in 2022 (Mohammed et al., 2023 ) have significantly set back to global sustainable development efforts. In light of this challenging scenario, enhancing the efficiency of attaining the SDGs by scrutinizing the intricate relationship between production, living conditions, ecology, and the SDGs becomes imperative. The conceptual framework of production, living, and ecological spaces (PLEs) encompasses distinct land categories, each fulfilling specific functions as delineated in national territorial spatial planning (Lin et al., 2022 ). Production space (PS) is designated for activities involving the generation of material products, living space (LS) for meeting the daily needs and preferences of individuals, and ecological space (ES) for upholding the stability and biodiversity of various life forms. Broadly, the categorization of PLEs is characterized by two primary approaches: one utilizing land use types to distinguish among PS, LS, and ES (Yang et al., 2020 ), and the other considering the multifunctionality of the land (Duan et al., 2021 ). This underscores the necessity for research on PLEs to encompass both the perspective of land use types and land function. Precise identification of PLEs is paramount. In practical terms, a widely accepted methodology involves collecting and categorizing land use data from sources such as statistical data or remotely sensed products (Lin et al., 2022 ). However, implementing quantitative measurement methods that effectively integrate data from diverse sources and scales to accurately identify the primary functions of PLEs poses significant challenges when operating on a large-scale level (Zou et al., 2020 ). Therefore, comprehensive research on PLEs should not only consider their diverse meanings but also take into account the accessibility of relevant data sources. Examining the nexus between PLEs and SDGs is imperative for formulating effective policies conducive to sustainable development. Land, as the foundational component of PLEs, carries profound implications for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, food security, poverty alleviation, and energy sustainability (Meyfroidt et al., 2022; Verburg et al., 2015 ). Numerous studies have indicated a potential linkage between PLEs and the SDGs (Fan et al., 2021; Peters et al., 2019 ). Noteworthy among these is the work of Fu et al. (2022) , who employed multi-source remotely sensed data to evaluate the land use sustainability of 334 Chinese cities. Their findings underscore the potential risk of diminishing land use sustainability in China, underscoring the imperative to harmonize the development of production, living, and ecological lands to advance SDG achievement. Additionally, a literature review conducted by Wang et al. (2022b)  highlights that PLEs exhibit strong correlations with at least 10 SDGs, albeit lacking specific elucidation on the nature of these relationships. By scrutinizing the interaction between the dynamic changes in PLEs and SDGs, we can discern potential barriers and opportunities for sustainable development amidst the transformative processes impacting the Earth's surface. Comprehending the direct relationship between PLEs and SDGs is indispensable for policymakers, national territorial spatial planners, and researchers striving for sustainable development. However, the current body of researchers falls short in providing an exhaustive exploration of the intricate interplay between land and sustainable development. The investigation into the interplay between SDGs and associated elements primarily centers on discerning synergies (positive correlations) and trade-offs (negative correlations) (Song et al., 2023 ). Pradhan et al. (2017) systematically analyzed synergies and trade-offs among the official SDGs across 227 countries and regions globally, utilizing the nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Their findings indicated a prevalence of synergies over trade-offs among the goals. Wang et al., 2022c  conducted a holistic examination of the synergy and trade-offs between SDG6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG14 (life below water). Employing an expert rating method, they assessed the interaction of these goals with other SDGs in China, evaluating the synergistic benefits of water pollution control across six distinct scenarios. This research provides valuable guidance for implementing sustainable water pollution treatment measures not only in China but also in other nations. Concerning methodologies for identifying synergies and trade-offs, two primary approaches are commonly employed: subjective evaluation (e.g., expert rating) (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2022c ) and objective evaluation (e.g., Pearson coefficient, Spearman coefficient, and panel regression) (Pradhan et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022 ). Subjective evaluation heavily relies on existing knowledge as a research foundation and can be challenging when dealing with complex, multidimensional, multisectoral, and multilevel SDGs. Consequently, objective assessment methods have garnered more attention, especially when the data volume meets the criteria for objective evaluation. Overall, the adoption of objective assessment methods to analyze synergies and trade-offs among SDGs and related elements is considered more straightforward and has gained recognition among numerous scholars. To bridge the existing research gap regarding the nexus between PLEs and SDGs, we undertook a comprehensive study encompassing 31 provincial administrative units in China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. The objectives of our research can be succinctly outlined as follows. Firstly, we aimed to scrutinize the dynamic evolution of PLEs in China, considering crucial aspects such as land use type and land functionality. Secondly, our focus extended to exploring the intricate relationship between first- and second-level PLEs categories, formulated based on land use type, and their correlation with SDGs. Thirdly, our research delved into investigating the complex interactions between PLEs, categorized according to land functionality, and their implications for SDGs.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials 2.1.1 Study area Our investigation focuses on 31 provinces in China, encompassing over 99 % of the nation's land area, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. China's rapid industrialization, achieved within a few decades (Zhang, 2017 ), sharply contrasts with the more extended timelines of developed nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States. This swift industrialization has left profound imprints on China's land use patterns (Kuang et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2010 ), manifesting in urban expansion, cropland reduction, and ecological land degradation. These alterations have posed challenges to China's sustainable development. In response, the Chinese government has instituted a governance framework emphasizing the preservation of ecosystem sustainability and stability, encapsulated in the “mountains, rivers, forests, croplands, lakes, grasslands, and deserts” system (Wang et al., 2020 ). This framework acknowledges the imperative of treating land as a natural resource necessitating sustainable management. Our examination of the relationship between PLEs and SDGs in China aims to contribute valuable insights to the nation's ongoing pursuit of sustainable development.  2.1.2 Data For our research, we utilized two datasets. The initial dataset was procured from the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center (https://www.resdc.cn ) and comprised land use type data. This dataset was derived through the interpretation of Landsat images and human–computer interactive interpretation, spanning the years 1980 to 2020 (Xu et al., 2018 ). The classification system employed comprised two levels, with the first level encompassing six categories, while the second level extended to 25 types (Liu et al., 2014 ). The reported accuracy for the first- and second-level classification stood at 94.3 % and 91.2 %, respectively. The specific land use data procured for our study covered the period from 2000 to 2015, maintaining a temporal resolution of 5 years and a spatial resolution of 1 km. The second dataset utilized in our study pertained to the SDG scores of China's 31 provinces, compiled by Xu et al. (2020) . These scores were derived from the evaluation of 119 indicators utilized for assessing the SDGs. Approximately 54 % of these indicators conformed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals framework, while the remaining 55 indicators were specifically tailored for localization. This involved adaptations, modifications, and substitutions for the original UN indicators (Chen et al., 2020 ). The sources of these indicators were diverse, encompassing United Nations documents as well as China's official and industry statistical yearbooks. Our primary objective in employing these two datasets was to scrutinize the correlation between alterations in PLEs and SDGs in China within the designated timeframe.   2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Overview of the methodology Land use involves the allocation of roles to land, influenced by both natural attributes and human interventions (Foley et al., 2005 ). Different land use types may fulfill similar functions, albeit with varying degrees of intensity. When scrutinizing PLEs using land use data, the consideration of two pivotal elements is imperative: land use type and land function. These components play a crucial role in augmenting the efficiency of land utilization, strengthening resource and environmental capacity, and promoting the sustainable exploitation of land resources. The exploration of the connection between PLEs and SDGs involves a structured process, as delineated in Fig. 1  . In the initial step, PLEs were formulated. Specifically, we generated first- and second-level production-living-ecological spaces categorized by land use type (PLEs-LUT) for China's 31 provinces spanning the years 2000 to 2015. Additionally, we established production-living-ecological spaces categorized by land functions (PLEs-LF). Progressing to the second step, we organized the 17 SDGs into three dimensions: social, economic, and environmental (D'Adamo et al., 2022; Fuso Nerini et al., 2018; Rockström & Sukhdev, 2016 ). This categorization aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the nuanced relationship between SDGs and PLEs. In the third and pivotal step, we employed the Spearman coefficient to analyze the synergistic or trade-off relationships, signifying positive or negative correlations, between PLEs (including PLEs-LUT and PLEs-LF) and SDGs. This analytical approach forms the core of our research endeavor.  2.2.2 Calculation of PLEs The composition of PLEs-LUT was established by considering the distribution of land use types outlined in Table 1  , resulting in the subdivision of second-level PLEs-LUT into a total of eight categories. To quantify the diverse functionalities associated with distinct land-use types within PLEs-LF, we drew upon insights from multiple studies (Cui et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2022a ). These studies served as the basis for attributing values to the production, living, and ecological functions of various land use types. The calculation formulas are:(1) PF = ∑ i = 1  n  LUA  i , t   × PS  i , t       ∑ i = 1  n  LUA  i , t         (2) LF = ∑ i = 1  n  LUA  i , t   × LS  i , t       ∑ i = 1  n  LUA  i , t         (3) EF = ∑ i = 1  n  LUA  i , t   × ES  i , t       ∑ i = 1  n  LUA  i , t         where, PF   , LF    and EF    are production function (PF), living function (LF), and ecological function (EF); LUA  i , t      represents i    type land use area at time t   ; n    is the number of land use types; PS  i , t     , LS  i , t     , ES  i , t      represent the production, living, and ecological function scores of i    type land use at t    time in Table 1 , respectively.  2.2.3 Concept of trade-offs and synergies The examination of how PLEs influence the attainment of SDGs was conducted through the application of the concepts of synergy and trade-offs. Positive correlations, exemplified by instances where increases in subsets of PLEs-LUT or PLEs-LF contributed to the advancement of SDGs, were indicative of synergy. In contrast, negative correlations, where increases in subsets of PLEs-LUT or PLEs-LF impeded progress toward SDGs, signified trade-offs. These relationships were quantified employing the nonparametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient (ρ   ). The Spearman coefficient is a reliable measure for assessing the non-linear monotonic connection between pairs of data, with the advantage of being less influenced by outliers (Hauke & Kossowski, 2011; Spearman, 1904 ). Generally, when examining the relationship among SDGs 1–17 using the Spearman coefficient, a correlation is regarded as synergistic if the p -value is < 0.05 and the p -value is > 0.6 (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Conversely, when the p -value is < 0.6, it signifies a trade-off relationship. In our study, we employed positive or negative Spearman coefficients to represent the synergy or trade-offs between PLEs and SDGs (Song et al., 2023 ).    3 Results 3.1 Changes in PLEs Fig. 2   illustrates the dynamics of PLEs-LUT across China during three distinct periods: 2000–2005, 2005–2010, and 2010–2015. Over time, many ecological spaces were replaced by production spaces, with the transition areas from ES to PS accounting for 19,534, 7,497, and 24,701 km2  in the respective time spans. This shift signifies the encroachment of industrial and urban expansion on extensive ecological spaces ( Li et al. (2020b) ). Conversely, certain production spaces underwent transformation into ecological areas, primarily observed in the conversion of croplands to forests and grasslands (Li et al., 2016 ). Green land planning in industrial zones and the ecological reconstruction of industrial relics emerged as predominant drivers for the conversion of production spaces into ecological spaces (Song et al., 2020 ). The reciprocal transformation of LS and ES was notably observed in urban or rural settlements, expanding to encompass ES (Baffoe et al., 2021; McDonald et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, the construction of ES, such as green spaces and artificial lakes within LS, contributed to this transformation (Guo et al., 2018 ). While the conversion between LS and PS was minimal, it held significance. LS expansion could potentially pose food security challenges by occupying cropland and diminishing its quality (Song & Pijanowski, 2014 ). Between 2000 and 2015, the transformations in PLEs-LF across the 31 provinces of China were scrutinized based on land functions, as depicted in Fig. 3   (see Table S2  for detailed scores). The PF and EF of land exhibited a general decline, while the LF witnessed an increase. Provinces such as Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanghai experienced a notable decrease in PF attributed to the degradation of cropland and grassland (Wang et al., 2018 ). Climate change and human intervention played substantial roles in fostering grassland restoration, contributing to a noteworthy increase in the PF in Ningxia and Xinjiang (Liu et al., 2019 ). The expansion of cities, marked by notable regional disparities, emerged as the primary catalyst for the growth of land living function (LF) (X. Li et al., 2020a ). Particularly, the Beijing-Tianjin region and the Yangtze River Delta region, encompassing Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, exhibited the most pronounced LF enhancements. From 2000 to 2015, EF displayed a diminishing trend, primarily attributable to the encroachment of cropland and grassland, reduction in the area of lakes and rivers, and the continuous deforestation of natural forest (Song & Deng, 2017 ). In terms of internal comparisons within PLEs-LF, the EF of each province generally ranked the highest, owing to the substantial proportion of ecological land types. However, a vast land area did not necessarily correlate with a high EF. For instance, Xinjiang, constituting approximately one-sixth of China's land area, exhibited a notably low EF, far below that of Tianjin, despite its land area being only a tenth of Xinjiang. This phenomenon was attributed to Xinjiang's land composition, characterized by an exceptionally high proportion of sandy land and desert.  3.2 Variations in Social-Economic-Ecological SDGs Fig. 4   illustrates the evolving trajectories of Social SDGs, Economic SDGs, and Ecological SDGs in China from 2000 to 2015. The Social SDG scores in China demonstrated substantial growth (Fig. 4 (a)), characterized by growth rates ranging from 17.42 % (Jiangsu) to 65.32 % (Ningxia), with an average growth rate of 34.22 %. Notably, 10 provinces exhibited social SDG growth rates surpassing 40 %, primarily concentrated in western provinces such as Ningxia, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the abundant natural resources in Western China, establishing a foundation and advantage for social development (Michel-Mata et al., 2022 ). Additionally, it is linked to the supportive government policies implemented to foster balanced development in central and western China, particularly focusing on social development in western provinces, including initiatives related to educational equality and social poverty (Li & Wei, 2010 ). Between 2000 and 2015, the mean growth rate of Economic SDG scores in China reached 36.27 %, as depicted in Fig. 4 (b). Five provinces exhibited growth rates exceeding 50 %, with Guizhou leading at an impressive 82.27 %, followed closely by Chongqing at 67.99 %. Nevertheless, it is crucial to highlight that Qinghai faced a notable decline of nearly 7 % in economic sustainability over the 15-year period, demanding special attention. The challenges predominantly center around the sustainability of consumption and production (Bai et al., 2023 ), particularly in the realm of waste emissions (Ping et al., 2011 ). In contrast to the upward trajectory observed in Social and Economic DG scores, ecological scores in China displayed the slowest rate of increase. Nonetheless, the overall ecological quality of the country continued to progress, marked by a national average growth of 17.90 % (Fig. 4 (c)). The growth patterns of Ecological SDG scores revealed a trend where southern provinces scored higher than their northern counterparts, and western provinces outperformed eastern provinces. To summarize, the scores of Social, Economic, and Ecological SDGs in China exhibited an ascending trend, with Economic SDGs displaying the highest growth rate. This trend aligns with the developmental focus on economic growth in China from 2000 to 2015.  3.3 Correlation analyses between PLEs-LUT and SDGs Table 2   delineates the trade-offs and synergies between first-level PLEs-LU and the dimensions of social, economic, and ecological SDGs, encompassing a total of 14 SDGs. From the perspective of social SDGs, an increase in LS (ρ   -value = 0.530** ) exerted a more substantial positive influence on fostering sustainable social development compared to PS (ρ   -value = 0.355** ). This prominence is attributed to the harmonious development of social factors, including poverty reduction, health, and gender equality, contributing to an enhanced residential experience for individuals (Lavell et al., 2023 ). Conversely, ES (ρ   -value = -0.444** ) demonstrated a trade-off relationship with social SDGs, resulting in inherent contradictions in land-use planning. The construction of adequate public facilities within a community is deemed essential to meet the burgeoning material and spiritual needs of individuals seeking a comfortable living environment (Song et al., 2023 ). This phenomenon was particularly observed in connection with SDG1 (no poverty), SDG3 (good health and wellbeing), SDG4 (quality education), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG17 (global partnerships), thereby substantiating these perspectives. The synergy between PS (ρ   -value = 0.290** ) and SDG2 (zero hunger) was marginally stronger than the relationship between LS (ρ   -value = 0.286** ) and SDG2. This is attributed to the fact that increased agricultural space leads to higher food production, aligning more favorably with the objectives of SDG2. Notably, a significant trade-off existed between LS (ρ   -value = -0.291** ) and SDG5 (gender equality). This disparity primarily stemmed from gender inequalities in the construction and development processes of urban areas, where male individuals were favored by employers over their female counterparts, resulting in unequal gender representation in the workforce (Xiao & Asadullah, 2020 ). Regarding the economic dimension, there was no significant synergy or trade-off relationship between PS (ρ   -value = 0.147) and economic SDGs. This observation may be attributed to the phenomenon of rural-to-urban migration among agricultural laborers, with cropland abandonment and a diminished economic value of crops (Daskalova & Kamp, 2023 ). A synergy was identified between LS (ρ   -value = 0.398** ) and economic SDGs, while ES (ρ   -value = -0.260** ) exhibited a trade-off relationship with economic SDGs. Of particular note was the trade-off between SDG7 (affordable and clean energy) and PS (ρ-value = -0.248**), as well as the synergy between ES (ρ-value = 0.198*) and SDG7 warranting attention. The promotion and adoption of clean energy solutions may initially have adverse effects on existing industrial production in the short term but can significantly benefit the ecological environment (Chen et al., 2023 ). Additionally, SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG12 (responsible consumption and production) demonstrated synergistic connections with both PS and LS, while exhibiting trade-off effects with ES. This pattern mirrors the relationship observed within the social SDGs subset concerning PS, LS, and ES. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the mutual reinforcement between the social and economic dimensions of the SDGs (Lee, 2020 ). The association between ecological SDGs and PS (ρ   -value = -0.249** ), as well as LS (ρ   -value = -0.227*), was characterized by mutual constraints, indicative of a trade-off effect. Conversely, the relationship with ES (ρ   -value = 0.234** ) was characterized by mutual promotion, signifying a synergy. These associations were predominantly observed concerning SDG6 (clean water and sanitation) to PS (ρ   -value = -0.335** ), LS (ρ   -value = -0.315** ), and ES (ρ   -value = 0.346** ). PS and LS contributed to agricultural, industrial, and domestic wastewater, thereby constraining the sustainable utilization of water resources. LS (ρ   -value = 0.417** ) exhibited a significant synergy with SDG14 (life below water), particularly in coastal provinces, where improved living conditions attract more marine researchers, promoting research and development for sustainable marine utilization (Wang et al., 2021 ). In comparison to the relationship between SDG6 and the first-level PLEs-LUT, the trade-off and synergy effects of SDG15 (life on land) with LS (ρ   -value = -0.200*) and ES (ρ   -value = 0.199*) were relatively weaker. The expansion of LS encroached upon ecological land, involving planting forests and vegetation to mitigate negative ecological impacts. ES, however, comprised a substantial amount of sandy desert, which was not conducive to the survival of terrestrial organisms. The intricate relationship between more detailed PLEs, specifically second-level PLEs-LUT, and SDGs, provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between land space and SDGs (Table 3   and Table S3 ). Focusing on the analysis of the association between social SDGs and second-level PLEs-LUT, the impact of IPS (ρ   -value = 0.723** ) within land PS exhibited a more pronounced synergy compared to APS (ρ   -value = 0.321** ). This trend was consistent across SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and wellbeing), SDG4 (quality education), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG17 (global partnerships). The economic and social benefits derived from industrial land surpass those from agricultural land (Wu, 2008 ). Similarly, the influence of ULS (ρ   -value = 0.658** ) within land LS on SDGs was generally stronger than that of RLS (ρ   -value = 0.533** ), evident in five goals: SDG1, SDG3, SDG4, SDG5, SDG11, and SDG17. This suggests that urban areas exhibit stronger social attributes than rural areas (Xu et al., 2022 ). Regarding the relationship with SDG2, the synergy effect of RLS (ρ   -value = 0.325** ) was stronger than that of ULS (ρ   -value = 0.318** ), primarily because RLS contributes significantly to food production, addressing hunger. Among various social dimension SDGs, only SDG5 showed a trade-off effect with both ULS and RLS, with RLS having a greater impact, indicating a more pronounced gender inequality issue in rural labor employment (Odera & Mulusa, 2020 ). The relationship between social SDGs and second-level ES was relatively complex. Specifically, Social SDGs exhibited a trade-off effect with GES (ρ   -value = -0.259** ) and OES (ρ   -value = -0.217** ), signifying the threat of sandy or unstable grassland (land on the verge of desertification) to sustainable social development (Wang et al., 2002 ). On the other hand, Social SDGs demonstrated synergy with AES (ρ   -value = 0.389** ), particularly evident in the relationships with SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG4, SDG11, and SDG17. It is noteworthy that the growth of forest land, seemingly unrelated to educational equity, exhibited a synergy effect of FES (ρ   -value = 0.190*) with SDG4, emphasizing the role of greening efforts in promoting educational equity (Yeager et al., 2023 ) and and warranting further exploration. Similarly, the synergy effect of GES (ρ   -value = 0.217*) with SDG4 deserves attention (Fang et al., 2021 ). The relationship between economic SDGs and second-level PLEs-LUT parallels the relationship observed with social SDGs and second-level PLEs-LUT (Table 3 ). In advancing economic SDGs, IPS (ρ   -value = 0.578** ) exhibited a more robust synergy effect compared to APS (ρ   -value = 0.1199), while ULS (ρ   -value = 0.569** ) emonstrated a stronger synergy with economic SDGs in contrast to RLS (ρ   -value = 0.354** ). The synergy between economic SDGs and ES was predominantly evident in FES (ρ   -value = 0.260** ) and AES (ρ   -value = 0.380** ), whereas GES (ρ   -value = -0.333** ) and OES (ρ   -value = -0.330** ) showcased a trade-off effect. Notably (Table S3 ), APS (ρ   -value = -0.257** ) exhibited a trade-off effect with SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), whereas the synergy between APS (ρ   -value = 0.324** ) and SDG12 (responsible consumption and production) surpassed the synergy between IPS (ρ   -value = 0.202** ) and SDG12. This discrepancy could be elucidated by examining the entire production process of APS (Rather et al., 2022 ). During the planting and growing season of food crops, substantial amounts of water and agricultural chemicals are consumed, contributing to water pollution and exerting negative impacts on sustainable energy production. However, the crop residues left after harvesting can enhance soil quality and cause less pollution (Smil, 1999 ), rendering them more conducive to promoting sustainable consumption and production. Furthermore, the synergy effect of RLS (ρ   -value = 0.369** ) with SDG12 was marginally stronger than the synergy effect of ULS (ρ   -value = 0.354** ) with SDG12, suggesting that sustainable production and consumption practices in rural areas may confer slightly more advantages (Wang et al., 2014 ). The association between ecological SDGs and second-level PLEs-LUT differs from the relationships observed in the preceding two categories with second-level PLEs-LUT (Table 3  and Table S3 ). Ecological SDGs primarily exhibit a trade-off effect with second-level PS and second-level LS), while demonstrating a predominant mutual promotion effect, characterized as synergy, with second-level ES. Nevertheless, distinctions are evident in the observed relationships. IPS (ρ   -value = 0.535** ), ULS (ρ   -value = 0.498** ), and RLS (ρ   -value = 0.338** ) predominantly manifest a synergy effect with SDG14 (life below water) in coastal provinces. The impact of industrial land on the marine environment is diminishing due to pollution control measures and waste management practices (Shahidul Islam & Tanaka, 2004 ). Similarly, the planning and development of residential land integrate green building practices and low-carbon living standards to mitigate pollution to the marine environment (Abubakar & Alshammari, 2023 ). Beyond the positive influence of increasing FES (ρ   -value = 0.698** ) on SDG15 (life on land), GES (ρ   -value = -0.200*), AES (ρ   -value = -0.178*), and OES (ρ   -value = -0.319** ) have adverse effects on SDG15, indicating that individual increments in GES (Bengtsson et al., 2019 ) and AES (Barbier et al., 2011 ) are not conducive to ecosystem well-being. For GES, this is attributed to the expansion of artificial grasslands, accompanied by extensive fertilizer use detrimental to ecosystem stability (Melts et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the construction of artificial water bodies necessitates subsequent restoration efforts to mitigate ecological damage caused by changes in land use type.  3.4 Correlation analyses between PLEs-LF and SDGs Owing to the variability in land use types' functionality, an examination of the relationship between PLEs and SDGs necessitates an exploration of land functions, specifically the study of PLEs-LF their alignment with SDGs, as illustrated in Table 4  . PLEs-LF revealed either synergy or trade-off effects with 16 SDGs. However, when considering the relationships between PLEs-LF and social-economic-ecological SDGs, the findings in Table 4  mirrored those in Table 2 , emphasizing that ecological conservation and economic sustainable development are not inherently contradictory. Distinctive variations in the relationships of PLEs-LF and PLEs-LUT with SDGs were particularly apparent in their specific associations with eight SDGs. Within the social dimension, compared to PS, PF (ρ   -value = 0.084) did not exhibit a significant relationship with SDG4 (quality education). Conversely, in comparison to LS (ρ   -value = 0.444** ), LF (ρ   -value = 0.459** ) demonstrated a more robust synergy with SDG4, suggesting that achieving and sustaining educational equity requires broader societal support, including policy assistance. LF (ρ-value = 0.387** ) also displayed synergy with SDG16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions). On the economic front, PF did not reveal significant relationships with SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG12 (responsible consumption and production). However, noteworthy is that LF had a more pronounced positive impact on these three SDGs compared to LS, suggesting that economic sustainability relies more heavily on human-driven innovation (Díaz et al., 2019 ). In the ecological context, PF showed trade-off effects with (climate action) and SDG15 (life on land). This is attributed to the potential adverse impacts of agricultural and industrial production on climate and the ecological environment (Olesen & Bindi, 2002 ). Furthermore, EF (ρ   -value = -0.349*) exhibited a trade-off effect with SDG14 (life below water). Enhanced land EF may lead to reduced reliance on marine resources, affecting the sustainable utilization of oceanic resources (Nathaniel et al., 2021 ). However, excessive reliance on terrestrial ecosystems may neglect marine ecosystems, impacting the conservation and restoration of marine ecological systems (Lambin & Meyfroidt, 2011 ).   4 Discussion 4.1 Comparison with previous studies We have established and elucidated the connection between PLEs and SDGs, emphasizing the impact of changes in land use types and advancements in land functions on SDG implementation. Despite the plethora of research on sustainable land use, many studies tend to adopt a limited scope. For instance, Qu et al. (2020)  scrutinized the sustainable utilization of urban and rural ecological land types, focusing on shifts in land use types across 282 prefecture-level cities and towns in China from 2009 to 2016. Meanwhile, Xue et al. (2019)  assessed the influence of land use policies in remote agricultural areas such as Godagari in Bangladesh, Guyuan in China, and Noto in Japan on local development. This assessment involved quantifying land functions to facilitate more effective land management. However, these studies exclusively considered either land use types or land functions in evaluating the sustainability of the study areas, potentially introducing biases into policy recommendations derived from their outcomes. Furthermore, ongoing research delves into the sustainability of land use grounded in SDGs (Wei et al., 2023 ). Nonetheless, our study transcends these approaches by exploring the relationship between land and SDGs, taking into account both land use types and land functions. This approach provides a more comprehensive and lucid depiction of the interplay between land use and SDGs. Simultaneously, our study underscores the significance of land function (Fig. 5  ). Generally, economic development tends to compromise the benefits of ecosystems, leading to ecosystem fragmentation, biodiversity degradation, and disruptions in carbon and nitrogen cycles (Hong et al., 2021 ). However, our findings indicate that ecological land functions do not inherently oppose sustainable economic development. This suggests that when studying sustainable land use, it is essential to concurrently consider both land use types and land functions (Verburg et al., 2009 ). PLEs-LUT exhibits interactions with 14 SDGs, while PLEs-LF shows correlations with 16 SDGs, underscoring the significance of land functions in the process of achieving the SDGs. Additionally, both PLEs-LUT and PLEs-LF are not associated with SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), which primarily addresses inequalities within and among countries.  4.2 Policy implications Our research lays a foundational framework for spatial land governance by addressing critical issues. A primary recommendation is the need to emphasize the importance of land functions while concurrently preserving existing land use types, particularly the ecological functions of non-ecological land use types. For instance, optimizing crop planting structures not only sustains food production in agricultural fields but also conserves water resources, improves ecological conditions (Coverdale & Davies, 2023; Liu et al., 2023 ), and significantly contributes to the advancement of SDGs 2, 6, and 15. Similarly, curtailing the expansion of industrial land, enhancing industrial land efficiency, and improving the economic efficiency of the unit area of industrial land not only mitigates adverse effects on SDG 15 but also fosters the achievement of SDG8 (Qu et al., 2020 ). Subsequently, our goal is to enhance and ensure the conservation functions of water resources in designated areas. This necessitates increased investment in funding and advancements in wastewater treatment and water-saving technologies to minimize the adverse impacts of production and daily life on SDG6. In the 21st century, dubbed the “century of water,” urban and industrial water pollution, along with agricultural irrigation, has resulted in numerous challenges, including increased water demand, decreased water resources, and aggravated water pollution (Boretti & Rosa, 2019 ), posing significant threats to social, economic, and ecological sustainability. Ultimately, we aim to establish a scientifically and logically sound system for sustainable marine resource development, intending to reduce damage to marine ecosystems and support SDG14, with a particular focus on coastal provinces. Given that oceans cover approximately 71 % of the Earth's surface, and their resources are both abundant and unique, high technological demands for resource exploitation are necessary due to challenges such as widespread pollution mobility, dispersion, and corrosion caused by wind, waves, and salt content. Furthermore, to address the limitations of land use data in capturing the complete spectrum of land goods and services, collaboration between governments at all levels and scholars is imperative for creating land function distribution data (Fu et al., 2022; Verburg et al., 2009 ). This approach establishes a direct link between land data and the social, economic, and ecological dimensions of regional development, offering a more nuanced and intuitive expression of sustainability.  4.3 Research uncertainty. By integrating land use and SDGs data, we have uncovered the direct impact of PLEs on SDGs, yet certain uncertainties persist. The categorization of SDGs into social, economic, and ecological domains introduces variations that could potentially influence research outcomes. In contrast to our classification, the SDGs wedding cake theory (Rockström & Sukhdev, 2016 ) places SDG7 under the social category, and SDG17 stands as an overarching achievement target not belonging to any specific category. Additionally, research on economic sustainable development in Europe suggests that SDG7 possesses stronger economic attributes (D'Adamo et al., 2022 ). Scholars also advocate for classifying SDG1, SDG2, and SDG11 under the economic category and SDG17 under the social category (Xu et al., 2023 ). Despite these varying classifications, we have opted to maintain our categorization system (Song et al., 2023 ). Simultaneously, our study acknowledges the shortcomings in the spatial–temporal resolution of SDGs data. To remedy this issue, a proactive approach involving the localization and spatialization of SDGs is necessary (Chen et al., 2020 ). Localizing SDGs research facilitates the development of a more detailed and targeted indicator system, aligning with the trajectory of regional sustainable development and allowing access to real-time updated data (Kates Robert et al., 2001; Sterling et al., 2020 ). Spatialization assessments of SDGs can precisely identify region-specific issues that require sustainability attention (Mulligan et al., 2020 ). Despite lingering data deficiencies in our study, it remains a relatively comprehensive assessment dataset (Gao et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Our research offers a novel perspective on the relationship between land and SDGs.   5 Conclusions We have presented groundbreaking and direct evidence of the nexus between land use, encompassing both land use space and land function, and SDGs at the provincial level within China. Utilizing land use data spanning from 2000 to 2015 across 31 provinces in China, we delineated land use types and functions, establishing distinct production spaces, living spaces, and ecological spaces collectively referred to as PLEs. Concurrently, we categorized SDGs into three dimensions: social, economic, and ecological. Employing a Spearman correlation analysis, we scrutinized the relationships between PLEs and the three dimensions of SDGs, encompassing their specific goals. The study has unveiled synergistic or trade-off associations between PLEs and 16 SDGs, with particular emphasis on the impact of land function on SDG achievement. Notably, the link between land's ecological functions and Economic SDGs lacks statistical significance, underscoring the greater potential of improving land use efficiency for sustainable development. Furthermore, humanity cannot overlook the sustainable development of the oceans in its efforts to preserve terrestrial ecological diversity. In summary, our research has yielded fresh insights and conclusions regarding the interplay between land and sustainable development. Looking ahead, as China's SDGs assessment further enhances its temporal and spatial resolution, the role of land within PLEs in the context of SDGs will continue to be accentuated. This, in turn, will support the sustainable utilization and management of land resources.
