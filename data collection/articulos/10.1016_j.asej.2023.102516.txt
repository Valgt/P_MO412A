                  Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the fastest growing industrial technique, harboring innovative, cost effective and environmentally friendly solutions. Over the years, AM technologies have been utilized in the aerospace and automotive industries mainly for prototyping purposes. However, 3D printing of aircraft and automobile components and parts has recently proven its efficiency. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the utilization of AM technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries is presented. The various AM techniques are compared based on their process, materials, and applications. In addition, the opportunities and limitations of AM in aerospace and automotive industries are highlighted. Finally, the contribution of AM and 3D printing in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is examined and evaluated.

Over the years, AM technologies have been utilized in the aerospace and automotive industries mainly for prototyping purposes. However, 3D printing of aircraft and automobile components and parts has recently proven its efficiency. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the utilization of AM technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries is presented. The various AM techniques are compared based on their process, materials, and applications. In addition, the opportunities and limitations of AM in aerospace and automotive industries are highlighted. Finally, the contribution of AM and 3D printing in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is examined and evaluated.   Keywords Additive manufacturing  3D Printing  Aerospace  Automotive  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)    1 Introduction Advancements in technology and the manufacturing industry require novel, sustainable and cost saving alternatives. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a technique that involves the creation of objects by building them layer by layer, where after particles from different layers are lined together through heat or chemicals, the process is replicated, and further layers are added. The process of AM results in a 3D complex structure as the layers are linked together one at a time. As apparent from the term, additive manufacturing process integrates the addition of raw materials rather than removing them in order to create light and robust 3D design [1,2] . Generally, 3D printing is a method for manufacturing 3D models using Computer-Aided Modeling (CAD). Hence, depending on the creation process, AM can be categorized as the following: easy implementation, automated manufacturing, layered manufacturing, and solid free foam [3] . Over the past decades, additive manufacturing has revolutionized the manufacturing industry as it is able to transform engineering ideas into completely functional and robust structures, regardless of the complicated geometry associated with them. Therefore, AM is able to create products easily, accurately, at a low cost and utilizing environmentally friendly material. Additive manufacturing and 3D printing has been utilized in many sectors [4–8] , especially in aerospace and automotive applications, where 33 % of the AM revenue is received from these industries [9] . Not only that, but the aerospace and automotive industries are the fastest growing sectors, reporting an increase in the range of 1–2 % annually [9] . The material in the aerospace and automotive industry varies between ceramic, metal and its alloys and polymeric based materials. These materials ought to possess exceptional performance, strength, and heat resistance with high durability, long term reliability and fatigue resistance [10,11] . Moreover, in the aerospace field, international standards are in place to sustain the process of material manufacturing. Recently, standards such as AMS (7000–7004) are being developed to maintain the materials and their production through additive manufacturing, which highlights the important and developing role of AM in the aerospace industry [9] . AM can be employed for rapid prototyping, creation of tools, and creating or finishing components and parts. Utilization of 3D printing and AM reduces the waste and consumption of energy during the manufacturing process, as time and energy are conserved throughout the various stages of production, in turn lowering the production costs and contributing to the sustainable development of manufacturing processes. The United Nations (UN) set in place a blueprint to achieve a sustainable future through the establishment of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [12] . As these goals aim to improve the environmental, economic, and social aspects, they are of great importance for developing technologies. The utilization of AM technologies results in a more sustainable manufacturing process than aligns with the SDGs achievements [13] . To highlight the importance of 3D printing in the aerospace and automotive industries and emphasis the advancement of their contribution in the manufacturing industry, a keyword analysis is carried out and shown in Fig. 1  . The figure is obtained through the VOSviewer software, where every node represents a keyword. As more keywords are mentioned in research articles, the bigger is the node that represents them. As seen in Fig. 1 (a), the most searched terms for the aerospace industry revolve around the additive manufacturing techniques. On the other hand, as seen from Fig. 1  (b), sustainability and 3D printing technologies are among the top used keywords. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the utilization of additive manufacturing and 3D printing technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries is presented. The various additive manufacturing techniques are discussed based on their applications, the materials utilized, and the processes involved. In addition, the opportunities and limitations of AM technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries are highlighted. Finally, the contribution of additive manufacturing towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is evaluated and assessed.  2 Additive manufacturing and 3D printing materials At the heart of additive manufacturing technology lie the diverse materials used to fabricate objects layer by layer. From thermoplastics and metals to biocompatible resins and advanced composites, the range of materials employed in additive manufacturing continues to expand, catering to an array of industries such as aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and consumer goods. The following section explores some of the key materials utilized in this innovative process, highlighting their properties, microstructure, unique advantages, applications, and the role they play in shaping the additive manufacturing technology. 2.1 Polymers Polymers are widely regarded as the primary and most commonly used materials for 3D printing, primarily due to their abundant availability, cost-effectiveness, favorable mechanical properties, and compatibility with various 3D printing processes. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), Nylon, Acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate (ASA), High impact polystyrene (HIPS), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Polylactic acid (PLA), Polycarbonate (PC), Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), Polyether ether ketone (PEEK), Thermoplastic polyester (TPC), methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile–butadiene styrene (MABS), and numerous other polymer materials are readily available in the market for additive manufacturing. These versatile polymers find applications in various sectors, including healthcare, aviation, automotive, and electronics industries [14] . Polymer materials used exhibit a diverse range of properties, making them a versatile choice for a wide array of applications. One notable advantage is their flexibility in achieving different levels of tensile strength, stiffness, and density, allowing for tailored solutions to meet specific project requirements. They generally have lower melting points than metals, simplifying the AM process. Additionally, polymers offer a broad spectrum of colours and finishes, enhancing aesthetic options. However, these materials may lack the extreme mechanical strength and heat resistance of metals. Some can be prone to warping or shrinking during printing, demanding precise temperature control. Furthermore, while biodegradable options are available, not all polymers are environmentally friendly. Among the most commonly used polymers for 3D printing are Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and Polylactic acid (PLA). ABS, a popular thermoplastic polymer, is formed by combining three monomer units, namely Acrylonitrile, Butadiene, and Styrene, with its chemical formula [(C8 H8 )x  * (C4 H6 )y  * (C3 H3 )z ]. The wide popularity of ABS can be attributed to its easy availability and favorable mechanical properties. The production process of ABS is simple and cost-effective, involving the polymerization of acrylonitrile and styrene in the presence of polybutadiene. This terpolymer is formed by varying proportions of monomers, typically containing 15 to 35 % acrylonitrile, 40 to 60 % styrene, and 5 to 30 % butadiene. ABS exhibits enhanced strength compared to pure polystyrene, owing to the presence of the nitrile group, while the styrene component provides a glossy surface finish, and polybutadiene imparts toughness even at low temperatures. ABS is an amorphous solid with no true melting point but exhibits a glass transition temperature of 105 °C [15] . It is commonly utilized within a temperature range of − 20 to 80 °C, as its mechanical properties are temperature-sensitive. Moreover, ABS is a recyclable material, and it can be recycled from waste electrical and electronic equipment. However, during the recycling process of ABS, void defects may occur due to the evolution of volatile substances, which could subsequently lead to decreased flexural strength and ductility, ultimately affecting the material's mechanical properties [16] . Polylactic acid (PLA) stands as another widely utilized polymer in the realm of 3D printing. PLA is a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from sustainable and natural sources, such as sugarcane, corn starch, potato chips, and tapioca roots [17] . The chemical composition of PLA involves two primary monomers, cyclic di-ester lactide, and lactide acid. The production of PLA involves ring-opening polymerization of lactide, wherein various metal catalysts are introduced either in solution or during the melting process and as a suspension. Reliance Life Sciences has successfully employed bacterial fermentation of renewable feedstock to produce PLA material, establishing a complete production process. In comparison to conventional polymers, PLA exhibits favorable mechanical properties. It exists as a semi-crystalline and amorphous solid, with a glass transition temperature of 55 °C and a melting temperature of 180 °C [18] . Commonly used 3D printing methods for polymers encompass fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, and laminated object manufacturing [18] . Polymers, despite their disadvantages in terms of mechanical properties and suitability for load-bearing applications, have been the subject of extensive research to overcome these limitations. One approach to enhance their mechanical properties is through the incorporation of various fibers, either short or continuous, within an organic polymer matrix, giving rise to Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs). By reinforcing polymers with fibers and particles, their mechanical strength is improved, enabling their application in load-carrying scenarios. These reinforced polymers encompass both synthetic and biomaterial resins. Reinforcement materials such as TiO2 , carbon nanofibers, montmorillonite clay, graphene, and others have been investigated [19] . Fig. 2   shows polymer-based 3D printed components utilized for aerospace industry [20] . The microstructure of polymer materials used in 3D printing plays a pivotal role in determining their mechanical, thermal, and overall performance characteristics. At the microscale, polymers consist of long chains of repeating molecular units known as polymer chains. The arrangement and orientation of these chains within the material significantly impact its properties. For instance, amorphous polymers have a disordered, random arrangement of chains, offering flexibility and transparency. In contrast, semi-crystalline polymers feature regions of ordered crystalline structures embedded within the amorphous matrix, resulting in improved strength and stiffness. Understanding and manipulating this microstructure through 3D printing processes, such as extrusion and layer deposition, enables precise control over material properties, making it possible to produce customized components with tailored mechanical behaviour and thermal characteristics. Table 1   presents a comparison between the characteristics and properties of polymer-based materials for AM techniques.  2.2 Ceramics Ceramic materials possess qualities such as hardness, brittleness, heat resistance, and resistance to corrosion. One of their primary advantages is their exceptional heat resistance, making them suitable for high-temperature applications, such as in aerospace and automotive industries. They also possess excellent electrical insulating properties. Ceramics exhibit superior hardness and wear resistance, ensuring long-lasting and durable parts. However, they can be brittle, which may limit their use in impact-prone applications. Ceramics are a class of inorganic, non-metallic materials such as: clays, cement, glasses, abrasives, and advanced ceramics. Traditional ceramics are usually sourced from natural substances, while advanced ceramics are typically engineered from synthetic material and often possess tailored properties such as particle size distribution, grain size and purity. These engineered features enable them to meet the increasingly demanding requirements of various industrial sectors, such as aerospace and automotive [21] . The presence of rigid ionic and covalent bonds in the microstructure of advanced ceramics is responsible for their outstanding physical, chemical, and mechanical properties [22] . These properties include high temperature resistance and stiffness, low coefficient of friction, and excellent chemical inertness. Ceramics are incorporated into additive manufacturing technology through three forms of feedstock: slurry-based, powder-based, and bulk solid-based. In slurry-based ceramic additive manufacturing, liquid or semi-liquid systems are utilized, wherein fine ceramic particles are dispersed as the feedstock. Powder-based ceramic additive manufacturing, on the other hand, involves loose ceramic particles contained within powder beds as the feedstock. Lastly, bulk solid-based ceramic additive manufacturing draws inspiration from laminated object manufacturing and employs various ceramic materials such as tape-cast alumina, zirconia green sheets, silicon carbide, silicon–silicon carbide composites, glass–ceramic composites, and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) for the feedstock. Aluminium (I) oxide (Al2 O) and Zirconium Oxide (ZrO2 ) are widely utilized oxide ceramic materials for AM technologies. Both posses a low sintering temperature, while Al2 O is more versatile, and ZrO2  is tougher. Silica (SiO2 ) are regarded as a cost-effective substitute and are also heavily utilized in AM processes. Non-oxide ceramics are generally more temperature resistant, stronger, and less exposed to fracture when compared to oxide ceramics. Non-oxide ceramics can be based on carbide such as silicon carbide (SiC), tungsten carbide (WC), and boron carbide (B4 C), or nitride such as silicon nitride (Si3 N4 ) and aluminium nitride (AlN). Processing non-oxide ceramics poses greater challenges compared to oxide ceramics, primarily due to their high sintering temperatures that usually exceed 1700 °C. The microstructure of ceramic materials used is characterized by a well-defined arrangement of crystalline grains within an amorphous matrix. Ceramic powders, the building blocks of printed objects, are composed of fine particles that contain crystalline phases. During the AM process, these powders are selectively fused together layer by layer, creating a network of densely packed grains. Controlling the microstructure through factors like sintering temperature and dwell time allows for precise tuning of the material's performance, making it possible to engineer ceramics with tailored properties for various applications, from high-temperature aerospace components to biocompatible medical implants. Table 2   presents a comparison between the characteristics and properties of ceramic-based materials for AM techniques. Polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) form a distinct category of advanced ceramics, created through the pyrolysis of polymeric precursors at temperatures exceeding 800 °C in inert atmospheres, resulting in the transformation into ceramic materials[23] . PDCs find applications in producing ceramic fibers, coatings, or components, often offering superior thermomechanical properties that are retained up to temperatures of 2000 °C in oxidizing atmospheres [24] . Nevertheless, the primary limitation of the PDC route is the transformation of polymers into ceramics through high-temperature pyrolysis. This process is marked with the liberation of considerable quantities of volatile gaseous substances (H2 O, CO2 , H2 , CH4 ), leading to substantial reduction in mass and significant shrinkage in dimension ranging from 40 % to 70 %. As a result, utilizing preceramic polymers to create ceramic components with a volume greater than a few millimetres becomes challenging, as the resulting material is usually filled with cracks[25] . Fig. 3   shows PDC-based 3D printed components for a catalytic reactor and their deformation behaviour [26] .  2.3 Metal and alloys The metal 3D printing process has garnered significant interest across various industries, including automotive, aircraft, manufacturing, and medical sectors, owing to its numerous advantages. Among their key advantages are exceptional mechanical strength, making them ideal for applications requiring robust and load-bearing components, such as in aerospace and automotive industries. Metals also exhibit excellent thermal conductivity and heat resistance, making them suitable for high-temperature applications. However, they can be heavy, limiting their use in weight-sensitive applications. Some notable examples of these metals include steel, titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys, cobalt-based alloys, and aluminium alloys. Metallic parts produced using additive manufacturing techniques exhibit fine microstructures and are comparatively denser than metallic parts manufactured through conventional processes. At the microscale, metals and alloys typically exhibit a crystalline structure, with grains or crystals that vary in size and orientation. The arrangement of these grains, as well as the presence of impurities and defects, can greatly influence material properties like strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance. The improved microstructure enhances the mechanical properties of AM produced metallic parts, increasing the ultimate stress and yield strength. Nevertheless, the presence of crack and its propagation needs to be carefully examined in AM-produced parts, as the existence of porosity can adversely affect the microstructure [27] . Controlling porosity can be achieved by regulating the quality of the feedstock material and adjusting the applied energy during the AM process [28] . The use of regularly shaped, finer particles, typically spherical, improves feedstock quality by enhancing homogeneity and flowability. Maintaining an appropriate level of volume energy deposition is crucial, as low energy levels are responsible for the presence of irregularly shaped voids, while high energy levels can cause spherical pores. Several flaws can have an adverse impact on the mechanical characteristics of the printed objects. These flaws encompass keyhole-type melting, inadequate powder melting, powder removal, and the capture of gas within the material. Keyhole defects emerge from intense vaporization, while insufficient powder melting arises due to low power and faster scanning rates [29] . Powder removal pertains to the observable clearance of powders along the melted path, resulting from particle shifts during melting. Effectively managing gas pressure during the additive manufacturing process can mitigate defects caused by powder removal. Pores entrapped by gas, which closely correlate with the quality of the input material, raise notable concerns, particularly for components requiring resistance against fatigue. Additionally, other metallurgical issues, such as balling/liquid spheroidization, distortion, delamination, and cracking are often associated with AM-produced metal parts[30] . Table 3   presents a comparison between the characteristics and properties of metal and alloys-based materials for AM techniques. 2.3.1 Steel and steel alloys Steel materials are commonly employed in numerous applications especially in tooling applications where high hardness and strength are required. For instance, 34CrNiMo6 steel, known for its exceptional mechanical properties, is utilized in machine elements, fasteners, and tools. However, significant alterations to the properties and microstructure are shown when these materials are processed using rapid forming [31] . SS316L, a type of austenitic steel, is known for its ease of machinability and weldability, in addition to high corrosion resistivity. Thus, its utilized in critical applications such as aerospace [32] . Microstructural characterization of SS316L reveals a unique hierarchical structure accompanied by sub-grain structures that result in high yield. The properties of the AM-produced steel parts heavily depend on the cooling approach (needed due to the high temperature involved in the printing), that occurs subsequent to the completion of the printing. For instance, low tensile strength is a characteristic of metal-cooled components, while brittleness is a characteristic of water-cooled components. On the other hand, air-cooling provides components that possess an adequate plastic properties and low tensile strengths [31] .  2.3.2 Aluminum and Magnesium alloys Aluminium (Al) alloys are attractive for AM as they are cost-effective and incur high thermal conductivity, facilitating a more facile and fast fabrication approach and minimizing thermal stresses compared to other metallic materials. However, various factors restrict the use of Al and its alloys to only a few AM techniques. The of volatile elements such as Zn, leads to poor weldability of Al alloys [33] . Among the commonly used Al alloys are AlSi10 and AlSi12. The aerospace engineering sector still requires lightweight materials with appreciable mechanical properties, making Al alloys highly sought after. Incorporating scandium into Al alloys beyond its eutectic point has enabled the development of materials highly demanded in aerospace applications. For instance, an Al alloy with added scandium exhibited a maximum tensile strength of 530 MPa. The material also demonstrated a high level of plasticity due to its ductile behaviour, reporting a reduction in cross-sectional area of 20 % and elongation of 14 % [34] . Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys find application in aerospace industries mainly as a replacement for heavier Al alloys owing to their lower density, lower weight, and promising strength attributes. For instance, Mg alloy AZ31 exhibits cycle fatigue resistance under 150 Mpa, outperforming the Al-based alloy 2017A [35] . Additionally, Mg alloys are considered alternatives to plastics due to their higher stiffness and comparable density. Doping Mg alloys with rare earth elements, enhances their corrosion resistance [36] . In addition, Mg alloys can be modified to enhance their mechanical properties through various methods, like composite conversion, grain size adjustments, and modification of surface layers. Despite the benefits of Mg alloys, they suffer from high oxidization and vulnerability mainly due to their hexagonal crystallographic structure. This has led to various processing issues reported by studies, such as the risk of ignition when loose materials like chips or powders are processed at elevated temperatures. This behaviour has limited the utilization of Mg alloys in the aerospace industry.  2.3.3 Titanium alloys Titanium (Ti) alloys are rapidly gaining popularity in the aerospace and automotive industries, due to their outstanding mechanical and chemical properties. Ti alloys are ideal for high temperature and strength applications such as steam turbine and engines’ blades and cases [37] . Manufacturing titanium alloy components using AM technologies offer several advantages over conventional techniques, especially due to the affinity of Ti alloys with cutting tool. Recently, several titanium-based alloys have attracted interest such as Ti6Al4V, Ti8Al1Er, TC11, TC21, and Ti5553 [38] . These alloys offer unique properties that make them promising candidates for various applications in aerospace field. Ti6Al4V alloy, also known as Ti64 alloy, is an α + β titanium alloy widely recognized and constitutes 50 % of the global titanium supply [39] . Ti64 possesses high-strength, resistance ti fatigue and corrosion, and low density make it a highly sought-after material in various industries, including aerospace, marine, energy, and automobile sectors. However, manufacturing Ti6Al4V alloys can be challenging due to its low thermal conductivity, susceptibility to strain hardening, and chemical reactivity. Conventional manufacturing techniques such as casting, forming, and metal removal techniques were previously used, but these methods often resulted in material waste, increased manufacturing costs, and longer lead times. As a more efficient alternative, additive manufacturing techniques are employed, offering the advantage of producing complex structures while addressing the mentioned challenges[40] . By using AM techniques, slightly higher densities can be achieved in as-deposited Ti alloys compared to conventional production methods. An alloy known as TC11 (Ti-6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr-0.3Si) is widely used in China for aerospace applications, particularly in compressor disks, due to its ability to resist high strains and stress during loading. An examination concentrated on the tensile potency of TC11 alloy produced via laser-based additive manufacturing, associating its strength with the arrangement of columnar grains and the texture oriented along the deposition axis[41] . Additionally, through annealing, other mechanical characteristics like strength and malleability were augmented, surpassing even the benchmarks set by traditional alloys. Continuous research efforts are currently underway concerning the TC21 alloy (composed of Ti–6Al–2Zr–2Sn–3Mo-1.5Cr–2Nb) and the Ti5553 alloy (comprising Ti–5Al–5Mo–5 V–3Cr). Evaluation of heat-treated TC21 samples in both horizontal and vertical orientations yielded distinct outcomes, where horizontal samples demonstrated heightened strength attributes, while vertical samples showcased enhanced elongation properties. These findings shed light on the potential applications and performance of these advanced titanium alloys in aerospace and other critical industries [42] . Ti5553 alloys, composed of Ti, Al, Vanadium (V), Molybdenum (Mo), and Chromium (Cr), exhibit significantly higher mechanical properties compared to other Ti-based alloys. With a tensile strength of 1400 Mpa and a yield strength of 1250 Mpa [10] , Ti5553 alloys are particularly well-suited for applications that require components with high stress resistance. These alloys find suitable use in critical parts including aircraft landing gears, fuselage, wings, helicopter rotors, and other parts that experience substantial mechanical loading. Fig. 4   shows 3D printed aerospace components using various Ti alloys [43] .  2.3.4 Nickel alloys Nickel-based alloys display excellent performance at elevated working temperatures, as their microstructure possess the ‘γ’ phase. These alloys are predominantly utilized in the production of critical components that operate at elevated temperatures and stress. For instance, Inconel 625 and 718 have been widely employed in the manufacturing of gas-turbine engines and compressors [38] . Another important Ni-based alloy, Invar, finds its use in applications where dimensional distortion due to temperature variations can’t be tolerated. This makes it suitable for precise applications such as electronics, optical and laser systems, and aircraft controls. Researchers, such as Yakout et al. [44] , have examined the physical and mechanical properties of Invar 36 fabricated through laser melting technique. The reported alloy achieved stable melting within the optimal range of laser energy densities, leading to an improved tensile and yield strengths, higher toughness, and elongation. Moreover, the density of the component was maximized, thereby reducing residual stresses. Avoiding the creation of voids and the vaporization of the elements that make up the alloy are among the key considerations during the fabrication of Invar 36 alloy. Paying attention to these aspects ensures the successful production of high-quality components using nickel-based alloys in additive manufacturing.  2.3.5 Other alloys High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of alloys formed by combining five or more metallic elements in equal atomic percentages or varying proportions, typically ranging from 5 % to 35 % [45] . The incorporation of multiple elements allows for the development of a wide range of alloys with diverse properties. These HEAs exhibit exceptional characteristics compared to conventional alloys, including high strength compared to their weight, ultimate tensile strength, fracture and oxidization resistance, thus improving the corrosion behaviour. The manufacturing techniques heavily affect the microstructure and phases of HEAs. Both Dendritic and interdendritic phases can be observed in HEAs, yet the interfaces between the phases affect the properties and deformation of HEAs. Further exploration and understanding of these aspects are essential for harnessing the full potential of high-entropy alloys in various technological applications. Magnetic alloys possess the ability to maintain a magnetic field over an extended period, making them ideal for functional components in various industries, including automobile, aerospace, and information technology. Additive manufacturing techniques have been investigated for the fabrication of magnetic alloys such as Ni–Fe–V, Ni-Fe-Mo [46] , Fe–30 %Ni [47] , and Fe–Si–B–Cu–Nb [48] , given their capability to produce intricate geometries in the energy sector. Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs) are a class of solid metallic materials with a disordered and amorphous atomic-scale structure. Unlike conventional alloy materials with regular microstructure patterns, BMGs have a randomly oriented microstructure. BMGs exhibit exceptional mechanical properties, but they also possess soft-magnetic characteristics. In order to conventionally produce these amorphous materials in the form of rods and sheets, large cooling rates (≈    100 K/s) is required. Hence, the utilization of AM technologies has been proposed as a plausible approach for creating complicated 3D shapes using BMGs. Research efforts have extensively investigated the properties of BMGs in relation to their manufacturing processes, such as casting and thermoplastic forming [49] . Since the amorphous structure is a defining characteristic of BMGs, precise control the annealing and cooling processes is essential. Metal matrix composites (MMCs) also provide properties similar to that of BMGs. Various traditional manufacturing technologies exist for fabricating MMCs, nevertheless, they are limited when it comes to producing complex structures. As a result, extensive research has been conducted to explore the feasibility of using additive manufacturing technologies to achieve outstanding properties in 3D complex MMC parts. Commonly used matrix materials include Al, Ag, Mg, Cu, Ti, Ni, and Fe, while reinforcements such as Al2 O3 , B4 C, BeO, graphite, Mo, SiC, NbC, TaC, TiB, TiC, W, and WC are utilized [50] . The development of Al-based metal matrix composites (MMCs) is a fascinating subject, especially for the aerospace sector. Xie et al. [51]  utilized cold spray (CS) to create Al7075 composites reinforced with TiB2  nanoparticles. The CS AM process successfully produced fully dense components, that showed higher micro-hardness and tensile strength compared to pure Al7075 components. Hu et al. [52]  employed laser-based AM to fabricate Al MMCs using borate whisker (Al18B4O3) as reinforcing elements, with an average length and diameter of 10–30 μm and 0.5–1 μm, respectively. The prepared MMC exhibited a substantial 65 % improvement in microhardness compared to pure Al. Table 4   provides a summary of various materials utilized in the additive manufacturing in the aerospace and automotive industry with an outlook on their advantages and disadvantages [15,53,54] . It can be seen that each material can be utilized for a specific application and function depending on the required properties and environment.    3 Additive manufacturing and 3D printing techniques Based on the feed, layer manufacturing process, and material, additive manufacturing process are classified into the following categories (Shown in Fig. 5  ): Direct Energy Deposition (DED), Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), Material Jetting, Binder Jetting, Material Extrusion, VAT Photopolymerisation, and Sheet Lamination. Generally, additive manufacturing processes can be carried for various materials (metal, alloys, plastic) and various material states (liquid, powder, solid). The various AM technologies are discussed in this section. 3.1 Direct energy deposition (DED) DED technique operates on the basis of melting material that is fed to a focal point on the build layer, usually occurring in inert atmosphere [55] . DED technologies are classified based on the feedstock (powder or wire) and based on the energy source (laser beams, electron beams, arcs, kinetic energy). DED technology manufactures the 3D model layer by layer, nonetheless, this technology can be used in a multiaxial machine and offer 3D positioning [56] . This feature allows for the creation of complex objects without the utilization of support structures. Fig. 6   shows the schematic of the DED method for both energy sources (laser and electron beams) [57] .The most common DED technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries are highlighted as follows. 3.1.1 Laser metal deposition (LMD) Laser Metal Deposition is an AM process where a laser beam is utilized to form a molten pool of metal powder on a metallic substrate (where powder is fed) or on an existing layer [58] . The powder melt can form a deposit which fusion bonds to the substrate. The metal parts are created, as the substrate is tracked on a pre-defined path. LMD is widespread as it allows for the fabrication of new parts, repair existing parts, and add engineering features to components.  3.1.2 Laser engineering Net-Shaping (LENS) Laser Engineering Net-Shaping (LENS) is similar to the LMD in where a molten pool is formed by a laser to catch the fed powder from the powder stream [59] . Once the laser moves away, the molten pool solidifies forming the first layer on the metallic substrate. The process is repeated to form a 3D object layer by layer. LENS is a versatile and industry-friendly process due to unique properties such as multi-material and functionally graded part fabrication.  3.1.3 Electron-Beam freeform fabrication (EBF3 ) Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3 ) is an AM process that is utilized to create near-net-shape parts. Similar to laser-based DED processes, EBF3  is carried in a vacuum chamber with an electron beam is constantly focused on the material feed to melt it and add another layer [60] . EBF3  requires less raw materials as compared to other manufacturing processes and offers scalable components limited only by the dimension of the vacuum chamber and availability of feedstock.  3.1.4 Wire Arc AM (WAAM) Wire Arc AM (WAAM) is a process that utilizes an electric arc as an energy source to deposit materials on a layer-by-layer basis [61] . Compared to laser-based AM techniques, WAAM possesses a higher deposition rate, lower equipment cost, a better material utilization ratio and a more environmentally friendly production process.   3.2 Powder bed fusion (PBF) PBF techniques operate on the principle of locally melting metal powder on a substrate to create layers [62,63] . Once a layer is formed, a new layer of powder will be distributed with the help of a roller. The un-melted powder can be reused as a support for the consecutive layer, eliminating the need for a support structure. Most of the PBF techniques utilize inert gases or vacuum chambers to eliminate the oxidation of the powder. Compared to DED technologies, PBF processes can create passages and provide parts with a higher fidelity build features [64] . Fig. 7   show the schematic of the powder bed fusion technique [65] . The most widespread PBF technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries are highlighted as follows. 3.2.1 Selective laser melting (SLM) Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a technique that employes a laser to completely melt and fuse metallic powders to create near net-shape parts with up to 99.9 % relative density [66] . The particles are joined together when the laser beam hits the thin layer of the material. Parts manufactured through the SLM process are characterized by their complex structures and geometries and their durability and high strength.  3.2.2 Selective laser sintering (SLS) Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is technique that is quite similar to SLM, with the difference that in the SLS process the plastic powder is fused using a high-power density laser where in the SLM process the plastic powder is melted then fused.  3.2.3 Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is a process that produces high-performance parts with significantly high mechanical properties. Similar to SLS, a high-power density laser is utilized to sinter the metallic powder [67] . DMLS can produce complex geometries that is quite to achieve with other metal manufacturing methods.  3.2.4 Electron beam melting (EBM) Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is an AM process identical to laser-based process with the distinction of utilizing an electron beam as an energy source to sinter the powder feedstock [68] . EBM is employed only for metallic and alloy parts, and the process occurs in high vacuum chamber to avoid oxidation. Although EBM provides a high throughput, it comes at the expense of lowering the accuracy and surface quality.   3.3 Binder jetting The binder jetting AM process requires a powder-based material and a binder. The liquid-based binder acts as an adhesive between the powder layers [69] . A 3D nozzle moves along a path depositing alternative layers of powder material and binding material, thus creating an object layer by layer. Since the method relies on binding, the resulting material is not suitable for structural parts, and although the printing process is quite fast, the long post processing time adds length to the overall process [69] .  3.4 Material jetting (PolyJet) The Material Jetting process operates in the same manner as a 2D printers, where materials are jetted onto the build platform using continuous or drop on demand approaches [70] . In the process, a printhead disposes droplets of material that solidifies under UV light, building the object layer by layer. Objects created with material jetting are characterized by very smooth surface finishes with high dimensional accuracy.  3.5 Material Extrusion In the material extrusion process, the feedstock comprising of metal powder and polymeric binder filament is heated until softened and can be extruded through a nozzle [71] . The printing material is then deposited on a heated printing bed to improve the adhesion between material and the bed, thus creating the 3D object layer by layer. The most common material extrusion technique is the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is famous as it doesn’t require a high energy source as compared to laser-based and electron beam-based AM methods.  3.6 Vat Photopolymerisation VAT Photopolymerisation also known as Stereolithography (SLA) is one the of the first AM techniques to be commercialized and patented. SLA is process of creating of 3D object through the utilization of a laser than illuminates and cures a liquid photopolymer resin layer by layer [72] . SLA can provide 3D objects with fine features and a good surface finish. Multi Jet Modeling (MJM) and Rapid Freeze Prototyping (RFP) are common VAT Photopolymerisation techniques.  3.7 Sheet lamination Sheet Lamination is an AM process that comprises of layer-by-layer bonding of thin sheets of material usually fed through a system of feed rollers [73] . Sheet lamination can utilize various materials such as paper, polymer, or metal, hence the process can also accommodate various binding methods. Sheet lamination is one of the least accurate AM methods, but it has the advantages of being low cost and fast. Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) and Ultrasonic Consolidation are widespread sheet lamination methods. Table 5   provides a summary of various AM techniques and methods [74–76] .   4 Additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry AM technologies have been utilized in the aerospace industries for decades. Generally, the material associated with aerospace parts can be divided into metallic and polymer components depending on the criticality of the part. The two biggest companies in the industry: Boeing and Airbus have both employed AM techniques for the manufacturing and repair of several part [56] . For instance, Boeing has manufactured upwards of 20,000 parts using AM technologies [77] . Recently, the employment of AM fabricated titanium-alloy parts saved Boeing around $ 2–3 million per airplane [78] . Airbus also has its fair share of AM fabricated components, especially metallic brackets and bleed pipes [79] . Moreover, spaces agencies such as NASA and SpaceX are currently exploring the feasibility of utilizing AM igniters, injectors, and combustion chambers on their rocket engines. Materials for the aerospace industry ought to be lightweight with high strength in order to reduce emission, save fuel and adhere to the safety requirements. Thus, the design of aerospace components involves the minimization of the material used and resulting in an increase in the complexity of the structure, function, and property of the parts. AM technologies can be utilized for freeform fabrication, where virtually any component shape can be printed. As compared to traditional fabrication methods, AM technology with its layer-by-layer approach is able to fabricate more versatile parts with optimized weight and strength [80] . The AM technology in aerospace can be divided into: Direct Part Manufacturing, rapid tooling, prototyping and repair and restoration. 4.1 Direct part manufacturing Direct part manufacturing refers to the fabrication of critical components utilized in aircraft such as nozzles, engines and combustion chambers, and non-critical components such as brackets, fixtures, and accessories. Currently, plenty of aircraft parts are being fabricated using AM technologies. For instance, the engine combustion chamber of IN718 helicopter has been created using AM technique [81] . Research at NASA has also been geared towards the employment of AM technologies for the fabrication of rocket engine components [82] . SLM technique was utilized to fabricate turbine blades comprised of Inconel and chrome, in addition to engine housing, vents, and ducts [83,84] . Nozzles of a leap engine can be produced by the FBD process, resulting in a 5-fold increase in the lifetime [56] . AM technology is a great candidate for the manufacturing for heat exchangers and heat sinks as it requires less skilled labor and less time as compared to brazing (conventional method for manufacturing heat exchangers) and offers higher degrees of freedom and flexibility than CNC (conventional method for manufacturing heat sinks) [54] . For example, a 3D printed nozzle from aerospace grade alloy showed great safety and heat resistance under extreme conditions [85] . In addition, due to the flexibility of printing complex geometries using AM technologies, the heat transfer through the heat exchanger fins can be enhanced as it is directly proportional to the complexity of the part geometry [86–88] . Aircraft brackets and structures are components that greatly benefit from AM techniques. PBF and DED methods can be employed to fabricate structures and brackets made of titanium grade 5 as they offer flexible design and easy manufacturing process [89,90] . An aluminum alloy Sentinel satellite’s antenna bracket fabricated with AM technology reported a weight reduction of 40 % [91] . Airplanes ribs, cabin brackets, support brackets and even windshield designs can all be fabricated using AM [54] . Recently, AM technology has been employed to fabricate the structure of a miniature satellite. Usually, the fabrication period of the structure through AM technologies is around 2 days, which is much less than the time required utilizing conventional manufacturing techniques [92,93] . EBM was employed to fabricate a titanium bracket for a spacecraft and reported 30 % weight reduction [94] . While another bracket reported a mass reduction of 46 % [94] . The biggest advantage of using AM in part manufacturing is the consolidation of multiple parts into a single part capable of performing the same functions at a lower cost and longer lifetime. For instance, a 248-part propulsion module was compressed to a singular module using the DMLS process [95] . DMLS has also been used to fabricate a flow measurement device capable of withstanding supersonic and subsonic conditions [96] . Non-metal parts can also be fabricated using AM technologies. For example, misprinted seat signs and maintenance manual fixtures are manufactured through the FDM process [97,98] , while through the SLA process repair kits can be fabricated with the advantage of reducing maintenance downtime [99] . Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV) or drones are the newest sector for the utilization of AM technology in the aerospace industry. AM is used to fabricate either complete drones or certain components. PolyJet process has been used for the rapid testing of UAV wings [100] . Employing AM is UAV manufacturing helps reduce the amount of materials yet maintaining and even improving the strength of the structure due to the use of complex structures such as honeycombs [101] . Another advantage of AM is the time saving aspect in the manufacturing process, where a fixed-wing UAV will take around 3 h to be printed, whereas it requires around 3–4 to be manufactured using conventional methods [102] . Postprocessing is usually required for parts and components manufactured through AM. This post process can be done through hybrid manufacturing, which combines additive and subtractive manufacturing into a single operation [103–105] . The subtractive manufacturing can be done through CNC milling. The use of such systems can reduce the number of productions steps and streamline the manufacturing process.  4.2 Rapid tooling Rapid tooling describes the manufacturing of tools and patterns needed to fabricate parts and components. Rapid tooling can be divided into direct rapid tooling such as molds and dies, and indirect rapid tooling such as mold patterns. The advantage of using AM for tooling manufacturing is the decrease of the production time and the number of skilled people required [106] . Through the use of direct rapid tooling, molds and patterns can be easily fabricated via AM processes. As for indirect rapid tooling, AM technologies are used to fabricate a temporary model. Subsequently, sand or ceramic mold is created for the casting of the metal part. One popular process is reconfigurable tooling, which allows the reuse of molds due to the presence of state-changing materials in the creation process. For example, splashes and tools of wing shapes were produced through this process [107] . Comparing direct and indirect rapid tooling, the number of steps is less for direct tooling and the overall part density is more effectively preserved.  4.3 Prototyping AM first came to light in the aerospace industry as merely a prototyping technology. Prototyping is the process of fabricating nonfunctioning parts that can be utilized for the verification of simulation models of aircraft parts and components. Prototypes aid in the discovery of design drawbacks and malfunctions that can only appear through a physical model. Prototypes can be used to test and verify the streamlines around the airfoils and fuselage components. In most cases, prototypes do not necessarily have to be produced from the actual part material, yet they need to have a certain degree of rigidity and fidelity to be able to reflect accurate testing results [108–110] . AM processes such as SLA and FDM can produce prototypes with such requirements. The advantage of these processes is the utilization of polymer-based materials rather than metal-based ones, yielding fast and cost-effective methods to validate the physical features. Recently, PolyJet was utilized to fabricate prototypes to test several wing designs for UAV applications. Through rapid prototyping, the propulsion, operation, aerodynamics, and structure of the design can be assessed and analyzed. Moreover, the use of AM techniques saves on the lead time and design cycles [111] . An Airbus UAV was manufactured in a time of 8 weeks due to the rapid prototyping tests with a protype made up of 90 % from polyamide powder. The FDM process is usually employed for the fabrication of prototypes that do not need to be of high quality, especially in the early stages of the design [112,113] .  4.4 Repair and restoration Metallic and non-metallic parts of aircraft can be repaired and restored using AM technologies, which allows for the reuse of the parts rather than scraping them. In most cases this allows for cost saving and a smaller environmental footprint when compared to conventional processes [114] . The restoration process can be divided into geometry restoration and structural integrity restoration. Geometry restoration is the process of restoring missing or torn geometry of aircraft components. With the advancements in the AM technology, especially DED, this process can be carried easily and with great cost savings [115] . Commercially, a T700 blisk was repaired from erosion damage using DED technology [116] . Moreover, a low-wattage repair method was applied to restore titanium components with minimal distortion yielding it effective for aircraft components [117] . Compressor blades tips were also repaired using AM technology resulting in an increase of the engine performance [100] . Structural restoration involves the enhancing of the structural integrity of components, which includes the repair of cracks and corrosive damage using SPD [118] . For instance, titanium SPD was utilized to chafe the damage on a hydraulic line and applied to overlapping joints to prevent corrosive damage [118] . Another application for parts restoration is the repair of compressors, turbines, blades, and combustor coatings using AM processes such as LMD and DMD [119] .   5 Additive manufacturing in the automotive industry The automotive industry has been shifting towards sustainable and green solutions through electrical vehicles and advancements in the battery system [120] . The utilization of 3D printing and additive manufacturing in the automotive industry is heavily linked to prototyping and tooling. Almost all of the commercial vehicle companies depend on AM technologies for prototyping as they provide a quick, cost effective, and environmental solution to test the performance of concept ideas and new designs. For instance, in the case of recalls, 3D printing techniques can be utilized for the fabrication of a prototype and an actual replacement part, thus saving on time, money, and labor [121,122] . Recently, car companies such as Porsche used AM technologies to manufacture spare parts like pistons and classic car items. This process proved to be more cost effective than conventional methods as the parts can be printed on demand hence saving on storage space and freeing up manufacturing lines [123] . In addition, the presence of AM technologies allows for the customization of certain cars resulting in a niche market of “Bespoke car design”. Rolls Royce are leading the industry in this regard, where around 30–40 % of customers opt to purchase a custom model and create their bespoke vehicle based on 3D printed components and structures [124] . Moreover, most automotive manufactures have been working towards the reduction of the vehicle weight to increase the fuel efficiency. Aluminum alloy parts manufactured through AM technologies show a weight reduction of 40–80 % as compared to parts that are manufactured conventionally [121] . This weight reduction will increase fuel efficiency, reduce waste materials, carbon footprint and overall cost of production. This is the first step towards the realization of fully 3D printed vehicles. Although the technology is not mature enough, continues research and experiments are being conducted to reach the potential of the AM technologies.  6 Opportunities and limitations of AM technology The utilization of AM technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries has numerous advantages, which are depicted in Fig. 8  . Starting with the rapid prototyping process that revolutionized the industry since prototypes can be printed almost immediately. When compared to machine prototyping, AM offers a less expensive and a quicker method allowing for a faster design change. As for the design of the parts, AM techniques offer flexible design that cannot be achieved by traditional methods. The fabricated parts can be manufactured from metals or polymers, allowing for lightweight and high strength. The reduction in weight is extremely vital in the aerospace and automotive industries as it lowers fuel consumption. Another advantage is the print on demand approach, thus saving on storage spaces and production costs. Although print on demand may seem inefficient as it does not allow for contingency, the fast design and production can solve this issue as parts can be ready in a matter of hours. With that approach, component production requires only the material needed for the component, with minimum waste. The production is done through a single step, and in turn saving on cost, time, and resources. Hence, the AM approaches are indefinitely environmentally friendly. As is the case with all manufacturing techniques, AM technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries suffer from certain disadvantages as depicted in Fig. 9  . Although 3D printing can be utilized to print plastic and metal parts, the raw materials selection is quite small as plenty of metals and plastics cannot be temperature controlled for the 3D printing process. In addition, there is a limit on the number of parts that can be 3D printed, which depends on the chamber size of the 3D printer. Shifting to mass production, the cost per unit for AM technologies is still higher as compared to traditional manufacturing methods such as injection molding. Most of the parts manufactured through AM technologies require post processing operations such as cleaning to eliminate support materials and smooth the outer finishes. To overcome the design inaccuracies, post process operations like water jetting, sanding, chemical soak and wash, and heat drying are employed. The amount of post processing needed can vary based on the part’s size, its application, and the AM technology used. Thus, although the printing process might be fast and effortless, the post processing increases the overall manufacturing time and slows down the process.  7 The role of AM in achieving SDGs Fig. 10   lists all of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [125] . The role of AM technologies in achieving the SDGs, especially SDGs 7,8,9,11,12, and 13, are discussed in this section. SDG 7 highlights that expanding the availability of electricity as well as other energy sources is essential for enhancing people's communities and lives. It attempts to achieve energy efficiency and advancement of clean energy sources in order to handle resources for development in a sustainable manner [126] . Based on World Commission on Environment and Development studies, industries including aerospace, energy production, and automotive are required to establish sustainable technologies. This necessitates a transition toward more efficient manufacturing methods that reduce material waste, releases of greenhouse gases (GHGs), natural resource extraction, and ecosystem disruptions. 3D printing and AM technologies can decrease the overall primary energy consumption as well as CO2  emissions for all industries under concern, including aerospace fuel requirements and aerospace manufacturing. This decrease is predicted to reach 9–35 % and 8–19 %, in the overall energy supply and CO2  concentrations in 2025, respectively [127] . Since 3D printed products can be created in any form, automobile parts can be developed with sparse interior formations, resulting in lighter parts than those manufactured using traditional manufacturing techniques. The fabrication of lightweight parts will in turn decrease the CO2  emission, as the vehicles transporting such parts will consume less fuels.. Furthermore, the automobiles themselves will be lighter, requiring less energy to operate, reducing the user money while also significantly lowering CO2  emissions in the long-term [128] . SDG 8 emphasizes the value of long-term economic expansion and elevated stages of economic productivity in creating well-paying, high-quality jobs, in addition to resource efficiency in consumption and production. It also advocates for full employment and decent jobs for everyone, as well as the abolition of forced labour, human trafficking, child labour, and the establishments of labour rights, healthy and secure workplaces [129] . 3D printing enables designers to attain high levels of accuracy while lowering costs, which is expected to increase its supply in the aerospace applications. The more effective production techniques may decrease production as well as transportation duration and expenses to the point where notable economic and financial advantages can be distributed across the whole value chain [130] . In 2019, over 1300 new passenger aircraft were created in the United States alone. The growing number of aircrafts becoming produced is expected to drive economic growth [131] . Consumer products and automotive manufacturing are among the two largest reasonably applied markets for 3D printing, accounting for 86 % of the overall manufacturing sector. However, because of issues with printing massive production volumes, 3D printing is still viewed as a specialized tool in such markets by 2025 [132] . The targets of SDG 9 is to create action to build resilient infrastructure, encourage sustainable and equitable industrialization, and promote innovation [133] . The importance of economic growth as a major factor affecting the environment is widely acknowledged, leading to a reassessment of its central role in our economic models. In developed countries, an increase in material wealth does not necessarily translate into higher levels of well-being and living standards. It is essential to distinguish and acknowledge essential aspects of well-being, life satisfaction, and prosperity beyond merely measuring the quantity of products and services generated by the economy [134] . Companies are interested in 3D printing in order to improve their supply chains, increase flexibility and establish more innovative product creation methods. The growing investment in 3D printing, coupled with the recognition of its potential as a viable alternative to traditional manufacturing, has spurred a strong desire for closer collaboration within the network to promote its widespread adoption. Manufacturing executives also acknowledge the potential for increased innovation, as 3D printing facilitates mass customization of new products while reducing waste and supporting sustainable economic growth [135] . Furthermore, the benefits of 3D printing extend beyond its impact on the global market and hold significant potential for environmental protection and the advancement of a globally sustainable economy [136] . Due to the increasing number of people living in urban areas and the expected rise in the percentage of urban residents in the overall population, achieving sustainable urbanization is a significant concern for many nations. The UN has identified this as a critical issue through SDG 11, which focuses on urban areas and includes 10 specific goals and 15 indicators. These targets and indicators are designed to facilitate sustainable changes in urban areas [137] . The targets specified under SDG 11 create a chance to utilize the transformative power of cities for sustainable development and innovation. As of now, around 193 countries are supporting the worldwide initiative to promote cities that are both sustainable and resilient. This initiative aims to create cities and human settlements that are safe, inclusive, sustainable, and resilient by the year 2030. As the international community endorsed a specific goal for cities, known as the ‘urban SDG’, they acknowledged that urbanization could be a powerful driver of development [138] . The automotive industry is a source of concern due to the pollution resulting from both its manufacturing processes and CO2  emissions generated from cars, as well as the waste produced at the end of their life cycle [139] . For instance, the European Union produces over 6 million tons of materials and components from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) annually. This amount of waste generated sparked a widespread interest among governments, leading them to become increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of vehicles throughout their entire lifespan. In the early 2000 s, approximately 25 % of the materials obtained from ELVs were disposed of through landfills or incineration for energy production, mainly due to the unavailability of sustainable recycling options for certain components [140] . For this reason, 3D printing technology has been introduced to the automotive and aerospace industry to provide significant positive impacts on the community as a whole. This technology has enhanced the sustainability and resilience of communities by reducing waste, promoting recycling, minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, and sustaining energy consumption [127,141] . The advantages offered by 3D printing aids in providing lighter, more resilient, and robust parts with approximately zero waste utilized in the aerospace industry [142] . As a result, 3D printing presents an opportunity to recycle materials in an environmentally friendly and efficient manner within the framework of a circular economy [143] . Furthermore, the utilization of 3D printing has the potential to prolong the lifespan of various car parts and enable the incorporation of recycled materials to fabricate tailor-made vehicle parts [144] . Hence, several automotive corporations are incorporating 3D printing into their operations. For example, Ford Europe currently employs 3D printers to manufacture car components using sand and nylon powder [139] . Similarly, Local Motors utilizes 3D printing to generate roughly 90 % of the components required for their vehicle assembly process [145] . In general, 3D printing is integrated in the automotive industry to promote recycling and reduce material waste. Most specifically, 3D printing facilitates the recycling and reusing of polymersin the automotive industry. In fact, studies have shown that it is feasible to use recycled ABS and PC in 3D printing to produce parts through the process of extrusion [143,146,147] . SDG 12 focuses on establishing sustainable consumption and production behaviors, which are critical for sustaining both present and future generations' living standards. Uncontrolled consumption and production processes are at the core of the three earth's problems of climate change, biodiversity destruction, and pollution. These problems, as well as the resulting environmental pollution, negatively influence human well-being and the attainment of the SDGs [148] . It is technologically possible to reintegrate and reuse polymers frequently utilized in the automotive market, including acrylonitrile ABS and PC. As such, it was indicated that 3D printing can extrude and create parts from recyclable ABS and PC [139] . Kreiger et al. [149]  performed a lifecycle assessment and discovered that a distributed model for generating filament from waste requires less energy compared to traditional manufacture, owing primarily to transportation, with savings of up to 80 %. 3D printing has captured the scientific community's interest, with some researchers considering that it could have a significant impact in sustainable production via recycling and lean production [139] . The Paris Agreement is the primary global framework aimed at achieving SDG 13. Both the Paris Agreement and SDG 13 share the objective of limiting the global temperature rise to below 2 °C. This is because a temperature increase beyond 2 °C would have severe consequences on the community as a whole. The average global temperature has already increased by 1.1 °C beyond pre-industrial levels due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. This enhancement in temperature has resulted in more recurring extreme weather disasters as well as rising sea levels. In order to address these challenges, SDG 13 was established to urgently resist climate change and its impacts while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions [150] . The role of 3D printing in the automotive and aerospace industry has led to substantial reductions in the CO2  emissions and energy utilization (from 38 % up to 75 %) [141] . These reductions have lessened the contribution of the automotive and aerospace industry to global warming. Furthermore, 3D printing offers several advantages in terms of waste generation reduction. 3D printing reduces material waste by removing non-essential and extra materials that are typically involved in conventional manufacturing processes [142] . Conventional manufacturing processes are associated with several drawbacks, such as material waste, residual stresses, complexity, large supp chains, design inflexibility, and increased CO2  emissions [151,152] . These processes account for around 20 % of the global CO2  pollutants (3)[153] . In contrast, 3D printing-based manufacturing largely eliminates these issues and enables the use of biodegradable and reusable materials for production [154] . As a result, replacing 3D printing by conventional manufacturing processes reduces CO2  emissions by 5 % by the year 2025 [132] . Moreover, the implementation of 3D printing technology has resulted in an overall reduction of 130.5–525.5 metric tons (Mt) of emissions, with aerospace fuels experiencing a reduction of 9–35 % and aerospace manufacturing experiencing a reduction of 8–19 %. Additionally, the aerospace manufacturing industry has experienced a significant reduction in resource utilization and waste generation due to the implementation of 3D printing technology, which incorporates a buy-to-fly ratio of almost 1:1 [155] . Furthermore, 3D printing also allows for the reuse of 95–98 % of raw material and can lead to a material waste reduction of 40 % [156] . Fig. 11   shows the impact of the AM technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries on the SDGs.  8 Conclusion Additive Manufacturing and 3D printing technologies have revolutionized engineering processes, especially in complex and specialized industries such as aerospace and automotive. Evolving from a technology merely used for prototyping to a technology utilized in every aspect of the industry, AM can be employed to fabricate parts, components, tools and for repair and restoration. AM has the advantage of creating lightweight parts with flexible design and minimum waste. Moreover, the parts are quickly printed on demand which allows for a cost effective and environmentally friendly manufacturing process. Nevertheless, AM technologies suffer from limited materials, restricted size, and design inaccuracies. All of these limitations can address through post processing operations, but a trade off on the manufacturing time will be present. In term of sustainability and achieving SDGS, AM technologies have a high positive impact on SDGs related to industry innovation and infrastructure, sustainable cities, responsible consumption and production, and climate action. AM also positively affects the affordable and clean energy and contribute to the decent work and economic growth. It is evident that 3D printing, and additive manufacturing are quickly becoming the favourite manufacturing techniques, especially for industries with forward thinking decision makers. Weighing the advantages of AM technologies prove that they will be the manufacturing pillars in upcoming industrial revolutions.
