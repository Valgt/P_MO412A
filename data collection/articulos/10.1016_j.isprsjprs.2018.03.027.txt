Over the next fifteen years, with these new Goals that universally apply to all, countries will mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind. (United Nations)  It was considered timely therefore for the inclusion of a Special Theme Section of the ISPRS Journal for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing covering topics on contributions that the photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial information sciences can make towards achieving the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which are shown in Fig. 1  . It is certain that some of the 17 SDGs can be enhanced by the addition of information and knowledge gained from the technologies of the photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial information sciences. While not limiting the topics covered by submitted papers, the call for papers for this special theme section included: contributions to food security, improvements in nutrition and sustainable agriculture; water quality for consumption and agriculture; water sanitation and maintenance; development of sustainable and liveability cities; sustainable industry; contributions to monitoring and management of the effects of climate change; measurement of air quality and studies of air pollution; contributions towards sustainable energy production; sustainable uses of the oceans and marine resources; sustainable management of forests; infrastructure development for urban and rural areas; and regional spatial data infrastructure development and information sharing for decision making. As an example, there is clearly a great deal of work required to achieve Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities  by 2030. As urban populations continue to grow, the sustainability of urban environments becomes increasingly important. Rees and Wackernagel (1996)  for example believed that the end of the 20th century was a turning point in the history of human civilization. They conclude that ‘no city or urban region can achieve sustainability on its own’ because cities depend on resources from the hinterland, stretching from nearby areas to globally through exports and imports. Therefore ‘a prerequisite for sustainable cities is sustainable use of the global hinterland’. On the other hand, advantages of city living include economies of scale, possibilities of reduced energy consumption and recycling, amongst others. Nevertheless, they question the ability of humans to make positive steps to achieve more sustainable living. Alberti (1996)  also stated that cities alter the local and global environment, because they alter the land and import vast amounts of food, water and energy, and export waste. Sustainability of urban environments can be assessed using sustainability indicators (SI), which were defined and discussed in Trinder (2016) , based on Becker (1997) and Harrington et al. (1993) , as ‘an exact measurement of single factors and their combination into meaningful parameters’ and indicators ‘as an expression of complex situations by a variable that compresses information into a more readily understandable form’. Many examples of SI have been provided in literature for a range of aspects of urban and cities environments, but no consensus has been reached on appropriate indicators that could apply to Goal 11. As well, the call for papers for this special section has not uncovered any contributions towards the development of SI for sustainable cities. Another example is reducing risk of disaster and increasing resilience of cities and communities, which contributes to Goals 11 , 13 , 14  and 15 . A number of publications have illustrated that geo-information technologies can greatly contribute to rapid and objective damage and loss estimation, facilitate preparedness and training of civil protection institutions and communities, and support emergency response activities. Altan et al. (2010, 2013 ) provided a number of best practices and analyses on the value of geo-information technology for monitoring and coping with natural hazards and disasters. Still much more coordination activities regarding sharing geoinformation technologies (sensors, data and services) at national and international levels need to take place to protect and sustain life on land and under water as a reaction to climate change. Other goals will require close attention to sustainability indicators in their achievement. Achieving Goal 1: Eradicate poverty  will require the development of appropriate indicators that assess environmental impacts as the prosperity of communities improve. While UN decisions are based on international politics, the achievement of the SDGs as stated above, require actions of individual countries to ‘mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change’ . In the view of the editors, the geospatial sciences can make very significant contributions to achieving the SDGs while contributing to the maintenance of sustainability of the environment. It is hoped that more papers on the topic will be included in this journal in the future. While a number of good papers were submitted to the Journal for review for this theme section, only three papers satisfied the reviewers and therefore were acceptable for inclusion in the Journal. The three papers provide examples of applications of geoinformatics that can contribute to achieving the SDGs in the future. The three accepted papers are:• Geoinformatics for the Conservation and Promotion of Cultural Heritage in Support of The UN Sustainable Development Goals,  by Wen Xiao, Jon Mills, Gabriele Guidi, Pablo Rodríguez-Gonzálvez, Sara Gonizzi Barsanti, Diego González-Aguilera, from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, University of Salamanca, Avila, Spain and Universidad de León, Ponferrada, Spain. As a contribution to SDGs 11 and 8 this paper provides details for the protection and safeguarding of cultural heritage of developed and developing countries, as well as the promotion of sustainable tourism. An analysis of three case studies concludes that the contribution of geoinformatics to the achievement of cultural heritage SDGs is necessary, significant and evident.  • Slavery from Space: Demonstrating the Role for Satellite Remote Sensing to Inform Evidence-Based Action Related to UN SDG Number 8  by Doreen S. Boyd, Bethany Jackson, Jessica Wardlaw, Giles M. Foody and Kevin Bales from University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. This paper is also a contribution to SDG 8, and was directed at ending modern slavery based on new and innovative approaches, with an emphasis on efficient use of resources. The paper demonstrates the fundamental role that remote sensing has played in estimating of the number of Brick Kilns across the Brick Belt, that runs across south Asia, and which are known sites of modern-day slavery. The paper states ‘there are global benefits to ending slavery - this will mean a better world for everyone: safer, greener, more prosperous, and more equal’.  • Physical Resources Assessment in a Semi-Arid Watershed: An Integrated Methodology for Sustainable Land Use Planning  by Balasubramani Karuppusamy, Central University of Tamil Nadu, India. The paper contributes to SDG 2: No Hunger , by providing a method for the application of geoinformatics technologies to evaluate physical resources of semi-arid watersheds, which is a methodology that would also be applicable elsewhere. The paper suggests strategies for coping with sustainable agricultural practices for the present and future based on an integrated methodology, which would be especially applicable for developing countries.
