                  Sustainable development serves as a guiding principle, striving to achieve human development goals while ensuring that natural systems can support essential ecosystem services and resources. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, accepted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, offers a unifying framework for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, both now and in the future. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include specific targets and indicators, helping to assess a country's progress towards achieving the goals. To evaluate the EU (European Union) countries' alignment with the SDGs, this study develops a group decision-making approach by integrating DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), MARCOS (Measurements Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution), and an optimization model. A DEA is a highly suitable procedure for evaluating the performance of multiple peer entities, often referred to as Decision-making Units (DMUs) or alternatives. On the other hand, the benefits of MARCOS are: (i) it considers both the ideal (ID) and anti-ideal (AID) scenarios and, (ii) it exemplifies the utility degree of each option in association to ID and AID. Lastly, the combination of cross-entropy and divergence measures effectively deal with the information loss occurred during the determining the weights of considered criteria. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model is more sensible and practical. According to the final results, Austria stands out as the top performer among the EU countries in implementing the SDGs and achieving favorable outcomes.

Problem identification and motivation Potential evaluation of European Union nations to evaluates the progress of EU countries towards achieving SDGs.  2. Define the objectives of a solution To investigate the positions of EU countries towards achieving SDGs using a hybrid MCDM method.  3. Design and development A unique DEA-MARCOS approach with an optimization model is devised to address decision-making challenges where DEA is used to identify the efficient alternatives and MARCOS is used to generate the ranking positions of the efficient alternatives. The optimization model comprises both maximum deviation measure and dispersion measure, and is used to determine the weight values of criteria.  4. Demonstration The applicability of the DEA-MARCOS technique is demonstrated through a real-life case study that evaluates the progress of EU countries towards achieving SDGs.  5.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, accepted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, offers a unifying framework for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, both now and in the future. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include specific targets and indicators, helping to assess a country's progress towards achieving the goals. To evaluate the EU (European Union) countries' alignment with the SDGs, this study develops a group decision-making approach by integrating DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), MARCOS (Measurements Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution), and an optimization model. A DEA is a highly suitable procedure for evaluating the performance of multiple peer entities, often referred to as Decision-making Units (DMUs) or alternatives. On the other hand, the benefits of MARCOS are: (i) it considers both the ideal (ID) and anti-ideal (AID) scenarios and, (ii) it exemplifies the utility degree of each option in association to ID and AID. Lastly, the combination of cross-entropy and divergence measures effectively deal with the information loss occurred during the determining the weights of considered criteria. Therefore, the proposed hybrid model is more sensible and practical. According to the final results, Austria stands out as the top performer among the EU countries in implementing the SDGs and achieving favorable outcomes.

However, this development has also led to significant global challenges that may threaten the well-being of future generations. The exponential growth of consumerism and the escalating impact of industrial production in the 1960s and 1970s have disrupted the natural balance and put immense pressure on the environment and natural resources (Blewitt, 2014 ). In response to these pressing issues, scientists and experts worldwide have emphasized the importance of ecological and environmental preservation, giving rise to the concept of sustainability. Originally focused on the relationship between development and the environment, the idea of sustainability has evolved to encompass all aspects of development, including economic, social, and environmental components (Rogers et al., 2012 ). The Brundtland report in 1987 defined sustainable development as meeting current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (Sachs, 2012; HÃ¡k et al., 2016; Pinto et al., 2017 ). While the goals pursued in the 1990s had their merits, today's objectives have shifted due to the impact of globalization, especially driven by advancements in information and communication technologies, leading to new economic, environmental, and social challenges (Elliott, 2012 ). The United Nations introduced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000 to outline key priorities for sustainable development. These goals aimed to address issues such as environmental concerns, poverty, hunger, and gender inequality by 2015. Progress towards the MDGs varied among countries and objectives. As the MDGs reached their culmination, a new focus emerged on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), embodied in the "Agenda 2030," which was agreed upon by UN Member States in 2015. The core of Agenda 2030 consists of 17 SDGs that call for global cooperation to enhance the global condition. The SDGs comprise 17 goals, with goals 1â6 carrying over from the MDGs and goals 7â17 addressing contemporary sustainability challenges. Each goal is associated with 5â12â¯targets, totaling approximately 303 indicators to monitor and assess progress towards the established objectives (HÃ¡k et al., 2016 ). To ensure the scientific validity of the goals and indicators, thorough development and evaluation discussions were conducted (Ritschelova, 2015 ; ICSU and ISSC, 2015 ; Pereira et al., 2021 ). Final findings suggest that about 17â¯% of the proposed targets may require revision (HÃ¡k et al., 2016 ), and the SD Solution Network (SDSN) has recommended 100 Global Monitoring indicators as reliable benchmarks. Some scholars caution that overlooking connections between the aims could lead to unintended and contradictory outcomes (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Eight years ago, the "Agenda 2030" was released, marking the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Several studies have since examined the progress made on various SDGs. One such focus has been on under-5 child mortality, both in national, regional, and global contexts (Liu et al., 2016 ). Investigations into newborn and under-5 child mortality in Africa and child mortality in China between 1996 and 2015 have been crucial in evaluating the significance of reaching the SDGs (Golding et al., 2017; He et al., 2017 ). Additionally, researchers have projected maternal mortality from 1990 to 2015 in the context of the SDGs (Alkema et al., 2016 ). Efforts to achieve the SDGs necessitate substantial resources to strengthen health systems in low-and middle-income countries (Stenberg et al., 2017 ). Authors likeÂ Fullman et al. (2017)  and Lozano et al. (2018)  further explored health-related advancements. Moyer and Bohl (2019)  examined policy frameworks' impact on SDGs implementation, while Pedercini et al. (2018)  highlighted the importance of simulation integrated models for SDGs strategy development. Salvia et al. (2019)  assessed the achievements from local and global perspectives, and Mohammed et al. (2016)  investigated the relationship between smart growth and meeting sustainability targets. Various aspects related to the accomplishment of the SDGs have been covered, including land degradation (Sims et al., 2019 ), sustainable well-being (Costanza et al., 2016 ), renewable energyÂ (Schwerhoff and Sy, 2017 ), and life below the ocean (Singh et al., 2018 ). Allen et al. (2020)  evaluated Australia's progress toward achieving the SDGs using established methodologies. It's important to note that these research publications have focused on specific SDGs rather than all 17 of them. Considering the breadth of the SDGs, assessing progress toward their achievement can be viewed as a MultipleÂ Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. While numerous MCDM approaches are available in the literature, selecting the best one can be challengingÂ (DaÄÄ±stanlÄ±, 2023; Kazemi et al., 2024 ). The choice often depends on the nature and complexity of the specific problem at hand. According to Stevic et al. (2019) , the results obtained through the MARCOS (Measurements Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution) tool are more accurate than those from other popular MCDM techniques such as ARAS, Multi-Attributive Border approximation Area Comparison (MABAC), Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS), Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and others. On the other hand, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), known for its quantitative and analytical capabilities, is a highly suitable tool for evaluating the performance of multiple peer entities, often referred to as Decision-making Units (DMUs) or alternatives. This study is driven by the aim of determining the relative progress of each EU country towards achieving specific SDGs in comparison to others. This paper introduces several novel aspects that distinguish it from similar studies:â¢ A unique DEA-MARCOS approach is devised to address decision-making challenges.  â¢ An optimization model, utilizing maximum deviation measure and dispersion measure, is proposed to determine the weight values of criteria.  â¢ The applicability of the DEA-MARCOS technique is demonstrated through a real-life case study that evaluates the progress of EU countries towards achieving SDGs.  â¢ Furthermore, a comparative analysis is presented to highlight the superiority of the developed framework.    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The literature reviews related to SDGs, MARCOS and DEA are furnished in Section 2 . In Section 3 , the proposed methodology is thoroughly explained, detailing its key components namely DEA, deviation and dispersion-based optimization, and MARCOS. Section 4  presents a real-life case study that demonstrates the application of the proposed methodology. The results and discussions are provided in Section 5 . The final section encompasses the findings, novel aspects, contributions, and limitations of the research.  2 Literature review The study (Kuc-Czarnecka et al., 2023 ) highlights how European politics have traditionally revolved around sustainable development, which has deep roots in European treaties. The SDGs are an extension of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The authors came to the conclusion that, by emphasizing the interactions between wealth, planet, partnership, and peace, the SDGs offer a far more comprehensive approach to sustainable development than the MDGs. Thus, with a focus on "political and institutional coherence," the SDGs are "indivisible and interconnected." The economic and ecological aspects of sustainable development now form the foundation of the SDGs. The MDGs' emphasis on reducing poverty has switched to integrated development, which includes reducing poverty. The summary of the study findings concentrating on the connections between SDGs is given in  Table 1 . According to the literature analysis (Table 1 ), some research concentrates on the selected SDGs, while others examine trade-offs and synergies among all of the SDGs. SDGs 1 and 3 are typically closely tied to one another, however SDG 2 is a compromise goal. According to Pradhan et al. (2017) , the discovered synergies demonstrate the broad compatibility of the sustainable development objectives, wherein advancement towards one goal can benefit the attainment of other goals. Scholars employ a range of techniques to evaluate the extent of SDG implementation and ascertain their interrelationships, encompassing correlation, time series, multivariate data analysis, MCDM, and neural networks. An MCDM is a powerful tool for analyzing complex real-world issues due to its ability to compare multiple alternatives using predetermined criteria. These techniques consider various factors that define potential courses of action. Decision-makers assess these options based on established criteria and their intended decision-making objective. Over time, MCDM techniques have gained popularity in addressing a wide range of issues, and new methods have emergedÂ (Wang et al., 2024 ). Allah Bukhsh et al. (2019)  classified MCDM approaches into three types: outranking methods, synthesis methods, and interactive methods. Outranking techniques allow decision-makers to rank options based on their preferences (Figueira et al., 2013 ). Synthesis methods prove useful when weighing frequently contradictory circumstances during decision-making (Simanaviciene et al., 2012 ). MCDM enables decision-makers to consider multiple criteria or goals, helping to resolve potential conflicts between different characteristics (Kumar et al., 2018 ). While numerous MCDM approaches are available in the literature, selecting the best one can be challenging. The choice often depends on the nature and complexity of the specific problem at hand. Stevic et al. (2019)  introduced the MARCOS approach for reasonable preference aggregation, involving defining the relationships between alternatives and ID/AID, imposing "ideal degree (ID)" and "anti-ideal degree (AID)" as reference points, and establishing the "utility degree (UD)" of each option with respect to ID and AID. According to (Stevic et al., 2019 ), the results obtained through the MARCOS method are more accurate than those from other popular MCDM techniques such as ARAS, MABAC, WASPAS, TOPSIS, and others. The MARCOS technique has found applications in various domains, including assessing human resources in the transport industry, selecting stackers in logistics systems, choosing suppliers, studying road traffic hazards, and ranking zero-emission last-mile delivery assessment. The review on MARCOS with applications are provided in  Table 2 . As seen from Table 2 , the MARCOS method has not been employed to assess EU countries' progress towards achieving the SDGs. The DEA is an appropriate approach for assessing the performance of various peer entities, often known as DMUs or options. It provides momentous potential in handling with complex and occasionally unknown DMU behaviors, comprising complex connections on multiple inputs and outputs. It has wide applications in numerous situations and different scenarios has been established recently. For example, Andrejic and Kilibarda (2015)  utilized a collective PCA-DEA model to assess the effectiveness and choice of certain distribution channels. Fallahpour et al. (2016)  integrated a fuzzy MADM technique with DEA, genetic programming, and other tools to properly evaluate green suppliers. Fan et al. (2019)  successfully used the DEA strategy in the PFSs (Production Frontier Structures) environment to rank the GSS (Green Supplier Selection) problem, considering both subjective and quantitative criteria. Wu et al. (2019)  proposed an all-inclusive DEA technique to address the GSS problem within the context of interval-valued PFSs. Li et al. (2019)  developed a DEA model to measure the efficiency of the logistics sector in the Wuhan region of Central China. Yazdani et al. (2020) Â introduced an integrated model combining DEA, FUCOM, and CoCoSo approaches based on rough set theory to select logistics centers in Spanish autonomous communities. Their strategy benefits from the use of aggressive, benevolent, and neutral cross-efficiency formulas to aid in selecting the ideal DMU among alternatives in a MCDM situation. They further combined the final cross efficiencies and created a comprehensive rating of the DMUs using the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) method. Zhou and Zhan (2020)  suggested three DEA-based models to generate more realistic efficiency scores for DMUs, considering the desired ratings within the outputs and employing MCDM to calculate output weights. Pereira et al. (2021)  extended a state-of-the-art approach using DEA for evaluating the convergence of the low- and middle-income UN member states about SDG 6 between 2016 and 2017. (Pereira and Marques, 2021, 2022 ) presented a benchmarking procedure for assessing the performance of 123 low- and middle-income UN member states about water and sanitation services (WSS) development targets over the 2001â2015 period of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The applied framework to evaluate European education procedures is based on creating a composite indicator adopting a âbenefit-of-the-doubtâ model. Addressing negative data, Soltanifar and Sharafi (2022)  used a modified cross-efficiency method to rank DMUs in DEA. They proposed a fuzzy VIKOR variant for their suggested approach. In a hesitant fuzzy setting, Mishra et al. (2022)  employed a combination of DEA, FOCUM, and MABAC techniques to tackle sustainable supplier selection issues. Hasani and Mokhtari (2022)  developed a hybrid fuzzy DEA-MCDM approach. Oliviera et al. (2023)  integrated MCDM and cluster analysis method with DEA. Chou et al. (2023)  worked on the performance assessment of research and development organizations using hierarchical network DEA. For solving large scale DEA models, Muren et al. (2024)  developed a new parallel framework algorithm. Despite these diverse applications of DEA, none of the existing research has focused on suitable assessment of EU countries in terms of achieving SDGsÂ (Bouraima et al., 2024 ). This research establishes the connection between the SDGs in EU countries. A unique DEA-MARCOS approach is the primary approach that permits us to analyze the complex phenomenon successfully. Two key research goals were set in the paper: i) Potential evaluation of European Union nations to evaluates the progress of EU countries towards achieving SDGs; ii) An optimization model, utilizing maximum deviation measure and dispersion measure, is proposed to determine the weight values of indicators SDGs (sensitivity analysis approach). We analyze seventeen SDGs and examine their linkages utilizing the 2020 Eurostat database in order to meet the research objectives. The innovative aspect of our research is based on the application of optimization techniques and sensitivity analysis (SA) to determine weights that yield the intended significance for each variable. During the weighing process, we can take into account the variables' distinction and association thanks to SA and comparative assessment.  3 Proposed hybrid methodology DSRM (Design Science Research Methodology) (Peffers et al., 2008; 2020 ) consists of a nominal sequence of activities to be followed in the process of creating an artefact. We position the problem in view of DSRM for which we develop a simple artefact (hybrid DEA-MARCOS model) that better contributes to the achievement of a goal. All relevant DSRM activities are furnished in  Table 3 . The 1st column lists the All DSRM activities are listed in the 1st column and their corresponding descriptions are provided in the 2nd column. The proposed DEA-MARCOS model has three parts described below. 3.1 Determination of efficient alternatives by Data envelopment analysis (DEA) Let there be m   alternatives to be assessed, each represented by various input and output attributes. Typically, non-beneficial attributes are designated as inputs, while beneficial attributes are considered as outputs. For each alternative, there are n   input attributes denoted byÂ d  r l     ( r  =  1 , â¦ , n )    and t   output attributes denoted byÂ e  s l    ( s =  1 , â¦ . . , t ) .    Let and represent the degrees of the r  th  input attribute and s th  output attribute for the l th  alternative, respectively. Inspired by the limitations encountered during the computation of the CCR model (Cooper et al., 2011 ) involving fractional non-convex programming, Charnes et al. (1978)  devised the corresponding Linear Programming (LP) model, which aims to address decision-making problems by either maximizing output criteria values or minimizing input criteria values. In this study, we consider the input minimization model of the CCR model, which is outlined below:(1)        f  l   =  min ( â r = 1  n  y  r   d  r l     )    subject  to           â l  ( â r  y  q   d  r l   â â p  x  s   e  s l      )  â¥ 0 ,       â s  x  s   e  s l    = 1 ,                   x  s   > 0   ( s = 1  , 2 , â¦ ,  t ) ,   y  r   > 0   ( r = 1  , 2 , â¦ ,  n )    }      where  x  s     and    y  r      (both positive) are to be assessed by explaining this LP model. The normalized values d  r l     and   e  s l     Â are calculated by(2) d  r l   = 1 â d  r l    max  r  d  r l     , e  s l   = e  s l    max  s  e  s l     â      To calculate the efficiency measure of an alternative, the following formula proposed by Charnes et al. (1978)  can be employed:(3) Î©  l   = 1 f  l       ( l = 1 , 2 , â¦ , m )     where Î©  l    Â is the efficiency measure of the l th  alternativeÂ T  l    . In the CCR model, an alternative is treated as efficient if it reaches a score of 1; else, it is considered as inefficient.  3.2 Deviation and dispersion-based optimization method for criteria weights determination The method of maximum deviation can be used to objectively determine the criteria weights which can affect the rationality of the criteria. On the other hand, dispersion measure uses the concept of Shannon entropy, for in a certain sense the more disperse the weighting vector the more of the information about the individual criteria. Assume that p  (<m ) is the number of efficient alternatives G  l    ( l = 1 ,  2 ,  â¦ ,  p )    and q  is the number of criteria H  v    ( v = 1 ,  2 ,  â¦ ,  q )   Â connected with a MADM issue in which each alternative is evaluated. Consider that the initial findings (real data) are depicted as the decision matrixÂ U = [ Î±  v  l    ]  p Ã q   .    Normalize the elements of this matrix using the vector normalization technique given below:(4) Î± Ë   v  l   = { Î±  v  l    â l = 1  p  ( Î±  v  l   )  2       ,           if   C  j   â setofbenefitcriteria    1 â Î±  v  l    â l = 1  p  ( Î±  v  l   )  2                if    C  j   â setofcostcriteria            Then the deviation measure can be expressed asÂ D e v ( W )  = â v = 1  q  Î²  v    â l = 1  p  â z = 1  p  D ( Î± Ë   v  l   , Î± Ë   v  z    )    ,    where Î²  1   , Î²  2   , â¦ , Î²  q     denote the criteria weights satisfying:Â â v = 1  q  Î² v   2  = 1 ,    Î² v  â¥ 0    â v ,    where D ( Î± Ë   v  l   , Î± Ë   v  z   ) = | Î± Ë   v  l   â Î± Ë   v  z    |  .   Â On the other hand, as introduced by Yager (1988) , the dispersion measure of the weighting vector W = ( Î²  1   , Î²  2   , â¦ , Î²  q   )   Â is defined as(5) D i s p ( W )  = â â v = 1  q  Î²  v   log  2    Î²  v        When choosing the criteria weightsÂ (Eti and YÃ¼ksel, 2024; Liu and Letchmunan, 2024 ), we must maximize the dispersion and deviation in order to optimize the information's absorption capacity. Thus, we have the following optimization model:(6) M a x Z = â v = 1  q  Î²  v    â l = 1  p  â z = 1  p  C ( Î± Ë   v  l   , Î± Ë   v  z   )   â â v = 1  q  Î²  v   log  2    Î²  v   = â v = 1  q  Î²  v    ( â l = 1  p  â z = 1  p  C ( Î± Ë   v  l   , Î± Ë   v  z   )  â log  2   Î²  v     )    Subjectto                                          â v = 1  q  Î²  v    2  = 1 ,   Î²  v   â¥ 0   â v     }       3.3 Generation of ranking order of alternatives by MARCOS method Assume that p  is the number of alternatives G  l    ( l = 1 ,  2 ,  â¦ ,  p )    and q  is the number of criteria H  v    ( v = 1 ,  2 ,  â¦ ,  q )   Â connected with a MADM issue in which each alternative is evaluated. Consider that the initial findings (available data) are depicted as the decision matrixÂ U = [ Î±  v  l    ]  p Ã q   .    Then the steps of the MARCOS method are as follows: Step 1:   Construct the extended matrix (EM) corresponding to [ Î±  v  l    ]  p Ã q    . Here, the ideal solution (IDS) and anti-ideal solution (AIDS) from Eq. (7)-Eq . (8) are imposed to construct the EM [ Î´  v  l    ]  p Ã q    .(7) Î± + v  = { max   l  Î± v l  ,            if    H v  â Collection  of  all  beneficial  attributes   min l   Î± v l   ,            if     H v  â Collection  of  all  cost  attributes                     (8) Î± â v  = { min l  Î± v l  ,            if    H v  â Collection  of  all  beneficial  attributes   max l  Î± v l   ,           if     H v  â Collection  of  all  cost  attributes                      Step 2:   Construct the normalized extended matrix (NEM) [ Î´ Ë   v  l    ]  p Ã q    Â corresponding to EMÂ [ Î´  v  l    ]  p Ã q    . The NEM is defined as(9) Î´ â¼  v l  = { Î´ v l  â l = 1  p  Î´ v l    2    ,            if    H v  â set  of  all  benefit  criteria   1 â Î´ v l  â l = 1  p  Î´ v l    2    ,              if     H v  â set  of  cost  criteria               Step 3:   Form the weighted NEMÂ [ Î¸  v  l    ]  p Ã q    . The elements are defined as Î¸  v  l   = Î²  v   Î´ Ë   v  l   .    Step 4:   Calculate alternativeâs the utility degrees (UDs). The UDs of l th  alternative w.r.t AIDS and IDS are formulated as(10) Ï  l  +   = â v = 1  q  Î¸  v  l     â v = 1  q   Î¸  v +  l         and    Ï  l  â   = â v = 1  q  Î¸  v  l     â v = 1  q   Î¸  v â  l           Step 5:   Compute utility values (UVs) for all alternatives. The UVs of the l th  alternative w.r.t. AIDS and IDS are calculated as(11) Ï  l  +   = Ï  l  â    Ï  l  â   + Ï  l  +       and    Ï  l  â   = Ï  l  +    Ï  l  â   + Ï  l  +           Step 6:   Estimate the final UVs of alternatives. The final UV of the l th  alternative is calculated as(12) Î¾  l   = Ï  l  â   + Ï  l  +    1 + 1 â Ï  l  â    Ï  l  â     + 1 â Ï  l  +    Ï  l  +                   Step 7:   Prioritize the options and select the best one based on the final UVs. Preference ordering of the options is done based on their final utility values.   4 Case study The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states primarily situated in Europe. Starting with the six founding states (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), the EU has expanded over time to include 27 members. The member countries comprise Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Czechia, Slovenia, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, and Romania. The SDG report of 2022 incorporates over 100 indicators related to the 17 SDGs. Approximately 70â% of these indicators are derived from official statistics, primarily from services under the European Commission, while the remaining 30â% are sourced from non-official data sources, such as NGOs and academia. To construct the final indicator set for the European SD report, five major criteria were considered: (a) Limiting the total number of indicators to 100 (plus or minus 15â%), (b) Preferring simple, single-variable indicators with clear policy implications, (c) Allowing for high-frequency monitoring of indicators, (d) Ensuring the statistical validity and robustness of indicators, and (e) Facilitating measurement of distance to targets. For this paper, the evaluation model includes the 17 indicators corresponding to the 17 goals, as presented in  Fig. 1 , along with their explanations.  Table 4  provides information on the indicators that are taken into consideration for the EU's member states. The proposed methodology ( Fig. 2 ) is to be applied here in order to determine the priority order of EU countries towards achieving SDGs.  5 Result and discussion 5.1 Results of the proposed DEA-MARCOS methodology Using the 27 supplied EU nations given in Table 4 , the most effective options are identified using the DEA approach.  Table 5  presents the findings. Only 16 nations namely, Austria, Estonia, Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, Czechia, Spain, and Romania are deemed to be the most effective alternatives out of all 27 alternatives. Consequently,  Table 6  reports a decision-making process with these 16 possibilities and 17 evaluation features (indicators). The vector normalized matrix is presented as  Table 7 . It is pertinent to mention that the indicators SDI1, SDI2, SDI8, SDI12 and SDI13 are of non-beneficial type only. Next, based on Eq. (6) , we have the following non-linear optimization model asM a x Z   = Î²  1   Ã ( 18.6474 â l o g  2   Î²  1    )  + Î²  2   Ã ( 2.3286 â l o g  2   Î²  2    )  + Î²  3   Ã ( 27.3493 â l o g  2   Î²  3    )  + Î²  4   Ã ( 16.6435 â l o g  2   Î²  4    )          + Î²  5   Ã ( 37.2829 â l o g  2   Î²  5    )  + Î²  6   Ã ( 18.3112 â l o g  2   Î²  6    )  + Î²  7   Ã ( 32.6242 â l o g  2   Î²  7    )  + Î²  8   Ã ( 29.5690 â l o g  2   Î²  8    )        + Î²  9   Ã ( 18.1152 â l o g  2   Î²  9    )  + Î²  10   Ã ( 10.4635 â l o g  2   Î²  10    )  + Î²  11   Ã ( 28.2309 â l o g  2   Î²  11    )  + Î²  12   Ã ( 32.4831 â l o g  2   Î²  12    )        + Î²  13   Ã ( 26.7521 â l o g  2   Î²  13    )  + Î²  14   Ã ( 14.1358 â l o g  2   Î²  14    )  + Î²  15   Ã ( 16.1987 â l o g  2   Î²  15    )  + Î²  16   Ã ( 15.4945 â l o g  2   Î²  16    )             + Î²  17   Ã ( 3.2984 â l o g  2   Î²  17    )         Subject to Î²  1    2  + Î²  2    2  + â¦ + Î²  17    2  = 1    and Î²  1   , Î²  2   , â¦ , Î²  17   â¥ 0   . This leads to the solutionÎ²  1   = 0.2037 ,   Î²  2   =  0.0534 ,   Î²  3   = 0.2894 ,   Î²  4   =  0.1843 ,   Î²  5   =  0.3887 ,   Î²  6   =  0.2005 ,  Î²  7   =  0.3420 ,  Î²  8   = 0.3115 ,    Î²  9   =  0.1986 ,  Î²  10   = 0.1255 ,  Î²  11   = 0.2982 ,  Î²  12   =  0.3406 ,  Î²  13   =  0.2835 ,  Î²  14   = 0.1602 ,  Î²  15   = 0.1801 ,  Î²  16   =  0.1732 ,    Î²  17   =  0.0614.            Based on Eqs. (7) and (8) , the extended matrix (EM) is constructed and presented as  Table 8 . The normalized EM is given in  Table 9 . We present the weighted normalized EM is given in  Table 10 . Eq. (10)  is used to calculate the UDs related to AID and ID, respectively. The UVs are formulated by Eq. (11)  that has connection with AID and ID, respectively. Finally, overall UVs of alternatives are computed utilizing Eq. (12) .  Table 11  describes the detailed results according to which with Austria made the most significant progress in achieving SDGs.  5.2 Sensitivity investigation (SI) Here, we conduct the SI for criteria weights to illustrate the effect of criteria weights on the ranking order. To do so, thirty-four arbitrary combinations (J 1 , J 2 , J 3 , â¦, J 34 ) (see  Table 12 ) of the criteria weights are considered to check the stability of the developed hybrid model. The final priority scores of alternatives (EU Countries) are shown in  Fig. 3 . The positioning places of alternatives along with the Spearmanâs rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) values (Saha et al., 2023 ) have been calculated for those 34âwt sets and presented in  Table 13 . The average of the SRCC values is calculated as â0.9929â, indicating a strong correlation (Saha et al., 2023 ) between the ranking positions. Therefore, the priority order of alternatives (EU Countries) obtained by utilizing the proposed methodology is robust and stable.  5.3 Comparative study With the intension to track progress of the EU countries towards the SDGs, Mateusz et al. (2018)  applied the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity) method, Stanujkic et al. (2020)  applied CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) method and Rani and Mishra (2022)  applied WASPAS (Weighted aggregated sum product assessment). So, this part aims to provide a comparative analysis of the developed decision support model with some of the existing decision-making methods, namely TOPSIS (Mateusz et al., 2018 ), and CoCoSo (Stanujkic al., 2020 ). These methods are applied to solve the addressed assessment of energy management investments. The results are reported in    Tables 14â16 . The final scores (utility values/compromise values) are shown in  Fig. 4 . Concerning the comparison outcomes, the best outcome is exactly the same as generated by our proposed method. This means that the results derived from our method are credible. Some advantages of the proposed method are given as follows:1. Information loss could result from the current methods (Mateusz et al., 2018; Stanujkic et al., 2020; Rani and Mishra, 2022 ) for determining criteria as they take no account of cross-entropy or divergence measures. Hence, the amount of questionable data cannot be quantified by the current investigations (Mateusz et al., 2018; Stanujkic et al., 2020 ). However, we have used a deviation and dispersion-based optimization model to determine the weights of the criteria. This optimization model takes into account the issues in decision-making while computing the ambiguous information and highlighting the significance of criteria.  2. Compared to the existing method (Mateusz et al., 2018; Stanujkic et al., 2020; Rani and Mishra, 2022 ), MARCOS method is more robust, reliable, and stable since MARCOS includes (i) IDs and AIDs (reference points), and (ii) the "utility degree (UD)" of each option in regard to AIDS and IDS.  3. The proposed methodology framework helps assess and prioritize EU Countries towards achieving SDGs.     5.4 Implication and discussion Based on the results, the countries that have progressed the most toward the SDGs are Austria, Latvia, Sweden, Germany, and Romania. Austria is highlighted in the final results as the country that achieves the SDGs with the greatest amount of progress. An examination of the input data reveals that not every segment exhibits the highest level of success. In spite of this, Austria advances in a steady and equitable manner toward every assessed SDG. Austria and a few other countries have the greatest performance among all EU members in various areas, such as gross domestic expenditure on research and development. Austria has demonstrated significant progress towards the SDGs, with achievements consistently falling between medium and best, and consistently ranking among the nations with the best results across the SDGs. Mateusz et al. (2018)  employed the TOPSIS and VIKOR models with the primary objective of characterizing the progress made by the EU member states toward the SDGs. They discovered that, among some other EU countries, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Italy, and Luxembourg are in first place, while Bulgaria and Romania are in lowest place. Piwowarski et al. (2018)  employed the TOPSIS and vector measure construction methodologies to analyze the changes in the EU's poverty region. Based on the aggregate results, Luxembourg, Finland, Austria, Malta, and Spain were shown to have the best results in terms of poverty reduction. When all is said and done, Romania and Bulgaria rank last once more. AHP technique was adopted by MartÃ­n and Carnero (2019)  to evaluate the attaining of the SDGs. According to the final results, Norway has a very high level of sustainability, while the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom all achieved excellent levels of sustainability. Romania and Bulgaria are once more on the very low list of countries in relation to the SDGs in this scenario. It is evident from looking at the results calculated by other researchers that there are similarities with the results covered in this study. It is evident that there are some similarities between the results pertaining to the top and bottom-ranked countries. Additionally, by evaluating each goal's development independently and the set of indicators linked to it, governments will be able to acquire a more accurate understanding of the current sustainability situation and improve their capacity to predict future trends. As a result of the suggested approach's success in the assessment of sustainability-related accomplishments, the direction for future work calls for conducting the assessment procedure based on MCDM approaches, adopted goals and indicators, and targeted values. By including the targeted values into the assessment model, it will be possible to obtain objective results that highlight any potential flaws that need to be fixed and better represent the existing situation and progress towards desired goals.   6 Conclusions This paper has offered a hybrid model by combining DEA, MARCOS, and an optimization model related to deviation and dispersion as a tool to make it easier to analyze how well the EU countries are doing in terms of reaching the SDGs. The MARCOS approach was used for the final ranking of the EU countries under consideration, and DEA was used to determine the most effective alternatives. A deviation and dispersion-based optimization model was also built for this purpose. The technique that has been established is based on 17 indicators that are related to the 17 SDGs. Although more indicators are introduced, the review procedure only uses 17 of them since they most accurately reflect the aims being considered. By doing so, the scenario of a complicated and broad model is avoided, as well as the indicator repetition. According to the final statistics, Austria has the best performance in terms of sustainable development. The conclusions reached in this way constitute a utility-based approach that takes into account the variations in the evaluation criteria. By doing this, it prevents a situation where some nations are ranked higher than others but only because they have made progress towards a small number of objectives. This workable compromise puts the balanced accomplishments of the evaluated nations into perspective. Additionally, the proposed method's effectiveness and dependability were confirmed by comparison with other established MCDM approaches. Even though some authors, like Miola and Schiltz (2019) , have claimed that the position of the country strongly depends on the chosen methodology and indicators, the inclusion of the SDG indicators in the appropriate decision model would help to provide a clear picture of the sustainability level achieved in the given country and their position relative to others. This article's primary weakness stems from the review process, which used data on just 17 indicators. All of the suggested indicators must be taken into account for the results to be more solid and trustworthy. Although DEA can handle multiple input and multiple output models, and DEA doesnât require an assumption of a functional form relating inputs to outputs, it has some limitations: it is an extreme point technique, and statistical hypothesis tests are difficult for DEA because of its non-parametric form. Besides the weighing model presented in this study does not reflect the correlative relationships among the criteria. On the other hand, the proposed ranking algorithm eliminates the effects of different dimensions of criteria using only one normalization process, which may bias the acquired results as each normalization process may lose the original information slightly. Lastly, the developed method does not determine the dominance degree of each alternative to the other alternatives.
