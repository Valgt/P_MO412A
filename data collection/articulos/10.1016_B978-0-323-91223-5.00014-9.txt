               The water–energy–food (WEF) nexus has attracted growing attention as an approach for integrated natural resources management through enhancing synergies and minimizing trade-offs in the three resources sectors. The WEF nexus has further been identified as a viable approach to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2 (food), 6 (water), and 7 (energy). This chapter presents an overview of how the WEF nexus could be applied to achieve SDGs 2, 6, and 7. It looks at the WEF nexus as a natural resources management tool, the SDGs dimensions in the WEF nexus, and the synergies and trade-offs in the WEF nexus with a focus on achieving zero hunger (SDG2), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and affordable clean energy (SDG 7). It is also argued that the possibilities of using the WEF nexus as an approach for achieving the highlighted SDGs and food and nutrition security are conditional on several drivers prevailing across varying contexts. This chapter ends by discussing the communications pathway approach for upscaling and outscaling the WEF nexus as a natural resources management tool to attain SDGs 2, 6, and 7at different spatial and temporal scales.

Keywords Integration  Livelihoods  Resource  Resource management  Resource security  Sustainable development   1 Introduction Water, energy, and food are vital resources for human well-being, poverty reduction, and sustainable development (Rasul and Sharma, 2016 ). With rapid population growth and migration, economic development, urbanization, cultural and technological changes, deepening poverty levels, and unprecedented climate change in the recent age, projections are that the global demand for resources, such as water, food, and energy, will rise (Corvalan et al., 2005 ). The approach recognizes the tension and complementarity in the use and availability of the three resources. Demand for food, water, and energy is expected to grow by 35%, 40%, and 50% by 2030, respectively. The poor also lack basic amenities such as access to electricity and clean water. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance the livelihoods of the poor as they tend to be undernourished, and lack access to power and clean water (Ferroukhi et al., 2015 ). 1.1 The WEF nexus—past to present discourse The WEF nexus approach has attracted growing attention within international politics, academia, and other areas of society. Initially, the concept originated within the realms of international politics as a result of the World Economic Forum and other policymakers in 2011 (Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2018 ). For instance, the work of Cairns and Krzywoszynska (2016)  dated the nexus back to the year 2008, when business leaders at the World Economic Forum issued a request to deal with nexus concerns between economic growth and water, energy, and food resource systems. One could argue that an integrated approach to water, energy, and food could improve resource security,  efficiency, poverty reduction and achieve better resource governance across sectors, and this has set the tone and premises for future discourses. The global financial crisis of 2008–09, and its aftermath gave further impetus to the notion of a nexus encompassing water, energy, and food (Allouche et al., 2014 ). The increasing awareness of the impacts of biofuel production on food prices and availability, particularly in developing countries, also stimulated public and scholarly concern regarding trade-offs between food and energy (Pittock et al., 2015 ). The competition for land and water for crop production of biofuels and food sparked interest pertaining to the water node of the nexus. As the water–energy–food nexus debate gains traction, it is increasingly becoming topical such that it progressively influences international development and resource governance approaches. The WEF nexus concept is gaining recognition as a conceptual framework that can be used to achieve sustainable utilization of resources across the different spheres, i.e., international organizations, academics, policy analysts, and other developmental stakeholders. The WEF nexus is regarded as a strong pillar in the successful implementation of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The United Nations and European Union (EU) Commission, for instance, seek to adopt a nexus perspective to implement the SDGs. The analysis of SDGs from the WEF nexus perspective has proved to be an important tool for establishing a holistic approach toward achieving sustainability and meeting the SDG targets. The increasing interest in the WEF nexus discourse is partly spurred by the increasing awareness among scholars and public officials that processes influencing the sustainability of natural resources are dynamic, complex, and uncertain. The uncertainty associated with climate change has added a new dimension requiring consideration. Much of the discussion of the nexus reflects an increasing interest of the impacts of climate change–induced uncertainty on interactions involving water, energy, and food production (Scott et al., 2015 ; Kurian and Ardakanian, 2015 ). Yet the increasing interest, alone, might not be sufficient to overcome the challenges that have thwarted earlier efforts to establish integrated policy programs. Although WEF nexus challenges are significantly evident at local scales, literature shows that the major focus of the WEF nexus has been at national, regional, and global scales (Biggs et al., 2015 ). Much focus has been placed on macrolevel drivers, material flows, and large infrastructure development. The discussion of WEF nexus challenges at local and household levels, especially in rural areas, is still missing (Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2018 ). There is need for the creation of appropriate strategies that address local development strategies, especially in developing countries. The role of renewable energy in the WEF nexus has not been adequately explored and has been discussed independently of the nexus system. Owing to the linkages between the WEF  components, it is important to address water, food, and energy issues jointly since they affect each other positively and negatively. Due to the complexity of the interdependencies, the trade-offs and synergies of water, food, and energy are described as the WEF nexus.  1.2 The WEF nexus as a tool for natural resources management Water, energy, and food are vital resources for human well-being, poverty reduction, and sustainable development (Rasul and Sharma, 2016 ; Khacheba et al., 2018 ). The current societal megatrends in urbanization, migration, consumerism, coupled with environmental, technological, economic, and demographic changes, continue to exert pressure on already scarce and deplete natural resources, threatening their sustainability, and, thereby, undermining the resilience of communities (Gelsdorf, 2011 ). The resultant challenges require transdisciplinary and transformative approaches in resource management, development, and utilization, using integrated approaches such as the WEF nexus, which allow for inclusive and equitable development, as well as coordinated resource planning and management (Nhamo et al., 2018 ). The WEF nexus approach suggests that the three sectors are not only interdependent, but they also have impacts on each other (WWF, 2017 ). For instance, the generation of energy causes water pollution, while the pumping and distribution of water for food production and processing consume significant amounts of energy. The sustainable management of natural resources requires a holistic approach that recognizes the interdependencies and relationships that exist between them. In the WEF nexus, water, food, and energy are not treated as independent systems but as subsystems of the nexus. Water, energy, and food are all complex sectors on their own, but they become even more complex upon studying their interactions increasing the complexity (Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015 ). In reality, the WEF nexus can be viewed in the following complex interactive relationships: (1) water for food (in excess of 70% of global freshwater withdrawal goes to food production), (2) water for energy (water is needed for energy extraction, electricity generation, refining, and processing in the energy sector), (3) water for energy and food (hydropower generation exhibits energy–water–food–environment connectivity), (4) agriculture and land for energy and water (agriculture has a dual role as an energy user and supplier in the form of bioenergy, and furthermore, agriculture production impacts the water sector through its effects on land condition, runoff, groundwater discharge, water quality, and land/water availability for other purposes), (5) agriculture, water, and the environment (overabstraction from surface water affects the minimum environmental flow that is required to maintain ecosystem services), (6) energy is required for food and water  (directly or indirectly, for transportation, processing, packaging, etc.), and (7) energy for water supply and sanitation services (including activities such water pumping, water distribution networks, water and wastewater treatment, etc.). Rather than viewing the interrelatedness of the water, energy, and food security sectors as a constraint, their relationships should be used as an opportunity to tackle development issues using a multisectoral approach. The WEF nexus approach aims to understand how each of these three sectors relates to the other two and seeks to use this understanding to make policy decisions that promote sustainable development and poverty reduction (Bizikova et al., 2013 ). The recognition of the complex interrelationships between the water, energy, and food sectors creates a basis for a new approach to integrated management and governance across sectors and ultimately across scales. Participation in the WEF nexus brings together all relevant stakeholders, including local and national governments, development banks and agencies, civil society, research institutes and universities, NGOs, the private sector, and international and regional organizations (Daher et al., 2018 ). The global partnership allows nations to share knowledge, technical expertise, and resources while also encouraging intraorganizational collaboration. Policy decisions and investments are still confined to sectorial boundaries, hence limiting the full operationalization of the WEF nexus in natural resource management. The existing policies across many countries still handle the three sectors separately as it is increasingly regarded as a conceptual framework for sustainable development (Biggs et al., 2015 ). The WEF nexus is intended to enhance policy to achieve sustainable development goals. The WEF nexus offers an integrated approach for analyzing the synergies and trade-offs between the different sectors and maximizes the efficiency of using the resources for adapting optimum policies and institutional arrangements. In other words, the WEF nexus guarantees the sustainable use of natural resources while reducing waste and loss (Daher et al., 2018 ). A frequent critique of the WEF nexus is that it appears to add relatively little to already existing integrated resource management approaches, such as the integrated landscape approach or integrated water resources management (IWRM). However, in IWRM, the conceptual framework arguably pursues the integrated and coordinated management of water and land as a means of balancing different water uses, while meeting social and ecological needs and promoting economic development, it has a fatal weakness when compared with the WEF nexus. By explicitly focusing on water, IWRM has a risk of prioritizing water-related development goals over others, thereby reinforcing traditional sectoral approaches. By contrast, the WEF nexus approach considers the different dimensions of water, energy, and food equally and acknowledges the interdependencies of different resource uses in sustainable development.  Some critics of the WEF nexus argue that analyzing one resource sector is sufficiently complex, suggesting that integrating multiple resource sectors simultaneously is a substantial challenge (de Loë and Patterson, 2017 ). Wichelns (2017)  concurs, contending that given the lack of success in implementing integrated natural resource management (INRM) and IWRM in practice, another call for integration should be questioned. It has, however, been suggested that the criticism of IWRM is well founded because it underestimates the importance of administrative boundaries, with its focus being hydrological catchments (Kurian, 2017 ). Belinskij (2015)  argues for utilizing a nexus approach since it removes the institutional “silos” that are prevalent in governance and policy circles. Leck et al. (2015)  argues that although the nexus concept is attractive, it is challenging to implement. Al-Saidi et al. (2017) , while acknowledging the complexity of modeling the nexus (i.e., computer-based modeling), emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all model to address WEF-related issues. However, common grounds have been found in the description of how localizing and contextualizing a nexus assessment will be vital to addressing trade-offs.   2 The SDGs dimensions and the WEF nexus The UN developed 17 SDGs, three of them, i.e., SDG 2, 6, and 7 pertain to the key components of WEF, i.e., food, water, and energy, respectively. Therefore, a discussion of WEF should first develop an understanding of the three SDGs. 2.1 SDG 2—zero hunger The SDG 2 aims to end hunger, accomplish food security and improved nutrition, and encourage sustainable agriculture by 2030. As with all SDGs, the zero hunger goal has targets, metrics, and indicators that are measurable and time bound (Gil et al., 2019 ). Globally, there has been a lack of universally accepted and simple definition of hunger, which has hampered progress in successfully addressing the problem. Generally, hunger has been defined by various scholars as an unpleasant feeling that is caused by lack of eating (e.g., Riches, 2016 ; Espel-Huynh et al., 2018 ). In both the developed and developing nations, hunger is often linked to poverty (Siddiqui et al., 2020 ), meaning that as the level of poverty increases globally, the number of people experiencing hunger also increases. FAO (2021)  indicates that hunger is also directly linked to resource access to resources, implying that those with more access to resources are less likely to be affected by hunger compared with their resource-poor counterparts. This could explain the findings reported by Haque et al. (2017)  who noted that women and children are more vulnerable to hunger, malnutrition, and starvation compared with men. Although the fight against hunger has been debated at various global forums, the number of people  affected by hunger is increasing, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the efforts to curb hunger have been crippled by the COVID 19 pandemic as it is directly and indirectly intensifying the weaknesses and shortcomings of global food systems. The total eradication of hunger requires a holistic approach that views the problem from a system perspective (Gil et al., 2019 ). FAO (2021)  defined hunger as the experience of having inadequate food required for meeting dietary requirements. The establishment of the linkages between water and energy has been identified as a prerequisite for the attainment of the zero hunger target (FAO, 2016 ). Recently, the WEF nexus emerged as a system that can aid in the fight against hunger by employing a multisectoral approach (Rasul and Sharma, 2016 ). Specifically, the approach considers the impacts of water and energy as the most influential sectors, which have a direct impact on local, regional, and global food systems. Although widely discussed in literature, the operationalization of the WEF nexus for achieving zero hunger at various scales remains a challenge. The nexus approach requires political commitment and knowledge on how it can effectively be utilized to formulate policies that reduce various forms of poverty and positively impact food security (Gödecke et al., 2018 ). Under the nexus approach, the implementation and monitoring of the models to eradicate hunger requires key indicators with accompanying threshold values. The main indicators help in measuring the success of approaches and identifying trade-offs with other sectors.  2.2 SDG 6—clean water and sanitation The SDG 6 mandate is to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water resources globally to give access to clean water and sanitation to the world's population (Tortajada and Biswas, 2018 ). Previously, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focused more on the global population access to water, with less attention given to water quality. According to the World Bank (2020)  statistics, 68% of the world's population has reliable access to water and basic sanitation. However, only 39% of the people who were reported to have access to water and sanitation had access to safely managed sanitation, which comprises appropriate collection treatment and disposal of waste (Shandra et al., 2011 ). Poor management of wastewater systems has led to contamination and pollution of underground water sources causing serious health risks to people (Blackett, 2015 ). Unlike the MDGs, the SDG 6 included and emphasized water quality as part of the 2030 goals. However, achieving clean water and sanitization is largely dependent on understanding the trade-offs and synergies that exist across the water, food, and energy sectors. Stephan et al. (2018)  pointed that the WEF nexus is a platform that can be used to effectively implement the SDG goals. Therefore, the improvement of the  access to clean water and sanitation at global level requires the nexus approach. Water is transboundary resource, and it requires systems approach that goes beyond single sectors or individual territory.  2.3 SDG 7—affordable and clean energy The primary objective of the SDG 7 is to ensure equal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Ahuja and Tatsutani (2009)  highlighted that as the global population grows so will the demand for inexpensive energy. There has been a new drive to encourage alternative energy sources, and in 2011 renewable energy accounted for more than 20% of global power generated (Franco et al., 2020 ). However, one in five people lack access to electricity, and as the demand continues to rise, there is a need for a matching increase in the production of renewable energy across the world (Křížková, 2019 ). The SDG programs promote the use of renewable and sustainable sources of energy. At the same time, they promote construction techniques that are more energy efficient. For example, in Mozambique, it is supporting, through UNIDO and national partners, a technology exchange with South African National Cleaner Production Center (SDGF, 2020 ). The WEF nexus is critical to the achievement of affordable and clean energy for all (Saladini et al., 2018 ). Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind, and thermal. Adopting cost-effective standards for a wider range of technologies could also reduce the global electricity consumption in buildings and industry by 14%, preventing the construction of around 1300 medium-sized power plants. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy sources in all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth and benefit the environment.   3 Food and nutrition security The concept of food and nutrition security has been explicitly defined in literature as a stage when a person has physical, social, and economic access to food all the times (El Bilali et al., 2019 ). To fulfill the nutrition aspect, the food should be consumed in adequate quantities and acceptable quality to effectively meet the dietary needs and food preferences (Pangaribowo et al., 2013 ). As the world population continues to experience food shortages, the importance of food security in various facets of society has been emphasized. SDG 2's primary goals are to eliminate hunger while increasing food security and nutrition (Griggs et al., 2017 ). Under the SDG 2, the United Nations outlines eight targets and 13 indicators, which all links to the improvement of global food and nutrition security (Fonseca et al., 2020 ). Several authors mentioned  climate change as one of the major factors negatively impacting the global water and food systems and leading to food insecurity (Fanzo et al., 2018 ; Myers et al., 2017 ; Loboguerrero et al., 2019 ; Clapp et al., 2018 ). As part of curbing the devastating impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security, SDG 2 outlines practical solutions that countries can adopt as part of their efforts to achieve zero hunger. For example, agricultural systems, forestry, and fisheries were identified as sources that can provide nutritious food as well as facilitate income generating projects that can improve livelihoods while protecting the environment (FAO 2018). However, in this example, agricultural systems, forestry and fisheries are not only interconnected but also directly or indirectly influenced and impacted by water and energy resources. Therefore, it is necessary to take a multisectoral approach (e.g., the WEF nexus) to address food and nutrition security challenges. Improvement in food security and nutrition can be effectively achieved through better coordination between the water, food, and energy sectors (Hoff, 2011 ), other factors being constant. The work of Mahlknecht et al. (2020)  postulated that for sustainability to be achieved in the process of reducing global hunger, the interconnections of the three sectors have to be recognized at local, regional, and global scales. The practical execution of SDG 2 objectives has considerably improved at various scales since the formation of the WEF nexus at the Bonn 2011 Nexus Conference; hence, the WEF nexus strategy is essential in achieving food and nutrition security.  4 Synergies and trade-offs in the WEF nexus Galafassi et al. (2017)  defined trade-offs as a decision-making process that benefits one or a few components of an interconnected system at the expense of the other components, whereas synergy can be taken as the interaction or cooperation of two or more components to produce a greater combined effect. Scott (2017) , however, indicated that trade-offs are the sources of contestations or conflicts that emanates from resource allocation and utilization within the WEF nexus system. 4.1 Synergies and trade-offs in the WEF nexus toward achieving food and nutrition security (SDG 2) The recognition of key synergies between water, energy, and food is essential in resource management decisions. Synergies are defined as the close connections of two or more groups, sectors, or institutions to generate a collective effect that would not be produced if they would have acted independently (Li et al., 2019 ). The complex dynamic interactions that exist between water, energy, and food sectors form synergies within the WEF system. In simple terms, Scott (2017)  defined synergies as “win–win” situations, whereby the needs of all  sectors are considered in the resource allocation and utilization. For the attainment of food and nutrition security, it is essential to quantify and analyze the synergies that occur in water, energy, and food systems (Xu et al., 2019 ). A balance in the use and generation of the WEF components must be achieved; otherwise, unsustainability may result. Wu et al. (2021)  evaluated the synergies and trade-offs in the WEF nexus in Canada. They noted that sources of synergies in the WEF nexus primarily emanate from the production and demand sides of the water, energy, and food sectors. For instance, the agricultural sector provides an opportunity to develop and generate bioenergy using food crops such as wheat and canola. On the other hand, the production of crops requires energy and water. If quantified and well balanced, these synergies can improve food and nutrition security. Martinez-Hernandez et al. (2017)  added that the close linkages that exist in the WEF nexus enable the recycling of resources, thus minimizing unnecessary losses especially in food production. For instance, wastewater from agriculture can be channeled toward energy generation. Evidence from literature shows that the effective assessment of WEF nexus synergies toward achieving food and nutrition security requires the participation of all relevant stakeholders especially at a local scale. The development of more synergies within the WEF nexus is encouraged since it can improve the capacity of nations to achieve the objective of the nexus, as well as moving toward achieving food and nutrition security globally (Bhaduri et al., 2015 ). The WEF nexus was established to specifically challenge and address the conflicts that emanates from resource utilization among the water, energy, and food sectors. The attainment of food security and nutrition has been affected by the trade-offs within the nexus system. For example, in many cases where one sector loses out, the decision about trade-offs becomes political and not sustainable. Several WEF nexus modeling studies have explored the sustainable utilization of scarce resources by means of balancing trade-offs in the nexus, thus improving food and nutrition to the world population (Wu et al., 2021 ; Zhang and Vesselinov, 2017 ; Yuan et al., 2018 ). An example of WEF trade-offs that affects food and nutrition security is the scarcity of water resources within the system. If water resources are limited, there are contestations with regards to its allocation to food production versus hydroelectric power generating projects. The works of Biemans et al. (2016)  and Rasul (2014)  confirmed that it is challenging to ensure that hydroelectric power generation and food production sectors are allocated adequate water, especially under the increasing water stress globally. Climate change is the primary source of water stress around the world, and exacerbates the WEF nexus trade-offs and undermines the efforts toward achieving food and nutrition security. To improve the resource flow in the nexus, Dhaubanjar et al. (2017)  proposes  that the holistic nexus approaches should promote evaluation of the benefits, impacts, and risks of projects across the three sectors to minimize trade-offs. The following sections provide a couple of case studies on the synergies and trade-offs for achieving SDGs 6 and 7 and the link to food and nutrition security, SDG 2.  4.2 Synergies and trade-offs for achieving clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) 4.2.1 Case study: Guatemala agricultural extension project Having noted that SDG 6 has the primary objective to provide access to clean water and sanitation (Tortajada and Biswas, 2018 ), it is worth noting that there are synergies and trade-offs that either promote or restrict the successful implementation and operationalization of the WEF nexus toward this goal. Synergies result in mutual benefits between the water sector and the adjacent sectors, while trade-offs increase contestations in resource utilization with the system. Therefore, if there are more synergies than trade-offs in the system, it will be a positive step toward achieving clean water and sanitization. Banerjee et al. (2019)  assessed the synergies and trade-offs in achieving zero hunger and clean sanitation in Guatemala. Their study reported that investments in water and sanitation and agriculture lead to trade-offs. Specifically, the expansion in commercial irrigation schemes affects the amount of water allocated for domestic use. Additionally, the excessive use of chemicals to improve agricultural productivity also resulted in pollution of water. While improving food security, agricultural expansion projects have denied certain communities of their right to clean water. Positively, agricultural extension projects have also resulted in the creation of synergies that favor the achievement of access to clean water and sanitation for all. For example, Kurian (2017)  noted that the recycling of agricultural water and possibly channeling it toward energy generation is a sustainable approach that minimizes resource waste of resources while achieving several SDGs at the same time.   4.3 Synergies and trade-offs for achieving affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) 4.3.1 Case study: off-grid solar energy in Rwanda The SDG 7 deals with ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. However, in the process of achieving the targets, there are unavoidable synergies and trade-offs that are created. Bisaga et al. (2021)  mapped synergies and trade-offs between the energy sector and sustainable development goals in Rwanda. The off-grid solar energy project created  synergies that substantially added value toward achieving clean energy in the country. Unlike hydroelectric power generation that consumes large amounts of water, the off-grid solar system is sustainable and puts less pressure on water resources (Sutthivirode et al., 2009 ; Kalogirou, 2004 ). Eventually, more water resources can be allocated for agriculture, while accessibility to clean water is still achieved. Additionally, the off-grid solar energy also significantly contributes to the attainment of zero hunger goal through solar-powered irrigation, which provides clean energy for perennial food crops production. The off-grid solar systems case also presents trade-offs that bring several challenges in the achievement of the access to clean energy goal. Bisaga et al. (2021)  identified several trade-offs including potential competition between the need for agricultural land and solar grid development, as well as the depletion of groundwater because of increased solar-driven irrigation.    5 Drivers of the WEF nexus toward achievement of SDGs 2, 6, and 7 The discussion in the preceding sections showed the relevance of the WEF nexus approach to understanding the opportunities for achieving SDGs 2, 6, and 7 and food and nutrition security. The sections argued that the possibilities of using the WEF nexus as an approach for achieving the highlighted SDGs and food and nutrition security is conditional on several drivers prevailing across varying contexts. An understanding of the context and drivers in WEF nexus can be achieved through the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA). The SLA was instrumental in highlighting the importance of the context within which development occurs and to pointing to the drivers that are critical to achieving desired livelihood outcomes (Scoones, 2015 ). Relevant drivers area varied and included climate change, population and economic growth rates, urbanization, policies and institutions, and technological advances. The extent to which the different drivers express themselves under varying contexts is all relevant to the expression of the WEF nexus toward achievement of food security, e.g., how climate change manifests itself, the level and growth of the population and the economy, the percentage of the population that is urbanized, the prevailing policies and institutional settings, the pace of technological changes, etc. Policies, for example, can stifle or stimulate the use of various resources, such as water, as well as the production, availability, and pricing of energy. Therefore, the suggestion that WEF nexus does not exist in a vacuum, and other factors should be considered in understanding or devising ways in which it is relevant to food and nutrition security outcomes.   6 Upscaling and outscaling the WEF nexus as a natural resources management tool for attaining SDGs 2, 6, and 7 Upscaling and outscaling an innovation, practice, or process require a defined communications plan and pathway. Technically speaking, upscaling of an innovation or practice means improving on its quality and making it better, whereas outscaling implies getting an innovation or practice out to a wider audience or to cover a larger scale. Therefore, upscaling can mean use of an innovation or practice could increase, starting from a lower level, e.g., local scale, and then be taken to cover a larger scale at the district, provincial, or national scales. Admittedly, the concepts of upscaling and outscaling lend themselves to different interpretations and applications, but both require clear communications pathways to enhance adoption and hence success in either direction. In this chapter, we adopt the definition where upscaling is related to quality, while outscaling is related to higher quantum in coverage. In a way, the WEF nexus as a resource planning and use tool can be classified as an innovation or practice that requires to be clearly communicated to various stakeholder within the development levels. This can range from policy makers at the top of government, through implementers in the provinces and municipalities down to the target beneficiaries right on the ground who benefit from properly planned resource utilization. Similarly, WEF nexus tools require to be outscaled for wider applicability. This, too, needs a communication strategy to enhance adoption of the practice. This point is further buttressed by the fact that there has been an outcry that the WEF nexus has remained in the realm of academic research alone, with no progress toward wider adoption and implementation by the target stakeholders (users) for sustainable natural resources management, both locally and globally. A communication plan is the complete set of methods and procedures that will be used to convey and share information about an innovation, practice, or lesson. It assumes that there are stakeholders who need to know about the innovation or lessons or outputs, and that the innovation, lessons, or outputs must be packaged accordingly to suit the needs and be desirable to specific group of stakeholders, and then how to actually carry out the communication activities, and finally monitor the communication plan. At each and every stage or step, the following questions should be asked; what, why, by who, by when, and how? These steps include (1) identifying WEF nexus communication stakeholders, (2) designing and producing WEF nexus communication products, (3) undertaking WEF nexus communication activities, and (4) monitoring and evaluating (M&E) the WEF nexus communication plan. In upscaling the WEF nexus tools, it means they need to be improved (if that is required) and also they need to be applied at different levels from the local  level to the national level. Upscaling can be a natural process that happens with minimal input depending on how refined an innovation is. If one takes the example of the integrative analytical WEF nexus (IAWN) model, as of now the model is spreadsheet based and can benefit from further development and enhancement such as having a friendly graphical user interface (GUI), having a database of development scenarios applicable to South Africa, and taking inputs from policy makers. Incorporating such will help in upscaling the model. The question then is what is the communication pathway for this to happen? As discussed before, the steps are by and large the same, who are the concerned stakeholders, what are the communication products and how can they be packaged, how best to then communicate these upscaling products, and finally the required M&E on this communication plan to ensure that it succeeds. The same concept applies if the upscaling implies moving from a lower level of application (local) to higher level (national). Of course, the reverse would be downscaling the technology, from national level to local level. Outscaling of WEF nexus practices means that they progress from being practiced at a smaller scale to a wide scale. Scale can be considered from a catchment perspective, i.e., moving from a subcatchment or catchment to several catchments, or from an administrative area perspective, i.e., moving from one district or municipality to many. As previously alluded to, the communication plan and pathway needs to be flexible since conditions in one catchment can be significantly different from those in the next for outscaling to occur. Consequently, the communication plans must be able to adapt and be tailored to those conditions. For example, currently the WEF nexus is being tried out in a number of spatial scale environments in South Africa and the region, from urban settings through catchment scale and finally at the national scale, and even at the Southern African Development Community (SADC) regional scale and continental level. For the practice to progress from local scale to national scale, there is need for a clear communication pathway for the WEF nexus models and tools–from who are the concerned stakeholders at all these levels through to how to M&E evaluate what is going on in that pathway.  7 Conclusion Achieving SDGs 2, 6, and 7 is one of the thrusts of the whole world, in addition to the other 13 SDGs. The three SDGs are interrelated as they collectively address issues around the water, energy, and food, suggesting the need for their joint consideration. The WEF nexus approach considers the three resources and has advantages for achieving the three SDGs. However, the WEF approach has highlighted the need to consider synergies and trade-offs between the three resources.  The development and implementation of the WEF nexus should include all relevant stakeholders that relate to the three resource systems. The WEF nexus identifies interlinkages, synergies, and trade-offs from the interactions that exist between water, energy, and food sectors. The knowledge of the connections that exist between WEF resources is critical in making resource management decision and can eventually lead to sustainable utilization of the resources and indeed the fulfillment of food and nutrition security and the SDGs 2, 6, and 7. Recently, WEF nexus research publications have been increasing exponentially and have demonstrated the capability of investigating the complex relationships between the three subsystems. Emphasis should be placed on the development of quantitative assessment tools that can enable the operationalization of the WEF nexus in both developed and developing nations and their contribution to food and nutrition security and the SDGs 2, 6, and 7 outcomes. Governments should ensure that the enabling environment and facilitating drivers exists. Lastly the WEF nexus as a practice needs to be upscaled and outscaled for the benefits to reach a wider audience at different spatial scales.   References Ahuja and Tatsutani, 2009 D. Ahuja  M.
