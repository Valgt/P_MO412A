                  Unstable, non-viable and unsustainable systems, whether they are environmental, political, technological, social or economic systems, create serious challenges and place even humanity itself at risk. At IFAC we believe that scientists and technologists, especially control and automation systems researchers and practitioners, can contribute to making the world a more stable place for everyone. Technological proliferation contributes significantly to these systemic and structural effects. The application of global systems of information, finance, energy and other resources has both negative and positive consequences. The diversity of TC 9-5 makes it a unique Science and Engineering community within which to explore the role of UN SDGs. This paper sets out the historical development of TC9-5 in light of the UN SDGs, and demonstrates some key aspects of the current alignment of TC9-5 with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

ORIGINS AND HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT  The genesis of the IFAC technical community dedicated to  improving international stability and concerned with the  conditions for sustainable development can be traced back to  1981, originating from discussions during the IFAC World  Congress in Kyoto, spearheaded by Hal Chestnut, the first  President of IFAC. This gave rise to a fledgling working  group (later to become a technical committee) initially known  as "SWIIS"  which stood for â€œSupplemental Ways of  Improving International Stabilityâ€�, later to be renamed  â€œTechnology, Culture and International Stabilityâ€� TECIS).  The community had the distinction of being one of IFAC's  most enduring and diverse (for a fuller treatment of the  development of TC9-5 see Kopacek, Stapleton & Dimirovski  (2017); Kopacek & Stapleton (2020)). Its inception can be  pinpointed to 1983, marked by the inaugural workshop  convened in Austria. This meeting was lauded as a pivotal,  and much needed, bridge connecting control engineers with a  myriad of other disciplines, thereby expanding IFAC's  purview to encompass a broader spectrum of related fields  related to the impacts of technology proliferation upon the  planet and human global civilisation.

ORIGINS AND HISTORICAL DEVELOP ENT  The genesis of the IFAC technical community dedicated to  improving international stability and concerned with the  conditions for sustainable development can be traced back to  1981, originating from discussions during the IFAC orld  Congress in Kyoto, spearheaded by Hal Chestnut, the first  President of IFAC. This gave rise to a fledgling working  group (later to become a technical committee) initially known  as "S IIS"  which stood for â€œSupplemental ays of  Improving International Stabilityâ€�, later to be renamed  â€œTechnology, Culture and International Stabilityâ€� TECIS).  The community had the distinction of being one of IFAC's  most enduring and diverse (for a fuller treatment of the  development of TC9-5 see Kopacek, Stapleton & Dimirovski  (2017); Kopacek & Stapleton (2020)). Its inception can be  pinpointed to 1983, marked by the inaugural workshop  convened in Austria. This meeting was lauded as a pivotal,  and much needed, bridge connecting control engineers with a  myriad of other disciplines, thereby expanding IFAC's  purview to encompass a broader spectrum of related fields  related to the impacts of technology proliferation upon the  planet and human global civilisation.

Now, 2 decades later, the accuracy of the  models and predictions proposed in the proceedings of the  2003 event, and following events, stand validated,  underscoring the enduring relevance and impact of the  insights gleaned from the SWIIS community.   The scope of Technical Committee (TC) grew to encompass  a wide array of subjects, showcasing the diverse applications  and ethical considerations within engineering. The next  section will briefly showcase a few indicative examples of  technologies that have been addressed in TC 9-5 publications  and which have relevance to the UN SDGs and their mission.  2. TECHNOLOGY, INTERNATIONAL STABILITY  AND SUSTAINABILITY: ACTIVITIES,  APPLICATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS  For decades the Technical Committee (TC) has explored and  evaluated a diverse range of technical control and automation  application domains. This short section provides a very short  but indicative overview of the activities of the past twenty  years or so which introduce some ways that TC 9-5 highlights  the relationship between automation and control and UN  SDGs.   On the technology application side, TC 9-5 showcased early  developments of innovative solutions for pressing  humanitarian problems, to development process gaps and  other areas. For example, in advanced robotics TC9-5  developed and showcased of robot swarms for humanitarian  demining (Kopacek (2002)). Another work by TC member  (Ibrahimov et al. (2018)) sheds light on crucial aspects of  technology adoption and innovation within the oil and gas  industry, particularly focusing on automation, robotics, and  safety standards. Its findings resonate deeply with TECIS's  mission and endeavours in leveraging technology for  addressing pressing humanitarian challenges. By highlighting  the significance of innovation in the oil sector and  emphasizing the need to enhance safety measures through  technological advancements, the paper underscores a parallel  need in TECIS's efforts to deploy innovative solutions for  humanitarian problems worldwide. Moreover, the discussion  on open innovation resonates with TECIS's approach to  collaboration and partnership in addressing complex global  issues. Other applications include the use of swarm drones for  rescue operations (Meshcheryakov et al (2019)). The use of  control and automation to manage complex issues arising  from population movements across national boundaries has  also been given attention, and a survey of these applications  has been published by TC9-5 ( Halili and Fetaji (2019)). This  very short selection of TC 9-5 applications showcase the ways  in which control and automation technologies impinge upon  international stability and it is evident that these have  implications for sustainabe development. In addition to  applications development and evaluation, process-based  research contributed to the ethical engineering discourse on  technology development methods. For example, ethically- improved systems engineering development praxis has long  been an important topic in TC 9-5 (e.g. Stapleton, Hersh &  Duffy (2005)).  A brief survey of the proceedings of the last ten years will  reveal how topics like energy systems, featuring country case  studies on system failures and their causes and effects, service  engineering applications for eldercare in poorer countries and  other cost-oriented solutions emanating from the Cost- Oriented Automation working group in TC 9-5 again  showcase important contributions in the area of global  sustainable development (e.g. Bula & Hajrizi (2019), a good  example of indicative conference proceedings addressing  many of these topics is Stapleton, Kopacek and Topalov  (2019)).   Leveraging automation and control technologies and their  implications in concert with the UN SDGs aligns with IFAC's  commitment to leveraging control and automation systems for  the betterment of society. The next section briefly highlights  some of the systemic challenges addressed by TC9-5.   3. TC9-5, SYSTEMATIC CHALLENGES AND  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  Environmental degradation, a key concern addressed by the  TC9-5 , stands out as one of the most pressing issues of our  time. Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions  and unsustainable resource extraction, poses an existential  threat to ecosystems and livelihoods worldwide.  Environmental stability is a major topic of TC9-5 activities,  especially as regards the Ethical Engineering Working Group  and the End of Life Management (EOL) Working Group.  systems for intelligent disassembly and reuse in industrial  settings. Furthermore, the TC's focus on cost-oriented  automation was exemplified through initiatives like the  development of low-cost service robots tailored for  underserved regions, illustrating a commitment to leveraging  technology for societal benefit and sustainable development.  (Kopacek, 2015). The Engineering Ethics working group  have organised special workshops as part of tC9-5 events,  during which the implications of Climate Change for IFAC  are explored in depth and strategies proffered for future  research and professional development in the IFAC global  community (e.g. Hersh & Stapleton (2009)).   In recent times global political instability has become a major  source of concern. TC 9-5 since the very beginning has used  control and automation systems thinking as a lens through  which to understand political instability and geopolitical  tensions, recognizing their role in exacerbating global  uncertainties and hindering progress towards peace and  cooperation. TC9-5 acknowledges the role of technological  advancements in shaping global dynamics. Engagement of  TC9-5 researchers in post-conflict situations has appeared  extensively in TC9-5 publications (e.g. .Stapleton (2009);  Stapleton, Kopacek & Hajrizi (2009);  Kealy & Stapleton  (2015)). Other contributions include the use of automation  and control to evaluate citizens perceptions of policy  initiatives and other political activities, foreshadowing many  178 Bahadur Ibrahimov  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 176â€“181 3    important debates about the role of AI (for example) in the  public sphere (e.g. Tsyganov (2021)). The 2021 TECIS  conference covered these topics in some depth and the  interested reader is directed to the full set of proceedings  (Stapleton, Avdeeva and Kopacek (2021)).  In the social sphere, inequalities persist across gender, race,  ethnicity, and socio-economic status, perpetuating  marginalization and exclusion. Access to education,  healthcare, and economic opportunities remains uneven,  limiting individual potential and hindering collective progress  towards achieving the full spectrum of human rights and  capabilities. These have been topics extensively addressed in  TC9-5. For example, at the 2022 conference a special session  was organised which included representatives from the  United Nations Development Program. The session addressed  education and gender-related rights (Stapleton et al (2022)).   4. BRIEF REVIEW OF TC9-5 VERSUS UN SDGS  The foregoing discussion is evidence of the alignment of  TC9-5 activities with UN SDGs since the very genning of the  community in the early 1980s, and some ways in which the  communities activities and agenda remain relevant to UN  SDGs today. This section will take a deep dive into a few of  those SDGs and look at TC9-5 activities through the UN SDG  lens. At the end of this section two tables will summarise  some indicative contributions of the TC under nine of the 17  SDGs. This communityâ€™s activities and outputs intersect with  several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), forging  crucial connections between global stability and sustainable  development.   By addressing poverty (SDG 1) through socio-economic  stability strategies, TC9--5 contributes to creating a  foundation for equitable resource distribution and poverty  alleviation.   Its exploration of environmental stability and system  analytical approaches aligns with SDG 13 (Climate Action)  and SDG 15 (Life on Land), supporting efforts for climate  resilience and biodiversity conservation.   Additionally, discussions on negotiation and mediation in  conflict resolution (SDG 16) foster peacebuilding and the  promotion of inclusive societies. TC9-5â€™s interdisciplinary  approach also contributes to reducing inequalities (SDG 10)  by addressing socio-economic disparities and promoting  inclusive development strategies. In essence, the work of  TC9-5 serves as a catalyst for holistic and interconnected  solutions, bridging the gap between international stability and  the pursuit of sustainable development, thus paving the way  for a more resilient and equitable future for all, supporting and  fulfilling the aims of SDG 17.   TC 9-5's work also aligns with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean  Energy) through research and innovation in energy-efficient  control systems and renewable energy technologies.  Similarly, TC 9-5 contributes to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation,  and Infrastructure) by advancing automation solutions for  sustainable manufacturing processes and resilient  infrastructure development.  Furthermore, TC 9-5's activities address cross-cutting issues  such as SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice,  and Strong Institutions) by promoting diversity and inclusion  in the field of control and automation, and by supporting  ethical practices and responsible innovation. The work of the  Technical Committee on Supplemental Ways for Improving  International Stability (TECIS), formerly known as SWIIS,  has been instrumental in addressing a diverse range of ethical  and societal issues within the realm of automation and control  systems.   Through initiatives such as robotics and engineering ethics,  TECIS has contributed to fostering responsible and ethical  practices in the development and deployment of advanced  technologies. Additionally, TECIS has played a pivotal role  in exploring strategies for End of Life Management (EOL) in  automated systems, emphasizing the importance of  sustainability and responsible resource management.     Table 1: TC9-5 Alignment with SDGs 1, 3, 5 & 7   Bahadur Ibrahimov  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 176â€“181 179 4      Table 2: TC9-5 Alignment with SDGs 9 & 10    Table 3: TC9-5 Alignment with SDGs 13, 15 & 16  TECIS' efforts have extended to promoting inclusion and  diversity within an across IFAC through the Inclusion and  Diversity working group. This working group, stemming  from the groundwork laid by TECIS at the 2016 TECIS  Conference, has made significant contributions to advancing  diversity and equity in the automation and control  community, culminating in notable achievements showcased  at the IFAC World Congress in 2023. Through these  collective endeavours, TECIS continues to shape the  discourse surrounding ethical, societal, and diversity-related  considerations in the development and implementation of  automation and control technologies, driving progress  towards a more responsible, inclusive, and sustainable future.   TC 9-5's Ethics Working Group plays a critical role in  navigating ethical considerations in research and practice,  ensuring that technological advancements are deployed  responsibly and in alignment with the principles of  sustainability and equality.  Tables 1, 2 and 3 summarise the alignment with UN SDGs.  Firstly, each table provides some indicative publications  which were presented at the last conference, TECIS 2022 in  Kosovo. The references for these citations are provided in the  references list at the end of the paper. However, for a fuller  treatment the reader is directed to the proceedings volumes  for the conferences of the 2020-23 triennium i.e. Stapleton,  Avdeeva & Kopacek (2021 and Kopacek (2022), Secondly,  each of the tables summarises alignment with the main  Working Groups of the Technical Committee. Each of the  shadowed cells fere to the fact that that these working groups  have published work in the specific SDG areas indicated at  some stage in a TECIS event and these publications can be  found in IFAC Papers Online.  5. CONCLUSION  TC 9-5 acknowledges its unique position within IFAC to  leverage control and automation systems for addressing  systemic challenges and advancing sustainable development  (Stapleton and Kopacek (2023)). By aligning its agenda with  the UN SDGs, TC 9-5 contributes to global efforts in areas  such as clean energy, sustainable cities, and responsible  consumption and production., to name a small few. Through  interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge exchange  within IFAC and outside, TC 9-5 seeks to create an ecosystem  to develop innovative solutions that address the root causes of  socio-environmental problems and promote inclusive  development. This paper suggests that this embodies the  partnership envisaged in UN SDG 17.  The United Nations plays a pivotal role in shaping the global  development agenda and fostering international cooperation  towards achieving the SDGs (UN, 2015). TC 9-5 recognizes  the importance of collaboration with UN agencies, academic  institutions, and civil society organizations to leverage  collective expertise and resources for sustainable  development.   By aligning its agenda with the UN SDGs, TC 9-5 aims to  leverage control and automation systems research and  practice to contribute meaningfully to achieving sustainable  development outcomes. The seventeen interconnected goals  encompass diverse dimensions of sustainability, including  environmental stewardship, social equity, economic  prosperity, and institutional governance.  180 Bahadur Ibrahimov  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 58-3 (2024) 176â€“181 5      REFERENCES  M.

At IFAC we believe that scientists and technologists, especially control and automation systems researchers and practitioners, can contribute to making the world a more stable place for everyone. Technological proliferation contributes significantly to these systemic and structural effects. The application of global systems of information, finance, energy and other resources has both negative and positive consequences. The diversity of TC 9-5 makes it a unique Science and Engineering community within which to explore the role of UN SDGs. This paper sets out the historical development of TC9-5 in light of the UN SDGs, and demonstrates some key aspects of the current alignment of TC9-5 with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).
