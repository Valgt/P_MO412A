Trade-offs and values in the UN sustainable development goals Mark Burgman ∗   Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, 14 Prince's Gardens, London, United Kingdom Centre for Environmental Policy Imperial College London 14 Prince's Gardens London United Kingdom   ∗ Corresponding author: Burgman, Mark   This review comes from a themed issue on UN SGDs: How can sustainable chemistry contribute?  Edited by Tom Welton   Anastas and Zimmerman (this volume) ask some excellent questions; How do you measure the value of a product or an ecosystem? How do you define performance around all of the consequences of a product life-cycle? What risk is acceptable to workers, consumers and future generations? What are acceptable levels of return on investments? These questions arise, for instance, in public discussions about the role of insecticides. Carrington (2018) reported in the Guardian that the EU bans on neonicotinoid insecticides and shorter renewal periods for glyphosate [1]  were supported by recent research such as that summarised in the UN Report on the ‘Right to food’ [2] , which eschews the widespread, industrial scale of crop protection chemicals, because of potential, unintended consequences on the environment and human health. These concerns are unpinned by, for instance, recent evidence that non-target insect populations are declining globally and dramatically [3] . Erik Fyrwald, CEO of Syngenta, responded by saying that shunning agricultural technology will have serious implications for food security, a consequence of the burgeoning human population and climate change. Fyrwald went on to say regarding pesticides: “I do think there is a trust issue – I think we have to listen more, engage more” [1] . Thus, there is an opportunity to deploy new approaches that close the gap between Anastas and Zimmerman's questions and current industry practice, some of which lie in the answers outlined in the papers in this collection. Poliakoff et al. argue for changes at ‘both ends’ of the supply chain, embracing laboratory construction and energy use. Likewise, Xu et al., O'Riordan, Pavez et al. and Lambin and Corpart outline corporate and societal aspirations towards the UN SDG goals, focusing on sourcing raw materials, production, distribution and fate of the products. Axon and James document the sustainability goals of many other major corporations and allude to the need to quantify the health, environmental, social and resource costs and benefits of chemical products. Coming to terms with the spirit of the UN's goals will require all of the initiatives described in these pages, but alone they are not enough. Green chemistry requires corporations to engage deliberately and strategically with the people they serve, including customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. To do this, industry and regulators need to contemplate the implication of decisions in the broadest possible terms using appropriate tools for social engagement and analysis.   References 1 D.
