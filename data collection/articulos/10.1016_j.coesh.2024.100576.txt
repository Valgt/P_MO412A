Introduction Groundwater and linkage to SDGs Fulfilling the freshwater demands of a continuously growing global population through groundwater shall face several challenges, such as contamination, climate change impacts, faster decline than recharge, and transboundary conflicts [1 ]. Utilising energy-efficient technologies, treatments, aquifer recharge techniques, and sustainable management practices can help alleviate these challenges [2 ]. This underscores the critical nexus between water and energy, with implications for the environment, climate, food security, and public health [3 ,4 ]. These issues closely align with the global objectives outlined in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs ) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development established by the United Nations, as well as in the 8 Millennium Development Goals . All the SDGs are relevant to water-related issues in some capacity and these SDGs complement each other [1 ]. For example, access to safe water and sanitation (Goal 6) and affordable energy (Goal 7) are vital for poverty reduction (Goal 1), hunger alleviation (Goal 2), and promoting good health through safe water (Goal 3). Similarly, combating climate change by transitioning to renewable energy (Goal 13), and eradicating poverty (Goal 1) can be pivotal to tackle injustice and inequalities (Goal 10). Gender equality (Goal 5) is essential for addressing disparities in sanitation and water access for women and girls and promoting peace and justice (Goal 16), especially in developing economies. Enhancing sustainable water and energy technologies leads to optimum utilisation of renewable energy sources (Goal 7), energy-efficient buildings and cities (Goal 11), fostering economic growth (Goal 8), promoting innovation (Goal 9), and protecting life in aquatic ecosystems (Goal 14) and on land (Goal 15). Quality education and access to information (Goal 4), and revitalising global partnerships (goal 17) for judicious water use are crucial to enhance responsible production and consumption (Goal 12), which in turn, will contribute to reducing the inequalities (Goal 10). Therefore, solving the problems related to groundwater adheres to the ancient concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam  (in Sanskrit), which implies ‘The Earth is one family’.  Scientiometrics (countries and sources) of recent research on ‘groundwater’ and ‘sustainable development goals’ Upon exploring the recently published literature available from Web of Science database using a combination of ‘groundwater’ and ‘sustainable development goals’, we identified over 400 articles published within the last 5 years. There is a significant year-over-year growth in the number of such articles. Further, among SDGs, the SDG6 has the maximum frequency (much higher than others) of mentions in these articles. Figure 1   presents the results of bibliometric analysis, i.e., the chord diagram showing the share of articles published from different countries with their inter-collaborative networks (minimum 5 co-published articles), whereas the horizontal bar chart represents the rank of journals in terms of number of citations received by the publications of the aforementioned combination. It is evident that United Kingdom and USA are the leaders across the globe with their dense international networks. The countries, viz., India, Germany, China, Australia and Netherlands have also contributed significantly towards research on the role of groundwater in achieving SDGs. Among the journals, the relevant articles published in ‘Science of The Total Environment ’ lead the chart with 1008 citations, followed by ‘Journal of Hydrology ’ with 541 citations. However, bibliometric analysis alone is insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of the field. Therefore, a systematic review approach is employed to further look into the methodologies, innovations, and findings of the key studies on groundwater monitoring and management, emphasising their contributions to SDG6 and SDG13. Advanced monitoring technologies have emerged as critical tools for sustainable groundwater management. For instance, remote sensing techniques using satellites, aerial drones, and gravitational monitoring have revolutionised the mapping and quantification of groundwater resources [5 ,6 ]. These technologies enable the identification of groundwater depletion hotspots and support the development of targeted conservation measures. Additionally, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in aquifers has facilitated real-time monitoring of groundwater levels and quality, enabling early detection of contamination and informing management decisions [7 ]. Sustainable extraction methods and community-based management strategies have also gained prominence in recent years. Studies have highlighted the effectiveness of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) techniques, such as rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge, in enhancing groundwater storage and reducing dependence on surface water resources [8 ,9 ]. Participatory groundwater management approaches, involving the engagement of local communities in decision-making processes, have been found to foster cooperation among stakeholders and lead to socially acceptable and effective management strategies [10 ]. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have emerged as promising approaches for enhancing localised groundwater recharge and improving water security. Studies have demonstrated the benefits of NBS, such as constructed wetlands, permeable pavements, and green roofs, in reducing surface runoff, improving water quality, and recharging aquifers [11–15 ]. These solutions offer cost-effective and eco-friendly alternatives to traditional grey infrastructure, while also providing co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. The synthesis of these studies highlights the potential of advanced monitoring technologies, sustainable extraction methods, community-based management strategies, and nature-based solutions in addressing the challenges posed by groundwater depletion and contamination. These approaches align with and contribute to the broader objectives of SDG6 and SDG13, promoting sustainable water management and climate change adaptation. However, the effectiveness and scalability of these solutions may vary depending on the specific context and require further evaluation and adaptation to local conditions.  Relevance of SDG6 and SDG13 with groundwater SDG6 plays a pivotal role in ensuring the sustainable management of groundwater and freshwater resources, a prerequisite for meeting the global demand for safe drinking water and sanitation. Access to clean groundwater sources is vital for public health, particularly in regions where surface water is scarce or contaminated, and groundwater quality must be safeguarded through pollution prevention measures and sustainable management practices. SDG6 underscores the importance of equitable access to safe water and sanitation, promoting water security and supporting sustainable development efforts worldwide. On the other hand, SDG13 emphasises the urgent need for climate actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Climate change typically leads to intensification of hydrological cycle, resulting in higher-intensity shorter-duration storms and higher temperatures, which directly affect groundwater resources. Groundwater plays a crucial role in climate change adaptation, providing a reliable water supply during dry periods and serving as a buffer against droughts. Therefore, regular monitoring of groundwater quantity and quality informs sustainable water management practices. Integrating this information into climate change adaptation strategies enhances resilience to climate-induced water stress, thereby aligning with the broader objectives of SDG13.   Review of relevant literature on groundwater and its relevance to SDG6 and SDG13 Groundwater sustainability in the context of SDG6 Several recent studies have reported diverse aspects of groundwater management towards sustainability, highlighting the integration of innovative technologies, governance models, and sustainable practices to address water scarcity and pollution challenges. Arora and Mishra [16 ] highlighted the urgent need for global water security in the face of challenges such as pollution and water scarcity. Improving water quality, water use efficiency and infrastructure can ensure equitable access to clean water and sanitation, and reduce the persistent gaps in global efforts towards meeting the complex water challenges. Similarly, Singh and Jayaram [17 ] explored the global challenges and initiatives relevant to groundwater for achieving global water security, with a focus on improving access, quality, and affordability of water and sanitation. Bouma [18 ] emphasised that understanding the soil moisture regimes through hydropedology is crucial to improve ecosystem services, agricultural production, water quality, and climate actions. Scheihing et al. [19 ] focused on the strategic importance of capacity development for groundwater sustainability, considering the fact that groundwater accounts for 97% of accessible freshwater. They underscored the importance of stakeholder-specific capacity assessments, development implementations, and success verification mechanisms as the backbones of groundwater capacity development. Considering the importance of water governance models to meet the SDGs, Di Vaio et al. [20 ] carried out a structured literature review, and underscored the necessity of collaboration, coordination, and stakeholder engagement in groundwater governance, thereby enhancing local-level groundwater management to address global sustainability challenges. Matta et al. [21 ] reviewed the vital role of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) practices in managing epidemics and pandemics. The study highlighted the necessity of robust WASH facilities and practices, specifically the behavioural changes to prevent the spread of diseases. On the other hand, Mustafa et al. [22 ] studied the impact of public awareness on achieving groundwater sustainability, which highlighted the positive effects of willingness to pay, social influence, governmental facilities, public awareness, and knowledge about contaminated water on the intention to use clean water. Due to increase in population, industrialization, pollution and other anthropogenic factors, availability of useable groundwater is under threat. A significant decline in groundwater levels was reported in Multan, Pakistan, due to increased water consumption and wastage during the COVID-19 pandemic. A chronic decline of 40 cm/yr in the groundwater levels across Malwa Region of Punjab (India) was reported, which can be attributed to the agricultural shift to rice cultivation after green revolution [23 ]. The crop water requirement of rice is very high and the Malwa Region falls under semi-arid to arid climatic condition, resulting in excessive dependence of agriculture on groundwater irrigation. The importance of groundwater in global water security, public health and socioeconomic development became pivotal in the unprecedented context of COVID-19 pandemic. Nature-based solutions, grey and green infrastructure, and sustainable irrigation practices for quantitative and qualitative enhancement of accessible water have gained significant attention in post-pandemic scenarios [24 ]. Studies across diverse countries have substantiated the essence of groundwater sustainability. For instance, improving access to clean drinking water and sanitation through the Swachh Bharat Mission, developing the Water Sustainability Index with emphasis on sustainable utilisation of water resources, National Aquifer Mapping and Management program (NAQUIM), ‘Atal Bhujal Yojana’ scheme to improve the management of groundwater resources in water stressed states, are some of the robust measures taken in India [4 ,25–27 ]. Some of the crucial measures in this regard include an improved policy-making, information access, and stakeholder engagement on groundwater governance in Iran [28 ]; resource-oriented sanitation, blue-green-brown infrastructure, restoration of ecological functions of inland waters as proposed options for efficient groundwater use in Austria [29 ]; policy interventions for equitable access to clean water and sanitation in Nigeria [30 ]; ecohealth model aimed at enhancing groundwater quality through integrated sanitation and hygiene practices in urban coastal settings of Benin, West Africa [31 ]; and enhancing domestic wastewater collection capacity as well as implementing full-cost recovery fees in Southeast Asian cities [32 ]. Garcia et al. [33 ] proposed an innovative method of integrating sustainability indicators into management practices to assess alignment of urban water systems with SDGs. These studies collectively highlight the necessity of comprehensive planning, policy reform, and community engagement to ensure sustainable water and sanitation management. Several studies in recent years have also collectively emphasised on the multifaceted challenges and opportunities in sustainable management of groundwater systems. Developing countries are typically challenged by the wider disparity between current capabilities and targets, higher demands, large population, limited availability of information, constrained resources and lack of statistical institutions to manage them. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) plays a vital role to overcome these obstacles by providing a platform for transparent sharing of gathered information. GIS can be particularly handy in accomplishing the majority of the targets under SDG6 [34 ]. The vulnerabilities in groundwater systems due to over-exploitation should be identified, especially in semi-arid and arid regions, utilising geospatial and multi-criteria decision-making tools [3 ,35 ]. The pressing issue of arsenic contamination in low-income countries urges cost-effective remediation techniques for safe water access [36 ]. The importance of infrastructure improvements for reliable water supply systems [37 ], wastewater treatments aimed at improving water availability and public health [38 ,39 ], as well as advancements the groundwater treatment technologies like capacitive deionisation (CDI) [40 ] are some of the vital ongoing efforts to achieve groundwater sustainability. Additionally, research addressing the impact of artisanal and small-scale mining on water resources urging policy reforms [41 ], along with initiatives aimed at addressing the inadequacy of SDG 6 indicators [42 ] are vital contributions toward this goal. Ibrahim [43 ] discussed the challenges and implications of viewing water as a human right versus a commodity, particularly in the context of SDG6. Overall, these studies collectively underscore the complexities of achieving clean water and sanitation universally, highlighting innovative solutions and the need for comprehensive policy and community engagement. The challenges and solutions pertinent to fulfilling SDG6 through groundwaters systems is summarised in Figure 2  .  Groundwater sustainability in the context of SDG 13 Transitioning to focus on SDG13, it is imperative to recognise the dual relationship groundwater holds with climate change—it is both significantly affected by climate change and, at the same time, has the potential to mitigate its impacts. In this context, recent studies have shown that climate change poses significant threats to groundwater resources due to changes in precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and increased temperatures. For example, Dehghani et al. [44 ] studied the effect of climate change on groundwater level in Iran, under the future RCP85 scenarios and found that the groundwater level would decline by 1–1.5 m in the future (2021–2040) due to the potential changes in temperature and precipitation. In another study, Xiao et al. [45 ] demonstrated the detrimental effects of sea level rise on groundwater in the Tibetan Plateau. The study found that saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems is exacerbated by these changes, thereby and posing significant environmental challenges. Hassan et al. [46 ] in their study examined how climate change affects groundwater recharge in Iraq, using a combination of a simulation tool (MODFLOW + WetSpass model) and downscaled climate model (CanESM2) output. The study indicated that by the end of this century, the annual groundwater recharge is projected to decline by 13.6% and 21.2% under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. These depletions in groundwater resources are further expected to exacerbate the drought severity and resilience of water supplies across the globe. In this direction, Lapides et al. [47 ] discussed how the groundwater depletion can lead to significant reductions in baseflow and surface water flow, which also negatively impact the aquatic ecosystems by altering the distribution and abundance of species that rely on consistent environmental flows. Bhattarai et al. [48 ] reported significant reduction in crop area and yields over India due to declining groundwater level in the country. These studies together emphasize the pressing need to tackle the depletion of groundwater resources in light of the increasing challenges posed by climate change. While climate change adversely affects groundwater systems, sustainable groundwater management has substantial potential for building climate resilience and mitigating climate change impacts to achieve SDG 13. For example, Noori and Singh [8 ] highlighted the effectiveness of groundwater recharge enhancement techniques, including rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge, as methods to increase groundwater storage capacity and reduce dependence on surface water resources. Similarly, Casas et al. [9 ] demonstrated the success of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) in the Los Arenales aquifer in Spain, showing that MAR systems enable aquifers to recover more quickly and remain less vulnerable during drought conditions. Further, Shyam et al. [49 ] proposed a geospatial approach for designing artificial recharge systems in India, which can increase groundwater recharge, ease stress on depleted aquifers and mitigate flood hazards during extreme precipitation events. Sikka et al. [50 ] emphasised the importance of a multi-faceted strategy encompassing the expansion of groundwater recharge, participatory groundwater management, and integration with other sectors. These approaches collectively contribute to building climate resilience, leveraging groundwater's significant storage buffer and reliability as a water source during dry spells and droughts. The challenges and solutions pertinent to achieving SDG13 through groundwater systems is summarised in Figure 2 .   Ways forward Enhancing groundwater data and modelling capabilities From the previous sections, it is evident that groundwater systems play a vital role in accomplishing SDG 6 and 13, and there are various opportunities to enhance the impact of groundwater in contributing to these sustainable development goals. One key area that requires immediate attention is the enhancement of groundwater data by implementing advanced mapping and modelling capabilities to accurately quantify available resources and its quality [5 ,6 ]. This is especially critical in developing countries where data gaps are acute and vulnerable communities are most affected. Innovations in remote sensing technologies, such as satellites, aerial drones, and gravitational monitoring, coupled with the rapid analysis of complex datasets using artificial intelligence, offer immense potential to revolutionise our understanding of groundwater resources at a global scale. Furthermore, the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in aquifers and advancements in hydrogeological modelling software can facilitate the integration of surface and groundwater, enabling smarter decisions regarding drinking water security, irrigation planning for food production, and the selection of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) sites [6 ,7 ]. While groundwater modelling has traditionally been conducted at the regional level due to computational complexity, technological advancements now provide an opportunity for more global-level modelling studies. By expanding the scale of modelling efforts, we can gain insights into the interconnected nature of groundwater systems and their implications for sustainable development. These insights will be particularly valuable for addressing transboundary aquifer systems and will enable farmers, communities and governments to plan for more sustainable utilisation of groundwater and ensure long-term water security.  Improving groundwater governance and management framework Improved groundwater governance and management frameworks are another essential aspect of achieving the full potential of groundwater systems in fulfilling SDG 6 and 13. Priority actions include addressing widespread groundwater contamination through eco-friendly interventions and sustainable technologies for soil and water remediation [51 ]. Sustainable efforts in minimizing contaminants like arsenic, nitrates, and pesticides in groundwater should also be promoted, with the implementation of greener solutions such as in-situ bioremediation and bioelectroremediation [52 ]. Development of equitable, climate-resilient groundwater policies is also crucial for adaptation, based on integrated principles of sustainability, social equity and efficiency [19 ]. Groundwater intricately connects multiple societal issues, from food and energy production to human health, ecosystem vitality, climate resilience, and equitable economic development. Constructing multi-stakeholder collaboration platforms oriented around specific aquifers or watersheds may enable development of locally relevant and integrated management solutions. The urgency of this cannot be overlooked, as demonstrated through emerging regulatory examples like California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) and the European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD) [53 ,54 ]. Embracing such partnership frameworks that bridge across sectors at multiple governance levels could substantially accelerate progress on groundwater sustainability [55 ]. Such partnerships can additionally open up opportunities for knowledge transfer, technology innovation, attract financing from public and private sources, and negotiate collaborative groundwater infrastructure development. Additionally, governance measures such as combined water use fees or withdrawal limits that consider connectivity to groundwaters would promote sustainable utilisation by balancing the water needs of municipalities, farmers, industries, and environments. However, the concept of ‘sustainability’ warrants careful framing to develop realistic, actionable plans [56 ]. As Wood points out, the term can be vague and unrealistic for long timescales. Thus, developing a practical groundwater sustainability vocabulary that incorporates quantity, quality, environmental impacts and social equity is crucial for shaping adaptation policies and governance capacities. International collaboration and investment can reinforce such governance improvements and support multi-stakeholder groundwater initiatives, particularly in developing countries. For example, the Global Water Partnership's strategic investments in community-based urban and rural water supply programs across Southeast Asia provide an inspiring model of how impactful funding can empower localised solutions while also strengthening national governance capacities [57 ]. Through collaborative efforts centred on channelling investments to such local and global initiatives, establishing clearly delineated sustainability objectives, and implementing decentralised participatory groundwater governance involving grassroots stakeholders alongside governments, scientists, and policymakers, the global community can strengthen groundwater's contributions towards fulfilling sustainable development goals.  Promoting participatory groundwater management and adopting innovative solutions Participatory groundwater management and the adoption of nature-based solutions (NBS) are two promising areas that require particular attention in the pursuit of sustainable groundwater management. Engaging groundwater users in decision-making processes can lead to socially acceptable and effective management strategies [10 ]. Participatory planning enables the identification of locally relevant solutions, fostering cooperation among stakeholders and reducing social tensions. However, the success of participatory approaches depends on factors such as the level of stakeholder involvement, the clarity of roles and responsibilities, and the capacity of local institutions to facilitate the process. The implementation of NBS presents significant benefits for enhancing localised groundwater recharge and improving overall water security, especially in the face of climate change. Simple, low-cost, and indigenous NBS, such as managed aquifer recharge (MAR) systems, not only contribute to ecological regeneration but also benefit communities by providing reliable water sources for agriculture, domestic use, and industrial applications [11–15 ]. Check dams, ponds, and wetland/meadow restoration are other common examples of NBS that help revitalise ecosystems while benefiting local communities. However, the effectiveness and scalability of NBS depend on various factors, such as the specific hydrogeological conditions, the availability of land and financial resources, and the willingness of stakeholders to adopt and maintain these solutions. Scaling out nature-based solutions holds great promise for enhancing localised groundwater recharge and water security, especially in the face of climate change. Solar-powered desalination technologies represent another underutilised yet promising solution for expanding water security in arid regions by making clean water accessible to those who currently rely on brackish supplies [58 ]. However, the adoption of these technologies faces challenges such as limited financial resources, technical capacity constraints, and the need for context-specific adaptations. Implementing these innovative solutions and strategies will require significant investment in research and development, as well as collaboration among stakeholders, policymakers, and scientists. Affordable access to these technologies is crucial for maximising their impact and ensuring their long-term sustainability. The benefits of adopting these ways forward are numerous, ranging from improved water quality and reduced poverty to enhanced climate resilience and sustainable agriculture [4 ,59 ]. But, the success of these approaches will also depend on the ability to adapt them to the specific social, economic, and environmental contexts of different regions. The study finds achieving sustainable development goals related to groundwater requires a multi-faceted approach that demands improved groundwater data, integrated water resource planning, increased public awareness, institutional strengthening and governance reforms, significant investment in research and innovation, stakeholder collaboration, and the adoption of NBS and climate change adaptation. By embracing these strategies and promoting cross-sectoral collaboration, we can effectively address the challenges posed by groundwater scarcity, contamination, and climate change, ultimately safeguarding water and food securities, ecosystem health, and equitable societies for future generations.
