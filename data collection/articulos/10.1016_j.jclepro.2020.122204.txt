                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the United Nations 2030 Agenda emerged in 2015, becoming an unprecedented global compass for navigating extant sustainability challenges. Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.

Handling Editor: Prof. Jiri Jaromir Klemeš The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the United Nations 2030 Agenda emerged in 2015, becoming an unprecedented global compass for navigating extant sustainability challenges. Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.   Keywords Sustainability  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Digitalization  ICT  Big data  Artificial intelligence    1 Introduction Sustainability and digitalization stand as major trends shaping the economy and society. The nexus amid both domains foreshows outstanding, yet untapped, opportunities to foster a transformation towards sustainable development (Osburg and Lohrmann, 2017 ). Paradoxically, sustainability challenges endure unanswered (Köhler et al., 2019 ). Indeed, environmental and social landscapes are hugely worsening, showing a glaring sustainability gap (Seele, 2016a ). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda brightly emerged in 2015, as an unprecedented global consensus and governance compass for bridging the sustainability gap, by navigating the ecological, social and economic challenges that humanity faces. A burgeoning body of literature devoted to the SDGs has been emerging in the last five years. Studies mainly focus on specific design caveats (Saner et al., 2019 ; Swain, 2018 ; Weber, 2017 ) or implementation and monitoring hurdles (i.e. Caiado et al., 2018 ; Crespo-Cuaresma et al., 2018 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2018 ) rather than on a critical overview of current research landscape. Thus far, there is no reference which comprehensively examines and categorizes all relevant research streams, gaps and controversies. Nevertheless, due to the novelty, multifaceted nature and extreme complexity of the 2030 Agenda, research is still incipient and fragmented, lacking sound science-policy dialogue and evidencing multiple controversies and open debates. Indeed, numerous implementation hurdles and uncertainties remain, being poorly covered in literature, thus deserving further understanding. Digitalization is heralded to be one of the most promising transformations for sustainability (Gouvea et al., 2018 ) towards tackling the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2019b ; Seele and Lock, 2017 ; Walker et al., 2019 ). However, regardless their underlying opportunities, digital paradigms such as Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, represent a nascent field lacking sufficient theoretical development and full of technological and non-technological challenges (Helbing et al., 2017 ; Hilbert, 2016 ; MacFeely, 2019 ). Controversies exist in terms of social and environmental sustainability (Akande et al., 2019 ; Kuntsman and Rattle, 2019 ; Scholz et al., 2018 ; Unwin, 2017 ). Only few studies address the relation amid digitalization and the SDGs, being a nexus which remains underrepresented in the scientific literature (i.e. GeSI, 2019 ; Kostoska and Kocarev, 2019 ; Tjoa and Tjoa, 2016 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). Pioneer studies are mainly focused on mapping the contribution of ICTs for monitoring SDGs indicators within stand-alone “for good” projects in specific domains, instead of understanding the role of digital capacities for bridging the 2030 Agenda challenges. Therefore, little is known about whether and to what extend the huge opportunities brought by digitalization could be responsibly leveraged for good, or on the contrary, end to hamper the achievement of the 2030 Agenda (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Goralski and Tan, 2020 ). Through a systematic and comprehensive review of relevant literature and the latest developments in the fields of sustainability and digitalization, the purpose of this article is twofold: (1) identifying, categorizing and assessing the key research gaps related to the SDGs, setting an overview of current state-of-knowledge in the field, coupled with (2); a critical exploration of the role that digitalization and Information and Communication technologies (ICTs), particularly Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, could play towards overcoming those SDGs hurdles and enabling the 2030 Agenda. Current research only scratches the surface, and to our best knowledge, a holistic systematic review, able to untangle the full picture of the research gaps, implications and prospective directions related to the nexus amid the 2030 Agenda and the role of digitalization to tackled them, has not yet been delivered. Our holistic review aims at bridging current literature gaps, by providing critical insights about underlying research gaps of the 2030 Agenda, underscoring the opportunities and limitations that digitalization could bring for tackling the SDGs, while devising potential policy implications and future avenues of research. Therefore, this study contributes with a unique seminal reference for guiding researchers, practitioners and policy-makers from different disciplines in the understanding of both the 2030 Agenda challenges and the nexus between the SDGs and Digitalization, by theorizing a yet uncharted research field. Aligned with the aforementioned, this article addresses two main research questions:⁃ RQ1 - What are the overarching research gaps of the SDGs within the UN 2030 Agenda?    ⁃ RQ2 - Whether and, to what extent, digitalization and ICT paradigms can responsibly contribute to bridging the 2030 Agenda gaps towards pursuing the SDGs?      The study is structured as follows, and shown in Fig. 1  . The first section introduces the motivation of the article, followed by the second section focused on the methodology. The third and fourth sections tackle the literature review and analysis concerning the first research question. Particularly, the third section firstly provides an outline about sustainability and, subsequently, it introduces the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) rationale. The fourth section addresses the SDGs implementation and governance hurdles. The fifth section is focused on the analysis of the convergence amid sustainability and digitalization, addressing the second research question. The sixth section covers a discussion where the research questions are answered in light of the previous review, beginning by summarizing the SDGs research gaps, followed by an exploration of the role of digital paradigms to bridge those caveats, closing with preliminary policy implications. Finally, the conclusion recapitulates the key findings, limitations of the study and future avenues which deserve further research.  2 Methodology The study has been undertaken through a systematic selection, in-depth review and synthesis of relevant literature over the last 10 years, as broadly acknowledged review approach (i.e. Aldieri et al., 2019 ). The review is based on qualitative methods, considering the most relevant sources of information from all relevant bodies of knowledge, primarily peer-reviewed articles in JCR journals, but also relevant pieces of grey literature, since some of the phenomena remain poorly explored in the scientific literature. It has been focused on identifying, clustering by themes and critical analyzing existing debates related to sustainability, the SDGs, and the convergence amid sustainability and digitalization (see Fig. 2  ), in order to generate both a big picture and detailed insights about the rationale and the policy, practical and research implications behind those discussions. The methodology followed is summarized in Table 1  . Two different screening processes for identifying scientific studies were performed: one focused on the SDGs solely, and the other focused on the interrelation amid sustainability, the SDGs, and digitalization. Different databases were explored in order to have a first understanding of the volume and adequacy of publications available. Afterwards, relevant journals and authors featured for more articles and citations were identified, leading to a screening refinement. Considering the novelty of the research realms, the publication period was narrowed to 2015–2019 for the SDGs (adopted in 2015) and 2010–2019 for the sustainability-digitalization domain (which began to emerge in the 2010). A few references published in early 2020 (as of March 2020) have also been included. Due to the multidimensional nature of the studied domains, subject areas were not restricted excessively, including ICTs, environmental, social, policy, business science and research. A parallel screening was conducted to identify relevant publications from practitioners, relevant initiatives (i.e. the Global e-Sustainability Initiative “GeSI”) and Multilateral Organisations (i.e. United Nation Agencies), as well as insights created through the different forums that have been forging the ground of knowledge. Once selected the documents, a first analysis of the abstract/executive summary was conducted to ensure relevance. Afterwards, the full text of relevant publications were profoundly analyzed, summarized and clustered according to central concepts and research themes. Through snowball analysis other contributions and refinements were added to further development of some of the sections.  3 The rationale of The Sustainable Development Goals within the Un 2030 agenda In this section, a brief introduction of the sustainability context is provided, followed by an overview on the SDGs rationale, including background, design shortcomings and imbalances. 3.1 An introduction to sustainability Sustainability has become a moral and economic imperative, since nature, society and businesses are strongly intertwined, affecting the valuation of any organization (Kiron and Unruh, 2018 ). Thus, success is no longer measured only in economic terms (Atos, 2018 ; UN Global Compact-Accenture, 2019 ). Paradoxically, the world seems to be far from a sustainable place. The negative footprints, climate crisis, severe biodiversity loss, pollution, inequality and social tensions, together with unsustainable behaviors remain or worsen (Kopnina, 2020 ; Osburg and Lohrmann, 2017 ), leading to growing threats (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ; Yingchun et al., 2018 ). Progress to date has not prevented the damage on the environment (Leal-Filho et al., 2018 ; Sabau, 2020 ). Indeed, environmental-related threats outrank the rest of global risks for third consecutive year (WEF, 2019a ). The Anthropocene trajectory has placed strong pressure on earth systems, due to the supremacy of economic growth at the expense of environmental and social degradation (Kopnina, 2020 ; Steffen et al., 2015 ), causing supply problems, along with economic and ecological damage (Kopnina, 2020 ; Osten et al., 2017 ). A conspicuous stagnation of sustainable development is revealed, a divide between intention and poor adoption, known as the “sustainability gap” (Dyllick and Muff, 2016 ; Seele, 2016a ). Numerous experts argue that the concept of sustainable development (SD) is an oxymoron (Spaiser et al., 2017 ), powerful but idealistic umbrella (Shahadu, 2016 ) made of multiple competing interests, demanding sound management and methodologies. The boundaries of the sustainability conception have been built without systemic perspective (Lozano, 2015 ). Decades of fragmented research and divergent theories have contributed to a feeble status, full of misconstructions. Even when sustainability science has impacted on the research landscape, by shedding light and bridging gaps amid disciplines, it remains in its infancy (Elsevier, 2015 ), as a “niche field” (Messerli et al., 2019 ). Sustainability problems endure unanswered (Köhler et al., 2019 ), being considered wicked (Capasso et al., 2019 ) and deserving new approaches, particularly in the social sphere (Kirschke and Newig, 2017 ). Significant efforts have been devoted to define sustainability, supported by vast literature. However, the concept is controversial (Köhler et al., 2019 ) and it has been so often misused, that the actual meaning is weakened. Even when it could allow different views, current lack of consensus undermines its realization (Waas et al., 2011 ). Attaining sustainability will require interactive efforts among disciplines, which have not yet embraced, since research remains silo-based (Bergman et al., 2018 ). Thus, an integrated and consistent approach is urgently needed (McMichael et al., 2003 ). A glimpse of history Foremost concepts of sustainability and SD were formed in the beginning of the XXth  century onwards (De Oliveira Neto, 2018 ), even though early notions are much older (Waas et al., 2011 ). SD concept became popular and gained momentum with the publication of the mythic “Brundtland report” (WCED, 1987 ), but even nowadays it remains poorly understood (Mensah, 2019 ; Shi et al., 2019 ), challenging policy-makers and scientists (Ramcilovic-Suominen and Pülzl, 2018 ). From then on, sustainability has inspired intense and controversial debates, evolving together with a sound body of theories and myriads of definitions. Two relevant milestones were put forth by Freeman (1984) , author of the “theory of the stakeholders” and (Elkington, 1997 ) who proposed the renowned “triple bottom-line”. Another iconic milestone was the “Earth Charter” (2000), a transformative framework towards a sustainable, just and peaceful society. Rockström et al. (2009)  coined the “planetary boundaries” frame, where sustainability is conceived as the ability to stay within 9 ecological carrying-capacity thresholds. During the 1980s ecological sustainability was the main focus (Osburg, 2017 ). This narrow emphasis on ecology caused counterproductive conflicts with the dominant social and economic realms, jeopardizing sustainability as a whole (Bergman et al., 2018 ). In the 1990s, the perspective evolved, pursuing reconciliation amid environmental, economic and social dimensions based on the ‘triple bottom line’, coined by Elkington (1997) . Currently, the climate crisis outranked the rest of ecological concerns. Recently, new dimensions have been added, namely the cultural aspects and a 4th pillar on good governance (Shi et al., 2019 ). Daly et al. (1995)  put forth a novel classification: weak, intermediate, and strong sustainability based on different types of capital. In weak sustainability, economic, natural, and social capitals are substitutes. In intermediate sustainability, natural capital could be partially substituted. Strong sustainability is featured by an economic vision able to preserve natural and social capital (De Oliveira Neto, 2018 ). Neumayer (2010)  enhanced this definition based on indicators such as: “genuine savings, sustainable economic welfare indexes, ecological footprints”. Shi argues that strong sustainability should be the prefer concept. However, it remains unaddressed in the literature, lacking specific actions (Osburg, 2017 ). Chang et al. (2017)  remarks the relevance of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) while Hazen et al. (2016)  examines theories such as the social capital, the institutions, agency and actor-network. Lastly, the UN 2030 Agenda adopted in 2015 (the Agenda hereafter ), constitutes the most ambitious, goal-based and universal blueprint for sustainability ever in the history of humanity.  Evolution of the sustainability concept Defining sustainability is highly complex, due to its holistic character, normative dimension, scale dependence and multiple facets. Hence, a universally concept remains “elusive” and controversial (Bergman et al., 2018 ; Köhler et al., 2019 ; Waas et al., 2011 ; White, 2013 ). Sustainability entails both means and ends, it is a process and a destination, a sort of philosophy with diverse communities (Johnston et al., 2007 ) stemming from multiple fields (Zamora-Polo and Sánchez-Martín, 2019 ). Boundaries are not clear, going beyond theory and predisposed to interpretation (Köhler et al., 2019 ). Therefore, it cannot be fully empirically proven without context-based interpretation (Waas et al., 2011 ). Caradonna and Ingram (2015) , Glavic and Lukman (2007) , Pater and Cristea (2016)  and Waas et al. (2011) , provide reviews about the evolution of the concept and terminology, which has been classified into functional definitions associated to “sustainable development” and systemic approaches (Pater and Cristea, 2016 ). Köhler et al. (2019)  take stock of research trends and future avenues in the field of sustainability transitions. Despite lacking a universally-agreed definition, most scholars concur on fundamental principles in which sustainability is founded, namely: normativity, equity, integration and dynamism (Waas et al., 2011 ). Sustainability brings a notion of durability and futurity, harmonic co-existence of nature and humanity, preservation, equality and fairness, respect and protection of what is value, equitable and efficient resource allocation and environmentalism (Basiago, 1995 ; Costanza and Patten, 1995 ). Resilience (Roostaie et al., 2019 ) and trust (Osburg, 2017 ; Wenzel, 2017 ) are also highlighted in recent studies together with de-growth (Caradonna and Ingram, 2015 ) and circularity (Antikainen and Bocken, 2019 ; Schroeder et al., 2019 ; Weissbrod and Bocken, 2017 ). The most agreed concept relies on the balanced articulation of three pillars: social, environmental and economic. Munasinghe (2004)  suggested that sustainability can be regarded as the process to improve human progress while maintaining the resilience of the economic, social and environmental systems. Environmental sustainability is linked to the ecosystems capacity to preserve their purposes in the long term. Economic Sustainability is perceived as a “normative concept” related to the capacity of efficiently and responsibly optimizing the use of available resources to maximize profitability over time (Osburg, 2017 ). Social Sustainability entails society’s willingness to endure community well-being, equity and intergenerational justice, interrelated with trust and ethical behavior (Osburg, 2017 ). Boyer et al. (2016)  underscores that the social domain remains overlooked and suggest applying a context-based systemic approach to sort out wicked problems associated with sustainability. Osten et al. (2017)  states that even in common-pool resource systems characterized by social dilemmas and conflicting interests, sustainability is possible. Wenzel (2017)  set forth the “System Capacity Horizon (SCH)” meaning that sustainability is an evolving concept, a role model for success spiral, defining a “target function of life” constrained by system boundaries (ecological, social or financial). Emerging schools of thought claim for an urgent major transformation to overcome inertia, de-growth progress (Caradonna and Ingram, 2015 ) and shift towards a “conscious capitalism” (Mackey and Sisodia, 2013 ). Martinuzzi and Schönherr (2019)  analyse corporate sustainability from the early philanthropic focus to the future data-driven, systemic, goal and impact-based frameworks embedded within the organisations purpose. Indeed, sustainability should be regarded from a holistic, systemic, inter-disciplinary and forward-looking perspective (Ben-Eli, 2018 ) keeping a balance between development and preservation of nature and communities (Kates, 2005 ). Scholz et al. (2018)  conceives a systemic perspective based on: “transdisciplinary inquiry, systemic limits, inter-intragenerational justice”. Conventional theories and fragmented constructs are not sufficient to trigger the desirable changes towards reconciling progress, people and planet. Novel holistic models are required to embed added-value sustainability in the very heart and purpose of every organisation (Bocken et al., 2014 ; Patala et al., 2016 ) and human being.   3.2 The background of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) In 2015, two historical global agreements came into life, bringing unprecedented consensus, for making true a sustainable inclusive development within the planetary and social justice boundaries: the COP21 Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015 ) together with the adoption of the resolution “Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”  (UN, 2015a ). Both represent a strategic compass and outstanding opportunity, not exempt of challenges, for building up an inclusive and sustainable future by the 2030 horizon. The 2030 Agenda is made of 17 goals and 169 targets supported over 5 pillars (planet, people, peace, prosperity, partnerships (see Fig. 3  ). It represents a promising blueprint for curbing excruciatingly “anthropogenic effects on the planet” (Osburg and Lohrmann, 2017 ), pursuing global governance and transnational policy coherence (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Kanie and Biermann, 2017 ). Building on the Millennium Development Goals (Sachs, 2012 ) and result of a broad participatory process (Saito et al., 2017 ), the Agenda aspires to be action-oriented, indivisible, multidisciplinary, inclusive and universally applicable, by integrating the three pillars of sustainability: economic, social and environmental (Biermann et al., 2017 ; Cheong, 2017 ; EU, 2019a ; Kanie and Biermann, 2017 ; Osburg and Lohrmann, 2017 ). It fosters goal-based and non-binding governance, relying on a flexible compliance nature (Biermann et al., 2017 ), which will require unique global cooperation (Dalby et al., 2019 ). The SDGs are carriers conveying interventions and policy constructions, advocating for priorities and values, and mobilizing action towards them (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ; Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). The Agenda aims at comprising relevant trends, such as the fourth industrial revolution, the impulse for a circular economy and responsible use of resources, the equality and gender dimension or the need for enhancing trust. It offers a novel perspective to transform global needs into solutions to societal challenges (WBCSD, 2019a ), evolving towards a strong sustainability that preserves natural and social capitals within the planetary boundaries (Holden et al., 2014 ). The SDGs, theoretically, represent a new future for net-value impact-oriented sustainability in the purpose of any organisation (Martinuzzi and Schönherr, 2019 ). All in all, the Agenda is an exceptional and ambitious attempt to reconcile progress and sustainability by building a “sustainable world leaving no one behind” . Facing such an enormous challenge will require cross-scale collaboration from all stakeholders and countries (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Florini and Pauli, 2018 ; Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ), as well as policy integration and coherence (Saito et al., 2017 ; Valencia et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, almost five years after its adoption, numerous critical voices are rising against the current scheme, underscoring multiple limitations and drawbacks, which justify further dialogue to improve this blueprint for humanity. The SDGs will not be attained unless urgent measures are taken and sustainable transitions are triggered (Walsh et al., 2020 ). A disruptive transformation of the global economic and social systems is needed to achieve both the Agenda and the COP-21 agreement (Horan, 2019 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; UN, 2019d ). We explore as follows, the relevance of articulating the Agenda as a systemic network of goals.  3.3 The SDGs as a systemic network of goals Goals and targets within the Agenda are closely intertwined and can be perceived as a highly interconnected and systemic network, as acknowledged in the literature (Barbier and Burgues, 2017 ; Cutter, 2015 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Griggs et al., 2017 ; Griggs et al., 2014 ; Hall et al., 2018 ; Le Blanc et al., 2017 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Liu et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2015 ; Mensah, 2019 ; Miola et al., 2019 ; Niestroy, 2016 ; Nilsson et al., 2018 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Schmidt et al., 2017 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ; UN, 2018b ; Weitz et al., 2019 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ; Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ). However, synergies and trade-offs among goals are poorly understood and hardly reflected in policy, calling for further research, towards delivering a systemic-approach. Research on interactions is a fast-growing domain, which can be undertaken by applying a sectorial approach (i.e. Griggs et al., 2017 ) or an extensive one, as a tool for prioritizing actions (i.e. Weitz et al., 2018 ). Manifold strategies exist, although five main methodologies can be highlighted: linguistic, literature, expert judgement, quantitative and modelling approaches (Miola et al., 2019 ). Saito et al. (2017)  provides an overview of studies focused on SDGs interlinkages. Stafford-Smith et al. (2017)  research interactions for multi-sectorial and transnational implementation. Yonehara et al. (2017)  and Allen et al. (2019a)  underscore the key role of evaluation. Nilsson et al. (2018)  compile insights from a conceptual framework for mapping interactions using a defined typology and characterization approach. The creation of sound models to understand the interactions is tackled by several experts (Collste et al., 2017 ; Khalili et al., 2017 ; Shahrier et al., 2017 ) while others devote their research to links among specific Goals (Coopman et al., 2016 ; Fuso-Nerini et al., 2018 ; Saraswat et al., 2017 ; Schmidt et al., 2017 ; Singh et al., 2018 ; Velis et al., 2017 ). Allen et al. (2019b)  argues that uncertainties exist regarding trade-offs. Pradhan et al. (2017)  examines synergies and trade-offs between pairs of SDGs in 227 countries, classifying the goals according to interlinks, concluding that the SDG12 is the Goal presenting more negative interactions, with 10 goals (SDG 1–7, SDG 9–10, SDG17), which could hamper sustainable consumption and production. Environmental-focused goals often conflict with those related to human or economic development, particularly in developed countries with intense footprints. Indeed, Scherer et al. (2018)  analyse the interaction between SDG1 (poverty), SDG10 (inequality) and environmental goals (SDG13, SDG15, SDG6) regarding consumption across 166 countries, concluding that promoting social goals usually leads to increase environmental impacts. Barbier and Burges (2019)  study trade-offs between net-gains reached on the SDG1 and the rest of goals, evidencing progress at the expense of environmental-based goals (SDG11-15). Pothen and Welsch (2019)  argue that advances in economic growth cause an increase of material footprint, causing environmental stress. Nevertheless, highly developed countries are able to decoupling growth from material consumption. Hence, quantitative interactions should be well understood to inform prioritization policies. Griggs et al. (2017)  identify positive synergies among several goals (SDG2, 3, 7, 14), by applying expert knowledge. Mainali et al. (2018)  apply network analysis and the Advanced Sustainability Analysis (ASA) framework in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, proving synergies and trade-offs amid the SDG1, 2, 6, 7. Fuso-Nerini et al. (2018)  and Fader et al. (2018)  study the water-energy-food nexus. Von Stechow et al. (2016)  analyse trade-offs between Climate Action (SDG13) and the rest of SDGs, underscoring that curbing energy demand is crucial across the goals. McCollum et al. (2018)  underline remaining knowledge gaps regarding the interlinkages of the energy-based goal (SDG7) with other goals and across contexts, uncovering dependencies (relating to time, geography, governance, technology, and directionality). Hall et al. (2018)  claim that partnerships (SDG17) and climate action (SDG13) are enablers for other goals. The integrated management of water resources (SDG6) is crucial to reach the rest of targets, while the health-goal (SDG3) is influenced by the rest of goals. Thus cross-fertilization and collaboration among disciplines is needed. Obersteiner et al. (2016)  devote research to the land-food nexus and related trade-offs among environmental conservation initiatives and food prices. Sustainable Consumption and Production policies could mitigate trade-offs and should be central in formulating SDGs strategies with systemic approach. Kroll et al. (2019)  analyse the evolution of synergies and trade-offs amid goals, underscoring the role of innovation to create a “virtuous cycle of progress”. They conclude that positive synergies are found for the SDGs 1, 3, 7, 8 and 9, while pervasive trade-offs remain for SDGs 11, 13, 14, 16, 17. Mantlana  and Maoela  (2019) address the interlinkages of the SDG9 with social inclusion (SDG2, 11) and environmental issues (SDG 6, 13, 15), concluding that there exist both relevant synergies and trade-offs, between the SDG 6, 13, 15, which should be acknowledged by policy. Dolley et al. (2020)  denounce ignored trade-offs related to food security and poverty within peri-urban dynamics, as a result of non-representative aggregate data and top-down approaches. Scharlemann et al. (2020)  argue that current assessment do not focus on environmental-human interactions which actually influence most SDGs and should be considered. McCollum et al. (2018) , Sachs et al. (2019a)  and Schmidt-Traub et al. (2019)  criticize that spillovers across countries are pervasive and remain ignore. Dawes (2019)  argue that the SDG network is not self-consistent, therefore indirect trade-offs could hinder the realization of some Goals, while targeted allocated network effects, even when unevenly distributed, could be leveraged to achieve them. Thus, the literature reveals severe gaps in terms of methodology, confirming a fragmented scenario, where different authors reach diverse, sometimes contradictory outcomes, depending on the focus and context of study, therefore, further understanding and better tools are required. Experts claim for a “whole-of-government” approach to fully reflect the interlinkages avoiding negative transboundary effects (Miola et al., 2019 ; UN, 2018b ). A science-based qualitative nexus approach of both direct and indirect relations is suggested by Karnib (2017a)  although quantitative approaches on top of bottom-up views are also relevant (Karnib, 2017b ). Fusing quantitative and qualitative approaches is essential to better understand the links, and subsequently, to harness synergies while minimizing trade-offs (Obersteiner et al., 2016 ) and spill-overs, strengthening cross-sector and transnational cooperation (Breuer et al., 2019 ; Miola et al., 2019 ; Schneider at al., 2019 ; Weitz et al., 2019 ). Indeed, incentivizing cross-cutting relations across sectors and goals plays a crucial role in the Agenda operationalisation (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). Van Soest et al. (2019)  propose combining methods such as expert surveys, integrated assessment models from different disciplines and text mining, to enhance the results while overcoming underrepresented social and human issues and reinforcing a suitable representation of geographies and sectors. Requejo-Castro et al. (2020)  explore the interlinkages related to the SDG6 by means of Bayesian Networks, using data from 179 countries, proving the robustness of this analytical approach and the relevance of integrating a multi-sectorial approach. Therefore, new measurement methodologies (Sachs et al., 2019a ) and research approaches leveraging novel technologies, would enhance our understanding of interlinkages, making possible to translate them into better and coherent policies for SD (Breuer et al., 2019 ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ). Notwithstanding, complexities and uncertainties need to be tackled, concerning the different scales of implementation and context-specific actions (Allen et al., 2018 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Griggs et al., 2013 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ) demanding further research and policy efforts (Barbier and Burges, 2019 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ; Zimm et al., 2018 ), as for integration (Miola et al., 2019 ).  3.4 Design shortcomings of the SDGs The Agenda results of a complex policy process instead of a science-based dialogue, leading to a diluted ambition when setting the final targets (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). Thus, the rational seems weak and the language remains complex and multi-layer (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ). Moreover, related provisions are feeble (Biermann et al., 2017 ), containing caveats and inconsistencies (Spaiser et al., 2017 ; Swain, 2018 ), which erode its credibility and jeopardize its achievement (Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Saito et al., 2017 ). Even when, experts agree in the pertinence of the 17 SDGs at macro level, when downscaling to the target level, shortcomings are revealed. Only 29% of the targets are well-developed (ICSU, 2015 ), most are narrow, not representative and difficult to measure hindering progress or demanding additional regulatory efforts. Moreover, a clear implementation approach is missing (Horton, 2015 ). Despite the pretended holistic ambition, goals and targets are not well-connected, remaining inspired by a silo-based philosophy (Bergman et al., 2018 ) dominated by the economic dimension (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ; Pogge and Sengupta, 2015 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ), and weakening the realization of the Goals. The new compass for sustainability is neither critical with the status-quo nor transformative enough (Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). It should be ethically rooted, ambitious and disruptive and not just rewording old-fashioned models of progress (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Moore, 2015 ). Social, human and environmental values are insufficiently considered, since economic growth overweighs the discourse. Inclusivity is quite feeble (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; Ulbrich et al., 2019 ; Weber, 2017 ), favoring commercial and political interests and omitting relevant issues such as political freedom or democracy (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ). Foundations for balancing inter-generational, intra-generational equity or social justice are also lacking (Spijkers, 2018 ; Terama et al., 2019 ; Vasconcellos Oliveira, 2018 ). Current Agenda scheme overlooks the ecological and relational dimensions of inclusiveness (Gupta and Vegelin, 2016 ). Furthermore, it has been criticized for being reductionist (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ), failing to disrupt harmful structures (Hawkes and Buse, 2019 ) along with for numerous contradictions (Dalby et al., 2019 ), since it supports conflicting elements leading to a difficult implementation with uncertain impacts (Crespo-Cuaresma et al., 2018 ; Vasconcellos Oliveira, 2018 ). A narrative of change is missing (Costanza et al., 2016 ; Ostrom, 2014 ). Priorities of all the stakeholders are not reflected, showing a low balance between local and global scales. Roles and responsibilities are diffused without obligations (Spangenberg, 2017 ). Some authors argue that it seems more a wish list rather than a consistent set of smart goals (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018 ; Pogge and Sengupta, 2015 ). Indeed, the Agenda seems disconnected of recognized methodologies and trends on the sustainability sphere (Lempert, 2017 ). A critical view is needed to impede conventional narratives which exacerbate inequalities (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ). Saner et al. (2019)  suggest revisiting the Agenda for making the most of prior advances and existing international agreements and including overlooked issues. Spijkers (2016)  claims for a more prominent impulse to sustainability, allowing cross-fertilization among disciplines and alignment with international frames. Stevens and Kanie (2016)  plea for transforming the idea of development towards systemic approaches. Given their relevance for pursing a truly sustainable and inclusive future, as follows we summarize the controversies regarding the imbalances behind the Agenda.  3.5 Imbalances amid dimensions and underrepresented issues As aforementioned, even when the Agenda aims at being universal and integrative, numerous scholars denounce that the economic development remains the main cornerstone, attesting imbalances and notable financial inertia (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ; Lempert, 2017 ; Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; Swain, 2018 ; Weber, 2017 ). Besides, commonly accepted international agreements on the mentioned domains are feebly considered (Saner et al., 2019 ) and relevant elements are omitted (Dalby et al., 2019 ). Risks are not appropriately reflected, neither are resilience and accountability (REDS-SDSN, 2017 ). Environmental and social aspects are poorly covered (Allen et al., 2016 ), proving strong limitations in terms of inequality, ecosystems, poverty, consumption and production and governance. An absence of ecology and human rights (Pogge and Sengupta, 2015 ), as well as, insufficient representation of cultural values are clearly evidenced. Despite its relevance, migration appears as a missing goal (Dalby et al., 2019 ). The health goal does not cover transboundary problems such as global pandemics or climate impacts on well-being (Dalby et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, the education-related goal is ambiguous (Kopnina, 2020 ; Walid and Luetz, 2018 ) and related indicators could hinder advancement (Dalby et al., 2019 ). Certainly, it is generally agreed that the environment is the weakest dimension, whereas economic-focused goals (i.e. SDG8 and SDG9) are oversized at the expenses of the ecological-based (i.e. SDG12, SDG14, SDG15, SDG6), which indeed are the lagging ones. Particularly, the SDG12 presents a narrow scope, predominantly focused on efficiency and poor ambition, being unable to reflect the relevance of sustainable consumption and production (Gasper et al., 2019 ) and neglecting guidance on transformation (Bengtsson et al., 2018 ). Indeed, environmental targets were diluted during the Agenda negotiation, discarding truly transformative goals or strong implementation means (Elder and Olsen, 2019 ), then resulting feeble and inconsistent (Spaiser et al., 2017 ). The role of ecosystem services should be better embedded (Macellari et al., 2018 ; Spijkers, 2016 ), together with the integration of natural capital as a foundation of the development cycle (Lempert, 2017 ; Martinez-Harms et al., 2018 ; Vasseur et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, the contribution of soil science is not well considered (Bouma et al., 2019 ) and the water-energy-food-climate nexus is absent. Giannetti et al. (2020)  compare the SDGs with the model of capitals and the “five sectors sustainability model” (5SenSu) attesting an unbalance distribution, where the environmental capital is reduced, thus claiming for a good balance. Lobos-Alva and Hoff (2017)  advise to integrate the planetary boundaries, coined by Rockström et al (2009) , within national strategies, identifying vulnerable and highly productive contexts for supporting transformation, conceived from a systemic vision (Bengtsson et al., 2018 ). Definitely, uncertainties exist about the true potential of the Agenda to tackle sustainability challenges (Leal-Filho et al., 2019a ) in comparison with previous tools such as the “Earth Chapter” (Earth Chapter, 2000 ), considered more advanced, balanced and integrated. An imbalanced and economic-driven Agenda would not be able to reduce inequality (Pogge and Sengupta, 2015 ). On the contrary, it could aggravate current unsustainability landscape (Kopnina, 2016 ). Besides, many SDGs deserve better and further attention (Salvia et al., 2019 ). The imbalance is strongly derived of the lack of integration, since economic and social progress could hinder environmental goals (Scherer et al., 2018 ). Ethical approaches considering all relevant dimensions are needed for moving beyond the status-quo (Kopnina, 2016 ). Therefore, interactions should be understood and acknowledged and all dimensions should be better balanced (Bergman et al., 2018 ) and seamless integrated (Cutter, 2015 ) reflecting the vision of strong sustainability. The following section discusses the huge challenges which have to be tackled for wisely implementing and govern such an ambitious, multifaceted and integrative agenda.   4 Implementation and governance of The Sustainable Development Goals within the Un 2030 agenda 4.1 An overview of the glaring implementation challenges Implementing the SDGs poses serious defies, regarding planning, monitoring, assessment and financing (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ) together with related policy challenges (Kanie and Biermann, 2017 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). The Goals are born universal, but need to be translated locally, into national plans, which depend on variable priorities across geographies (Allen et al., 2016 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2018 ). Translating the SDGs into local contexts requires clear, long-term vision supported by policy targets (Galli et al., 2018 ) along with investments. Indeed, present allocated level of investment is not sufficient to address the Agenda, revealing a financing gap (Lagoarde-Segot, 2020 ) and the urgency to mobilize further resources (Barua, 2019 ). Therefore, such implementation remains a burdensome task, full of complex challenges (Caiado et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, it also represents an opportunity to navigate SD challenges (Leal-Filho et al., 2019a ), and align local and global needs supported by with science-based systemic frameworks (Stafford-Smith et al., 2018 ). Enhancing the means of implementation and governance to overcome hurdles and accelerate progress is subject of intense research and debate (Bartram et al., 2018 ; EU, 2019b ; Griggs et al., 2017 ; Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ; Yingchun et al., 2018 ). Science and policy can significantly contribute by acknowledging interconnections, evidence-based procedures and well-designed indicators, (Schmalzbauer and Visbeck, 2016 ). Success in achieving the Agenda will rely on the level of local commitment and enactment, integration of all SD dimensions and alignment with extant initiatives (Biermann et al., 2017 ). Localization  emerges as a relevant issue in the literature. Jones and Comfort (2019)  discuss localization challenges in the UK, concluding that lack of consistent policies, limited awareness, and funding gaps persists. Engström et al. (2019)  study cross-scale water, land, climate and energy interactions in Sweden. Terama et al. (2019)  explore the relation between urban sustainability and the SDGs with a Nordic perspective, claiming that is disconnected from local practice, demanding better integration and multidisciplinary approaches. Allen et al. (2019a)  explore nesting national models in Australia and claim for coherent policies and investments while acknowledging potential risks. Fukuda-Parr and Muchhala (2020)  analyse the role of developing countries, particularly the “agency of the South”, in shaping global norms. Schmieg et al. (2018)  argue that individual ethical norms at the micro-level could decelerate unsustainability at meso-level, while norms at the macro-level, such as the SGDs, may accelerate innovations. Kabisch et al. (2019)  underline the relevance of local contexts to achieve urban transformations. Schmidt-Traub et al. (2019)  suggest involving civil organisations and cities as key players towards localization the SDGs while enhancing integration into regulatory frameworks. Almost five years from the SDGs adoption, numerous Voluntary National Reviews are available (UN, 2019h ). However, most countries have not yet reported status (Allen et al., 2019a ) and VNRs have been dedicated to readiness and progress, rather than comparatives between policies or contexts, which remain underreported (Elder and Bartalini, 2019 ). Quantitative assessment of SDGs performance across counties is required (Allen et al., 2016 ; Engström et al., 2019 ; Huan et al., 2019 ; Lafortune and Schmidt-Traub, 2019 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ). Dickens et al. (2019)  plea for benchmarks and national indicators to avoid reducing significance. Complexities regarding different scales should be soundly considered by reconciling all specificities from the global to the local domains. Relevant methodological hurdles and data gaps and lags remain (Dang and Serajuddin, 2020 ; Guo, 2020 ; Jacob, 2017 ), hampering the effectiveness assessment. Hence, further research is desirable concerning measurement efforts (Elder and Bartalini, 2019 ). Integration in governance  based on science-based foundations, policy coherence, together with science-policy interfaces is another a central issue for the Agenda (EU, 2019b ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018 ; Miola et al., 2019 ; OECD, 2019a ; OECD, 2019c ; Tosun and Leininger, 2017 ; UN, 2018b ; Valencia et al., 2019 ). Indeed, target 17.14 is specifically focused on policy coherence. However, current governance fragmentation could hinder the SDGs achievement (Monkelbaan, 2019 ). As widely acknowledged, the Agenda needs to move beyond monitoring and focusing on achieving a better balance among dimensions, leading to a systemic, holistic system-approach (Bartram et al., 2018 ; Coopman et al., 2016 ; Cutter, 2015 ; Liu et al., 2015 ; Miola et al., 2019 ; Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Allen et al. (2018)  review the SDGs implementation in 26 countries, concluding that, despite progress, critical gaps prevail regarding interactions, showing prevalence of silo-based approaches, counterproductive for unleashing the transformative power of the Agenda. Dalby et al. (2019) , Stevens and Kanie (2016)  and Obersteiner et al. (2016)  argue that the Agenda requires an unprecedented integration effort to shift beyond siloes. Bartram et al. (2018)  critique the means of implementation of the SDG6 (water) providing policy recommendations to enhance this goal. Van der Hel and Biermann (2017)  compare six international science-based initiatives, related to SDGs governance, analyzing how they achieve the necessary “salience, credibility and legitimacy” to be soundly integrated within policy. Tosun and Leininger (2017)  argue that domestic policies strongly influence the implementation strategies, leading to divergent interpretations of interlinkages and integration. Indeed, “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” visions are needed to foster ownership and trigger governance transformations (OECD, 2019b ; UN, 2018b ). The SDGs should integrate both social and ecological well-being at all levels, but current integration and vertical diffusion remain poorly developed (Kanie et al., 2014 ). Indeed, Integration should consider three dimensions: horizontal, vertical, and engagement of stakeholders (UN, 2018b ; Valencia et al., 2019 ), including governance frameworks across geographies and scales to better deal with transboundary issues (Amos and Lydgate, 2019 ; OECD, 2019c ; Schmidt et al., 2017 ). The Agenda is indivisible, therefore unsuitable prioritization practices (i.e. “cherry picking”) could danger the holistic vision (Allen et al., 2018 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ). Manifest overlaps and uneven support are evidenced, together with poor coordination or accountability (ECOSOC, 2017 ). Certainly, accountability is feeble considered (Zimm et al., 2018 ), since proper tools are lacking and the Agenda mainly refers to monitoring instead. Bowen et al. (2017)  identify three governance challenges: raising collective action, equitably manage trade-offs, and providing mechanisms to secure accountability. Grainger-Brown and Malekpour (2019)  conclude that existing implementation methods lack transformative power and strategic acumen. Monkelbaan (2019)  suggest an “Integrative Sustainability Governance framework” standing upon power, knowledge and norms pillars and considering resilience, systemic discussions and behavior issues. Sullivan et al. (2018) , Caiado et al. (2018)  claim for innovative tools and analytical frameworks to overcome challenges. Kanie et al. (2019)  plea for action coherence and compliance, spurring transformative shifts both on science and policy sides while adapting extant instruments and policies. Reynolds et al. (2018)  explore the role of system-thinking towards pursuing the SDG17 (means of implementation), concluding that capacity building and action-learning platforms are required. Knowledge gaps persist, particularly amid social and ecological systems at local level, limiting the effectiveness of governance (Mastrángelo et al., 2019 ). Indeed, knowledge management is a relevant, yet overlooked, element which could support implementation (Barrantes-Briceño and Almada-Santos, 2019 ), enhancing policy and practice. Certainly, the literature reflects the need of a paradigm shift based on multi-level governance  and full stakeholders’ engagement (Dalby et al., 2019 ; EU, 2019b ; Martens, 2019 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ; UN, 2019d ). Caiado et al. (2018) , Giannetti et al. (2018)  and Horan (2019)  underscore the potential offered by partnerships and the need to reinforcing bottom-up approaches. However, this transformation is not straightforward, since multiple uncertainties remain regarding human-environment complexities, unknown cause-effect relations, conflicting views from different stakeholders and context-based specificities (Messerli et al., 2019 ). Thus, agents of change, actionable strategies and enhanced gears are needed to achieve the Goals (OECD, 2019c ; UN, 2019d ). Sachs et al. (2019b)  and the “The World in 2050 Initiative “(IIASA, 2019 ) concur that six shifts are required to spur progress, by tackling education and inequalities, health and well-being, low-carbon sustainable energy and industry, sustainable land use and food systems, smart cities and harnessing the digital revolution. Chapman and Shigetomi (2018)  recognize the relevance of the lifestyle factor. Fostering public involvement is crucial (EU, 2019b ; Li et al., 2018 ), but policy reforms are not sufficient, production and consumption patterns and power structures should be also transformed prioritizing human rights and planetary boundaries (Bengtsson et al., 2018 ; Martens, 2018 ). A narrative of change and disruptive transformation of the idea of development is unavoidable (Bengtsson et al., 2018 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; UN, 2019d ) by decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation shifting to circular economies (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). Policy and financial enabling frameworks are key critical leverage points (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Lagoarde-Segot, 2020 ; UN, 2019g ) yet poorly developed. Geopolitical stability and good governance have to be enhanced (IMF, 2019 ), together with incentives, investment label (UN, 2019d ), fostering international cooperation (UN, 2019g ) and promoting and debt and tax reforms (ECOSOC, 2019b ). In conclusion, multiple limitations exist to overcoming implementation challenges by achieving a truly whole-of-government integrative and context-savvy approach, able to engage all the stakeholders, avoiding counterproductive prioritization. Better coordination and accountability mechanisms guided by analytical frameworks, science-based approaches, sound policy enablers and a shift towards sustainable patterns are open issues yet to be decoded.  4.2 Following-up progress and assessing impact The SDGs realization strongly depends on monitoring and evaluation (Lu et al., 2015 ; OECD, 2019b ; UN, 2018b ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ), which indeed, relies on ensuring robust accountability (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Wackernagel et al., 2017 ). Measuring progress is an imperative for the implementation (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Persson et al., 2016 ; Reyers et al., 2017 ; Yonehara et al., 2017 ). However, current data vacuum, non-consistent indicators, limitations regarding data processing, interoperability and interpretation, together with absence of sound methodologies and coordinated efforts to compare progress across geographies (Crespo-Cuaresma et al., 2018 ) are hindering follow-up (Lior et al., 2018 ; Lu et al., 2015 ). Extant analytical and modeling tools are not able to cover the 169 targets, evidencing knowledge gaps and the need to reduce complexity and enhance accountability (Zimm et al., 2018 ). A taxonomy and systematic approaches for quantifying progress are absent (Xu et al., 2020 ). Besides, present emphasis on using institutional indicators is jeopardizing the understanding of effectiveness and overlooking interactions (Benson et al., 2019 ). Defining the measurement purpose in line with materiality assessment, together with proper integration within governance, are essential factors (Schönherr et al., 2019 ). First preliminary attempts to assess the SDGs framework have been undertaken, although the Agenda remains a voluntary effort, lacking mandatory reporting mechanisms. Monitoring efforts to date are mainly devoted to single indicators (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ). An additional difficulty comes from the complex nature and interpretation of the SDGs, requiring further refinement and clarification of their underlying objectives (Dang and Serajuddin, 2020 ). Therefore, monitoring and evaluation should go beyond indicators and outcomes, by considering contextual issues (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Renn et al., 2020 ). Thus, ensuring that progress is relevant, equitable and truly sustainable (Schwandt et al., 2016 ). Indicators are not able to explain failures, wicked issues or complex dynamics, evidencing that a system-approach is needed (Renn et al., 2020 ). Localization is critical to overcome mismatches between theory-driven indicators and local conditions. The compatibility between accountability regimes and integrated policy approaches is controversial. Therefore, accountability should be reflected by using a context-based approach and shared governance among all actors, avoiding strong regimes (Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018 ). The definition of essential variables with systemic perspective is crucial, enabling both sustainable transformation and interaction at policy level (Reyers et al., 2017 ). Tracking the spatio-temporal dynamics of progress at global and local level seems an imperative (Xu et al., 2020 ). Even though, concepts such as sustainable value creation (Arnold, 2018 ; Dressler and Bucher, 2018 ), inclusivity or resilience, are especially difficult to assess (Bamberger et al., 2016 ; Yonehara et al., 2017 ). An inclusive approach is crucial to improve measurement, along with a proper narrative and understanding of priorities (Bidarbakhtnia, 2020 ). Multi-sectoral action and prevention-driven policies are required (Lozano et al., 2018 ). In summary, suitable context-based and systemic methodologies, accountability compatible with policy integration, data availability and granularity, along with and capacity building are critical elements to consider for evaluating progress, thus far untapped, requiring further efforts.  4.3 The role of performing indicators and data availability The SDGs indicators were adopted by 2017, after a tough process lead by the UN Statistics Division, wanting a scientific debate and influenced by politics struggles and competing interest (Kapto, 2019 ), hence resulting in relevant shortcomings (Brussel et al., 2019 ). Indeed, indicators are still being reviewed. As of March 2020, the classification contains 116 Tier-I indicators (those with well-built methodology and available data), 92 Tier-II indicators (lacking data coverage), 20 Tier-III (featured by both limited data and methodologies) and 4 with multiple-tiers (UN Statistics Division, 2020 ). Thus, a large number of SDG indicators lack data and agreed methodology, and some metrics could be contradictory (Bissio, 2019 ; Dawes, 2019 ; Hickel, 2019 ). Nevertheless, measuring SD is highly complex due to the underlying limitations of interpretation, multidimensional nature and tensions among dimensions, particularly regarding public goods. Monitoring requires a broad analysis of the goals essence. Therefore, indicators should be selected based on their ability to reflect the respective SDG value and not only on data availability. Further effort in enhancing Tier II and III indicators is highly necessary (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). A relevant body of literature on SDGs indicators can be found, concluding that extant metrics suffer relevant limitations (Annan-Diab and Molinari, 2017 ; Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ; Dlouhá and Pospíšilová, 2018 ; Galli et al., 2018 ; Hák et al., 2016 ; Lehtonen et al., 2016 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Storey et al., 2017 ; UN, 2019c ; World Bank, 2019 ). Current framework has been criticized for being narrow, inflexible and unfeasible; hence undermining the purpose of monitoring what matters instead of doing what can be measured with official statistics (Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ). Indicators can be considered reductionist both based on its conception and use (Ordaz, 2019 ), and assessment based on present metrics could be confusing (Janoušková et al., 2018 ). Mapping indicators could be useful to devise solutions, while avoiding threats (Kraak et al., 2018 ). Measurement challenges are linked to interpretation, demanding a refinement of the goal formulation and subtle purposes, as well as cost-effective solutions to bridge the data vacuum (Dang and Serajuddin, 2020 ). Certainly, relevant data gaps and lags remain (Jacob, 2017 ), as well as underreported transboundary impacts such us migration (UN-SDSN, 2019 ). Thus far, data is available for half of the indicators (Dang and Serajuddin, 2020 ) and only 50 of the 169 SDG targets are ready for progress assessment (Martens, 2018 ). Most uncertainties and challenging measures are linked to the SDG12 (Dalberg, 2017 ) and those goals related to ecosystems and climate (i.e. SDG13, 14, 15), (OECD, 2019c ). Indeed data gaps affect 77% of environmental-related goals (UNEP, 2019 ). Good progress has been made only on 23% of the environment-focused indicators owing to a combination of policy, reporting and funding. The majority suffers negative trends, therefore further data and actions are needed to accelerate progress (UNEP, 2019 ). Lozano et al. (2018)  and Hall et al. (2019)  underscore uncertainties and data limitation concerning the Health-related goal (SDG3), which could yields inaccurate aggregation, estimation and modelling. Trade-offs and spill-overs across boundaries have been ignored by most metrics, therefore they should be considered (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2017 ). Better data collection, analysis and interpretation are looked-for (Lozano et al., 2018 ), not only to measure progress but also to make corrections and projections (UN-SDSN, 2019 ). Regarding the SDG11 on cities, inconsistencies are uncovered in relation to other frameworks, revealing the need of comprehensive approaches to benchmarking and assessing policies (Giles-Corti et al., 2019 ). Ulbrich et al. (2019)  explore how inequalities could affect the representativeness of the SDG indicators, particularly on the goal devoted to cities (SDG11). Dickens et al. (2019)  suggest defining tangible targets at national level, along with indicators and benchmarks to avoid reducing the significance of prescribed global indicators, while allowing comparative evaluation. In absence of representative and integrated measures, persistent bias would remain. Most experts claim for a critical review of current indicators, alongside the formulation of alternative metrics and benchmarks going beyond the “obsolete” GDP indicator (Costanza et al., 2104 ; Hák et al., 2016 ; Mair et al., 2018 ; Merry, 2019 ; Rubio-Mozos et al., 2019 ; Saito et al., 2017 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Suciu and Năsulea, 2019 ). GDP indicators (i.e. SDG8) contradict the principles of sustainability efforts, since strongly clashes with those goals devoted to ecology and equality (Coscieme et al., 2020 ). Current frames underachieve on sustainability, yielding cascade effects on poverty and inequality (Wackernagel et al., 2017 ). Vanham et al. (2019)  analyse environmental footprints overlaps with indicators and explore their potential to assess progress towards the SDGs and the “water-energy-food-ecosystem” nexus. Fioramonti et al. (2019) , Ivanov and Peleah (2018)  and Suciu and Năsulea. (2019)  plea for alternative indicators for wellbeing, to reinforce the sustainability narrative by connecting a new economic paradigm compatible with the goals (i.e. Happy Planet Index, Sustainable Human Development Index). For instance, the “Inclusive Wealth Index” (UNEP, 2018 ) is a simple index, comprising the natural, human and manufactured capital which could complement the GDP, even though it represents a weak sustainability concept. Composited multi-dimensional indexes going beyond national implementation could help to overcome some limitations (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018 ; Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Lozano et al., 2018 ), and offering a holistic approach (Lior et al., 2018 ). Lemke and Bastini (2020)  suggest a “Multilevel Sustainable Development Index (MLSDI)” able to overcome limitations of existing indices, which hardly reflect all the dimensions of sustainability and are unable to compare agents at different levels due to methodological caveats. In the corporate realm, harmonized indicators and methodologies for reporting are critical, avoiding narrow approaches (GRI-UN Global Compact, 2018 ). Nevertheless, novel metrics and composited indexes suffer limitations and should be enhanced, including potential contrasting effects (Bondarchik et al., 2016 ). Hence, crafting novel science-based metrics, together with context-friendly measures, leveraging new data sources, better aggregation and integration, are urgently needed in order to ensure that, despite the challenges, all targets can be measured, all countries can monitor progress and transboundary issues can be considered.  4.4 Adoption and progress as of 2019 Thus far, progress has been evidenced, although is slow-paced and unevenly distributed across contexts and actors (Sachs et al., 2019a ; UN, 2019a ; UN, 2019b ). Hurdles to wide-ranging achievement persist (Bryan et al., 2019 ). The world is off-target, since no country has yet achieved the goals (Dalby et al., 2019 ; OECD, 2019c ) and even top-performing countries face challenges (Sachs et al., 2019a ). The first SDG-Summit held in September 2019 (UN, 2019f ) pleaded for a decade of urgent action. Current policies and frames yield limited progress, therefore deep and urgent transformations are required to accelerate progress (Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ). Political leadership and engagement from all stakeholders are urgently needed to increase funds and spur action to catalyze change (UN, 2019d ). Key cornerstones for tacking stock on progress are, inter-alia: the annual report from United Nations “Progress Report towards the SDGs” providing a perspective of the goals status; the SDG Index and Dashboards (UN-SDSN, 2019 ) which classify countries according to their performance, however, it has been criticized for its limited consistency and low performance on sustainability (Wackernagel et al., 2017 ); the SDG Atlas (World Bank, 2018a ) which debates measuring methods for Tier-3 indicators. Other relevant documents are “Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019” (OECD, 2019c ) concerning the OECD countries and the Eurostat Monitoring Report, describing progress within the EU (EU, 2019a ). According to these reports, social inclusion and environmental-related goals are alarmingly worsening, showing a worrisome biodiversity loss, exacerbation of the climate crisis, unsustainable pollution of oceans, consumption and rising footprints (ADB, 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ; UNEP, 2019 ). Actually, projected extreme poverty and hungry indicators are unbearable and access to health services remains deficient. Inequalities and conflicts are rising and humanitarian crisis are enduring, placing human rights in danger in many contexts, threatening social cohesion and progress (UN HLPF, 2019 ). Climate action is perceived as an urgent priority (Dalby et al., 2019 ), followed by responsible consumption and production (Globescan-Sustainability, 2019 ). Besides, transboundary issues, such as migration, and ignored spill-overs are hindering progress in vital goals (Sachs et al., 2017 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2019 ; UN, 2019b ). Moreover, some megatrends might be threatening the Goals: the unsustainable growth model, weakened multilateralism overlooking transboundary responsibilities, strong structural and financial barriers such as debt crisis, unfair trade, and democracy loss worldwide. Existing reports show different, occasionally contradictory, conclusions depending on the approach used, evidencing a fragmented knowledge regarding progress, extremely context-dependent. Methodologies and tools are unsatisfactory and often inconsistent, lacking an agreed systematized measure of progress (Xu et al., 2020 ). Thus, new approaches tackling the context, offering strategic directions and fostering commitment and collaboration are required (ADB, 2019 ). Sabau (2020)  argues that present lack of progress relies on a narrow understanding about sustainability values and claims to reorient governance towards a “tetravaluation” approach across key actors, based on: “exchange, labor, use and function value”. Moyer and Hedden (2020)  propose an integrated assessment model (International Futures) to evaluate progress toward target nine indicators related to human development. Biermann et al. (2017)  underline the relevance of aligning the SDGs with extant initiatives, integrating all SD dimensions. Lozano et al. (2018)  highlight the need of multi-sectoral common action and prevention-driven policy action. Therefore, poor progress to date results of a number of hurdles which need to be tackled, in terms of institutional coordination and capacity, adoption and ownership, flawed assessment standards, together with unsuitable indicators, methodologies and data gaps. New metrics, specific tools and tailored guidelines for accountability and reporting, by harnessing technology and new data sources, are required to cover the SDGs singularities.  4.5 Roles, responsibilities and collaboration among actors Achieving the SDGs will require close-knit collaboration, cooperation and coordination efforts, as well as shared responsibility from all stakeholders, to move beyond intentions into actions (Frey and Sabbatino, 2018 ; Kurz, 2020 ) (Fig. 4  ). In this regard, ensuring policy coherence, improving legitimacy (Donoher, 2017 ) and active engagement of business, governments and civil society is crucial (Galli et al., 2018 ; Lucas et al., 2016 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ; Schönherr et al., 2017 ; UN, 2019d ). However, the roles within the Agenda have not been properly discussed nor soundly established (Spangenberg, 2017 ). Responsibilities should be defined to mediate with trade-offs and spill-overs, as well as to unravel the potential contribution from all actors. Given the ambition of the SDGs, promoting collaboration and activating narratives of change, are essential factors for overcoming hurdles and inertia, towards accelerating progress (Dalby et al., 2019 ; UN, 2019d ). Business realm The private sector plays a decisive role in the implementation and financing of the Agenda (Cordova and Celone, 2019 ; Frey and Sabbatino, 2018 ; Kolk et al., 2017 ; Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ; Van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). Companies are expected to lead the transformation, by motivating market sustainability, crafting sustainable approaches (CSIL, 2017 ), building purpose-driven culture and inspiring their supply chains (Deloitte, 2017 ; UN Global Compact-Accenture, 2019 ). Mainstreaming the SDGs is not straightforward (Elder and Bartalini, 2019 ), since open issues and lack of understanding about added-value and actionable strategies remain (Betti et al., 2018 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). Unsuitable means of implementation, together with institutional or cultural factors could hinder adoption and progress (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ). Van der Waal and Thijssens (2020)  study the motivations that could guide companies to get actively involved within the Agenda, to create shared value for “common good”, concluding that business involvement is limited and “evasive”, apparently encouraged by “legitimacy” and institutional factors. Indeed, businesses are gradually committed with the Agenda, and progress is being made, supported by tools like the SDG Compass (WBCSD, 2015 ), CEO Guide (WBCSD, 2017 ), Good Life Goals (WBCSD, 2019c ), SDG Matrix (UN Global Compact-KPMG, 2017 ) or the Blueprint for Business (UN Global Compact, 2017 ). However, companies are not taking appropriate accountability actions, nor sufficiently aligning materiality with the SDGs (KPMG, 2018 ; Martinuzzi et al., 2017 ; WBSCD, 2019b ). SDG adoption is moving ahead, with the SDG13 (climate) on top and ecological goals on bottom. Nevertheless, corporate involvement persists limited and obscure in terms of governance, as well as highly dependent of the type of SDG (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ). A controversial discussion relies on how to prioritize actions based on principles (UN Global Compact-Accenture, 2019 ), while avoiding “cherry-picking” counterproductive decisions (CSIL, 2017 ), which would threat the holistic mission of the Agenda. It seems that companies are prioritizing some SDGs focused on climate, well-being or growth at the expenses of the ecosystems or food security (KPMG, 2018 ). Another notorious aspect to avoid is the use of the SDGs as “green-washing” marketing instrument to induce behavior change in consumers or stakeholders, which could yield to a loss of trust (Pimonenko et al., 2020 ). Rendtorff (2019)  analyses the SDGs role as a governance tool and driver for business ethics and CSR, triggering transformation of the economic model. Martinuzzi and Schönherr (2019)  claim for impact-oriented, collaborative, data-intensive, universal systemic framework to guide companies in better measuring their impacts. Cordova and Celone (2019)  underline the relevant role of industrial innovation as a driver of the SDGs. Govindan et al. (2020)  study the particular barriers of the SDGs in relation to the novel “industrial sharing economy” paradigm. Van Tulder (2018)  advises purpose-driven business to tackle wicked problems, guided by principles to understand and integrate the Goals. Redman (2018)  claims for addressing communication, tactical and strategic issues. Vildåsen (2018)  perceives the SDGs as a platform for debating social and environmental concerns with stakeholders, facilitating collaboration. Rubio-Mozos et al. (2019)  underline the role of purpose-driven SMEs and entrepreneurs claiming for a new systemic “engagement ecosystem” shifting to a sustainable growth model aligned with the Agenda. A framework for SDG business reporting has been designed by leveraging the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, the Global Compact and the Responsible Investment principles (GRI-UN Global Compact, 2018 ) although it presents limitations. Szennay et al. (2019)  analyses the relation among the SDGs and GRI indicators confirming a strong link but also business coverage gaps. Muff et al. (2017)  suggest a framework to translate goals into business opportunities, nurturing the SDG Compass which presents ambiguous and low-ambitious scope. Current tools are not appropriate, evidencing lack of proper indicators (Lopez, 2020 ), open-sources rankings or standards based on impact. Hence better guides and standards are urgently required (Topple et al., 2017 ). In conclusion, embedding the SDG into the corporate strategy and reporting, while avoiding counterproductive prioritization is essential. This relies on fostering collaboration with stakeholders and building novel guidelines and tools towards raising ownership. Regardless the utmost relevance of business for achieving a sustainable future, little is known about how companies can integrate the goals into corporate governance and business models (Dahlmann et al., 2019 ) demanding further and inter-disciplinary research (Dalby et al., 2019 ). Academic realm.  The relevance of science, research and education communities for catalyzing the SDGs has been broadly acknowledged (Colglazier, 2015 ; ECOSOC, 2019a ; Leal-Filho et al., 2019b ; Kopnina, 2020 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ; Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ; Saito et al., 2017 ; Schmalzbauer and Visbeck, 2016 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2018 ; UN, 2019d ). Undeniably, science is crucial to provide significant indicators and monitoring systems to understand interactions and complexities (Schmalzbauer and Visbeck, 2016 ; UN, 2019d ). Nonetheless, profound understanding of its contribution, along with proper indicators, roadmaps and reporting processes are required (Colglazier, 2015 ). Education, is a multiplier for sustainability, therefore, new transformational educative models (Zamora-Polo and Sánchez-Martín, 2019 ) and governance frameworks (Kickbusch and Hanefeld, 2017 ) which activate sustainability are required, although it remains a challenge (Giangrande et al., 2019 ). Current education role within the Agenda is questioned, for being unable to recognize extant paradoxes, favoring an economic-based notion of development, lacking ecology ethics (Kopnina, 2020 ). Despite progress, a lack of capacity persists in most academic institutions regarding sustainable practices. Gaps in research and practice particularly in terms of demographic diversity could hinder education for sustainability (Rashid, 2019 ). Moreover, science and research communities should yet agree a common ground about ethical and epistemic values around sustainability (Schneider et al., 2019 ). Public Sector and Governments.  Given the enabling character of public institutions they play a leading role driving the Agenda governance (UN , 2018b ; UN, 2019b ; UN, 2019e ), particularly towards supporting the SDG16. A holistic approach comprising all the dimensions of sustainability and related interlinks, together with the reinforcement of synergies, alignment and collaboration across scales is required in order to breakdown silos (Cutter, 2015 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ). New integrative systemic models and tools are needed to guide policy-making (Collste et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2015 ). Civil Society.  Little attention has been paid to the role of civil society (Martens, 2019 ) and individuals, which is also linked to localization, despite their huge potential contribution to the SDGs (Li et al., 2018 ). Indeed, consumption represents the 60% of the global wealth (UNCTAD, 2019 ), thus, citizens are relevant agents in pursuing a more sustainable society (Micheletti et al., 2014 ). The historic global demonstrations for climate action on 2019, have shown the potential behind mobilizing civil society towards sustainability purposes. However, spaces for civil society participation are limited, therefore constraining the respective influence on sustainable policy and the SDGs implementation, revealing a “democracy-influence paradox” (Sénit, 2019 ). Citizen science also constitutes a relevant data source which could be integrated into the SDGs reporting system (Fritz et al., 2019 ). Public awareness, citizen engagement, ownership and people-centric indicators are critical and must be enhanced (EESC, 2018 ; Guan et al., 2019 ; Lucci and Lucci, 2015 ; Rubio-Mozos et al., 2019 ; UN, 2019d ; UNU-CS, 2018 ) and bottom-up governance should be better leveraged (Martens, 2019 ). Knowledge about behavior formation towards the goals is limited (Guan et al., 2019 ). Hence, further research and policy development is desirable to fully explore the meaningful contribution of civil society to change patterns and accelerating change. Multi-stakeholder partnerships.  These alliances are fundamental drivers of SD, helping to rally different actors while bridging market failures, free-riders issues or governance gaps (Nelson, 2017 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). Thus, cross-sectoral, public-private and collaborative partnerships are considered crucial elements for successfully achieving and funding the Agenda in line with the UN Addis-Abeba Action Agenda (UN, 2015c ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Florini and Pauli, 2018 ; Horan, 2019 ; Kolk et al., 2017 ; OECD, 2019c ; UN, 2019d ; UN-ECOSOC, 2019b ; UN-SDSN, 2019 ). Certainly, the 17.16 and 17.17 targets focus on effective public-private and civil society partnerships. Particularly, data partnerships are essential for a responsible use of digital technologies (Data4SDGS, 2019 ; Data-Pop Alliance, 2017 ; UN-SDSN, 2019 ; WEF, 2019d ). Rasche et al. (2019)  argue that enhanced legitimacy and accountability are needed to evolve the use of data for development through partnerships. Susha (2020)  discusses that data collaborations are promising although little is known about how to successfully implement such partnerships. However, articulating partnerships and bringing together different stakeholders is not forthright. Strong complexities, implementation and governance hurdles, unclear impacts (Berrone et al., 2019 ; UN DESA, 2019 ) or limited effectiveness persist (Beisheim and Ellersiek, 2017 ; Melo, 2018 ; Nelson, 2017 ). Horan (2019)  reveals two main caveats regarding identification and implementation of transformative and efficient partnerships, and suggests enhancing: “compensation, collaboration, capacity, coordination and incentives”. Success strongly depends upon stable political and economic structures not always available. Aligning actors, providing incentives and instruments are also challenges. The added-value brought by the partnerships has yet to be clarified and they need to be scale-up to leverage their transformative power (UN Global Compact -Accenture, 2018 ). Further research based on facts and contextual understanding is needed for leapfrogging and scaling the partnerships for the SDGs. In conclusion, clarifying the roles, responsibilities and unlocking the engagement, ownership and collaboration of all the actors, at all levels of society in the same direction, is essential to accelerate transformation and progress for pursuing the goals.   4.6 The role of technology, innovation diffusion and knowledge transfer Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) are key requirements towards SD (EC, 2015 ; Köhler et al., 2019 ; Perez, 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ; Vatananan-Thesenvitz et al., 2019 ) and should be central for the SDGs implementation (Colglazier, 2015 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ). A relevant literature about the relation between STI and sustainable transitions exists, underlining the need of novel paradigms (Köhler et al., 2019 ). The role of STI in enabling a carbon-neutrality (Labanca et al., 2020 ) and improving efficiency and effectiveness of SD (Berawi, 2017 ) is widely acknowledged. Furthermore, eco-innovation is considered a driver for the SDGs (Cordova and Celone, 2019 ). Indeed, the Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the diffusion of green innovative technologies (Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Walz et al., 2017 ). However, sustainability issues cannot be solved just by technology (Kane et al., 2019 ; Söderholm et al., 2019 ; Secundo et al., 2020 ). Walsh et al. (2020)  denounce a narrow consideration of STI in framing the SDGs through the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism (UN, 2018a ), since is featured by a disproportionate focus on technology transfer and little on eco-innovation, wanting planetary boundary awareness (Imaz and Sheinbaum, 2017 ). Moreover, social innovation is poorly understood and considered (Eichler and Schwarz, 2019 ). Knowledge gaps among social and ecological systems remain (Mastrángelo et al., 2019 ), together with tensions between technological progress and environmental conservation. The SDG12 (target 12.a) and SDG17 (17.7.1) support, respectively, technology capacity and transfer in developing countries, as well as diffusion of “environmentally sound technologies”, but without setting truly actionable objectives (Gasper et al., 2019 ) and lacking measurement methodologies. Thus, they are unable to overcome market-induced tensions which limit diffusion of green technologies such as Intelectual Property Rights (IPR). Furthermore, access to technology depends on multiple dynamics and environmental performance is context-dependent. Thus, literature evidences that policy, along with reinforced means of implementation and finance, are crucial elements to mediate with those tensions (Sinha et al., 2020 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ). The diffusion and integration of the SDGs within the heart of STI policy is essential (Walsh et al., 2020 ). STI narratives should be enhanced by knowledge-sharing and collaboration across geographies and actors (Berawi, 2017 ), promoting co-creation (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Indeed, a knowledge-based society is an imperative for realizing the Agenda (Colglazier, 2015 ), since knowledge plays a vital role in the international development realm by bridging local and global insights amidst research, policy and practice. The goals act like vehicles that arrange and disseminate norms, value creation and policy improvement (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ), constituting a relevant frame to knowledge brokering among societal actors (Cummings et al., 2019 ). However, literature pays little attention to this subject (Barrantes-Briceño and Almada-Santos, 2019 ). The intellectual capital and creativity act as enablers for transitions towards an innovative, knowledge-based, smart and sustainable society (Herman and Suciu, 2019 ; Secundo et al., 2020 ; Suciu and Năsulea, 2019 ). Moreover, the interlink amidst human, structural and relational capital is essential to create societal value (Secundo et al., 2020 ), although rests little explored (Gouvea et al., 2018 ; Secundo et al., 2020 ), evidencing inclusiveness gaps. Policy diffusion of ecologically-aware innovation and green technologies is a critical tool for cleaner production and SD (Crespi et al., 2015 ; Centobelli et al., 2020 ), since it facilitates knowledge spill-overs (Aldieri et al., 2019 ) leading to a virtuous cycle of eco-innovation. Thus, policies should promote knowledge transfer between different sources for allowing eco-innovation and SD (Aldieri et al., 2020 ). However, derived negative externalities, “free-riding” incentives and potential tensions amid genuine sustainability and productivity maximization should be acknowledged by appropriate policy mix and knowledge absorption (Aldieri et al., 2019 ). Further research is required on breakthrough and diffusion Köhler et al. (2019) . The SDGs diffusion could collide at global scale due to persistent silos but could be possible close to the implementation level (Kanie et al., 2014 ). Top-down diffusion of innovations can be difficult in specific contexts, where informal networks can be suitable enablers for dissemination (Henry, 2018 ; Masuda et al., 2018 ). Indeed, innovation strategies are context-dependent (Eichler and Schwarz, 2019 ), while sharing common factors to succeed such as an “enabling environment, absorptive capacity, learning and diffusion”. Thus, policy should balance diffusion and absorptive capacity depending on the maturity of the innovation system (UNCTAD, 2017b ). Research on diffusion dynamics of sustainable innovation is thus far limited (Clausen and Fichter, 2016 ) particularly concerning bottom-up grassroots innovations (Feola and Butt, 2017 ). Patnaik and Bhowmick (2020)  underscore the relevance of fostering inclusive innovation and native knowledge for SD, overcoming extant asymmetries and ensuring ownership, transformative learning and psychological nuances. Hötte (2020)  contends that slow diffusion of green technologies could be partially caused by path dependence of technological change and cumulative knowledge. Pradhan et al. (2020)  argue that innovation diffusion and investments impact the economic growth in Europe, the direction of the causality is dependent of the specific measures utilized for that purpose. Current green growth and innovation perspectives are narrowly techno-centric, mainly focused on economic development, which overlook environmental concerns (Capasso et al., 2019 ) and neglect complexity, social and systemic interactions (Labanca et al., 2020 ). Social impacts of technological innovations and technology transfer have been disregarded in the literature (Corsi et al., 2020 ) and should be diffused to guarantee a genuine sustainability. Zhou et al. (2020)  explore the partial influence of fairness appreciation, embedders and knowledge-sharing in enhancing green innovation, as essential factor towards the SDGs. Schot and Steinmueller (2018)  suggests that ecosystems and socio-technical system change should be integrated, overcoming current lack of knowledge provision from the private sector. Building-up competences for tackling complexities and social issues seems crucial (Labanca et al., 2020 ), along with reorientation of technology considering market, structural and transformational failures at different scales (Capasso et al., 2019 ). Stimulating a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) approach to understand the complexities (Thapa et al., 2019 ; Van der Leeuw, 2018 ) along with facilitating inclusive innovation among low-income segments are priority facets which should be embedded in policies (Foster and Heeks, 2013 ; Hanlin and Kaplinsky, 2016 ; Zanello et al., 2013 ). However, the RRI concept and related policies persist ambiguous and should be well formulated considering: “inclusion, anticipation, responsiveness, reflexivity, as well as sustainability and care” (Burget et al., 2017 ). For instance, Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH) represents a promising approach for supporting numerous SDGs, demanding novel business models and social finance (Lehoux et al., 2018 ). Novel approaches, technologies and competences, including design thinking (Maher et al., 2018 ), and innovative business models (Arnold, 2018 ; Dressler and Bucher, 2018 ) are also desirable. Several authors devote research to the domain of digital technologies. Fukuda-Parr and McNeill (2019)  underscore the role of Big Data and digital technologies in shaping knowledge (epistemology) for SD and the SDGs in particular. Pappas et al. (2018)  argue that digitalization, specifically Big Data and analytic ecosystems, could speed up a transition to sustainability, provided that the interrelations amid actors are well understood, leading to value and knowledge creation. Stuermer et al. (2017)  underline that literature has considered digital artifacts as means towards SD, although they should comply with a number of prerequisites for sustainability. Tosic and Zivkovic (2019)  claim that a correlation between knowledge and innovation can be found, compatible with preserving sustainability approach. Knowledge-sharing policies in smart cities focused on merging green and smart concepts are an emerging, yet untapped, field (Israilidis et al., 2019 ). The WEF (2020a)  pleas for increasing the technology intensity of the SDGs strategic and implementation actions, aligning the Agenda with the 4th Industrial and Digital Revolution. Nevertheless, excessive “Technopolitics of Development” leaded by private philanthropists that use developing contexts as living labs for experimentation, could challenge participation and trigger undesirable consequences (Fejerskov, 2017 ). Reframing the STI policy agendas to promote and disseminating green technological innovations seems essential (Centobelli et al., 2020 ). Extant frames should be reoriented to encourage transformation towards SD (Walsh et al., 2020 ), based on context-savvy solutions (Centobelli et al., 2020 ), multi-scale and inclusive perspectives (Leach et al., 2012 ), novel technologies and principles, and a suitable mix of strategic actions, policy and finance (Rogge and Reichardt, 2016 ; Edmondson et al., 2018 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ). Hence, Technological innovation is crucial for achieving the goals, but it should be guided by a consistent policy and systemic governance able to overcome persistent barriers and market failures. A profound understanding of potential STI contribution is needed (Colglazier, 2015 ).Further understanding about the role, drivers and dynamics of technological innovation for SD and knowledge flows is needed, together with specific enabling regulation, effective and inclusive policies to bridge barriers while reinforcing social good (Vatananan-Thesenvitz et al., 2019 ).   5 The convergence amid sustainability and digitalization 5.1 A brief introduction to the powerful digital transformation The advent of digital paradigms, together with the explosion of computational power, have triggered a new era heralded to revolutionize science (Schmidt and Cohen, 2013 ) and facilitate a data-driven economy (WEF, 2019b ) and knowledge society (Grech and Camilleri, 2017 ). Digital technologies are disrupting across the economy and society. The data deluge, processed by intelligent algorithms, endows a huge connectivity and computational capacity, which combined with traditional methodologies and contextual nuances, can provide unprecedented capacities to explore, understand, predict, optimize and innovate aspects that were inscrutable before (Hey et al., 2009 ; Manyika, 2011 ; McKinsey, 2016 ). Digitalization brings novel cultural, holistic and multidimensional phenomena (Boyd and Crawford, 2012 ) beyond and across disciplines, blurring frontiers (Etzion and Aragon-Correa, 2016 ), and driving a complex and highly interconnected network (Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ). The digital era cornerstones, offer huge potential to create new value propositions, enabling operational performance and efficiency, supporting wise decision-making and accountability, and building capacities or awareness. Given its exceptional power to approach complex societal issues, it has become an integral part of governmental agendas (Etzion and Aragon-Correa, 2016 ; UN, 2019b ; World Bank, 2018b ). Thus, the digital revolution grants a powerful tool to build-up smart green growth (Perez, 2019 ) and sustainable governance (Etzion and Aragon-Correa, 2016 ; Ki-Moon, 2014 ; Seele, 2016a ) which primarily relies on harnessing the so-called “data revolution for sustainable development” (Jacob, 2017 ; UN, 2014 ). However, digitalization is often surrounded hyperbolic expectations and unrealistic promises (Kiron and Unruh, 2018 ) bringing about multiple concerns and yet unknown risks (Letouzé and Pendtland, 2018 ). Its potential to spur SD is still controversial (Fernández-Portillo et al., 2019 ). Science and society are at a crossroad, being an upheaval or metamorphosis, where technology will transform the way we live and the whole society (Helbing et al., 2017 ).  5.2 The nexus between digitalization and sustainability Digitalisation1  1 Digitalization can be interpreted as the use of digital technologies to provide new value-producing opportunities (Gartner, 2020 ). In this article, digitalization can be perceived as the process by which economy and society are evolved around digital technologies providing new added-value opportunities.   and sustainability are game-changers and strategic imperatives which are converging, triggering major transformations (Kiron and Unruh, 2018 ; Osburg and Lohrmann, 2017 ). The convergence between digitalization and sustainability is perceived as a winning combination, not exempt of challenges, offering opportunities within and across organizational boundaries for overcoming informational void (Atos, 2018 ),. Other experts consider that both are conflicting concepts leading to a paradigm shift in social and ecological systems (Gebhardt, 2017 ). However, the nexus amid both domains remains poorly explored and little is known about whether and to what extent the digital era could contribute or jeopardize sustainable landscapes (Seele and Lock, 2017 ), what is the role of digital technologies in pursuing the Agenda and how to enable a sustainable digitalization. Therefore, a responsible and well-enunciated synergy between digitalization and sustainability is unavoidable and thus far untapped. The potential of ICT paradigms, particularly Big Data, to spur sustainability while enhancing transparency and accountability, has been widely recognized (Corbett, 2018 ; De Camargo-Fiorini et al., 2019 ; GeSI, 2019 ; Gijzen, 2013 ; Gouvea et al., 2018 ; Hilty and Aebischer, 2015 ; ITU, 2017b ; El Hilali and Manouar, 2020 ; Madudova et al., 2018 ; Seele, 2017 ; Seele and Lock, 2017 ; UN, 2019b ; WEF, 2020a ; World Bank, 2018b ; Zhao et al., 2017 ). The so-called “for good” movement does not only allude non-profit activities but also purpose-driven actions creating shared value. Nevertheless, a lack of consensus about the meaning of “social good” persist (Berendt, 2019 ). Digital paradigms are considered enablers of SD (Fernández-Portillo et al., 2019 ; Van der Velden, 2018a ), since they could support human progress, enhance personalization and reframe the business case for both investors and consumers (Holst et al., 2017 ), transforming behaviors and enabling circular economy (Atos, 2019 ). Besides, digitalization could enhance transparency, help to assess Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance (Kiron and Unruh, 2018 ; Seele, 2016b ), drive resource efficiency, accelerate discovery (WEF, 2020a ), promote education (Ahel and Lingenau, 2020 ), support evidence-based decision-making and predictions (GeSI, 2019 ; ITU, 2017b ; Tjoa and Tjoa, 2016 ). However, strong controversies and uncertainties persist, particularly about the relationship between ICTs and sustainability at the corporate realm (Jones et al., 2017 ; Saunila et al., 2019 ; Ziemba, 2019 ). Digitalization may lead to unintended environmental or social effects (Scholz et al., 2018 ; Van der Velden, 2018a ), such as degradation of natural ecosystems (Bekaroo et al., 2016 ), amplification of power-asymmetries or digital divides (ITU, 2017b ). However, it also may help to reduce inequality (Asongu and Odhiambo, 2019 ) or financial access (Tchamyou et al., 2019 ), depending on how it is shaped. Digitalization could cause negative environmental and health impacts (LaPointe, 2018 ) linked to electronic waste (Aksin-Sivrikaya and Bhattacharya, 2017 ; WEF, 2019c ; WEF, 2020a ), raw materials production and disposal impacting biodiversity (Baldé et al., 2017 ; Khakurel et al., 2018 ; Osburg and Lohrmann, 2017 ; WEF , 2020a ) growing energy and water use, together with pollutant emissions (ITU, 2017b ; Tjoa and Tjoa, 2016 ). ICTs have been associated to awful effects on human rights related to minerals extraction (i.e. Coltan) in conflicting zones (Aksin-Sivrikaya and Bhattacharya, 2017 ). Bieser and Hilty (2018)  denounce a gap on indirect environmental effects of ICTs, which affect patterns of production or consumption, particularly consumer behavior. Thus, numerous aspects of ICTs could be intrinsically unsustainable (Unwin, 2017 ), remaining poorly studied (ITU, 2017b ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ; MacFeely, 2019 ). Regarding energy consume and carbon emissions, digital technologies are “Janus-faced”, opening controversial debates (Schulte et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2015 ; Yan et al., 2018 ). ICTs are perceived as low-carbon enablers holding the potential to promote an efficient energy landscape (Bekaroo et al., 2016 ; Bull, 2015 ; Gouvea et al., 2018 ; Jacob, 2018 ; Mirza et al., 2019 ) but their massive development could yield a huge energy demand (Bekaroo et al., 2016 ; Strubell et al., 2019 ). Belkhir and Elmeligi (2018)  assess ICT footprint, concluding that the digital sector would be responsible of 14% of the green-house emissions, providing recommendations to curb them. Perils exist concerning growing negative footprints or perverse cascading effects increasing vulnerabilities due to the interconnected global system (Helbing, 2012 ). On the contrary, Jacob (2018)  explores the role of ICTs towards enabling a climate-friendly low carbon future, concluding that a net-positive impact is possible, provided that suitable policy, infrastructures and means are implemented. Other scholars (Gelenbe and Caseau, 2015 ; Moyer and Hughes, 2012 ) and studies (GeSI, 2016 ) underline the ICTs ability to reduce emissions, evidencing an “inverted-U” relation (Higón et al., 2017 ). Hence, despite the burgeoning literature, contradictory views, lack of understanding and poor accountability remain about the net impact, along with rebound and induction effects of digitalization (Gensch et al., 2017 ; Pohl et al., 2019 ). Thus, in-depth research and integrated management of ICTs and environment is desirable (Wang et al., 2015 ). Moreover, achieving the all-out net-sustainable benefit is challenging due to tensions amid the different dimensions (Tura et al., 2018 ). Sustainability needs a balance within the planetary and social limits, whereas development is fueled by growth (ITU, 2017b ). So far, environmental concerns and social divides are poorly covered in the literature. Kreps et al. (2015)  discuss the Ecological World Systems Theory (WST) as a holistic framework to assess the environmental impact of ICT. Indeed, the role of digitalization for sustainability is nascent, based on one-shot philanthropic-based projects or incidental findings from efficiency-focused efforts lacking purpose (Lee, 2014 ; Shin, 2016 ; Watson et al., 2010 ), evidencing a clear research gap. Indeed, research regarding ICTs sustainability is an emerging issue (Yan et al., 2018 ), which was initially focused on narrow quantitative issues, such as energy and carbon footprints, under the term of “Green IT” or “Sustainable ICT”. A strand of literature focuses on ICTs for SD, specifically, on climate change mitigation by reducing carbon emissions and adaptation in urban context (Akande et al., 2019 ). Green IT is supposed to reduce impacts while enhancing sustainable growth contributing towards the SDGs (Imasiku et al., 2019 ). However, technology is not a silver lining and sustainability issues should be pursued from a systemic perspective (Kane et al., 2019 ). Technology and data require governance, security and trust (Letouzé et al., 2019 ). Horner et al. (2016)  review ICT4S taxonomies, concluding that net-impact remains unknown. Thus far, the potential to tackle all sustainability pillars has not yet been fully proved (Bonilla, 2018 ; Madudova et al., 2018 ; Pouri and Hilty, 2018 ). Strong gaps exist regarding value creation, delivery and capture (Parida et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, social aspects are gaining attention spawning new schools of thought (Fors and Lennefors, 2018 ). A comprehensive analysis should be developed (Sachs et al., 2016 ). Despite the emerging literature, the relationship the topic is not yet fully understood at micro-level. On the other side, sustainability is an imperative for digitalization (Etzion and Aragon-Correa, 2016 ). Without considering sustainability, the digital era would lead to serious threats, increasing vulnerabilities (Helbing, 2012 ). Deprived of a responsible approach, the exponential development of technologies and the singularity expected by 2025, would lead to dire consequences for humankind. Society must accept the responsibility of making technology more sustainable, ethical and human-focused (Leonhard and Graf-von-Kospoth, 2017 ). Therefore, digitalization is central towards sustainability and a sustainable digitalization is possible, it will depend on the way we outline it (Adams et al., 2018 ; Osburg and Lohrmann, 2017 ; WBGU, 2019 ). Digitalization could accelerate sustainable transitions, particularly ecological and social shifts in the industrial domain (Beier et al., 2017 ). However, a number or prerequisites should be ensured to handle potential impacts (Khakurel et al., 2018 ; Pappas et al., 2018 ; Stuermer et al., 2017 ). In addition, dialogue across sectors and actors is needed, since ICTs for sustainability and a sustainable ICT system even when related are different notions (Hofstetter et al., 2020 ). On the whole, the digitalization holds great potential for overcoming research gaps and societal problems, whereas sustainability is also an imperative for a responsible digital transformation. However, current model of digital transformation does not ensure a SD (Chazhaeva et al., 2019 ). A clear gap between technology and sustainability is evidenced (Akande et al., 2019 ). Digitalization brings open sustainability concerns, yet to be disentangled, mainly related to environmental impacts, social divides and ethical issues. A huge space for policy action exist (IEEE, 2018 ), along with a glaring new field of research (Scholz et al., 2018 ), claiming urgent structural change, normative safeguards to shape digitalization towards the public good (Lane et al., 2013 ). Van der Velden (2018b)  suggests reorienting the digital revolution towards sustainability within the planetary boundaries. El Hilali and Manouar (2019)  claim for unleashing sustainability through digitalization. Research and policy should guide a sustainable digital revolution (Pouri and Hilty, 2018 ; Khakurel et al., 2018 ). In conclusion, because of their complex multidimensional nature and nascent state-of-play, the nexus between digitalization and sustainability remains untapped and little is known about how to seize its opportunities while minimizing pitfalls, evidencing manifest research and policy gaps. Consequently, further research about this interplay is needed, as well as new policies and governance approaches.  5.3 The case of smart sustainable cities and communities One of the most promising and widespread applications of ICTs for SD are the smart sustainable cities. Digitalization can be regarded as a tool for sustainable cities (Bifulco et al., 2016 ) following the widely acknowledged framework for smart cities designed by Giffinger and Gudrun (2010)  which comprises 6 dimensions, namely: smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment, smart people, smart living and smart governance. Certainly, as urbanization grows and digitalization permeates the entire society, cities are becoming complex and multidimensional networks, engines of the economic growth which account for the majority of the population and 70% of the greenhouse emissions (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ). Given that city planning becomes critical for the goals (Giles-Corti et al., 2019 ), addressing sustainable and resilient cities by leveraging digital capacities constitutes an imperative for attaining the 2030 Agenda as a whole. An emerging body of literature reveals how urban policy and management could benefit from the digital revolution to foster well-being and eco-innovation, supporting both the “New Urban Agenda” (Valencia et al., 2019 ), the SDG11 (Allam and Dhunny, 2019 ; Amini et al., 2019 ; Balogun et al., 2019 ; Bibri and Krogstieb, 2017 ; Bifulco et al., 2016 ; Croese et al., 2020 ; Kharrazi et al., 2016 ; Vaidya and Chatterji, 2019 ; Valencia et al., 2019 ; Zheng et al., 2020 ), while advancing the rest of SDGs. Ismagilova et al. (2019)  review the alignment of smart cities with the SDGs, underlining limitations and future directions. Amini et al. (2019)  consider smart cities as computationally and socially complex, multi-sectorial, multi-actor and interdependent networks whose objective is promoting SE, quality of life, together with efficient operation and efficient services. Valencia et al. (2019)  underscore the relevance of localisation and transdisciplinary research regarding: boundaries, governance, actors, synergies and trade-offs and indicators. Even when several literature reviews exist in the domain, a lack of systemic quantifiable and multidisciplinary perspective remains (Zheng et al., 2020 ) along with lack of consensus. Indeed, some experts argue that cities cannot be smart and sustainable at the same time (Akande et al., 2019 ) and the potential of digitalization to tackle climate adaptation has not yet been proved (Balogun et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the literature also reveals caveats and complexities. Urban sustainability is still not well understood at policy level (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ), neither is the concept of smart cities, and current indicators for the SDG11 are not consistent, lacking benchmarks (Giles-Corti et al., 2019 ). Implementation issues remain poorly understood, especially concerning resilience (Croese et al., 2020 ). Regarding urban digitalization, multiple open issues persist, such as data privacy and security, misconstructions both on the policy and technology side, along with lack of systemic perspectives able to balance social and environmental issues (Allam and Dhunny, 2019 ; Amini et al., 2019 ; Bibri and Krogstie, 2017 ; Kitchin, 2015 ; Israilidis et al., 2019 ). Kharrazi et al. (2016)  underline the key role of urban Big Data for feeding innovative indicators, thus helping policy-makers to achieve SD. Nevertheless, leveraging the data deluge demands culture and skills advancement, together with investment and dedicated programs. Bibri and Krogstie (2017)  argue that ICT development should be better linked with SD and well-being, while underscoring numerous critical issues which remain overlooked, lacking theory development. Yigitcanlar et al. (2019)  contend that limited evidence exists about the integration of genuine sustainability, since policies are techno-centric and multiple complexities remain, suggesting a knowledge-based development and policy enhancement. Allam and Dhunny (2019)  claim that sustainability, inclusivity and well-being, must not be disregarded. Social and cultural nuances should be integrated, balancing technological, social and environmental factors. Israilidis et al. (2019)  argue that research is mainly focused on technical issues, overlooking social approaches, knowledge-sharing and learning capabilities, conceiving cities as multi-stakeholder and citizen-centered knowledge hub. Michalec et al. (2019)  contend that lack of awareness about how different actors, such as practitioners, understand smart cities, showing that urban climate justice is scarcely embedded in this topic, where policy needs enhancement. Cowley and Caprotti (2019)  regard smart cities as space for experimenting in opposition to critical experts which consider them as top-down imposition for policy-making and planning purposes. Öberg et al. (2007  state that organisational aspects of management are poorly considered, lacking theoretical ground. Despite the limitations and caveats, sustainable, “green” and smart concepts for SD can converge provided that environmental quality and resilience keeps central in policy and planning (Gazzola et al., 2019 ). In conclusion, further research is needed to fully understand the limitations and provide policy and governance recommendations for truly embedded sustainability as a core value and feature of smart cities.  5.4 A first-approach to the role of digital paradigms for pursuing the SDGs, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Digitalization offers a far-reaching potential on the sustainability arena, for addressing intractable societal, environmental and governance challenges in an unprecedented fashion, towards pursuing the SDGs, as acknowledged by numerous experts (ECOSOC, 2019c ; GeSI, 2019 ; ITU, 2017a ; Sachs et al., 2019b ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; UN, 2019d ; UNCTAD, 2018 ; UN DESA, 2018 ; UN Global Pulse, 2016 ; World Bank, 2018b ; Walker et al., 2019 ). The nexus between digitalization and the Agenda could be perceived as a “vector of hope” not exempt of threats, demanding transformative shifts (Bissio, 2018 ). Thus, a convergence of both digital and ecological transformation is compelling (Villani, 2018 ), although still untapped (Hampton et al., 2013 ). The digital disruption goes beyond technology, representing an interplay between technology, social change and policy (Hilbert, 2016 ) since socio-economic enablers and understanding the human side are equally important factors (Grech and Camilleri, 2017 ). Relevant synergies among digital paradigms exist, namely Big Data Analytics,2  2 Big Data Analytics refers to the conjunction between huge volumes of data, along with analytics techniques, which make possible to process data into information (CNIL, 2019 ). It could also be interpreted as the conjunction of data crumbs, communities and capacities (Letouzé, 2015 ). Artificial Intelligence refers to the portfolio of technologies, algorithm-based and data-driven computer systems that enable machines and people with digital capabilities such as perception, reasoning, learning and even autonomous decision making (BDVA, 2018 ).   Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technologies, Quantum Computing, among others. The digitalization era can only be leveraged by articulating all of them together, creating unseen capacities towards accomplishing the SDGs (BDVA, 2017 ; EESC, 2017 ; Kirkpatrick, 2017 ; UN ESCAP, 2017 ). The potential relies on acquiring knowledge from new data sources able to complement and cover limitations of traditional techniques, while enhancing human-capacities, connectivity and collaboration while mitigating subtle risks. Despite its incipient status, a nascent literature revealing the potential of digital paradigms to track progress or advance the SDGs can be found, although unevenly distributed across contexts (UN Women, 2018 ) and lacking a truly comprehensive approach in light on research gaps from both fields. Wu et al. (2018)  review correlations among SDGs and ICTs from practical use cases, identifying research gaps within the three pillars of sustainability. Tjoa and Tjoa (2016)  claim for a holistic approach to include ICTs impacts on the SDGs. ITU (2017b)  outlines risks and opportunities behind ICT for SDGs while the ICT-Benchmark (Huawei, 2017 ) asserts the related correlations. Fernández-Portillo et al. (2019)  underline a positive relationship of ICT and SD in European countries, underscoring the need to enhance connectivity and digital skills. Van der Velden (2018a)  suggests a sustainable digitalization within the Planetary Boundaries and compares two frameworks: the SDGs considering digitalization as a neutral tool and Doughnut Economics, more integrative, able to reveal potential negative impacts. Townsend and Coroama (2018)  plea for a “digital acceleration” of sustainability, underscoring three opportunities: resource efficiency, clean technologies and circularity. The WEF (2020a)  calls for increasing the relevance of digital technologies within the SDGs by aligning the Agenda with the 4th Industrial Digital Revolution through novel platforms. Kostoska and Kocarev (2019)  propose an ICT framework for accelerating the SDGs, considering local and global perspectives, vertical and horizontal relationships amid stakeholders, by integrating data, sustainability and governance. El Massah and Mohieldin (2020)  argue that digital transformation can impact the localization and achievement of the SDGs. Other scholars explore the, yet unknown, relationships and interactions between specific digital paradigms and the SDGs, inter alia: Industry 4.0 (Beier et al., 2017 ; Bonilla, 2018 ; Ghobakhloo, 2020 ; Nhamo et al., 2020 ), IoT (Salam, 2020 ) or Blockchain (Adams et al., 2018 ). Fukuda-Parr and McNeill (2019)  discuss how Big Data heralds disruptive implications for the SDGs governance and indicators. Even when some goals seem more suitable than others for profiting the digital transformation (Letouzé, 2015 ; Pentland, 2015 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ), it impacts across all sectors and disciplines (BDVA, 2017 ; ITU, 2017a ; UNCTAD, 2017a ). Indeed, digital paradigms would directly impact targets 9.c, 4.b, 5.b and 17.8, while they could be relevant for realizing all the 17 SDGs (GeSI, 2019 ; UNCTAD, 2017a ). GeSI (2019)  underline that 103 out of 169 SDGs targets are influenced, with potential to benefit by 22%, but also to threat or inhibit some targets. The WEF (2020a)  states that, digital paradigms could impact 10 out of 17 SDGs, enhancing the 70% of their related challenges. However, critical voices denounce a scattered consideration of the digitalization within the Agenda. Novak and Tjoa (2018)  argue that, despite its relevance, none of the SDGs is solely devoted to digitalization and the potential impact of ICTs is poorly considered. Concerning Big Data and AI for the SDGs, their untapped value behind has been addressed by some scholars and practitioners, although scientific literature is still incipient (AI4Good, 2019 ; Alemanno, 2018 ; Chandy et al., 2017 ; Etzion and Aragon-Correa, 2016 ; Guo, 2020 ; Hilbert, 2016 ; ITU, 2019b ; ITU, 2017a ; Lepri et al., 2017 ; Malhotra et al., 2018 ; Seele and Lock, 2017 ; Shiroishi et al., 2019 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; Song et al., 2017 ; UN Global Pulse, 2016 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ; Williams et al., 2019 ). Some initiatives in this realm can be found, namely: the UN Global Pulse (2016) , the UN Open Data Hub (2020) , Data-Pop Alliance (2017) , Datakind (2012) , the UN Global Working Group on Big Data for Official Statistics (2019) , the World Bank Group “Big Data Innovation Challenge” initiative (World Bank, 2016 ), the “ITU4SDG” tools (ITU, 2017c ), the UN World Data Forum from 2017 to 2020 (UNWDF, 2018 ), the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS, 2019 ), the AI for Good Global Summits from 2017 to 2019 (AI4Good, 2019 ), the “Data for Development” initiative (D4D, 2013 ), the “Data for Good Exchange” from 2014 to 2020 (D4GX, 2014 ) or “Frontier 2030” (WEF, 2020b ). Regardless the relevance of these pioneer studies and initiatives, a profound and holistic analysis of the SDGs gaps, coupled with how ICT paradigms could responsible contribute to bridge them, cannot be found in literature. Indeed, literature reveals that Big Data and AI applied to SD are in its infancy. Little is known yet, about whether it could promote or hinder the realization of the 2030-Agenda. Further multidisciplinary research is needed to fully understand multiple complexities behind this nexus. One of the most salient values of digitalization for the SDGs relies on the data revolution (Jacob, 2017 ; UN-SDSN, 2019 ; ECOSOC, 2019c ). Indeed, relevant challenges remain to grasp timely and high-quality data, along with subsequent analytics (Andries et al., 2019 ; Guo, 2020 ). ICTs are essential to overcome critical data gaps, by complementing traditional data sources and enhancing granularity (Letouze et al., 2019 ), which is particularly problematic in deprived countries (Chandy et al., 2017 ). Novel sources of Big Data such as Earth Observation Data (Andries et al., 2019 ; Guo, 2020 ) or citizens’ mobile data (Malhotra et al., 2018 ) could be useful to feed SDGs indicators and monitoring SD. Certainly, Bullock et al. (2020)  and Oliver et al. (2020)  underline the potential of AI and mobile data for tackling global crisis or pandemic management. People-focused Big Data could enhance SDGs accountability (Williams et al., 2019 ). For instance, digital health technologies enhance the compilation of disaggregated data for the SDG3 (Konduri et al., 2018 ). Given the relevance of interpretation and context-awareness, merging Small and Big Data for feeding better SDGs indicators, creating proxies and complementing official statistics in an affordable way is crucial (UN Women, 2018 ; Van den Homberg and Susha, 2018 ). Data ecosystems could enrich reporting, overcoming fragmentation, divides and data vacuum, enhancing development effectiveness (Letouze et al., 2019 ). Nonetheless, several conditions should be assured for responsibly harnessing the data revolution (UN DESA, 2018 ), namely: ensuring data accessibility and significance; fairness by avoiding bias and capturing diversity; accountability and transparency; cultivating ownership, trust and user-centric data (EU, 2019a ; Fjeld et al., 2020 ; Lepri et al., 2018 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ); promoting data stewards (UN Global Pulse-GSMA, 2017 ); securing consensus on data-sharing models (Data-Pop Alliance, 2017 ; ECOSOC, 2018 ); establishing privacy standards while minimizing ethics risks (Campolo et al., 2018 ; Herschel and Miori, 2017 ; EESC, 2017 ; Fjeld et al., 2020 ; Metcalf et al., 2016 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; Yayboke et al., 2017 ); strengthening statistical systems and building-up digital literacy (Bhargava et al., 2015 ; Letouze et al., 2019 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ). Moreover, reliable business models, methodologies along with policy for international collaboration and funding are critical factors yet unexploited (UN-SDSN, 2019 ). Notwithstanding, the power of Big Data, AI and synergic ICTs, goes beyond metrics. Indeed, data is unworkable without interpretation (EESC, 2017 ). Digital paradigms provide enhanced capacities for scientific discovering, decision-making, forecasts and governance, becoming the new cornerstone to advance social research (Bright, 2017 ; Fazekas, 2014 ; Paulus et al., 2014 ) and to understand and transform behaviors towards sustainable conducts. The fusion of Big Data Analytics and AI, holds exceptional descriptive, predictive, prescriptive and discursive functions (Letouze, 2015 ), which could contribute holistically across all dimensions of sustainability (Maaroof, 2015 ; Khakurel et al., 2018 ). Thus, digital capacities are essential for addressing complex social problems (Lepri et al., 2017 ; Pappas et al., 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ) so as to enhancing governance towards SD (Athey, 2017 ; Letouze, 2015 ; Lowman, 2017 ). Furthermore, digital paradigms enable novel collaborative digital ecosystems (Jensen and Campbell, 2019 ; Pappas et al., 2018 ; Stuermer et al., 2017 ), expanding global connectivity and facilitating knowledge-sharing (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). However, beyond benefits, digital technologies are also changing the information landscape, raising ethical and social concerns (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Metcalf et al., 2016 ; O’Neill, 2016 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; UN DESA, 2018 ). Big Data disrupts knowledge management and governance, but it could significantly contribute to the SDGs as long as potential threats are carefully managed with proper policy and governance (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). AI could trigger an ideal world achieving the 2030 Agenda or a dystopian future far for the SDGs (Goralski and Tan, 2020 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). Regarding ecology issues, they are almost invisible in the related strategies and policies (Villani, 2018 ). Furthermore, sustainable digitalization policies are lacking (Khakurel et al., 2018 ), since only few countries consistently include the SDGs within their AI or digital strategies (Van Roy, 2020 ). Thus their role in pursuing the environmental goals should be enhanced (WEF, 2020a ). Critical voices argue that digitalization challenges outshine opportunities (MacFeely, 2019 ). Hence, since controversies prevail, demonstrating whether and to what extent digital capacities can be used in a responsible, eco-friendly and human-centered fashion towards the SDGs is crucial (Letouze and Pentland, 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). Nevertheless, so far, a lack of systemic perspectives remains and little is known yet about how such capacities could be achieved without inducing bias or manipulation (Niño et al., 2017 ). Current status is characterized by a fragmented landscape, booming narrowly-focused stand-alone pilots difficult to scale (UN Global Pulse-GSMA, 2017 ) following a reductionist and ambiguous “for good” approach, or even “ethic-washing” tactics (Campalo et al., 2018; Stocker, 2016 ). Multiple barriers persist around policies and regulations, together with lack of tools and insufficient capacities to face the challenges ahead (Lee, 2014 ; Letouzé, 2015 ; Shin, 2016 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; UN Global Pulse-GSMA, 2017 ; UN Women, 2018 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ). A huge gap between potential and performance remains (Chandy et al., 2017 ; Janowski, 2016 ), together with severe limitations to surpassing the philanthropic scope and become mainstream conscientiously. Furthermore, structural challenges remain in terms of, namely: lacking infrastructures, expertise or capacities, quality data, market incentives and regulation, trust and security (WEF, 2020a ). Cybersecurity spillovers could impact SD and persist ignored in research studies (Ahmed, 2020 ). These hurdles cannot be solved by technology alone and are even magnified in deprived contexts (Yayboke et al., 2017 ). Addressing contextual specificities is required (Hesse et al., 2018 ; ITU, 2019b ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ). A massive development of digital technologies without proper governance and means could lead to unsustainable and uneven landscapes. Therefore, digital and sustainability policies should be aligned with the SDGs. Responsible and ethics-driven governance, regulation and means of implementation are urgently needed to ensure a sustainable scale-up (Data-Pop Alliance, 2017 ; EESC, 2017 ; ECOSOC, 2018 ; UN DESA, 2018 ; UNDG, 2017 ; WEF, 2020a ). Building-up digital capacity among governments is crucial for the SDGs implementation (Janowski, 2016 ). Therefore, making the digital revolution works for the SDGs relies on a number of leapfrogs, summarized as follows. Sound enabling frameworks and responsible principle-based regulation are required, together with funding mechanisms, tailored incentives, and sustainable business models allowing collaboration across stakeholders (BDVA, 2017 ; Data4SDGS, 2019 ; Data-Pop Alliance, 2017 ; ITU, 2019a ; ITU, 2017a ; ECOSOC, 2018 ; Letouze, 2015 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ; Walker et al., 2019 ). Coordinating international efforts among all the ecosystem actors by building-up public-private multi-sectorial partnerships and promoting market demand (UNWDF, 2018 ) is essential (Data-Pop Alliance, 2017 ; ECOSOC, 2018 ; ITU, 2019a ; UN Global Pulse-GSMA, 2017 ; Yayboke et al., 2017 ). Therefore, a profound characterization of the phenomenon is required. Digitalization for the SDGs should be responsibly harnessed for both monitoring and achieving progress, then accelerated and scaled up, unleashing the full potential of ICTs for the Goals. This advancement relies on aligning better ethics-driven policies, sound regulation and enablers, multi-stakeholder alliances and ecosystems, fostering digital literacy, innovation and investments, for driving the Agenda (Sachs et al., 2016 ; WEF, 2020a ).   6 Discussion In light of the literature review and in-depth analysis undertaken, we discuss as follows, the insights gained throughout previous sections 3 to 5 . Firstly, a discussion about the research gaps of the SDGs is provided, mainly in answer to the first research question. Secondly, a preliminary envisage of the contribution of digital paradigms for tackling those gaps and advancing the UN 2030 Agenda is presented, giving response to the second research question. 6.1 Summary of the SDGs research gaps The rationale behind the Sustainable Development Goals has been introduced, uncovering the main research gaps which deserve future attention, summarized along these lines. As analysed in section 3.3 , discussions devoted to the systemic nature of the Agenda and the interlinkages amid goals and targets, have dominated recent research (i.e. Allen et al., 2019b ; Barbier and Burgues, 2017 ; Griggs et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2015 ; Nilsson et al., 2018 ; Saito et al., 2017 ; Schmidt et al., 2017 ; Stafford-Smith, 2017 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ). Despite the fast-growing body of literature on this relevant topic, the interlinkages are not fully understood nor soundly integrated within policy, particularly trade-offs (Allen et al., 2019b ; Barbier and Burges, 2019 ; Dolley et al., 2020 ; Kroll et al., 2019 ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Scherer et al., 2018 ; Von Stechow et al., 2016 ) and transboundary spill-overs (McCollum et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2019 ).  The SDGs network cannot be considered consistent as argued by Dawes (2019) . Extant studies are fragmented, context-dependent and habitually contradictory. Consensus exists about this flawed understanding, leading to an ill-defined prioritization, which might erode the holistic nature and enactment of the Agenda. Furthermore, multiple complexities (Allen et al., 2018 ; Griggs et al., 2013 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ), along with dearth of suitable tools and science-policy interfaces persist (Allen et al., 2018 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ). We evidence the need of further research this major gap, through novel science-based methodologies (Sachs et al., 2019a ; Van Soest et al., 2019 ), able to deal with complexities across contexts and scales by fusing qualitative and quantitative approaches (Karnib, 2017a,b ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ). In addition, science-policy interfaces (McCollum et al., 2018 ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ; Zimm et al., 2018 ) and transnational cooperation (Breuer et al., 2019 ; Georgeson and Malin, 2018 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Schneider at al., 2019 ; Weitz et al., 2019 ) would add value as for acknowledging interactions to inform prioritization policies. Combining this analysis with the section 5.4  outcomes, we argue that innovative technologies (Breuer et al., 2019 ; Kroll et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ) and particularly, digital capacities, might be helpful to supercharge scientific discovery and governance towards shedding light on the SDGs interlinkages. Secondly, an emerging strand of literature (see sections 3.4 and 3.5 ) denounce design shortcomings and strong imbalances of the present SDGs scheme, namely: diluted ambition (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ); extreme complexity (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ); inconsistencies (Spaiser et al., 2017 ; Swain, 2018 ) and contradictions (Crespo-Cuaresma et al., 2018 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Vasconcellos Oliveira, 2018 ); omitted or underrepresented ecological and human-centric issues (Allen et al., 2016 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Gasper et al., 2019 ; Giannetti et al., 2020 ; Gupta and Vegelin, 2016 ; Martinez-Harms et al., 2018 ; Spijkers, 2018 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; Vasconcellos Oliveira, 2018 ; Weber, 2017 ); unevenness and lack of integration amid dimensions, showing strong financial focus (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ; Lempert, 2017 ; Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ; Pogge and Sengupta, 2015 ; Scherer et al., 2018 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; Swain, 2018 ; Weber, 2017 ); absent alignment with widely recognized frames (Lempert, 2017 ; Saner et al., 2019 ); and feeble transformative narrative (Costanza et al., 2016 ; Leal-Filho et al., 2019a ). Prior studies evidence a feeble enactment approach (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018 ; Horton, 2015 ), unsolved tensions across scales and dimensions, along with grand controversies regarding the targets representativeness. These flaws should be tackled since they might erode the credibility and enactment of the Agenda (Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Leal-Filho et al., 2019a ; Saito et al., 2017 ). Thus, an open debate with divergent views about the suitability of the current Agenda scheme is evinced, which might be handled by multidisciplinary science-policy dialogue (Messerli et al., 2019 ) and novel analytical capacities (McCollum et al., 2018 ). Additionally, we observe that emerging sustainability trends, such as conscious capital (Mackey and Sisodia, 2013 ), “net-handprinting” (Kühnen et al., 2019 ), the model of 4 capitals (Ruijs et al., 2018 ) might enrich the debate, although they have been overlooked in the literature. In view of the analysis, it would be highly recommendable to critically revisit the Agenda (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Saner et al., 2019 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ) towards overcoming the unveiled caveats and balancing dimensions (Bergman et al., 2018 ), thus embedding a genuine and holistic SD. Moreover, a relevant body of literature (see section 4.1 ) is devoted to persistent implementation and governance challenges, (i.e. Bartram et al., 2018 ; Caiado et al., 2018 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Griggs et al., 2017 ; Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ; Yingchun et al., 2018 ). Most implementation hurdles are closely tied to discerning the localization (Allen et al., 2016 , 2019a bib_Allen_et_al_2019a bib_Allen_et_al_2016 ; Fukuda-Parr and Muchhala, 2020 ; Kabisch et al., 2019 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2019 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2018 ) and integration matters, together with aforementioned interlinkages. A closer look to recent studies reveals fragmented governance (Monkelbaan, 2019 ), manifold integration issues and lack of comparative studies across contexts (Allen et al., 2016 ; Dickens et al., 2019 ; Elder and Bartalini, 2019 ; Engström et al., 2019 ; Huan et al., 2019 ; Lafortune and Schmidt-Traub, 2019 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ). Such a multidisciplinary Agenda casts, yet unwell understood, complexities (Allen et al., 2018 ; Caiado et al., 2018 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ) and tensions across scales and dimensions that could lead to unsuitable prioritization (Allen et al., 2018 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ). Policy caveats persist due to missing whole-of-government approaches and sound integration of contextual issues (Messerli et al., 2019 ). Coordination mechanisms for tackling trans-boundaries issues (Amos and Lydgate, 2019 ; Schmidt et al., 2017 ) merit further development and understanding. Regardless their relevance, only few studies explore the funding gap (Barua, 2019 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Lagoarde-Segot, 2020 ). Besides, the roles of capacity-building, awareness-raising (Bowen et al., 2017 ), knowledge management (Mastrángelo et al., 2019 ; Barrantes-Briceño and Almada-Santos, 2019 ), or transformative narratives are poorly developed (Bengtsson et al., 2018 ; Kanie et al., 2019 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). Hence, these topics deserve further consideration. We observe that multi-level governance (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Martens, 2019 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ), moving beyond siloes (Allen et al., 2018 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ), while allowing cross-fertilization (Spijkers, 2016 ) and alignment (Biermann et al., 2017 ; Leal-Filho et al., 2019a ) amongst different levels of governance, disciplines and stakeholders portrays eminent opportunities for bridging hurdles. Nevertheless, little attention has been devoted to these aspects. Therefore, the need of further assessment and novel analytical tools is evidenced (Caiado et al., 2018 ; Sullivan et al., 2018 ), in onder to cope with governance uncertainties and context nuances towards science-based systemic approaches (Bartram et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2015 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2018 ), together with interfaces to inform policies (Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018 ; Schmalzbauer and Visbeck, 2016 ). Based on the uncovered gaps, we perceive an opportunity on harnessing digital capacities for addressing a paradigm shift vis-à-vis the aforesaid challenges. Furthermore, policy and financial enabling frameworks are key critical leverage points which would be recommended to further developed, guided by science, innovative and holistic approaches. Prior research (see section 4.2 ) substantiates the importance of measuring progress by monitoring and evaluating the Goals (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Lu et al., 2015 ; Persson et al., 2016 ; Reyers et al., 2017 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Yonehara et al., 2017 ).Nonetheless, huge research challenges remain regarding accountability (Bebbington and Unerman, 2018 ; Bowen et al., 2017 ; Wackernagel et al., 2017 ; Zimm et al., 2018 ), couple with missing suitable taxonomies (Xu et al., 2020 ), sound methodologies (Crespo-Cuaresma et al., 2018 ) and analytical tools. These limitations are hindering the assessment (Lior et al., 2018 ; Lu et al., 2015 ). Indeed, little attention has been paid to the conflict between accountability and integration (Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018 ), or the dynamics across scales (Xu et al., 2020 ), deserving further exploration to cope with context specificities. Moreover, a context-based assessment going beyond indicators (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ; Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Renn et al., 2020 ; Reyers et al., 2017 ; Schönherr et al., 2019 ; Schwandt et al., 2016 ) and capable of reflecting sustainability qualitative and quantitative nuances, while capturing the complexities of the SDGs (Dang and Serajuddin, 2020 ) has yet to be developed. Numerous studies focus on indicators (see section 4.3 ), revealing shortcomings and inconsistencies (Brussel et al., 2019 ), as a result of insufficient scientific foundations and dialogue. Consensus exist on the unsuitability of extant metrics (Annan-Diab and Molinari, 2017 ; Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ; Dlouhá and Pospíšilová, 2018 ; Galli et al., 2018 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Hák et al., 2016 ; Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Lehtonen et al., 2016 ; Ordaz, 2019 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Storey et al., 2017 ). Several authors claim for a critical review of present metrics moving beyond GDP-based indicators (Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Coscieme et al., 2020 ; Costanza et al., 2104 ; Hak et al., 2016; Mair et al., 2018 ; Merry, 2019 ; Rubio-Mozos et al., 2019 ; Saito et al., 2017 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Suciu and Năsulea, 2019 ). An open debate on alternative indices prevails (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018 ; Fioramonti et al., 2019 ; Lozano et al., 2018 ; Suciu and Năsulea, 2019 ). Moreover, severe limitations persist regarding data availability (Dang and Serajuddin, 2020 ; Jacob, 2017 ; Lozano et al., 2018 ; Martens, 2018 ), interoperability and analytics (Dawes, 2019 ; Hickel, 2019 ) which are hampering progress. As argued by Dang and Serajuddin (2020) , difficulties are not only due to the indicators but come from the goal formulation, which would suggest a refinement to facilitate interpretation. Hence, the analysis illustrates the need of further research efforts on the road to enhanced accountability, assessment approaches and indicators, particularly on Tier II and Tier III indicators (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ) and disregarded transboundary spill-overs (Sachs et al., 2017 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2019 ). Given the exceptional prospects that digitalization may bring in this realm (see section 5.4 ), we argue that a full exploration of the role of digital paradigms (e.g. Big Data and AI) to provide novel data sources, proxies and analytics, would add value and help to overcome limitations of Tier II and III indicators. Regarding headway on the SDGs, early-stage literature (see section 4.4 ) unveils truncated adoption, off-target and uneven progress across contexts (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ), along with fragmented knowledge. This status might be the result of the confluence of, yet poorly addressed, implementation hurdles (Bryan et al., 2019 ), policy caveats (Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ), deficient capacity and geopolitical megatrends. As argued by Sabau (2020) , scarce progress could also be the consequence of a narrow understanding about sustainability values. Other authors emphasize how overlooking transboundary issues and spill-overs are hindering advancement (Sachs et al., 2019a ; Sachs et al., 2017 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2019 ). Present reporting systems have been criticized, since they struggle with data quality, limited consistency (Wackernagel et al., 2017 ) and contradictory outcomes. These grounds suggest the requirement of better aligning the SDGs with existing frames (Biermann et al., 2017 ), developing new benchmarks and ensuring a multidisciplinary perspective (Lozano et al., 2018 ). Accelerating progress is urgently required (Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ; Sachs et al., 2019a ). These arguments suggest the need of further developing data-driven systemic and context-savvy approaches to track the dynamics of progress and nudging adoption. Thus, an opportunity for digital paradigms would emerge in this domain, where digital capacities might be highly supportive. Recent studies emphasize (see section 4.5 ) the relevance of encouraging engagement and ownership among all actors (Galli et al., 2018 ; Lucas et al., 2016 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ; Schönherr et al., 2017 ), along with worldwide collaboration to deliver the Agenda (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Frey and Sabbatino, 2018 ; Kurz, 2020 ). However, research reveals a number of drawbacks in this regard, which might be linked to the unclear roles and responsibilities (Spangenberg, 2017 ) of a non-binding Agenda (Biermann et al., 2017 ), along with persisting silo-based inertias (Bergman et al., 2018 ; Cutter, 2015 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ). Besides, the added-value and means of implementation of the SDGs for every actor (i.e. businesses, academic, civil society, public sector) have not been clearly articulated. Thus, a profound and systematic analysis is required for discerning this relevant topic. A growing body of literature focus on the role of business for pursuing the Agenda, underlining huge potential (Cordova and Celone, 2019 ; Frey and Sabbatino, 2018 ; Martinuzzi et al., 2017 ) but also severe drawbacks in terms of involvement (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ) and yet unknown add-value (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). Some studies have underscored lacking reporting tools and guides (Dahlmann et al., 2019 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Lopez, 2020 ; Topple et al., 2017 ), along with uneven alignment between corporate strategies, policy priorities and science perspectives. These shortcomings might lead to cosmetic approaches or counterproductive cherry-picking practices (Pimonenko et al., 2020 ), jeopardizing the purpose-driven holistic vision of the Agenda. Defining a common ground on the sustainability meaning is essential as argued by (Schneider et al., 2019 ). Besides, we consider that exploring novel corporate trends and purpose-driving models would enrich the debate. Regardless its relevance, the role of grassroots and civil society has been assessed only to a very limited extent (Li et al., 2018 ; Martens, 2019 ; Sénit, 2019 ). Little is known about behaviour formation or how to raise public awareness and involvement headed for the Goals (Guan et al., 2019 ; Lucci and Lucci, 2015 ; Rubio-Mozos et al., 2019 ). Further research this topic would be very useful for accelerating progress to the Goals. Furthermore, relevant factors such as cultural influence (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ), barriers to adoption, education (Kopnina, 2020 ) and capacity building remain poorly explored. The literature also underscore the great potential of the collaboration mechanisms and partnerships (Amos and Lydgate, 2019 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Florini and Pauli, 2018 ; Horan, 2019 ; Kolk et al., 2017 ; Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ) to bring together actors while breaking down siloes. Indeed, the Agenda might be considered a debate platform across stakeholders, as agued by Vildåsen (2018) . Nevertheless, collaboration issues have not been widely explored, showing complexities and governance challenges (Berrone et al., 2019 ; Beisheim and Ellersiek, 2017 ; Melo, 2018 ; Nelson, 2017 ) which merit additional research. Insights drawn from literature evidence that further research is required for a profound understanding of the reported challenges. In view of, the outstanding capacities of digital ecosystems to spur collaboration (Pappas et al., 2018 ), we argue that a novel approach based on digital capacities could enrich this research realm, by reinforcing collaboration, driving narratives for transformation and nudging behaviors towards accelerating progress. Finally, few recent studies (section 4.6 ) cover the essential role of technological innovation diffusion and knowledge transfer for accelerating transformations towards the SDGs. In this respect, current research reveals grand opportunities (Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Colglazier, 2015 ; Cordova and Celone, 2019 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ) but also uncertainties, on top of trade-offs to ecological conservation and social welfare (Aldieri et al., 2019 ). Major knowledge gaps persist in the literature (Barrantes-Briceño and Almada-Santos, 2019 ; Mastrángelo et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, technology and innovation are narrowly considered in the extant Agenda scheme as argued by Walsh et al. (2020) . A number of relevant aspects have been assessed only to a very limited extend, namely: diffusion of spill-overs (Aldieri et al., 2019 ) and knowledge flows; social impacts (Corsi et al., 2020 ); environmental concerns (Capasso et al., 2019 ); responsible research and innovation (Thapa et al., 2019 ; Van der Leeuw, 2018 ; Lehoux et al., 2018 ); complexities and systemic interactions (Labanca et al., 2020 ); inclusive approaches or grassroots innovation. Thus, the aforesaid arguments suggest that these aspects should be further researched and fully embed in policies. Most studies recognize that policy heralds as an essential mediator to overcome potential market or structural failures, impacts and externalities (Aldieri et al., 2020 ; Capasso et al., 2019 ; Sinha et al., 2020 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ) while promoting diffusion of eco-innovation and knowledge-sharing (Berawi, 2017 ). Nonetheless, given the limitations of current policy agendas, several authors claim that they should be reoriented to encourage eco-aware, responsible, inclusive technology-driven transformations towards SD (Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Vatananan-Thesenvitz et al., 2019 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ). Other authors argue that neither technology nor policy alone could facilitate transformations to sustainability (Köhler et al., 2019 ), since additional elements such as strategy, enablers, regulation, competences are required (Rogge and Reichardt, 2016 ; Edmondson et al., 2018 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ). In this realm, digital technologies emerged as essential elements for shaping knowledge (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ) and driving sustainable transformations (Pappas et al., 2018 ). However, literature pays very little attention to this opportunity. In view of the insights reported, we claim that technology and innovation, particularly on the digital realm, are key enablers for catalyzing the SDGs, provided that they are employed in an ethical and eco-friendly fashion. Further research is required to discerning present challenges headed for unlocking technology and innovation for the sake of the Agenda. In conclusion, drawing on the reported results, the authors have clustered seven main research gaps of the SDGs, which deserve further research together with novel approaches. A summary of critical issues and gaps can be found in Table 2   and Fig. 5  . Despite the challenges unveiled, the authors advocate that there exist outstanding opportunities to overcome the aforementioned caveats and accelerate progress towards realizing the Agenda, as illustrated in Fig. 6  . Some of these prospects might rely on harnessing the digital revolution, which is discussed in detail as follows.  6.2 A preliminary envisage on the role of digital paradigms to bridge the SDGs research gaps Drawing on the literature insights (see section 5 ), the second research question is answered as follows. The convergence amid digitalization and sustainability is still a nascent research field, full of opportunities but also controversies. As discussed in section 5.4 , a still incipient body of literature acknowledges the, yet untapped, prospects that digital paradigms might bring to SD (i.e. Chandy et al., 2017 ; Hilbert, 2016 ; Song et al., 2017 ) and towards pursuing the SDGs (i.e. El Massah and Mohieldin, 2020 ; Guo, 2020 ; Kostoska and Kocarev, 2019 ; Letouzé et al., 2019 ; Malhotra et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2019b ; Seele and Lock, 2017 ; Tjoa and Tjoa, 2016 ; Townsend and Coroama, 2018 ; Van der Velden, 2018a ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ; Walker et al., 2019 ; Williams et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). Indeed, a series of recent studies prove how digital paradigms, predominantly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, are being incipiently applied for measuring or advancing a relevant number of SDGs (i.e. GeSI, 2019 ; ITU, 2019b ; ITU, 2017a ; Malhotra et al., 2018 ; UN Global Pulse, 2016 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ; Walker et al., 2019 ). However, we verify that scientific literature is underdeveloped and fragmented. Most studies come from the grey literature, evidencing that little attention has been paid to the Agenda gaps and whether digital paradigms could contribute to bridge them. In light of the analysis undertaken in section 5.4 , we suggest that the contribution of digital paradigms to bridge the SDGs gaps might be threefold: (1) overcoming extant data vacuum by harnessing non-traditional data sources, while ensuring ground validation, quality and interoperability; (2) providing enhanced data-driven analytical capacities for scientific research, monitoring, assessment, decision-making and governance; (3) expanding collaboration and knowledge-sharing opportunities by building-up highly connected digital ecosystems and data partnerships. The first contribution is widely acknowledged in recent literature. ICTs, and particularly Big Data, seem crucial to compile data and distil it into knowledge (Andries et al., 2019 ; Chandy et al., 2017 ; Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Guo, 2020 ; Jacob, 2017 ; Konduri et al., 2018 ; Letouze et al., 2019 ; Malhotra et al., 2018 ; Van den Homberg and Susha, 2018 ; Williams et al., 2019 ). Therefore, prior research corroborate that the data deluge brings innovative and affordable paths to overcoming limitations of conventional SDGs metrics, monitoring and assessment process, by merging small traditional data with novel Big Data sources. Nevertheless, the literature also unveils a number of capacity constraints, methodological and market barriers (ITU, 2019b ; ITU, 2017a ; Letouze et al., 2019 ; Walker et al., 2019 ; Yayboke et al., 2017 ), together with social, privacy and ethical concerns (Campolo et al., 2018 ; Herschel and Miori, 2017 ; Lepri et al., 2017 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ) which need to be addressed. On these grounds, we claim for ensuring a context-aware, bias-free, trustworthy and ethically-driven approach able to overcome potential risks to sustainability or inclusion. Regarding the second contribution, prior studies illustrate that the genuine added-value of digitalization goes beyond data, which is worthless without interpretation, even more in the multifaceted sustainability realm. The synergic combination of digital paradigms and specifically, the fusion of Big Data Analytics with Artificial Intelligence, yields outstanding computational, analytical and predictive abilities (Letouze, 2015 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ) to unprecedentedly supercharge human capacities. Thus, digital capacities push boundaries, having enabled a novel research stream for advancing social and behavioral sciences (Bright, 2017 ; Fazekas, 2014 ; Paulus et al., 2014 ), as well as for enhancing governance of wicked sustainability issues (Lepri et al., 2017 ; Athey, 2017 ; Lowman, 2017 ). Stemming from these insights, we argue that digital capacities would be strongly useful for addressing most of the implementation and governance limitations of the SDGs, based on augmented analytical capacities and data. Nevertheless, prior research seems just a first step and further studies are needed to profoundly understand the extent of their contribution to the Agenda, as well as to tackle potential trade-offs. Concerning the third contribution, despite the relevance of the digital ecosystems for enabling collaboration, trust and knowledge brokering towards SD (Jensen and Campbell, 2019 ; Pappas et al., 2018 ; Stuermer et al., 2017 ), their role towards bridging the SDGs gaps remains poorly explored. Previous studies show that digital paradigms could facilitate connectivity (Fernández-Portillo et al., 2019 ; ITU, 2017a ), knowledge-sharing (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ) and collaboration across geographies (ITU, 2017a ; Zheng et al., 2020 ). It would bring together data, capacities and knowledge through data partnerships (Rasche et al., 2019 ; Susha, 2020 ; Yayboke et al., 2017 ). Hence, we substantiate that digital ecosystems might offer remarkable prospects for overcoming limitations of the Agenda related to lacking collaboration and knowledge management (Pappas et al., 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ), while enhancing digital literacy (Bhargava et al., 2015 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ) and enabling multidisciplinary collaborations (Bibri, 2019 ; ITU, 2017a ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). Further exploring the contribution of digital ecosystems to the SDGs would enrich the debate. The Fig. 7   as follows summarizes our preliminary approach; outlining the potential contribution of digitalization towards overcoming the previously introduced SDGs research gaps, shedding light to the second research question. Beyond prospects, a closer look to the literature reveals that digital disruption brings also a dark side. Controversies and lack of systemic perspectives remain regarding the sustainability potential of digitalization (Letouze and Pentland, 2018 ; Niño et al., 2017 ). Prior studies corroborate that digital paradigms, specifically Big Data and AI, face unsolved challenges and capacity constraints by themselves, lacking well-developed theoretical and regulatory frameworks (BDVA, 2017 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). A prominent strand of literature recognizes disruptive governance implications (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ), couple with unintended social, ethical, equity-related and environmental concerns (Wu et al., 2018 ). Thus, a holistic approach for assessing and curbing impacts is required, as argued by Tjoa and Tjoa (2016) . Indeed, intense and inconclusive debates on ethical threats, social divides (Campolo et al., 2018 ; Herschel and Miori, 2017 ; Hilbert, 2016 ; Khakurel et al., 2018 ; Lepri et al., 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ) and dystopias potentially brought by Big Data and AI have dominated recent research (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Goralski and Tan, 2020 ; Metcalf et al., 2016 ; O’Neill, 2016 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). Critical scholars claim that digitalization caveats outstrip opportunities (MacFeely, 2019 ) and actually it conflicts with sustainability (Gebhardt, 2017 ; Unwind, 2017; MacFeely, 2019 ). Moreover, some studies underline a feeble and strewn integration of technology (see section 4.6 ) and digital innovations within the Agenda frame (Novak and Tjoa, 2018 ). This raises the question of whether it would be advisable to explore the convenience of setting clusters for transformation, including one devoted to the digital transformation as suggested by Sachs et al. (2019b) , or even a novel SDG18 devoted to the governance of digitalization and the 4th industrial revolution. Thus far, we observe that discussions have been mainly focused on ethical and social concerns, while environmental sustainability has been marginally included (Khakurel et al., 2018 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ) or directly ignored in both research and policy agendas (Villani, 2018 ), prevailing a cosmetic approach to SD. We argue that a better integration and fully alignment of digitalization with all dimensions of the SDGs, including ecology issues, might be unavoidable, demanding further research and dialogue. In this regard, it is important to note, that specific complexities emerged when digital paradigms are applied to the sphere of SD. This might be explained, on one hand, because sustainability issues are wicked and featured by tensions amid dimensions. Consequently, achieving net-benefit is challenging by itself (Tura et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, sustainability and digitalization should be pursued from a systemic and ethical perspective, beyond current techno-centric approaches (Hilbert, 2016 ; Kane et al., 2019 ; Leonhard and Graf-von-Kospoth, 2017 ). A closer look to literature evidences a breach between science and practice, along with silo-based disciplines (ITU, 2019b ; ITU, 2017a ), and insufficient diffusion of innovations (see section 4.6 ). These factors might be impeding a mutual understanding and a desirable multidisciplinary approach necessary to merge sustainability and digitalization. This would suggest the need to foster dialogue and collaboration across disciplines (Bibri, 2019 ; Hofstetter et al., 2020 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; Valencia et al., 2019 ; Zheng et al., 2020 ). Despite the remarkable opportunities ahead, prior and current research reveals that progress in harnessing digital paradigms for pursuing the SDGs is very slow-paced, incremental, and highly context-dependent. Thus, this realm remains at an embryonic and fragmented stage. Furthermore, insights drawn from literature confirm that some SDGs gaps rely on structural, cultural, financial or human factors (ITU, 2017a ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; Yayboke et al., 2017 Walker et al., 2019 ) which are not susceptible to be solved by technological innovations. ICTs can bring added value, complement and augment human capacity, but another enabling elements are needed, demanding further research. Indeed, previous studies confirm that multiple non-technological and structural barriers persist in terms of policy and regulation (WEF, 2020a ), capacities (Letouzé, 2015 ), infrastructures, market incentives, trust (Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ; Hesse et al., 2018 ; Shin, 2016 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ) and security (Ahmed, 2020 ; Shin, 2016 ). Hence, a severe gap between potential and realization is evidenced (Chandy et al., 2017 ; Janowski, 2016 ). The predominant school of thought acknowledges the opportunities of digitalization towards pursuing the 2030 Agenda, while claiming for accelerating a responsible, ethics-driven, inclusive and context-aware governance, regulation and enabling frameworks (Kostoska and Kocarev, 2019 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; Townsend and Coroama, 2018 ; Van der Velden; 2018a ). Particularly relevant are aspects such as fairness, accountability and transparency, as argued by Lepri et al. (2018) . Moreover, collaboration and digital literacy (Bhargava et al., 2015 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ) across actors, disciplines (Campolo et al., 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ) and geographies would be central to ensure a sustainable scale-up of digital paradigms for the SDGs (Janowski, 2016 ; BDVA, 2017 ; ITU, 2017a ; ITU, 2019a ; Walker et al., 2019 ; WEF, 2020a ). However, we observe a lack of consensus about the notion of ethics, responsibility or “social good” (Berendt, 2019 ; Fjeld et al., 2020 ). Most aforementioned caveats are poorly developed in the scientific literature and insufficiently embedded in policy. We stand at a crossroad for the future of humanity. Devoid of a sustainable approach, the massive development of digital technologies would lead to dire unsustainable landscapes, while without digitalization the SDGs gaps might endure. Digitalization and sustainability are mutually-affective and unavoidable. Incremental improvements of technology are not sufficient to solve sustainability issues, requiring disruptive transformations, as argued by Köhler et al. (2019) . Therefore, identifying the social and environmental value of digitalization for sustainability to scale-up and mainstream this nexus would enrich the debate. Embracing an ethics-driven approach, while mitigating trade-offs and addressing contextual specificities would be highly recommended (Campolo et al., 2018 ; Data-Pop Alliance, 2017 ; EESC, 2017 ; ECOSOC, 2018 ; Fjeld et al., 2020 ; Hesse et al., 2018 ; ITU, 2019b ; Khakurel et al., 2018 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). This approach should cover also ecological concerns, so far overlooked in the research agendas. In light of the insights gained, we might conclude that extant research can only be considered a primary step towards a profound understanding of the underscored challenges and key tenets of this realm. We confirm that digitalization holds outstanding opportunities towards supporting the SDGs, but enhancements in both the Agenda scheme and the current path of digitalization might be advisable towards responsibly scaling-up and harnessing the digital revolution for “social good”. The convergence of digitalization and the SDGs, unfolds a remarkable space for further multidisciplinary research, policy development, dialogue and collaboration amid key actors.  6.3 Preliminary policy implications In light of the discussion presented, the authors envision preliminary policy implications, which should be cautiously interpreted as a first-approach, requiring further exploration. As main implication, the available evidence suggests the need of revisiting and profoundly enhancing the Agenda formulation and related policies to overcome extant shortcomings (Ala-Uddin, 2019 ; Bartram et al., 2018 ; Dang and Serajuddin, 2020 ; Sabau, 2020 ; Saner et al., 2019 ). This seems particularly relevant regarding the novel and cross-cutting goals (i.e. SDG12, SDG17) along with the lagging ones, related to inequality (SDG10) and the environment (SDG13, SDG14, SDG15), since a systemic sustainable approach should keep central (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ; Spijkers, 2016 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). The SGDs should serve as narratives for transformation (Horan, 2019 ; Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ; Sachs et al., 2019b ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ), encouraging multi-level policy reforms (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Martens, 2019 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ) able to steer a new model of prosperity founded on genuine sustainability (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). This paradigm shift would attain not only the sustainability sphere, but also all synergic policies (i.e. STI frames), ensuring legitimacy (Donoher, 2017 ; Van der Hel and Biermann, 2017 ), integration and coherence (Collste et al., 2017 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Kanie and Biermann, 2017 ; Saito et al., 2017 ; Valencia et al., 2019 ). Thus, a multi-sectoral policy action would be required (Lozano et al., 2018 ) which may be enriched by subsuming novel trends. The breach between science and practitioners, as well as the silos amid disciplines, sectors and countries should be breakdown, by facilitating mutual understanding, cross-fertilization and interdisciplinary collaboration (Allen et al., 2018 ; Bergman et al., 2018 ; Cutter, 2015 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Hofstetter et al., 2020 ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ; Spijkers, 2016 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). Therefore, it would be important to encourage a strong integration, alignment, and interdisciplinary coordination amid policies and strategies in the domains of SD (Biermann et al., 2017 ; Leal-Filho et al., 2019a ; Saner et al., 2019 ), digitalization (Pappas et al., 2018 ) and innovation, towards accelerating the SDGs (Van der Velden, 2018a ; El Hilali and Manouar, 2019 ), through suitable mechanisms and incentives (Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). This reinforcement would be undertaken at all scales (Florini and Pauli, 2018 ; Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ), across countries (Allen et al., 2016 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ), and throughout the stages, based on comparative benchmarks to context-savvy evaluation (Dickens et al., 2019 ; Giles-Corti et al., 2019 ). Dedicated policy mechanisms for spurring transnational cooperation would be desirable (Breuer et al., 2019 ; Dalby et al., 2019 ; Schneider at al., 2019 ), mainly in order to mediate with tensions and transboundary issues (Amos and Lydgate, 2019 ; Schmidt et al., 2017 ), while overcoming weakened multilateralism and geopolitical risks. An additional significant implication concerns the imperative of acknowledging the SDGs interlinkages and complexities within policy frames (Breuer et al., 2019 ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ) to avoid unsuitable prioritization and cherry-picking. Having demonstrated that governance should ensure a holistic, context-savvy and whole-of-government approach (Bartram et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2015 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ), this requirement seems to rely on reinforcing the contribution of science technology and innovation (Schneider at al. 2019 ; Van der Hel and Biermann, 2017 ), to inform policy-making, by mutual dialogue, alignment and science-policy interfaces (Collste et al., 2017 ; Liu et al., 2015 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ; Zimm et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, it would be relevant to reinforce knowledge transfer and sharing (Barrantes-Briceño and Almada-Santos, 2019 ; Aldieri et al., 2020 ) and reframe STI (including digital paradigms) by responsible, inclusive, people-centric and environmentally-aware policies, along with suitable diffusion (Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ). As argued by Hilbert (2016)  the digital era elicits interplay between technology, social change and policy. Therefore, policy would encourage an ethically-driven digital governance bringing novel methodologies, data sources (Lu et al., 2015 ) and metrics (Vatananan-Thesenvitz et al., 2019 ), in parallel to direct interventions to reinforce infrastructures and capacities (Smith and Neupane, 2018 ). Another relevant aspect to be considered within policy is the combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, since this diverse approach seems to be beneficial (Karnib, 2017b ; Martens, 2019 ) towards heighten ownership and engagement amid stakeholders, specifically through collaboration (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2020 ) and efficient alliances (Caiado et al., 2018 ; Giannetti et al., 2018 ; Horan, 2019 ). Thus, this would facilitate a whole-of-society approach, unlocking the contribution of civil society and business to the goals. Paving the way towards the goals also relies on social change, raising awareness and action (Bowen et al., 2017 ), building capacity (Horan, 2019 ; Lu et al., 2015 ; Reynolds et al., 2018 ) and reinforcing education and skills (Kopnina, 2020 ), which might be better considered in policy. Particularly, it would be relevant to foster digital literacy (Bhargava et al., 2015 ; Lepri et al., 2018 ; Letouzé and Pentland, 2018 ) among policy-makers and sustainability literacy among digital practitioners in order to facilitate mutual understanding. Moreover, policy would play a crucial role in reinforcing the enabling environment and means of implementation (Bartram et al., 2018 ; Smith and Neupane, 2018 ), along with, levelling the playing field at global and local scale (Bartram et al., 2018 ). This might be materialized by crafting flexible and responsible regulatory and financial frames (Dalby et al., 2019 ; Lagoarde-Segot, 2020 ) able to handle potential threats (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Vatananan-Thesenvitz et al., 2019 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ; WEF, 2020a ). Extant enabling grounds should be enhanced, by considering innovative incentives and approaches (Caiado et al., 2018 ; WEF, 2020a ). All in all, we are witnessing a critical momentum for shaping the future of digital and SD strategies. Windows of opportunity are sighted for policy to steer a convergence amid the ecological, social and digital transformation (El Hilali and Manouar, 2019 ; Van der Velden, 2018a ), where digitalization for the SDGs is ethically mainstreamed by mitigating potential risks (Khakurel et al., 2108). The SDGs, and particularly, their ecological and social dimensions, should be strongly embedded in the heart of digital and technological policies and strategies, avoiding cosmetic or “ethic-washing” approaches (Campolo et al., 2018 ; Stocker, 2016 ). Enabling frames and novel incentives would be well received to spur environmental and social accountability of digital paradigms, as climate-friendly and net-sustainable engines.   7 Conclusion In this article we have presented a comprehensive systematic review and profound qualitative analysis of the research field and rationale behind the Sustainable Development Goals within the UN 2030 Agenda, uncovering the main research streams and gaps which deserve further attention (RQ1). Furthermore, this study sheds light about whether, how and to what extent, digital paradigms and ICTs technologies, particularly Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, could be responsibly harnessed to bridge current SDGs gaps and leapfrog sustainable development (RQ2). Ultimately, the study seeks to provide a general overview and guidance on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, unraveling policy implications and recommendations for paving the way towards the Agenda. Thus, our article represents a seminal reference which makes a contribution to further define avenues of research, and facilitate mutual understanding of the convergence of both flourishing domains. Despite the increasing interest and emerging strand of publications on the SDGs, thus far, both the 2030 Agenda and digitalization for SD remain yet untapped domains, revealing numerous open and aspects which have not been fully explored. Furthermore, little attention has been devoted to the role of digital paradigms to deal with the complexities, limitations and research gaps of the 2030 Agenda and consequent policy implications. A holistic categorization of the SDGs challenges and research gaps coupled with the exploration of the contribution of the digital paradigms to leapfrog them has not been produced elsewhere. Hence, the convergence of both realms remains unknown. Our suggested holistic approach is, to our best knowledge, the first of its kind, representing a valuable contribution for determining the current foci and potential directions of further research. Regarding the first research question (RQ1), this article provided a categorization of the SDGS research gaps, by clustering them into 7 main groups. Thereby, the findings evidence that, even when the Agenda embodies an unprecedented opportunity to reconcile progress and sustainability, manifold research and policy gaps persist, which are hindering its universal realization and holistic nature. Severe design shortcomings, along with implementation and governance hurdles have been found and interpreted, concluding that they should be acknowledged and tackled by science, policy and practice. Key findings reveal poor understanding of the complexities across scales and interlinkages among goals and targets, particularly trade-offs and spill-overs. Moreover, results disclose imbalances and tensions amid dimensions, inconsistencies, insufficient attention to contextual nuances and underrepresented elements such as human rights, ecological issues or cultural values. Based on these caveats, a major implication has been revealed: the Agenda should be revisited and profoundly enhance with a genuine holistic ambition. Additionally, strong implementation and governance hurdles persist, which might be explained as a consequence of: lack of integration, unclear responsibilities and reduced ownership amongst actors, limited alignment and localization, poor means of implementation and coordination, along with an absence of suitable enabling frames. Ten years left until the 2030 deadline, progress worldwide is far from ambitions, hindered by huge data vacuum, flawed accountability and assessment methodologies, and unsuitable indicators, silo-based prioritization, along with absence of a genuine narrative of change. Besides, the role of technology, innovation and knowledge management remains underutilized. The findings suggest that these obstacles could be tackled by additional research, direct policy interventions and science-policy dialogue, but most of them demand further innovative approaches yet untapped. Concerning the second research question (RQ2), devoted to the role of digital paradigms towards the Agenda, it is attested that the digital oomph hold both promises and threats for tackling the SDG research gaps. Indeed, digital paradigms and ICTs provide huge amounts of data, unprecedented computational power, novel collaborative ecosystems and enhanced capabilities to cope with wicked societal problems. Particularly, the fusion of Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence bring descriptive, predictive, prescriptive and discursive capacities, which add value to traditional approaches by augmenting human capacity and, overall, enhancing sustainability governance. However, the findings also evidence that digital technologies are not a silver lining and come along with yet unknown caveats, principally ethical issues, social divides and environmental concerns which can jeopardize the SDGs. In addition, the use of digital paradigms for the SDGs is still nascent, showing a fragmented and immature landscape, based on stand-alone pilots, unable to scale and mainstream as a solution to global challenges. Findings evidence that sustainability is neither properly embedded neither within the digital strategies and policies nor in the research agendas, threatening the goals. Furthermore, we found that not all the SDGs challenges can be solved by data-driven solutions or technology-enable capacities. Some hurdles are structural and should be sorted out beyond technology. Additional direct interventions enhancing the playing field are required, and should be guided by ethical and inclusive policy, providing regulatory and financial enablers. Our study reveals implications for theory, practice and policy. In light of the findings, we claim that, achieving the SDGs will require profound science-guided and technology-enabled policy reforms and strong alignment of the realms of SD, technological innovation and digitalization. This entails adopting a holistic and responsible approach, huge concerted efforts across contexts, actors and disciplines, together with technology, policy and social enablers. Appealing narratives for transformation are also needed, able to jointly engage policy makers, business, academics and the whole civil society on the way to this blueprint for humanity and the planet. In terms of limitations, firstly we underline that both sustainability and digitalization are multidimensional, highly complex, and ever-evolving realms, featured by lacking sound theory development, consensus definitions and unclear delineation of research boundaries. Both the SDGs, as well as the convergence of digitalization and sustainability, embody nascent and multidisciplinary areas of research, where the scientific literature has not being developed at the same pace as the phenomena in study. Thus, the literature presents an immature, fragmented landscape, with manifold controversies and unexplored issues. This circumstance is exacerbated in the digitalization domain, evidencing glaring gaps in the scientific literature, which have been covered by grey literature from renowned practitioners and multilateral organisations. Such a multidisciplinary domain demands to integrate all relevant perspectives to portray the phenomenon in its whole magnitude. Given the aforesaid limitations, this research should be cautiously interpreted as first-approach exploration. Besides, due to the emerging nature of the topics and the methodological approach based on manual screening and qualitative analysis, we acknowledge that some relevant studies could have been unintendedly omitted. Concerning future avenues of research, this study can be regarded as a seminal reference which illustrates the SDGs features and their nexus with digitalization. Regardless the relevance of the findings generated, this article only scratches the surface of a huge and untapped space for research. We corroborate that further exploration coupled with policy and practice development is required in every research gap and implication uncovered in this review. We confirm that this multifaceted field offers promising avenues of further multidisciplinary research in order to fully understand and leverage the convergence amid sustainability and digitalization towards tackling the SDGs challenges. We advocate that the humanity has an outstanding opportunity to ensure a responsible and inclusive digital transformation which contributes to the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda.
