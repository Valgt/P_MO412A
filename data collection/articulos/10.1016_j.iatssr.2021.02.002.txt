                  United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 11 aims to promote inclusiveness and sustainable urbanization, such that cities can become productive and accessible places for attracting talent, encouraging innovation, and creating economic growth. SDG Target 11.2 specifically mentions urban transport. Localizing SDG Target 11.2 involves city governments ensuring a public transport (PT) system that has at least two dimensions of accessibility: physical and economic. This translates to ensuring barrier-free physical access to the PT system, as well as affordable fares for using the PT system. This study presents a process for operationalizing the SDG Target 11.2 indicator for small cities in India. The study focuses on addressing physical access to quality public transport system. Presently, the commuters in these cities are dependent on intermediate PT (IPT) systems to meet their mobility needs.
                  Small cities lack a detailed database for planning PT systems. Master plans are generally prepared by planning authorities to guide the future development of cities; however, the master plan documents lack discussion and vision for future mobility, as required by SDG Target 11.2. This study concludes that the current indicator for SDG Target 11.2 requires modification to ensure SDG-compliant PT systems in small cities. An integrated IPT and PT system is required to improve access to high-quality PT systems, in line with SDG Target 11.2.

This study presents a process for operationalizing the SDG Target 11.2 indicator for small cities in India. The study focuses on addressing physical access to quality public transport system. Presently, the commuters in these cities are dependent on intermediate PT (IPT) systems to meet their mobility needs. Small cities lack a detailed database for planning PT systems. Master plans are generally prepared by planning authorities to guide the future development of cities; however, the master plan documents lack discussion and vision for future mobility, as required by SDG Target 11.2. This study concludes that the current indicator for SDG Target 11.2 requires modification to ensure SDG-compliant PT systems in small cities. An integrated IPT and PT system is required to improve access to high-quality PT systems, in line with SDG Target 11.2.

There are ten specific targets and 15 indicators [1 ] for achieving SDG Goal 11. SDG Target 11.2 specifically mentions urban transport. According to this target, “By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons”. To measure the progress towards achieving SDG Target 11.2, cities are to measure the proportion of the population within 500 m (walking time = 5 min) of a PT system. Localizing SDG Target 11.2 involves city governments ensuring a PT system that has at least two important dimensions of accessibility: physical and economic. This translates to ensuring barrier-free physical access to the PT system, as well as affordable fares for using the PT system. India is expected to double its urban population over the next two decades. At present, nearly 30% of the urban population in India lives in small cities (populations less than 500,000) [2 ]. Given the expected urbanization rates in India and the envisaged future share of urban dwellers in the total population, SDG 11 and the question of sustainable urbanization are of the utmost importance for Indian cities. A nodal agency has been appointed at a national level to implement SDGs in India; however, there are no clear guidelines on how to translate national sustainability goals to the urban level, or how to implement SDGs in cities. Herein we report a process for applying SDG Target 11.2 in small cities in India, which have many common characteristics, despite occupying different states and geographies. There is no formal PT system provided by the state in small cities; therefore, transport is a state subject. Municipal councils and corporations do not have access to the databases required for monitoring SDG Target 11.2. Therefore, SDG Target 11.2 must be modified to measure access to intermediate PT (IPT) provided by independent operators, which are loosely regulated by the city government. With increasing population and geographical boundary of a city, can we continue to rely on the IPT system to provide PT access to all, or should the city government prepare a road map for introducing a quality PT system as required by SDG 11.2? Generally, city expansion is planned and guided by a development authority, municipal council, or city corporation, based on a master plan document. Master plan documents should provide guidance for future urban growth, land use patterns, and transport infrastructure. Are the current master plans providing sufficient guidance to meet the SDG 11 targets? Herein we present results from two case studies of cities in India (Patiala and Bulandshahr), and aim to answer the following questions: What is the relevance of SDG Target 11.2 for cities dependent on IPT modes? How can we plan a PT system for achieving SDG Target 11.2 in small cities?  2 Literature review SDG indicators (in general) and SDG 11 (in particular) have been discussed and researched by many authors since the declaration of UN SDGs in 2015. Research on SDG indicators has focused on the global, national, or urban level [3–5 ]. The process of translating global indicators to national contexts is crucial for all 17 SDGs.The interplay between the global, national, and (particularly) local scale is fundamental for SDG 11. This is because the indicators for this SDG require disaggregation, and cannot merely be collected at a national level [6 ]. Several weaknesses of the SDG Target 11.2 indicator have been highlighted in recent studies [7 ]. The authors have rightly questioned its basis because it encourages an increase in the supply of motorized PT (bus or rail systems). This goes against the sustainable transport paradigm of encouraging short trips dependent on walking and cycling. The current indicator also does not recognize the role of IPT systems. IPT is denoted by different names in different parts of the developing world, varying from IPT to “para-transit.” It is operated by private operators with minimal regulatory controls. It varies from four-wheeled jeepneys to three-wheeled autorickshaws and tuk-tuks [8 ]. As a result, the Target 11.2 indicator captures only a fraction of the PT; for example, in the Indian context, small cities are completely dependent on informal systems (i.e. IPTs) [9 ]. Simon et al. [5 ] highlighted the different methods of measuring this indicator; some focus on the distance travelled, while others on the number of trips made, and the included trips also vary. This makes inter-country comparisons difficult. The authors recommended a system of parallel measurements (i.e., simultaneously using old and new methods) to guarantee reporting continuity. Brussels et al. [7 ] proposed two new indicators for local urban and planning agencies in Bogota, Colombia. The authors reviewed three different types of access measures: location-, person-, and utility-based measures. Location-based measures combine the performance of a transport system with location characteristics. On the other hand, person-based measures analyze accessibility at an individual level, considering individual constraints such as time budgets, activity requirements, and locations. Such measures require detailed individual and disaggregated data. Utility-based measures are based on analyzing the economic benefits that people derive from being able to reach spatially dispersed activities. Accessibility is viewed as the result of a set of transport choices, and is dependent on the utility of the individual's choice, relative to the utility of all choices. The authors justified the use of a location-based measure for the Target 11.2 indicator. It was developed based on a survey of city residents, with respect to the acceptable travel time for work trips. The authors concluded that “The results of the application of SDG indicator 11.2 to the reality of Bogotá shows that it does not provide meaningful and useful results. We expect this to be similar in most cities in the global South, as well as cities in the global North, but for different reasons.” The SDG Target 11.2 indicator must include informal transport, at least in cities that rely on IPTs. It should also reflect the quality of access to infrastructure, employment opportunities, and other activities. In the following section, we discuss how a PT network can be planned, as guided by the SDG Target 11.2 indicator. We estimate the expected travel modal shares when an SDG-compliant PT system is introduced.  3 Methodology The study was conducted in three phases. Phase I documented current IPT routes. The percentage of the population living within an accessible distance (acceptable walking distance) to IPT was estimated, along with the application of the SDG Target 11.2 indicator on IPT routes. Phase II included an analysis of travel demands in the city, specifically along the main arterial roads. Arterial roads were planned as the main corridors for city traffic, with at least a 30 m right-of-way. At present, these roads are served by IPT; however, in future, bus routes could be introduced. The current travel mode share of the population residing within 500 m of a potential bus route was estimated based on Census 2011 urban district data for urban populations residing in Bulandshahr and Patiala. The travel demands for 2025 and 2030 were estimated based on the expected population increase from the master plan documents of each city, assuming no change in the modal share. These were reasonable assumptions, as we looked at the modal shares of cities of similar sizes that Bulandshahr and Patiala are expected to reach in 2025 and 2030, and found similar shares of the travel modes existing in Bulandshahr and Patiala today. The future travel demand was estimated for three scenarios. Scenario 1 included the introduction of non-motorized transport (NMT)-compliant streets (better facilities for walking and cycling), Scenario 2 included an improved PT system (buses with an average headway of 10 min along the main corridors), and Scenario 3 included NMT and PT infrastructures together. Possible modal shifts were estimated in each scenario to quantify the demand for PT. Phase III estimated the bus fleet and bus size for meeting the estimated PT demand, and for obtaining a reasonable load factor in the peak hours with a policy headway of 10 min. 3.1 Current travel patterns in the cases of Bulandshahr and Patiala According to the 2011 Indian Census work trip data, approximately 34,781 trips were made in Bulandshahr, with an average trip rate of 0.15 trips per person. In Patiala, 96,288 trips were made, with an average trip rate of 0.24 trips per person. In Bulandshahr, walking was the predominant mode of transport, at approximately 50% of the total trips; however, in Patiala, motorized two-wheelers were the dominant mode of transport with 33% of the total trips, followed by bicycles with 26% (Table 1  ).  3.2 Phase I- description of intermediate/informal public transportation (IPT) routes and measuring accessibility using sustainable development goal (SDG) 11.2 target IPT routes play an important role in providing transport services to commuters in small cities. The IPT operations in Bulandshahr and Patiala are largely four-seated e-rickshaws and six-to-eight-seated auto-rickshaws (three-wheeled motorized vehicles), respectively. There are eight IPT routes in Bulandshahr, and nineteen IPT routes in Patiala. The route lengths of the IPT operations vary between the case cities; the minimum IPT route lengths in Bulandshahr and Patiala were 1.3 km and 2.4 km, respectively, and the maximum lengths were 3.7 km and 10 km, respectively. The differences in the route lengths between the case cities were owing to differences in the areas of the cities, and the connectivity of the routes to the outgrowth of the city. The SDG Target 11.2 indicator was applied to the IPT routes to estimate the proportions of the city area and population living within 500 m of IPT routes. More than 70% the areas and populations of both cities had access to IPT services. The IPT routes in Bulandshahr only provided services within the city limits. In contrast, the IPT routes for Patiala not only provided services to the city limits, but also to the outgrowths of the city. 3.2.1 Rationalizing access distance to PT/IPT The use of a PT system depends on its accessibility [10 ,11 ], regardless of age, income, or physical disability. Accessibility can be defined in terms of walking time, i.e. 5, 10, or 15 min from an origin to a bus stop, or walking distance, i.e. 200 m, 400 m, 500 m, or 800 m from an origin to a bus stop. Understanding the influence of the walking distance on PT is a key element in establishing equitable access to PT [12 ]. In 2005, Vuchic [10 ] observed that the maximum walking distance to transit service was 800 m, and that approximately 75% of potential passenger trips comprised less than a 400 m distance to a transit service (Fig. 1  ). Other studies have shown that 50% of people are willing to walk 550 m to access PT [13 ]. A peak was observed in the walking distance to bus stops between 200 m and 400 m, and a large number of walking trips were within 1 km of distance [14 ]. People accessing bus stops at less than 400 m of distance are considered active commuters, relative to people accessing bus stops at distances of more than 400 m. Similarly, for a distance of 800 m to the bus stop, people accessing less than 800 m are considered active commuters, in contrast to those with distances greater than 800 m [15 ]. Walking is the primary access mode for trips from home to PT [12 ,16 ]. Therefore, the number of riders who use a bus transit system decreases as the distance from the bus stop increases. Based on understanding the importance of accessibility to PT systems, some cities have proposed guidelines for promoting accessibility to PT systems, viz. Sydney (400 m for bus mode, 800 m for rail network), Vancouver (400 m), Helsinki (300 m), and Perth (500 m) [12 ]. In view of the above and SDG Target 11.2, an access distance of 500 m was considered for estimating the demand for the proposed routes in the case cities. We also estimated the proportions of the populations in the case cities residing within 300 m and 400 m. These populations are the most likely to use the proposed PT system, as the current trip lengths are short.   3.3 Phase II: Assessment of current and future demand Approximately 71% of the trips in Bulandshahr and 65% of the trips in Patiala were under 5 km, i.e., short-distance trips. Walking was the predominant mode in short-distance trips in Bulandshahr, at more than 40%; however, motorized two-wheelers were the predominant travel mode in Patiala, with an approximately 25% share. The shares of walking and bicycle trips were significantly higher for short distances (< 5 km) in both case cities, at 55% in Bulandshahr and 35% in Patiala, as compared to those for long-distance (> 5 km) trips, at approximately 13% in Bulandshahr and 12% in Patiala (Table 2  ). 3.3.1 Future demand estimation The population projections for Bulandshahr and Patiala were taken from government master plans. Assuming that the trip rates and modal shares of the case cities will remain unchanged in 2025 and 2030, the estimated travel mode shares and trip length distributions for Bulandshahr and Patiala for the years 2025 and 2030 are provided in Table 3  .  3.3.2 Estimated shift in travel modes Various studies have assessed the influence of improving the transport infrastructure for NMT and buses in Indian cities, and have estimated the shift of private vehicle (motorized two-wheelers and buses) trips and IPT trips to NMT and PT modes [17 ]. Based on assessing the impacts of providing SDG Target 11.2-oriented PT systems in the cities, possible modal shifts under different scenarios are summarized in Table 4  . The shifts of private vehicle and informal PT passengers to PT and travel mode shares of the two cities were estimated for different interventionscenarios: improving NMT(bicycles and pedestrians) infrastructure (Scenario 1), improving PT(bus stops and bus lanes) infrastructure (Scenario 2), and improving both NMT and PT infrastructure (Scenario 3). NMT infrastructure includes making safe pedestrian patha, introducing traffic calming at intersections and safe bicycle lanes on arterial roads. PT improvement includes bus stops with a maximum spacing of 600 m, bus lanes on arterial roads and bus operations to ensure average wait time of 10 mins. All three scenarios were tested for maximum shift scenario(MSS) which is based on 30% short trips from MTW(motorized two wheelers), three wheelers and buses shifting to bicycles. Possible shifts to bus are listed in Table 4 . Similarly all three scenarios were tested for least shift scenario(LSS) which is based on only 10% short trips MTW, 3 wheelers and buses shifting to bicycles. The impacts of improving NMT and PT infrastructure are different for the two case cities. For the 2025 mode share, the improvement from the NMT infrastructure (in increasing NMT trips) is marginally higher in Patiala (12%) than in Bulandshahr (9%). However, for the year 2030, the improvement in regards to increasing NMT trips is much higher between the case cities, at 23% in Patiala and 9% in Bulandshahr. Similarly, for the 2025 mode share, the improvement of PT infrastructure in increasing PT trips is marginally higher for Patiala (30%) than for Bulandshahr (20%). However, for the year 2030, the difference in PT trips is much higher between the case cities, as the Patiala PT trips increase to 50%, compared to the unchanged 20% of Bulandshahr PT trips. The maximum share of shifts reflected shifts from motorized two-wheelers and informal PT to PT. However, when measuring the absolute number of trips, the maximum shifts reflect shifts from MTW and IPT to NMT (Table 5  ). In all scenarios, the shift from cars is expected to be negligible. It is also assumed that improvements in bus infrastructure do not cause a shift from NMTs to buses. This is because the existing long-distance NMT users may have monetary constraints, and hence would not be willing to shift to buses.   3.4 Phase III- development of public transport plan To assess the transport and travel patterns of a city, transport-related development projects largely rely on household travel and volume count information. This information is largely missing in small cities. In view of the limited data available, we used mode of travel data (regarding travel to the place of work) available from the 2011 Census. Table 6   summarizes the data used for planning the PT routes and fleet requirements. Route Identification: A combination of the road network (major arterial roads) and trip attractions was used as guidance for identifying PT routes. In Bulandshahr, three city bus service routes, three IPT service routes, and five mofussil (routes serving areas outside the city boundaries) service routes were used; in Patiala, eight city bus routes, two mini bus routes, 12 IPT routes, and one Mofussil Service route were identified. The identified routes provided connectivity within the city (intra-city), and between the city and surrounding villages/cities (mofussil-city and outgrowth) (Table 7  ).  3.5 Route-wise demand estimation for PT system- city bus services To estimate the demand for each route of the city bus service for both cities, the population coverages within 500 m of the routes were estimated (Table 8  ). The proportion of the work trip mode share for each route was estimated by applying the respective city work trip rate (Bulandshahr: 0.15 and Patiala: 0.24). The demand for each route of the city bus service was estimated in a mode shift of Scenario 3, i.e., improving both NMT and bus infrastructure (Table 9  ). 3.5.1 Fleet requirement The bus fleet requirement depends on the ridership demand and route length, along with operational benchmarks such as the peak hour flow, headway, load factor, average speed of the bus, terminal time, and size of the bus. The SDG Target 11.2 indicator suggests providing PT with at least 20 min of headway. However, in this study, we considered at least 10 min of headway. The average speeds of buses in Indian cities range from 15 to 20 km/h. Therefore, an average speed of 18 km/h was assumed. The peak hour flow and load factor were assumed to be 10% and 1.2, respectively. The size of the bus was determined based on the demand, and on the right-of-way available for the selected route. For the Patiala city bus services, a 44-seated bus was considered, owing to high demand and the availability of the right-of-way as compared to Bulandshahr. For the Bulandshahr city bus services, a 24-seated mini-bus was considered (Table 10  ).    4 Discussion We measured the SDG Target indicator 11.2 for the proposed PT Network in 2025 and 2030. Table 11   shows the proposed routes for formal bus services, as well as for IPT. The IPT routes were proposed along routes with low demand. Since IPT includes small vehicles (4–6 seats) and often operates at high frequency, low-demand routes can be better served by these with reasonable operational efficiency. Figs. 2 and 3    show PT and IPT routes in Bulandshahr and Patiala. In the proposed PT system, approximately 92% of Bulandshahr population and 85% of Patiala population have access to a PT route with an access distance corresponding to the SDG Target 11.2.1 indicator (500 m). Within 1 km of access distance, 100% of Bulandshahr population and 99% of Patiala population have access to a PT system. However, the accessible distance from the SDG Target 11.2.1 indicator may not be an acceptable access distance for small cities in India and developing countries, owing to the large number of short trips (> 5 km). Therefore, shorter access distances of 300 m and 400 m were considered along the proposed routes, to estimate the percentages of the populations within accessible distance to PT routes (Table 10 ). Seventy percent of the Bulandshahr population falls within 300 m of the proposed PT routes. This increased to more than 80% with an accessible distance of 400 m. In Patiala, the population with access to PT is slightly lower as compared to that of Bulandshahr, at approximately 64% and 76% for 300 m and 400 m accessible distances to PT, respectively. The total PT network comprises city bus services, mofussil services, and IPT services. The areas and populations served by these three routes overlap. Almost 99% of the population is served by the combined PT network in both cities within a 500-m access distance. The population residing beyond 500 m will be dependent on other modes of transport to access the PT network. As can be seen in Table 10 , this is a very small proportion (8% in Bulandshahr, and 13% in Patiala). Therefore, the dependence on walking as the most important feeder mode is very high in both cities. IPT services play a very important role in both cities. At an access distance of 300 m, 20% of the Bulandshahr population and 32% of the Patiala population are served by IPT. More than 70% of Bulandshahr population and 50% of Patiala population have direct access to city bus services, even with the SDG Target 11.2 indicator distance. The population with access to PT increased to more than 90% in Bulandshahr and 85% in Patiala when providing an integrated network of bus service and IPT (Table 12  ). Integration is achieved by retaining few IPT routes while introducing formal PT routes. IPT does not play a role of feeder mode, but a serving the complete route which have short trips and comparatively low demand. Coverage area defines the proportion of the area or population within the accessible distance i.e. 300 m, 400 m, 500 m and 1000 m (Table 12 ) to the IPT or Public transport system from either sides. The total physical distance covered by current IPT routes in Patiala and Bulandshahr is 92.1 km and 19.1 km respectively. The total physical distance covered by proposed IPT routes in Patiala and Bulandshahr is 41 and 7 km respectively. The coverage of proposed IPT routes is listed in Table 12 .  5 Conclusion In this study, we developed a road map for a PT system in cities where a formal PT system does not exist, and where only a weak database exists for planning a formal system. The application of SDG Target 11.2.1 indicator was extended to IPT routes, to make it relevant for small cities. The road map was developed to ensure high accessibility for all citizens, by integrating formal bus routes and routes served by IPTs. The integrated PT Network improved the SDG Target 11.2.1 indicator value from approximately 85% to 92% in Bulandshahr and from 63% to 85% in Patiala (Table 13  ). In the proposed PT system, approximately 92% of Bulandshahr population and 85% of Patiala population have access to a PT route, with an access distance of 500 m. With a 1 km access distance, these increase to 100% and 99%, respectively. Thus, the integration of IPT networks is crucial for achieving this level of accessibility. The PT ridership was estimated based on secondary data and possible travel mode shifts for three scenarios. The demand for PT increases substantially when high-quality pedestrian infrastructure is implemented along with PT routes. Overall trip lengths in cities with populations of less than 1 million remain short (average 5–7 km). Therefore, the demand for bus transport remains low. To achieve operational efficiency, small buses are required. A standard bus with 50 seats will have a low load factor and long headways. The SDG Target 11.2.1 indicator requires at least three levels of modifications to be operationalized in small cities. It needs to include IPT systems or para-transit systems when defining the PT system. An integrated bus and IPT system can provide access to a larger population. IPT routes are retained or new routes can be introduced depending on the requirement of the city corridors, Safe and secure pedestrian access to PT and IPT be provided. With high frequency of buses, more comfortable buses and safe physical access, it is possible to to induce modal shifts from motorized two wheelers to PT systems, resulting in a higher demand for integrated PT systems. This is important because otherwise, the demand for PT will remain low, and the number of motorized two-wheeler trips will increase. In small cities, a large proportion of trips are shorter than 5 km. Therefore, the access distance of 500 m from SDG 11.2 may require modification. For example, a shorter access distance of 300–400 m is more acceptable for short trips. Similarly, with a combination of dedicated bicycle lane on arterial roads, and control of motorized traffic speed on other roads a safe bicycle network can be created. This is expected to induce a small shift of short trips to bicycles from motorized two wheelers as well as from bus and IPT. Overall PT ridership will depend on both aspects. The target should be to induce change from MTW to bus. Bus trips shifting to bicycles is a desirable outcome for SDG targets.   Conflict of interest The authors have no COI to disclose.
