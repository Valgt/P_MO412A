                  Energy from waste has been in recent years the focus of many developing nations that are serious about tackling energy crisis especially within Africa. With the current global crash of crude oil prices, environmental pollution and global warming, renewable energy is beginning to gain more attention and among such energies termed renewable energy is biogas which could be generated from organic wastes especially municipal solid wastes. Wastes from landfill sites cuts across all sectors of life as a result there is need to categorise such wastes according to its origin, composition, toxicity and management. By doing the waste categorization, it will be easier to determine what proportion of landfill wastes could be used to produce energy that can be affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern for all which is the goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research focuses on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) classification and quantification and as a result this research work was able to successfully classify wastes into two broad categories namely: compacted round collected refuse and dailies non-compacted wastes. The paper was also able to conclude that compacted round collected refuse will always tend to produce higher percentage of organic waste as seen in the case study used for this research work which is 33% by percentage weight. Furthermore, biogas production and upgrading techniques which could be used for energy production as a means of realizing the SDGs goal 7 within the next 15 years was also explained.

Abstract  Energy from waste has been in recent years the focus of many developing nations that are serious about tackling energy crisis  especially within Africa. With the current global crash of crude oil prices, environmental pollution and global warming,  renewable energy is beginning to gain more attention and among such energies termed renewable energy is biogas which could  be generated from organic wastes especially municipal solid wastes. Wastes from landfill sites cuts across all sectors of life as a  result there is need to categorise such wastes according to its origin, composition, toxicity and management. By doing the waste  categorization, it will be easier to determine what proportion of landfill wastes could be used to produce energy that can be  affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern for all which is the goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This  research focuses on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) classification and quantification and as a result this research work was able to  successfully classify wastes into two broad categories namely: compacted round collected refuse and dailies non-compacted  wastes. The paper was also able to conclude that compacted round collected refuse will always tend to produce higher percentage  of organic waste as seen in the case study used for this research work which is 33% by percentage weight. Furthermore, biogas  production and upgrading techniques which could be used for energy production as a means of realizing the SDGs goal 7 within  the next 15 years was also explained.

Introduction   With the ever growing demand for energy in recent years there is an urgent need to invest in clean and  sustainable form of energy in order to ensure that the energy needed by mankind in this world is met so as to avoid  energy crisis. From time immemorial mankind has been exploring and exploiting natural given resources such as  coal, natural gas and crude oil and these resources which are generally referred to as fossil fuels are non-renewable  and sustainable. As a result, over the years fossil fuels are becoming depleted and uneconomical to exploit  especially when comparing the price of crude oil per barrel in the world market. Although, these sources of energy  has provided for the necessity of mankind in many areas and contributed so greatly to the industrialization of nations  which the world enjoys till date nevertheless, the earth has also been affected negatively by the utilization of these  resources. It is not a gain-saying that fossil fuels has been the major contributor to global warming, Greenhouse  Gases (GHGs), climate change and environmental pollution. All these poses a threat to the livelihood of mankind on  earth as a result of the use of fossil fuel which is a non-renewable source of energy. In order to eradicate and ensure  that the environment we live in does not suffer further damages from the numerous consumption of fossil fuels,  there is a need to research and invest drastically into renewable energy which is clean, environmental friendly and  sustainable.   2.  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) [1]  In year 2000, the world celebrated the end of another millennium and world leaders gathered at the United  Nations to deliberate and strategize how best to fight poverty in all ramifications so has to ensure that the new  millennium is better for all people on earth. At the gathering eight (8) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  where reached with a target of actualizing all by the year 2015. The goals are listed and thus summarized:  Goal 1 which was aimed at eradicating extreme poverty and hunger was to a large extent successful by the end of  2015 because there was a drastic decline in the number of people globally, living in extreme poverty from 1.9  billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015. Also, there was a great increase in the number of working middle class who  live on $4 per day which translates directly to a rapid fall in the number of undernourished people from 23.3 percent  in between 1990-1992 to 12.9 percent between 2014 -2016.       Goal 2 which was aimed at achieving universal primary education was also a huge success because it saw an  increase in primary school net enrolment rate shooting up from 83 per cent in 2000 to 91 per cent in 2015. It also  saw 8 percent rise in literacy rate among youth aged 15-24 years between 1990 and 2015.   Goal 3 like other goals was targeted at promoting gender equality and empowering women recorded high level  of accomplishment because many young girls were enrolled into schools and as at 2015 women makes up 41 per  cent of paid workers outside agricultural sector and have gained more ground in parliaments of the 174 participating  countries which amounts to about 90 per cent rise compare to the past 20 years.   Goal 4 was aimed at reducing child mortality by providing sound healthcare for mothers and vaccination for new  born babies and this has led to the reduction from 90 to 43 deaths per 1000 live births between 1990 and 2015.    Goal 5 like the previous was centred on health targeting improvement in maternal health. Between 1990 and 2014  there has been an increase of 39% in women that received antenatal visits in Northern Africa while in Southern Asia  and Sub-Saharan Africa maternal mortality ratio also declined by 64 and 49 per cent respectively within the year  1990 and 2013.   Goal 6 was aimed at combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other Diseases. According to the Millennium  Development Goals report of 2015, there has been a significant decline (1.4 million) in new cases of people infected  with HIV by 2014 there has been an increase in number of people receiving the antiretroviral drugs. Also, there has  been a drastic reduction in malaria outbreak in Sub-Saharan Africa as a result of insecticide mosquito nets  distribution while saving the lives of about 37 million people between 2000 and 2003 from tuberculosis as a result  of prevention, diagnosis and treatment.    Dada and Mbohwa / Materials Today: Proceedings 5 (2018) 10577Ã¢â¬â10584 10579  Goal 7 which was aimed at ensuring environmental sustainability also recorded a remarkable achievement  because 98 per cent of ozone- depleting substances have been eliminated since 1990. Also, by 2015, 91 per cent of  the global population now drinks water from an improved source while 2.1 billion people globally now have access  to improved sanitation.   Goal 8 which was the last in the MDGs focused on developing a global partnership for development. The goal  saw to the development of inter countries trade especially from developing countries to developed ones and by  2014, 79 per cent of imports from developing nations were duty free. Furthermore, internet accessibility has grown  given rise to about 3.2 billion people globally linking to global network of content and applications.   3.  Transmission from Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) into Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs)[2]  After the milestone year of 2015 for MDGs, a new strategy to ensure the sustainability of the developments  achieved from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was formulated and that led to the Sustainable  Development Goals which was expected to run for the next 15 years. The Sustainable Development Goals are  interlinked despite the fact that they are made up of 17 goals, 169 targets and 230 individual indicators. They are  itemized below:  Goal 1: End poverty in all forms everywhere  Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture  Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages  Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all  Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls  Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainability management of water and sanitation for all  Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.  Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent  work for all.  Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.  Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries.  Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.  Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.  Goal 13: Take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impacts.  Goal 14: Conserve and sustain the use of oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.  Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably mange forests, combat  desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.  Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and  build effective, accountable and inclusive institution at all levels.   Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.  4.  Energy from Waste  Energy is the power derived from the utilization of physical or chemical resources, especially to provide light and  heat or to work machines [3]. There are various forms by which energy exist such as: thermal, electrical, chemical,  nuclear, and solar amidst others. These energy forms can be converted or transformed from one form to another in  order to meet up with global energy demand there is a need to look into various sources of generating energy. There  are several ways or technology that could be applied to produce heat and electricity other than the use of fossil fuels  and with advancement in technology the human race will discover sustainable, renewable, safe, low-cost and secure  energy sources. Therefore, a combination of technologies will be required to meet the globeÃ¢â¬â¢s energy need [4].  Energy could also be produced from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfill sites which accommodates all kinds of  wastes from different origins such as domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, construction and institutional  wastes as shown in Fig 1. High quantity food and organic wastes found in landfills originating from domestic,  institutional and commercial sources have high raw methane content therefore can be use as feedstock in a biogas  plant to produce biogas for heating, cooking and electrification [5].     10580 Dada and Mbohwa / Materials Today: Proceedings 5 (2018) 10577Ã¢â¬â10584    Fig. 1. A typical municipal solid waste landfill  Food wastes could also be collected in high volume from food markets where perishable food commodities are  considered to be below standard grade for human consumption as shown in Fig 2. These food wastes collected in  skips can be sent to a biogas plant where it can serve as feedstock for production of biogas either by using anaerobic  digestion technique or mesophilic and thermophilic digestion technique of organic wastes [6].    Fig. 2. Collection of food wastes from food market  5.  Characterization and Quantification of Wastes from Landfill    In one of the landfills visited during this research, waste characterization and quantification was done in order to  have a general view about the type of waste generated within the municipality. It was observed that there are two  major categories of waste the landfill receives on daily basis namely: Compacted round collected refuse and Dailies  non-compacted wastes.  Compacted round collected refuse comprises of wastes collected from house to house, markets, streets and  institutions.  These wastes are collected and compacted in a refuse truck which offloads the wastes on landfills while  dailies non-compacted wastes are collected in polyethylene bags in pick-ups or vans and dumped on the landfill.  The quantification was done by weighing 1 ton each of both compacted round collected refuse and dailies non- compacted waste and sorting them into various categories as seen in Fig 3 and Fig 4. The organic materials which is   Dada and Mbohwa / Materials Today: Proceedings 5 (2018) 10577Ã¢â¬â10584 10581  the major potential for the production of biogas that could be used as a clean and renewable energy source was  further characterized to determine the possibility of biogas generation within a biogas plant as shown in Fig 5 and  Fig 6.

Organic waste quantification from compacted round collected refuse      Fig. 6. Organic waste quantification from dailies non-compacted waste  From Fig 3, it is observed that organic waste is the highest percentage by weight because of the sources or origins  of the waste which is market and residential areas unlike when comparing it to waste from streets, institutions and  construction sites which is the major source of waste collected as dailies as seen in Fig 4. Above all, we classified  the organic content of both compacted round collected refuse and dailies non- compacted wastes as seen in Fig 5  and Fig 6 it can be said that the largest percentage of the waste is food waste. When carefully sorted it can be a good  and reliable source for feeding an anaerobic digestion plant for biogas production.

Biogas Production and Upgrading    Biogas is a product of anaerobic degradation of organic substrates which is one of the oldest process used for the  treatment of industrial wastes and stabilization of sludge [7]. Anaerobic digestion is a collection of processes by  which microorganisms break down biodegradable materials in the absence of oxygen [8]. Biogas which is a source  of renewable energy could be produced majorly from four (4) sources namely: Sewage treatment plants, Landfills,  Organic Industrial waste streams and digestion of organic waste (Mesophilic or Thermophilic). The production of  Biogas using anaerobic digestion technique involves four (4) stages namely: (i) Hydrolysis phase where large  organic polymer chains are broken down into smaller molecules. (ii) Acidogenesis phase where bacteria ferments  the smaller molecules from the hydrolysis phase to produce ammonia (NH3), Hydrogen (H2), Carbon dioxide (CO2),  Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S), fatty acids, organic acids and low alcohols [9]. (iii) Acetogenesis phase where acetogenic  bacteria or acetogens produces acetic acid, carbon and hydrogen [10]. (iv) Methanogenesis phase which is the last  stage of producing biogas using anaerobic digestion. During this phase methane is produced from hydrogen, carbon  dioxide, acetate and intermediate products from the hydrolysis and acidogenesis phases. Production of methane at  methanogenesis phase is along two pathways as presented in reaction equation (1) and (2). The conversion of acetic  acid as seen in equation (2) being the major pathway [11].

The goal of biogas  upgrading is to obtain a high concentration of methane [12]. In order for biogas to meet up with standards for  numerous applications it must be upgraded and there are various upgrading techniques for producing biomethane  from raw biogas. Biogas upgrading can be categorized into two phases (i) Cleaning and (ii) Methane Enrichment.   By subjecting the biogas through the cleaning process, acidic gases and impurities are removed while higher  concentration of methane are obtained when Carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed from the biogas which is the  methane enrichment process. Methane enrichment can be achieved using various techniques such as: water  scrubbing, chemical scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption, membrane separation and cryogenic separation  technique. Nevertheless, the amount that each technology is able to isolate as well as its efficiency in doing so  should be considered with other factors in the choice of a technique. Also, water vapour, water soluble gases and  aerosols from biogas can be dried in the production line by cooling.      7.  Biomethane Utilization for Meeting goal 7 of the SDGs    Several pathways where biomethane (upgraded biogas) could be used have been identified and many developed  countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, Germany amongst other nations has capitalized on the opportunities this  renewable energy source provides in order to have clean, safe and a friendlier environment for the citizens.  Upgraded biogas possess identical gas quality properties as natural gas therefore it can be used as a natural gas  replacement. It can also be utilized in boilers (as an environmental friendlier source for heat and steam production)  although this option is obsolete due to the abundance of alternative sources from solid waste origin [13]. Other areas  of utilization of upgraded biogas includes heating, electricity generation, vehicle fuel and also can be distributed to  natural gas grid [14]. One of the major advantage biomethane has is the fact that it can be stored as either  compressed biomethane or liquefied biomethane. In most cases, biomethane produced is far greater than what is  needed on-site therefore proper storage helps to make it available for future use and for easy transportation to where  it could be used or further distributed.    8.   Conclusion    If proper sorting of organic waste found on landfill sites and food markets or depots can be done it can serve as  feedstock for anaerobic digestion in order to produce large quantity of biogas and biomethane for various  applications. If the organic component of the solid waste is rehabilitated into energy by anaerobic digestion, it will  decrease the adverse effect on the environment and contribute to reduction in consumption of fossil fuels while  10584 Dada and Mbohwa / Materials Today: Proceedings 5 (2018) 10577Ã¢â¬â10584  providing affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy which is the goal 7 of the sustainable development  goals.

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0005" view="all">Energy from waste has been in recent years the focus of many developing nations that are serious about tackling energy crisis especially within Africa. With the current global crash of crude oil prices, environmental pollution and global warming, renewable energy is beginning to gain more attention and among such energies termed renewable energy is biogas which could be generated from organic wastes especially municipal solid wastes. Wastes from landfill sites cuts across all sectors of life as a result there is need to categorise such wastes according to its origin, composition, toxicity and management. By doing the waste categorization, it will be easier to determine what proportion of landfill wastes could be used to produce energy that can be affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern for all which is the goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research focuses on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) classification and quantification and as a result this research work was able to successfully classify wastes into two broad categories namely: compacted round collected refuse and dailies non-compacted wastes. The paper was also able to conclude that compacted round collected refuse will always tend to produce higher percentage of organic waste as seen in the case study used for this research work which is 33% by percentage weight. Furthermore, biogas production and upgrading techniques which could be used for energy production as a means of realizing the SDGs goal 7 within the next 15 years was also explained.</ce:simple-para>
