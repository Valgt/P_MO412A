                  Prioritizing areas and targets, coordinated with development gaps, is necessary to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the face of resource limitations resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The SDG interlinkages further exacerbate the difficulty inherent in addressing these goals. However, previous studies failed to consider the indicator interlinkages in the process of aggregate performance assessments and thus cannot identify priorities based on indicator interlinkages and development gaps. This study integrated network analysis and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to convert indicator interlinkages into indicator weights and then assessed the aggregate performance of the SDGs. Subsequently, the prioritized provinces and indicators were identified at the subnational level of China based on the aggregate performance of the SDGs, SDG growth rate and indicator interlinkages. The per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2), the proportion of people living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1), and the under-five mortality rate (3.2.1) were the most contributing indicators to the aggregate performance of the SDGs, while the common challenges dealt with SDG 16, SDG 6, SDG 7 and SDG 12. Moreover, accelerating the development of western provinces would make it possible to overcome the traditional imbalance status, while resource-driven provinces should be paid special attention due to their poor aggregate performance of the SDGs and their lower growth rate. Thus, a coordinating strategy is highly recommended for allocating resources to the priority targets and finally achieving the SDGs.

The interlinkages among SDG indicators. b. The direct interaction between indicator 2.3.2 and other indicators; c. The direct interaction between indicator 3.2.1 and other indicators. Note:  Nodes present indicators, edges are correlations between any two nodes (positive in blue and negative in red), and different line widths show the size of correlations. Indicators belonging to one SDG are presented by the same color, while indicators having a higher contribution rate are labeled with a bigger size. The most important and central sustainable development indicators, with a value of a maximum k-core subgraph (k = 52), were included. The complete figure is presented in the Supplementary Fig. S1 .

Prioritizing areas and targets, coordinated with development gaps, is necessary to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the face of resource limitations resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The SDG interlinkages further exacerbate the difficulty inherent in addressing these goals. However, previous studies failed to consider the indicator interlinkages in the process of aggregate performance assessments and thus cannot identify priorities based on indicator interlinkages and development gaps. This study integrated network analysis and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to convert indicator interlinkages into indicator weights and then assessed the aggregate performance of the SDGs. Subsequently, the prioritized provinces and indicators were identified at the subnational level of China based on the aggregate performance of the SDGs, SDG growth rate and indicator interlinkages. The per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2), the proportion of people living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1), and the under-five mortality rate (3.2.1) were the most contributing indicators to the aggregate performance of the SDGs, while the common challenges dealt with SDG 16, SDG 6, SDG 7 and SDG 12. Moreover, accelerating the development of western provinces would make it possible to overcome the traditional imbalance status, while resource-driven provinces should be paid special attention due to their poor aggregate performance of the SDGs and their lower growth rate. Thus, a coordinating strategy is highly recommended for allocating resources to the priority targets and finally achieving the SDGs.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Priorities  Imbalance  Interlinkages  Development gap  China    1 Introduction With global attention diverted to dealing with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have faced unprecedented challenges. This pandemic has already caused an enormous disease burden, a shortage in the supply of health services, and increased risks to food security, and there will be long-term effects of the loss of education for millions of children [1 ,2 ]. Thus, every country has encountered resource constraints in investing in sustainable development (including expanding health care and overturning biodiversity loss and climate change). Naidoo and Fisher emphasized that two-thirds of 169 targets are not expected to be met by 2030 and that 10 % of SDGs may be affected by future pandemics [3 ]. The development gaps, coordinated with priority areas and targets, are much needed to determine the direction of resource allocation in the face of competing challenges. SDGs are an integrated framework related to national, regional and global sustainable development planning through agreements in 2015 among all 193 United Nations (UN) members that are planned to be achieved by 2030 [4 ]. SDGs map out a broad spectrum of economic, social and environmental objectives in coordination with the ecosystem, which are interdependent and interlinked [5 ,6 ]. SDGs apply to all actors and aim to integrate the dimensions of sustainable development and address the needs of the most vulnerable populations [4 ,7 ,8 ]. Since year 2015, the UN continued to publish, implement, and improve the global SDG framework, which currently includes 244 indicators corresponding to 17 goals and 169 targets reinforcing the growing importance of these indicators [9 ]. Based on these indicators, a wide range of quantitative methods (such as the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and analytic hierarchy process) have been applied to synthesize the indicators into a single number and assess the aggregate performance of the SDGs to identify the development gap. These indicator-based methods have been applied at various scales (global and regional (e.g., OECD, Europe Union, 15 countries along the “Belt and Road”), national (e.g., Australia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan), and subnational (e.g., provincial-level performance)) [5 ,8 ,10–19 ]. However, these methods failed to capture the indicator interlinkages. SDG indicators directly and indirectly interact with each other, and the association among SDG indicators could be nonlinear [20–22 ]. In the context of resource limitations, achieving the successful implementation of all SDGs requires identifying priority indicators for resource allocation [7 ,23–27 ], which will rely upon disentangling the complex interactions between the goals and their targets [12 ,28–31 ]. Greater importance should be attached to indicators with a stronger connection with other indicators. The reason is that investments in these indicators may have a spillover effect on the performance of other indicators and, in turn, on SDG achievement [5 ,12 ,32 ]. A series of methods (e.g., system analysis, the cross-impact matrix approach, principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis) have been developed to assess indicator interlinkages, but these methods have disadvantages [33 ,34 ]. PCA assumes that data are linearly separable. System analysis also has strong assumptions [35 ]. In the study by Anderson et al., SDGs 11 and 12 did not meet the criteria for model inclusion and were excluded from the system analysis [35 ]. Moreover, system analysis and the cross-impact matrix approach tend to estimate the direct association among SDG indicators based on expert judgment [33 ,34 ,36–40 ]. Compared with these methods, network analysis holds an advantage. Network analysis looks at the network of targets from the perspective of selected individual targets and quantifies the associations among targets [8 ,14 ,36 ,41–43 ]. Lusseau and Mancini [14 ] and Warchold et al. [43 ] used eigenvector centrality in network analysis to assess the interactions among SDGs, which can consider both direct and indirect as well as nonlinear indicator connections. However, studies based on indicator interlinkages have identified indicators that have a strong connection with other indicators as priorities, which might not be coordinated with SDG development gaps. Priorities that rely only on indicator interlinkages might neglect development gaps in terms of SDG aggregate performance, leading to imbalanced development [34 ]. For example, the Chinese government used to identify economic growth as priorities and blindly pursue economic growth, even at the price of environmental conditions and health. The reason is that economic growth has a strong connection with other indicators, and economic growth would drive the achievement of other goals. Indeed, economic growth greatly contributed to improvements in the synthetic national power of China. However, imbalance has been exhibited, further hindering sustainable development. Therefore, priorities cannot be decided only based on indicator interlinkages. To address these potential gaps, Feng et al., Lamichhane et al., and Allen et al. have attempted to assess SDG performance while accounting for indicator interlinkages [31 ,44 ,45 ]. However, Feng et al. and Lamichhane et al. used PCA, which holds a linear association assumption and detects only the direct associations among indicators. Allen et al. [34 ] adopted a multicriteria analysis decision framework to combine network analysis with indicator-based assessment and then assessed and prioritized SDG targets. The study focused on 22 countries in the Arab region. Nevertheless, indicator priorities may be shaped by subnational contexts, and thus, subnational SDG performance assessments accounting for direct and indirect interactions remain an important knowledge gap. For instance, in China, the 34 provinces vary greatly in terms of their population, disease patterns, socioeconomic development, ecological environment, and energy reserves [46–48 ]. These differences may lead to divergence in the shortboards and priorities for each province. Thus, subnational-scale SDG-related research should be conducted to propose context-specific strategies. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the development gap and the priority areas and targets based on a multicriteria analysis decision framework combining network analysis with TOPSIS at the subnational scale in China. The study used network analysis to assess indicator interactions. Then, the study converted indicator interlinkages into contribution rates for assessing SDG progress and the development gap with TOPSIS method. Finally, based on Allen et al., combining indicator interactions and the SDG development gap with the growth rate, priority areas and targets to the aggregate performance of SDGs were identified [34 ]. As China is the world's largest developing country and the second-largest economy, understanding SDG progress in China could contribute to advancing sustainable development at a global scale.  2 Methods 2.1 Data Collection Based on the UN’ official list of global Sustainable Development Goal indicators, 2019 Sustainable Development Report, and previous literature [4 ,9 ,17 ,49 ], 147 indicators in 2010,2012 , 2014 , 2016 , 2018    from 30 databases were selected to assess the progress of the Chinese SDG (see Supplementary Table S1  online for details). Specific principles of indicator selection have been presented in Supplementary Text S1 . It should be noted that SDG 17 (global partnerships) is likely to be a national level goal. Hence, the relationships between SDG 17 and the other SDGs have not been considered in the subnational evaluation [36 ,50 ]. To address the missing data, the grey forecasting method was conducted because this method enables the usage of fewer data to generate the missing values [51 ].  2.2 Data normalization Within these collected data, diverse units exist that are unable to make the computation directly. Thus, the following equations. (1) - (3) were used for normalizing the positive, negative, and moderate values [17 ,49 ].(1) Positive:  d i j  t +   = a i j  t  − a j min   a j max  − a j min    , d i j  t +   ∈ [ 0,1 ]      (2) Negative:  d i j  t −   = a j max  − a i j  t   a j max  − a j min    , d i j  t −   ∈ [ 0,1 ]      (3) Moderate:  d i j  t *   = { 1 −  a j q  − a i j  t   max ( a j q  − a j min  , a j max  − a j q   )    , a i j  t  < a j q     1 −  a i j  t  − a j q   max ( a j q  − a j min  , a j max  − a j q   )    , a i j  t  > a j q     1 ,  a i j  t  = a j q      }  , d i j  t *   ∈ [ 0,1 ]      Where a i j  t     is the value of indicator j  (j = 1,2,…,147) for province i  (i = 1,2,…,25) in the year t  (t = 2010,2012,2014,2016,2018); d i j  t     is the normalizing data; a j max     and a j min     present the target and baseline values of the indicator j  for all provinces from 2010 to 2018; a j q     is the target value of the original data for moderate indicators. We described the method of setting target and baseline values in Supplementary Text S2  and the summary statistics for each indicator in Supplementary Table S2 .  2.3 Network analysis to measure indicators interlinkages Network analysis was used to measure indicators interlinkages. An adjacency matrix was constructed for evaluating the correlations across different indicators under each SDG, and Spearman's correlation was assessed to acquire the direct relations among all the possible combinations for the collected indicators [16 ]. Based on the adjacency matrix, the eigenvector centrality, covering direct and indirect connections among indicators, was obtained for presenting the contribution of each indicator under the SDG network [52 ]. Eigenvector centrality takes into account not only how many neighbors an indicator has but also whether it has important neighbors [53 ]. The following equation (4)  can be employed to identify the eigenvector centrality for each indicator, which measures the direct and indirect interlinkages among indicators.(4) x k  = λ − 1   ∑ h = 1   j  m k h   e h  , k = 1,2 , . . . ,  j     where m k h      is the adjacency matrix, which is determined from Spearman's correlation between any two indicators; λ    and e h     are the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector for the m k h     . Additionally, a k-core decomposition was employed as a robust check to verify the important indicators identified by eigenvector centrality. If the indicator has larger values of k-core, these indicators were considered as the most crucial and central indicator [54 ,55 ].  2.4 TOPSIS integrates for a comprehensive assessment TOPSIS is an approach that has been proposed to address the issue of multicriteria decision-making problems; the main concept is to gather the smallest geometric distance from the positive data and the largest geometric distance from the negative data [56 ,57 ]. It has a higher capability to integrate with other methods and has no limitation in adopting the numbers of data [58 ,59 ]. Using the eigenvector centrality as weight for each indicator, TOPSIS was applied to calculate the aggregate performance of the SDGs on provincial level. The performance on SDGs takes the direct and indirect interlinkages among indicators into consideration. It can be seen that the bigger the changes in the value of indicators with a great eigenvector centrality, the greater the changes in the aggregate performances in SDGs. Thus, those with the greatest weight were recognized as the most contributing indicators to the aggregate performances of the SDGs. The TOPSIS method is presented as follows. The normalizing data were arranged into a decision-making matrix ( D )   , as shown in the following equation (5) .(5) D = [ d 11 t   d 12 t   ⋯  d 1 j  t    d 21 t   d 22 t   ⋯  d 2 j  t    ⋮  ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   d i 1  t   d i 2  t   ⋯  d i j  t     ]  , i = 1,2 ,  ⋯ , 25 ;  j = 1,2 ,  ⋯ , 147       equations (6) and (7)  below were used to calculate the positive and negative ideal solutions [57 ].(6) I t +   = ( d i 1  t +   , d i 2  t +   , ⋯ d i j  t +    )  = ( max 1 ≤ i ≤  25   d i 1  t  , max 1 ≤ i ≤  25   d i 2  t  , ⋯ max 1 ≤ i ≤  25   d i j  t   )      (7) I t −   = ( d i 1  t −   , d i 2  t −   , ⋯ d i j  t −    )  = ( min 1 ≤ i ≤  25   d i 1  t  , min 1 ≤ i ≤  25   d i 2  t  , ⋯ min 1 ≤ i ≤  25   d i j  t   )       Adopting the following equations (8) and (9)  attains the Euclidean distance from each indicator.(8) θ i t +   = ∑ k = 1   j  x k  ( d i j  t +   − d i j  t   )  2        (9) θ i t −   = ∑ k = 1   j  x k  ( d i j  t −   − d i j  t   )  2         Computing the weighted SDG performance for each province using equation (10) .(10) P i t  = θ i t −   θ i t +   + θ i t −     , P i t  ∈ [ 0,1 ]        2.5 Dashboard analysis for identification of priority provinces and indicators The priority provinces were identified based on the weighted SDG performance and their growth rate. Province with a weighted performance in 2018 and compound annual growth rate (CAGR) below than the provincial level mean value indicates the province was lagging, and thus should be given priority. CAGR for each province in the studied period was computed using the following equation (11)  [60 ].(11) δ i  = ( P i t 1   P i t 0    )  1 t 1  − t 0     − 1 =  ( P i 2018  P i 2010   )  1 9   − 1      where t1  is the year for the beginning value, t0  is the year for the ending value; P i t 1      and P i t 0      are the weighted SDG performance for the province i  in the year 2018 and 2010. Similarly, priority indicators for each province were recognized based on indicator value, growth rate and the contribution rate. A dashboard diagram is drawn to make the comparisons and realize the core problem for each province. Given a province, among the top contributing indicators, those with a greater development gap and a lower CAGR compared to the mean value of individual indicators were identified as priority indicators. In addition, despite a higher value, indicators with a negative CAGR were also recognized as priority indicators. Among the multiple priority indicators, those with a higher contribution rate should be granted a higher focus.   3 Empirical results 3.1 The most contributing indicators to the aggregate performance of the SDGs Fig. 1  , Table 1  , and Supplementary Table S3  present the eigenvector centrality and k-core values for indicators obtained from network analysis. The results using eigenvector centrality were consistent with those obtained from k-core decomposition, indicating the robustness of the estimated indicator interlinkage. The per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2), the proportion of people living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1), and the under-five mortality rate (3.2.1) were the top three contributing indicators to the aggregate performance of the SDGs. These indicators had direct interactions with multiple indicators, including those indicators with a great contribution rate, which enabled these indicators to obtain a higher influence (Fig. 1 a, Table 1 ). For example, according to Fig. 1 b, the per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2) was directly linked with 101 indicators among the 147 indicators, leading to a high degree centrality. Furthermore, the per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2) was strongly associated with a number of the top 50 contributing indicators (e.g., the proportion of people living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1), the under-five mortality rate (3.2.1), and the proportion of the population below the international poverty line (1.1.1)), which also expanded the indirect association of the per capita net income of rural residents with other indicators and increased its contribution rate (Fig. 1 b, Table 1 ). Similarly, the under-five mortality rate (3.2.1) was found to be connected to 107 indicators, thus ranking fourth with respect to its degree centrality. In addition, the connected indicators included the per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2), the proportion of people living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1-1) and the proportion of children living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1–4), which were ranked as the top five contributing indicators (Fig. 1 c, Table 1 ).  3.2 “Strong east, weak west” but “faster west, slower east” Table 2   shows the TOPSIS results, measuring the SDG performance across provinces and years. The geographic comparison is also included in Supplementary Fig. S2 . The aggregate performance increased by approximately 25.64 % (0.539–0.429/0.429), from a score of 0.429 in 2010 to 0.539 in 2018 (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In 2018, the top five provinces/municipalities were Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong, all of which are located in eastern China. Meanwhile, the bottom three provinces were Shanxi, Guizhou, and Gansu. However, the three provinces that have improved the fastest were Guizhou, Gansu, and Sichuan in western China. In contrast, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, located in eastern China, have lost momentum. In summary, the geographical pattern of the Chinese SDGs exhibited a “strong east, weak west” but “faster west, slower east” pattern. Zhang et al. suggested that the Chinese government has implemented a range of supportive policies, including infrastructure development, talent introduction, and ecological protection and restoration, which has led the western provinces to exhibit synergistic interactions among the SDGs, thereby transforming the geographic pattern [17 ].  3.3 Priority provinces Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning were characterized by their weighted performances in 2018 and growth rates below the provincial mean level. Thus, these provinces should be given priority. Hebei is adjacent to Beijing (the capital of China), but it has been few benefits from its location with respect to SDG development. In contrast, the resources of Hebei have been siphoned off to Beijing, constraining Hebei's development. Because of the stalled growth rate, Hebei Province has gradually fallen behind. The remaining four provinces resemble typical resource-dependent cities that used to play an important role in national economic development in periods of high resource consumption for rapid economic development. However, large risks and costs are required to carry out business transformation when resources are exhausted. The priority provinces based on the SDG performance and growth rate for these five years were very similar to the prior results. The only exception was Heilongjiang Province. Heilongjiang was identified as a priority province based on its SDG performance in 2018 but not over the five years. One potential explanation may be the deteriorating situation in Heilongjiang [61 ].  3.4 Priority indicators Table 3   and Supplementary Table S4  show the SDG dashboard. Judging from the indicator values and their growth rates, there were common challenges across China. These challenges dealt with SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption). These indicators exhibited either a low growth rate or performance across Chinese provinces, which are the problems confronting development. China was still in transition from focusing only on the economy to focusing on a harmonious society and economy while improving social welfare. Specific to the provinces, the SDG challenges differed by province. For resource-driven provinces, their major challenges primarily dealt with SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure). Among them, Chinese scientific papers included in the SCI (s9.1) contributed the most. This indicator was used by the 2019 Sustainable Development Report as one of the metrics of the performance of a scientific and technological system to assess the productivity of scientists and the evolution of science in China [9 ]. The results indicated that resource-driven provinces need to continuously improve the bases of the original strength of technological innovation capability to survive and develop in the era of the knowledge economy.   4 Discussion The UN has proposed 17 SDGs to address sustainability issues. Nevertheless, existing complex interlinkages among these goals exacerbate the difficulty inherent in addressing these goals. Previous studies that assessed the aggregate performance of the SDGs failed to account for the interlinkages among SDGs, and cannot capture the identification of desirable priority targets [34 ]. The problem has become more prominent at the subnational level in the context of resource limitations during COVID-19. To address this gap, this study adopted network analysis to identify the contributions of the 147 selected indicators to SDGs at the subnational level in China. Then, employing TOPSIS and visual analysis allowed a comprehensive assessment adjusting for indicator interlinkages, which identified those provinces meriting prioritization and their associated strategies for leading the adjustment of resource allocation. 4.1 Indicator interlinkages Our study revealed indicator interlinkages at the subnational level in China and identified that the top three ranked indicators include the per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2), the proportion of people living below 50% of the median income (10.2.1), and the under-five mortality rate (3.2.1) in terms of the contribution to the aggregate performance of SDGs. The results obtained in China were different from those found in other countries. Weitz et al. emphasized that effective institutions (16.6), sustainable consumption/production (12.1), and resource efficiency (8.4) were the most important goals for Sweden [40 ], and the proportion of the population below the international poverty line (1.1.1), official flows for agriculture (2.a.2) and the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (3.1.2) were confirmed to be the most important goals for South Asia in Swain and Ranganathan's study [42 ]. Previous studies have noted that there will be variations in the interactions of SDGs across regions and demographics [14 ,17 ,35 ,42 ]. The ranking of indicator contribution in China may broadly correlate with strong effects to improve social welfare based on rapid economic development. Zhang et al. also highlight the importance of the Chinese government's commitment based on the interactions among the three categories of SDGs [17 ]. Notably, Zhang et al. did not detect the interlinkages among indicators within each goal. Thus, our results regarding priorities at the indicator level could be different from those at the goal level, but they may provide a chance to design a more precise policy.  4.2 The imbalance across provinces and the prioritized provinces Although China has made great progress in pursuing the SDGs over time, substantial provincial variation is the greatest concern on the national side. The geographic position, natural terrain and social factors across provinces may cause these variations. The traditional geographical pattern of the Chinese SDGs is “strong east, weak west”, which was confirmed by Xu et al., Wang et al. and Liao et al. [49 ,50 ,62 ]. However, due to the national strategy emerging from development opportunities and resource support in terms of the Western development strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative, current SDG development has become a “faster west, slower east” phenomenon. Our results were consistent with those of Zhang et al., who found that China's central and western provinces conformed to sustainable development patterns [17 ]. Meanwhile, this study contributes to the current literature by identifying Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Jilin, and Liaoning as provinces meriting prioritization based on their lower performance and growth rate. They were mainly resource-driven provinces. Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9) in the economic transition process [63 ,64 ] were a main challenge for these provinces.  4.3 Adopting a coordinated and focused strategy to allocate resources SDG 16, SDG 6, SDG 7 and SDG 12 were the common challenges to achieving sustainable development at the national level of China and at the provincial level. These challenges, which were identified based on performance, the growth rate and indicator interlinkages were not necessarily the most contributing indicators. To address the common challenges, a coordinated strategy from the Chinese central government is required to adjust the steps and rearrange the resources of provinces. However, there were specific peculiarities and challenges identified for each province. For instance, the resource-driven provinces of Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning have encountered an unbalanced SDG development mode, and achieving SDG 9 through economic transition is a particular priority of these provinces. Thus, allocating resources to meet the major challenges has become the critical step at the provincial level for resource-driven provinces. The local government needs to adopt a focused strategy to allocate resources and address province-specific priorities through preferential policies, financial support and so on. It should be noted that the prioritization and focused strategy consists not merely of assigning a department to find the solution to these challenges alone. Particular SDGs, such as the China Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development Program (2011–2020) and the National Climate Change Program (2014–2020), have been formulated into specific tasks [65 ,66 ]. Although these specific tasks enable the rapid dissemination of SDGs, it may be difficult to reach SDGs under established resource allocations. Each related department concentrates only on the assigned tasks in terms of the single SDG without considering the interrelations among the SDGs in arranging resources efficiently and effectively [28 ]. To address this structural contradiction, the government needs to adjust the policy coordination framework to lead cross-department collaboration efficiently and effectively [24 ,30 ].   5 Contributions and limitations This study makes three significant contributions. First, the study quantified the direct and indirect interlinkages among indicators at the subnational level of China, which is helpful for understanding the association among the SDGs in a complex network. The only study to assess SDG performance at the subnational level in China was performed by Zhang et al. However, their article did not detect the interlinkages among indicators within each goal. Second, the proposed method enables us to make a comprehensive assessment by considering the direct and indirect interlinkages. Third, in terms of guidance for the SDGs, the analytical results provide a solid basis for the Chinese government to adjust the allocation of resources to achieve the SDGs by combining performance, the growth rate and the indicator contribution. On this basis, the Chinese government can enable the recognition of current SDG performance and determine how to coordinate with local governments for better SDG alignment. There were several limitations in this study. First, although 147 indicators with 125 cities from 30 databases were considered to perform a comprehensive assessment, it was still insufficient to cover all SDG considerations. Due to the shortage of goal-related data, we could not perform an exhaustive review of all 169 targets, and it was difficult to determine the gaps between reality and goals. Future studies need to cover the databases and indicators as much as possible to generate a comprehensive assessment and maintain the diversity of data for representing individual SDGs. Second, although the proposed method can discover the interlinkages among the SDGs, the directional causal relations among each of the goals still rely on further research to explore them. Third, this study concentrated on Chinese data; it may lack generalization to apply the results of this study to other countries. However, the method taking indicator interlinkages into consideration offers guidance for resource allocation that may be applied to other countries. Future studies can adopt the same method to collect different data from several countries in making comparisons.  6 Conclusion The study identified the development gap and the priority areas and targets based on a multicriteria analysis decision framework combining network analysis with the TOPSIS method at the subnational scale in China. Network analysis revealed that the per capita net income of rural residents (2.3.2) was the most contributing indicator to the aggregate performance of the SDGs. It was directly linked with 101 indicators, including other contributing indicators to the aggregate performance of the SDGs, which led the indicator to achieve a high contribution rate. Although China has made great progress in sustainable development, its geographic imbalance is striking. The benefits stemming from the Chinese government's attempt to adopt the “faster west, slower east” approach have allowed the traditional imbalance to shift, while resource-driven provinces deserve special attention due to their struggles with industrial transformation. SDG 16, SDG 6, SDG 7 and SDG 12 were the common challenges at the national level, while the challenges for resource-driven provinces were concentrated in SDG 9. To achieve the SDGs, there is an urgent need to adopt a coordinating and focused strategy to allocate resources.
