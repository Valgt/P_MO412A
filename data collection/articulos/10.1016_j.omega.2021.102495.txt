                  Convergence in productivity examines if entities in an industry get closer to the best practices or if the gap between the frontiers of the best and worst performers decreases over time. In a multi-input multi-output setting, the assessment of 
                        σ
                     - and 
                        β
                     -convergence can be measured with the use of non-parametric frontier techniques, such as data envelopment analysis. We propose an innovative approach to estimate convergence in the context of performance assessments resting on composite indicators, accounting for desirable and undesirable indicators. This methodology rests on ‘Benefit-of-the-Doubt’ models, specified with a directional distance function. It is applied to the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) in order to study their convergence in terms of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) ‘Good health and well-being’. We collected data for all years since the proposal of the SDGs, covering the period between 2016 and 2020. The results show that all WHO regions are

                     -divergent, especially because of the generalised decline of the Worst Practice Frontier (WPF), alongside an improvement at a lower rate of the Best Practice Frontier (BPF). The regional analysis also revealed 
                        
                           σ
                           ^
                        
                     -convergence in the Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region; the South-East Asia and African Regions exhibited 
                        
                           σ
                           ^
                        
                     -divergence; the Western Pacific and European Regions remained stable in terms of the performance spread regarding the BPF. At the worldwide level, we also observed an increase of the gap between the BPF and the WPF, although the performance spread around the worldwide BPF remained relatively stable.

In a multi-input multi-output setting, the assessment of σ  - and β  -convergence can be measured with the use of non-parametric frontier techniques, such as data envelopment analysis. We propose an innovative approach to estimate convergence in the context of performance assessments resting on composite indicators, accounting for desirable and undesirable indicators. This methodology rests on ‘Benefit-of-the-Doubt’ models, specified with a directional distance function. It is applied to the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) in order to study their convergence in terms of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) ‘Good health and well-being’. We collected data for all years since the proposal of the SDGs, covering the period between 2016 and 2020. The results show that all WHO regions are β ^   -divergent, especially because of the generalised decline of the Worst Practice Frontier (WPF), alongside an improvement at a lower rate of the Best Practice Frontier (BPF). The regional analysis also revealed σ ^   -convergence in the Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region; the South-East Asia and African Regions exhibited σ ^   -divergence; the Western Pacific and European Regions remained stable in terms of the performance spread regarding the BPF. At the worldwide level, we also observed an increase of the gap between the BPF and the WPF, although the performance spread around the worldwide BPF remained relatively stable.   Keywords Data envelopment analysis  Convergence  Composite indicator  Malmquist index  Sustainable development    1 Introduction The idea of convergence in economics considers the hypothesis that countries with a low per capita income (PCI) tend to “catch up” with countries with a high PCI over time [1] . Eventually, all countries’ PCIs converge, since developing countries have a faster growth rate than developed ones, due to technological replication and higher diminishing returns. There are two key notions regarding convergence in the economic growth literature: σ  -convergence and β  -convergence [2] . The former refers to the degree of dispersion in terms of productivity across countries. The latter identifies the degree of productivity growth of poor countries compared to rich ones. Traditionally, these concepts are studied using a single productivity measure (e.g., PCI) and are quantified using econometric methods. Therefore, evaluating convergence within a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) setting is a challenge that is essential to a more in-depth understanding of this theory, especially in sectors with a critical role for sustainable development. Pursuing a sustainable development agenda is a subject that has tremendous importance in the study of global welfare [3] , specifically in an age when there is an increasingly conjoint effort of countries to strive for a “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” [4] . The United Nations (UN) is paving the way for a more sustainable development via the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) programme. Undeniably, when addressing the challenges that we face, both as an integral part of the human civilisation and the planet Earth, poverty, climate change and environmental degradation, peace, justice, and health are critical dimensions. In particular, “ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages is essential to sustainable development” [5]  and is at the foundation of the UN’s SDG 3. At present, the world is making a stand against a global health crisis. COVID-19 is emphasising the suffering of millions and undermining economies worldwide. If progress was being made by the UN and the World Health Organization (WHO) towards improving the health and well-being of populations before the pandemic, additional efforts are now needed to conquer the short-, medium- and long-term setbacks brought along by this health emergency [6] . In essence, aiming one’s attention at implementing a more efficient funding of health systems, promoting better sanitation and hygiene conditions, and enhancing the access to healthcare services will lead to noteworthy progress in vital gauges, such as increases in life expectancy and decreases in child and maternal mortality. For this reason, we propose applying a state-of-the-art technique to assess the σ  - and β  -convergence of the WHO Member States regarding the thirteen targets of the UN’s SDG 3. Accordingly, the contributions of this research to the literature rest on the development of a non-parametric methodology for the evaluation of convergence applicable to performance assessments based on composite indicators (CIs). In particular, we extend the framework proposed by Horta and Camanho [7]  to the context of evaluations based on directional ‘Benefit-of-the-Doubt’ (BoD) CIs [8] , which enable assessments considering desirable and undesirable indicators. This allows the computation of convergence in σ   and β   in a CI framework considering a multi-desirable multi-undesirable output (MDMUO) setting. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to study the WHO Member States performance regarding the UN’s SDG 3, considering the years that followed its proposal in 2015, i.e., between 2016 and 2020. In particular, the so-called CIs [9]  have the power to contribute to decision-making and to inform public opinion regarding complex contexts, given their ease in aggregating, interpreting, and communicating information. Examples of widely recognised CIs include the Environmental Performance Index [10] , the Climate Change Performance Index [11] , and the Human Development Index [12] . The BoD approach developed by Cherchye et al. [13]  has been gaining traction as a popular method to generate CIs. As undesirable outputs are a reality in the natural world, the development of the directional BoD approach [8] , which extends the original BoD approach [13] , was inevitable. Examples of CI works based on the BoD and directional BoD approaches include Morais and Camanho [14] , Karagiannis and Paschalidou [15] , D’Inverno et al. [16] , Aparicio and Kapelko [17] , Oliveira et al. [18] , Rogge and Van Nijverseel [19] , Silva et al. [20] , Aparicio et al. [21] , and Pereira et al. [22] . In the end, although data envelopment analysis (DEA) is the leading performance assessment technique in the health sector [23] , the application of BoD models to health-related areas merely include hospitals [22] , hospital services [24] , nutrition [25] , and public health [26] . Fundamentally, there is a knowledge gap concerning the use of BoD CIs to study convergence, and this topic could be extremely relevant to guide sustainable development, particularly in the health sector. Indeed, worldwide assessments to support global policy-making in this field have an immense potential to contribute to a more sustainable development of nations, taking into account the impact of health policies on the well-being of populations. Besides, there is not a single study of the kind applied to the UN’s SDG 3 internationally. This article is organised along the following lines. Section 2  encompasses the literature review that justifies the knowledge gap behind this research. Section 3  lays out the proposed methodology. Section 4  outlines the case study. Section 5  exposes the findings and discusses them. Section 6  closes the paper by exposing the achievements, recommendations, and limitations of this research, as well as some ideas for future work.  2 Knowledge gap On the one hand, in line with Sala-i Martin [27] , “a group of economies are converging in the sense of σ   if the dispersion of their real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita levels tends to decrease over time”. Mathematically, this can be represented by σ t + 1   < σ t    , where σ t    is the standard deviation of the logarithm of the GDP per capita of economy i   at period t  , i.e., log ( y i , t   )   , and σ t + 1     is an analogous representation for a consecutive period. The previous characterisation has been adapted to a broader context by exploring the dispersion tendency of an output/input productivity indicator across several decision-making units (DMUs) over time [7] . This can be achieved by using an efficiency measure in a MIMO setting, whose average value can be interpreted as the spread of a given productivity indicator. Note that the relative efficiency score evaluates the distance of a given DMU to a reference frontier, representing the most productive standards observed in the other DMUs. Let us then consider n   DMUs using x i j  t  ∈ R + m     inputs to generate y r j  t  ∈ R + s     outputs in period t  , and x i j  t + 1   ∈ R + m     inputs to produce y r j  t + 1   ∈ R + s     outputs in a consecutive period t + 1   . Following Shephard [28] , the output distance function for the DMU under assessment (DMU j 0   ) is defined as shown in Expression (1) .(1) E t  ( x t  , y t  )  = min { θ : ( x t  , y t  θ  )  ∈ T t  }      The production technology T t  = { ( x t  , y t  )  : x t   are  capable  of  producing  y t  }     represents the attainable input-output values for a given production process. Furthermore, Färe et al. [29]  stated that Expression (1)  amounts to the radial efficiency measure of Farrell [30] , under constant returns to scale (CRS); hence, E t  ( x t  , y t  )  ⩽ 1   . Consequently, the average value of the efficiency measures for the sampled DMUs can be used to estimate the spread of productivity indicators. Moreover, the ratio between efficiency scores in two consecutive periods corresponds to the efficiency change E C t , t + 1      Malmquist index component [31] :(2) E t + 1   ( x t + 1   , y t + 1   )   E t  ( x t  , y t  )    = E C t , t + 1        In agreement with Horta and Camanho [7] , computing the geometric mean of Expression (2)  for the sampled DMUs yields the value of convergence in σ ^   :(3) σ ^  -convergence = ( ∏ j = 1  n  E C j t , t + 1   )  1 / n        Be mindful of our adoption of σ ^   -convergence instead of σ  -convergence henceforth to denote the fact that our measures are computed using an optimisation model to estimate distances to the frontier. Consequently, σ ^   -convergence will represent the evolution of the dispersion around the frontier, which is interpreted as follows:- σ ^  -convergence < 1   , there is divergence, i.e., on average, the DMUs of the sample departed from the best practice frontier (BPF) from period t   to t + 1   ;  - σ ^  -convergence = 1   , there is constancy, i.e., on average, the DMUs of the sample remained at an identical distance to the BPF from period t   to t + 1   ;  - σ ^  -convergence > 1   , there is convergence, i.e., on average, the DMUs of the sample come closer to the BPF from period t   to t + 1   .    In essence, the benefits from employing σ ^   -convergence rather than σ  -convergence (estimated with traditional econometric approaches) are due to the ability of the former to deal with multidimensional settings and the possibility of using non-parametric techniques like DEA for its estimation. This rationale can also be adapted to a different context regarding the investigation of the dispersion tendency of an overall performance measure, estimated for several DMUs based on BoD CI models. Here, we provide the foundations to estimate convergence resorting to frontier models applied to MDMUO CI settings. In the remainder of this paper, the CI score will be evaluated with a directional distance function (DDF), by means of a vector with positive components associated with desirable outputs and negative components associated with undesirable outputs. The directional BoD CI value is converted into an equivalent efficiency metric in ]0,1], such that higher values signal a closer proximity to the frontier. The maximum value (equal to one) signals that the DMU is located on the frontier. Hence, the average performance score of the sample represents the spread of overall performance among the sampled DMUs, such that a low average score signals the existence of large distances to the frontier, denoting a large dispersion below the frontier. Indeed, Chambers et al. [32]  proposed a DDF that allows a DMU to scale inputs and outputs simultaneously along a path that is defined according to a directional vector g  . The DDF can be seen as a generalisation of the input and output Shephard distance function specifications [28] . Considering the production technology Φ  = { ( x , b , y ) : x  are  capable  of  producing  b  and  y }   , the general form of the DDF, accounting for the existence of undesirable outputs b k j   ∈ R + l    , as proposed by Chung et al. [33] , is given by Expression (4) .(4) D →  ( x , b , y ; g b  , g y  )  = max  { β : ( x , b + β g b  , y + β g y  , )  ∈ Φ  }       Note that, in a BoD framework as proposed by Cherchye et al. [13] , the inputs are treated as a dummy variable equal to one. In this context, the directional vector g = ( g b  , g y  )    can assume a variety of configurations. The components of vector g   indicate the direction of change for the desirable outputs and undesirable outputs, respectively, reflecting alternative managerial objectives. For instance, the specification of the directional vector as g = ( − b , + y )    allows the simultaneous radial increase of desirable outputs and decrease of undesirable outputs in order to reach the frontier of the technology. Note that the vector has positive components associated with desirable outputs and negative components associated with undesirable outputs. When the components of the directional vector are equal to the values of the inputs and outputs observed in the DMU j 0   , it is possible to interpret the value of the DDF as the proportional adjustments to outputs required to reach the frontier of the production possibility set (PPS). Boussemart et al. [34]  provided an exact equivalence between DEA’s radial efficiency score and the DDF score with a directional vector g = ( − x , y )   . In this paper, we use this result to convert the CI estimated with a DDF model (involving a unitary input for all DMUs, as required by the features of BoD models) into an equivalent efficiency score in ]0,1], according to the formulation shown in Expression (5) .(5) B ( b , y )  = 1 − D →  ( x , b , y ; − b , + y )   1 + D →  ( x , b , y ; − b , + y )         In the remainder of this paper, the notion of efficiency associated with a CI setting, represented by the value of B t  ( b t  , y t  )    , should be interpreted as the distance to the best performance levels observed in the sample. The estimation of B t  ( b t  , y t  )     and B t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )     scores for all DMUs in the sample, corresponding to periods t   and t + 1   , enables the estimation of convergence, resorting to Expressions (2)  and (3) . On the other hand, “there is absolute β  -convergence if poor economies tend to grow faster than rich ones”, according to Sala-i Martin [27]  once more. Mathematically, this occurs if β > 0   , after estimating the regression γ i , t , t + 1   = α − β log ( y i , t   )  + ε  i , t     , where γ i , t , t + 1   ≡ log ( y i , t + 1   / y i , t   )     is the annualised growth rate of GDP per capita of economy i   between two consecutive periods, α   is an additional linear regression parameter, and ε  i , t     is an additive error term. The assessment of β  -convergence requires the analysis of the dynamics of DMUs located on the BPF and the worst practice frontier (WPF) between two consecutive extents of time. That process may arise because of the:- Decline of the BPF coupled with the improvement, constancy, or decline at a smaller rate of the WPF;  - Improvement at a smaller rate, constancy, or decline of the BPF coupled with the improvement of the WPF.    The process of divergence follows an analogous reasoning. Bear in mind that there is neither proof of convergence nor of divergence in β   when the distance between the BPF and the WPF stays approximately the same, indicating that they improve or decline at the same rate or remain constant [7] . Moreover, let us define the distance to the WPF, evaluated with a DDF, as shown in Expression (6) :(6) I →  ( x , b , y ; g b  , g y  )  = max  { β : ( x , b + β g b  , y + β g y  )  ∈ P m i n   }   ,      where P m i n     represents the minimum performance level discerned from the sample. Note that with a directional vector g = ( + b , − y )   , β   is the maximum proportional increase of undesirable outputs and decrease of desirable outputs needed to achieve the position on the frontier corresponding to the minimum performance level of the sample; hence, β   is always greater or equal to zero, rendering I ( x , b , y ; g b  , g y  ) ⩾ 0   . The conversion of the DDF into an efficiency measure can be done as follows:(7) W ( b , y )  = 1 + I →  ( x , b , y ; + b , − y )   1 − I →  ( x , b , y ; + b , − y )         Note that the value of W ( b , y )    will be within the range 1 , + ∞   . The distance to the WPF can be estimated for different periods, rendering the values of W t  ( y t  , b t  )     and W t + 1   ( y t + 1   , b t + 1   )    . Let us now consider the movements of the frontiers (BPF and WPF) between t   and t + 1   . These movements can be assessed for the position of DMU j   in period t   or t + 1   . In this paper, we privilege the position of the DMU in the most recent period, and, thus, the evaluation is conducted only for the output mix observed in t + 1   . The movement of the BPF can be assessed considering Expression (8) , and follows the same rationale as the assessment of the technological change component of the Malmquist index [31] .(8) T C t , t + 1   = B t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )   B t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )        A value greater than one in Expression (8)  signals that, for the output mix of DMU j   in t + 1   , the BPF moved to more productive levels between t   and t + 1   . Conversely, a value lower than one indicates lower productivity levels for the BPF in t + 1    than in t  . A similar analysis can be conducted to estimate the movement of the WPF between t   and t + 1    using Expression (9) :(9) W P C t , t + 1   = W t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )   W t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )        A value greater than one in Expression (9)  signals that, for the output mix of DMU j   in t + 1   , the WPF moved to more productive levels between t   and t + 1   . Conversely, a value lower than one indicates lower productivity levels in the frontier in t + 1    than in t  . In consonance with Horta and Camanho [7] , the evolution of the distance between the BPF and WPF can be estimated by the ratio between these two measures, as shown in (10) . However, note that in this study we propose assessing the movements between the frontiers only for the location of the DMU in the most recent period ( t + 1 )   , whereas in the approach proposed by those authors [7]  this estimation also considered the position of the DMU in the earlier period t  .(10) D B W  t , t + 1   = T C t , t + 1    W P C t , t + 1     = B t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )   B t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )    W t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )   W t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )         The value of convergence in β ^    for the sample under assessment can be determined by computing the geometric mean of Expression (10)  for the n   DMUs in the sample:(11) β ^  -convergence = ( ∏ j = 1  n  T C j t , t + 1    W P C j t , t + 1     )  1 / n       To denote the fact that our measures are computed using frontier models, we use the symbol ‘  ^    ’ to refer to β ^   -convergence hereafter. Besides, when:- β ^  -convergence < 1   , there is convergence, i.e., on average, the BPF and the WPF are closer from period t   to t + 1   ;  - β ^  -convergence = 1   , there is constancy, i.e., on average, the BPF and the WPF remained at and identical distance from period t   to t + 1   ;  - β ^  -convergence > 1   , there is divergence, i.e., on average, the BPF and the WPF are more distant from period t   to t + 1   .    At heart, the benefit of using β ^   -convergence instead of β  -convergence rests on its applicability to multidimensional settings and its ability to be decomposed into two components (A T C t , t + 1      and A W P C t , t + 1     ), viz.,(12) β ^  -convergence = ( ∏ j = 1  n  T C j t , t + 1   )  1 / n   ( ∏ j = 1  n  W P C j t , t + 1   )  1 / n    = A T C t , t + 1    A W P C t , t + 1         where A T C t , t + 1      is the average technological change and A W P C t , t + 1      is the average worst practice change, characterising the average movements of the BPF and the WPF between period t   and t + 1   , respectively. Values of A T C t , t + 1      and A W P C t , t + 1      greater than one signal performance improvements of the BPF and the WPF, respectively. Bottom line, the concepts of convergence in σ   and β   are, naturally, related. For example, by looking at the sample variance of log ( y i , t   )   , a relation between σ t    and σ t + 1     depending on β   can be deducted. Instinctively, it is clear that if the GDP per capita of two economies becomes increasingly alike over time, the reason must rely on the faster growth of the poorer economy [35] . In the study of convergence, it is also important to identify the DMUs that have moved the frontier to higher productivity levels over time. Accordingly, based on Färe et al. [36]  and Oliveira et al. [37] , the identification of the DMUs shifting the best-practice frontier over time can be achieved by resorting to specific innovation criteria. Innovative DMUs must fulfil the following conditions:- Condition 1: B t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )  = 1   , denoting that a DMU is located on the BPF in t + 1   ;  - Condition 2: B t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )  > 1   , denoting that a DMU in t + 1    is located outside the PPS in t  .    A DMU satisfying both conditions will exhibit T C t , t + 1   > 1   , denoting technological improvement of the BPF from t   to t + 1   . Note that the distance between frontiers is measured at for output mix observed in t + 1   . We also extend the innovation concept in an opposite direction, to identify DMUs that are lagging behind the others and that were responsible for the WPF’s movement to lower performance levels over time. In the remainder of this paper, we will denote the DMUs that satisfy the following conditions by laggers :- Condition 3: W t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )  = 1   , denoting that a DMU is located on the WPF in t + 1   ;  - Condition 4: W t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )  < 1   , denoting that a DMU in t + 1    is located below the WPF in t  .    These DMUs should receive special attention, as they have the worst levels of performance observed in t + 1   . Furthermore, their performance levels in t + 1    correspond to a decline from what was observed in the previous period t  .  3 Methodology In line with Horta and Camanho [7] , the distances to the BPF should be estimated assuming CRS. In a traditional MIMO setting, the distances can be estimated by the standard output-oriented DEA model of Charnes et al. [38]  and the distances to the WPF can be estimated by the inverted output-oriented DEA model of Yamada et al. [39] . However, the idiosyncrasies of the present case study demand a few changes to those models. First, taking into account the nature of the indicators corresponding to the targets of the UN’s SDG 3, we need to consider a model that, resting on a DDF formulation, accounts for both desirable and undesirable indicators. The DDF formulation avoids the modification of the undesirable indicators’ original measurement scale, because the direction of change is given by the signs of the components of the directional vector g   used in the optimisation model. Second, we need to convert standard DEA models that consider the transformation of inputs into outputs in a BoD formulation [13] , suitable for the estimation of CIs. Subsequently, the directional BoD model, expressed in the multiplier formulation, is shown in Model (13) . This formulation allows the restriction of the weights u r    and p k   , associated with the desirable and undesirable outputs, respectively. Note that v   corresponds to the weight associated with the dummy input, and y r j 0      and b k j 0      correspond to the values of the desirable and undesirable indicators observed in DMU j 0   . Additionally, when dealing with ratios, the models require the formulation of Banker et al. [40] . However, Hollingsworth and Smith [41]  state that this formulation should not be associated with variable returns-to-scale (VRS), since the use of ratios generates a loss of information regarding the DMUs’ size and it implicitly assumes a CRS technology, which is also true in the case of CIs [8] . Then, the dual (envelopment) formulation of Model (13)  is presented in Appendix A  - Model (A.1)  -, as well as an illustrative example demonstrating the computation of the distances and the application of the convergence concepts.(13) D →  =   min  − ∑ r = 1  s  u r  y r j 0    + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  b k j 0    + v         subject  to  ∑ r = 1  s  u r  g y  + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  g b  = 1           − ∑ r = 1  s  u r  y r j   + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  b k j   + v ⩾ 0 ,      j = 1 , ⋯ , n        u r  ⩾ ε  ,     r = 1 , ⋯ , s        p k  ⩾ ε  ,     k = 1 , ⋯ , l        v ⩾ 0           The magnitudes of the directional vector components specified in the empirical assessment presented in this paper are equal to the values observed for DMU j 0   , i.e., g = ( g b  , g y  )  = ( − b k j 0    , y r j 0    )    . This enables a proportional interpretation of the CI scores regarding the reduction of undesirable indicators b k j 0      and the improvement of desirable indicators y r j 0     . The mathematical infinitesimal ε    is used to ensure that all desirable and undesirable outputs included in the model are taken into account in the performance assessment. This enables to distinguish radially efficient DMUs in the sense of Farrell [30]  from truly efficient DMUs in the sense of Pareto-Koopmans [42] . Bear in mind that the value of the objective function of Model (13)  corresponds to an inefficiency estimate, such that a value of D →  = 0    indicates that DMU j 0    is located on the BPF, and D →  > 0    signals the existence of inefficiency. As discussed in the previous section, in line with Boussemart et al. [34]  and Oliveira et al. [37] , the conversion of an inefficiency measure, estimated with a directional vector g = ( − b k j 0    , y r j 0    )   , into an efficiency measure can be done by means of Expression (14) :(14) B ( b , y )  = 1 − D →   1 + D →         Model (15)  can be used to estimate the distance to the WPF in a directional CI framework. The dual (envelopment) formulation of Model (15)  is shown in Appendix A  - Model (A.2) .(15) I →  =  max  − ∑ r = 1  s  u r  y r j 0    + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  b k j 0    + v           subject  to     ∑ r = 1  s  u r  g y  + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  g b  = 1                ∑ r = 1  s  u r  y r j   − ∑ k = 1  l  p k  b k j   − v ⩾ 0 ,      j = 1 , ⋯ , n            u r  ⩾ ε  ,     r = 1 , ⋯ , s            p k  ⩾ ε  ,     k = 1 , ⋯ , l            v ⩾ 0           The objective function of Model (15)  returns a value greater than or equal to zero, where one implies that DMU j 0    is stationed on the WPF, and a value greater than one denotes the distance from that WPF. Similarly, the conversion of the CI score I →  t    to an efficiency measure W t  ( b t  , y t  )     can be achieved using Expression (16) :(16) W ( b , y )  = 1 + I →   1 − I →         Additionally, the mix-period formulations for D →  t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )     and I →  t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )     are required to the computation of β ^   -convergence; for this reason, we present the mix-period formulation for D →  t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )     in Model (17) . The adaptation of model (15)  to a mix-period formulation I →  t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )     is straightforward and is not shown.(17) D →  t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )  = min  − ∑ r = 1  s  u r  y r j 0   t + 1   + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  b k j 0   t + 1   + v      subject  to  ∑ r = 1  s  u r  g y t + 1   + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  g b t + 1   = 1        − ∑ r = 1  s  u r  y r j  t  + ∑ k = 1  l  p k  b k j  t  + v ⩾ 0 ,  j = 1 , ⋯ , n       u r  ⩾ ε  ,  r = 1 , ⋯ , s      p k  ⩾ ε  ,  k = 1 , ⋯ , l      v ⩾ 0         Afterwards, the estimation of convergence proceeds as previously mentioned, according to Expression (3)  for σ ^   -convergence, and Expression (12)  for β ^   -convergence.  4 Case study This section characterises the selected indicators in Section 4.1 , and the available DMUs in Section 4.2 . The details regarding the software used to run the optimisation models are provided in Section 4.3 . 4.1 Indicators According to the UN, the SDG 3 has thirteen targets, corresponding to nine ‘Outcome’ targets and four ‘Means of Implementation’ targets [43] , whose individual attainment can be measured by one to five indicators. These health statistics were provided by WHO’s Global Health Observatory (GHO) database at https://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/en/ , based on its annual ‘World Health Statistics’ reports issued between 2016 and 2020 (the ones that are SDG-related, unlike the previous 2005–2015 reports that concerned the Millennium Development Goals). From the initial twenty-six indicators, we did not consider:- Two indicators that were left out of the GHO database (3.3.4 and 3.5.1);  - Seven indicators that had more than 25% of missing data in at least two years between 2016 and 2020 (3.3.1, 3.3.3, 3.7.1, 3.8.1, 3.8.2, 3.a.1, and 3.b.2).    Ultimately, eleven targets and seventeen indicators remained (see Tables 1   and 2  ), four of which being desirable and the remaining thirteen being undesirable.  4.2 Sample Following the value-focused thinking approach of Keeney [44]  for the sake of a more valid decision-making, one hundred and eighty-one WHO Member States were selected as our DMUs, resulting from a process of elimination that excluded thirteen potential DMUs from the initial set based on having more than 25% of missing data in at least two years between 2016 and 2020 (Andorra, Cook Islands, Dominica, Eswatini, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, Niue, North Macedonia, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, San Marino, and Tuvalu). Furthermore, WHO’s database also categorised the aforementioned Member States into six groups known as WHO regions: African Region (comprising 46 Member States), Eastern Mediterranean Region (comprising 21 Member States), European Region (comprising 49 Member States), Region of the Americas (comprising 33 Member States), South-East Asia Region (comprising 11 Member States), and Western Pacific Region (comprising 21 Member States). Despite the fact that we compare the Member States globally in our analysis via the construction of a metafrontier considering all WHO countries in 2016 and 2020, we also explore convergence per region in Section 5 , based on the estimation of regional-specific frontiers. In the end, we considered a balanced panel data of one hundred and eighty-one WHO Member States observed according to seventeen UN SDG 3 indicators based on data from the WHO’s ‘World Health Statistics’ reports of 2016 and 2020. The key descriptive statistics of the selected indicators are presented in Table 3  . In case of data unavailability, the approach of Oliveira et al. [37]  was followed: a certain missing value was replaced by its homologous from a previous year; otherwise, the worst performance of the sample concerning that specific indicator was considered.  4.3 Application details The methodology detailed in Section 3  was implemented using MATLAB version R2020a software, alongside IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimisation Studio version 12.8 optimisation package.   5 Results and discussion As mentioned in Section 4.2 , we have analysed the σ ^   -convergence and β ^   -convergence of the WHO Member States globally and according to the six WHO regions. Indeed, as a result of the application of Model (13)  and Model (15)  and Expression (3)  and Expression (12) , respectively, we have computed the values of convergence in σ ^    and β ^    between 2016 and 2020, obtaining the aggregated results presented in Table 4  . Table 5   provides a different outlook on the same results. Recall that σ ^  -convergence > 1    indicates that the performance spread among countries is decreasing and β ^  -convergence > 1    indicates that the gap between the BPF and the WPF is increasing. Globally, the WHO Member States have increased the gap between the BPF and the WPF by improving the former, but this occured alongside the worsening of the latter (except in the Region of the Americas, that also increased the performance of the WPF). In essence, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the European Region, and the Region of the Americas were the WHO regions in which their respective Member states came closer to the BPF (σ ^  -convergence > 1   ), but in which the BPF and the WPF got farther apart from 2016 to 2020 (β ^  -convergence > 1   ). These results may find an explanation in the debate surrounding the cohesion policy of the European Region [45,46] , the regional cooperation framework between the European Region and the Eastern Mediterranean Region [47] , and the improved participatory action research interventions in terms of clinical coordination in public healthcare networks in Latin American developing countries [48] . By contrast, the African Region, the South-East Asia Region, and the Western Pacific Region exhibited σ ^  -convergence < 1    and β ^  -convergence > 1    from 2016 to 2020. This implies divergence at both levels. Indeed, Ssozi and Amlani [49]  had already demonstrated that the health expenditure of nations in Sub-Saharan Africa is focused on short-term targets (e.g., immunisation and nutrition) rather than on long-term targets (e.g., life expectancy and mortality rates), while Ward et al. [50]  had previously identified the need to improve the health of the most vulnerable groups in the societies of Asia-Pacific countries, proving that their social cohesion, inclusion, empowerment, and security still requires policy changes. Finally, a more in-depth analysis of the results is shown geographically in the figures below. Fig. 1   presents the performance change E C    of the WHO Member States from 2016 to 2020, and Figs. 2   and 3   illustrate the average technological change A T C    and the average worst practice change A W P C    of the WHO regions from 2016 to 2020, respectively. In all cases, a score with a value greater than one signals improvement in terms of the UN’s SDG 3: the E C    represents an analysis at Member State level, with E C > 1    signalling that the Member State is closer to the regional BPF in 2020 than it was in 2016; the A T C    represents an analysis at WHO region level, with an A T C > 1    indicating that the regional BPF moved to better performance levels from 2016 to 2020; the A W P C    also represents an analysis at WHO region level, with an A W P C > 1    indicating that the regional WPF moved to better performance levels from 2016 to 2020. Bear in mind that the Member States that were not part of our sample are represented in a dark grey colour. In Fig. 1 , it is possible to observe the individual efforts of the WHO Member States towards achieving the UN’s SDG 3 regarding their regional performance change from 2016 to 2020. In particular, it is clear that the majority of the Member States have an E C ⩾ 1   , with the African Region, the European Region, and the Region of the Americas having most of the Member States with an E C ∈ 1 , 2    . Additionally, one Member State exhibits an E C ∈ 2 , 3     (Haiti). Approximately 22% of the WHO Member States show an E C < 1   , being the African Region and the Western Pacific Region the most problematic regions. Moreover, by studying the components of β ^   -convergence separately, we can have a better understanding of how the frontiers of the WHO regions evolved from 2016 to 2020. On the one hand, by resorting to Fig. 2 , we can see that all regions exhibited an A T C > 1   , indicating that the performance of the regional BPFs is improving over time. The South-East Asia Region is the WHO region with the highest ATC (1.7168). This result is in line with the major technological development that the South-East Asia Region is undergoing in comparison with the remaining regions [51] , for instance. On the other hand, Fig. 3  shows that all WHO regions, apart from the Region of the Americas, have an A W P C < 1   . This means that this region was the only one that improved the WPF between 2016 and 2020. At last, following the innovation and decline conditions detailed at the end of Section 2 , we found that approximately 22% of the WHO Member States were deemed as global innovators and 7% were regarded as global laggers concerning the UN’s SDG 3 from 2016 to 2020. Table 6   displays the globally innovative and lagging WHO Member States per region for easier reading. Note that all WHO regions have at least one global innovator and one global lagger, except for the African Region (which has no global innovators). Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the Bahamas, Estonia, Jamaica, Tunisia, and the United States of America were not in the BPF in 2016 and were part of the set of global innovators from 2016 to 2020; analogously, Bulgaria, Haiti, Kiribati, and the United Republic of Tanzania were not in the WPF in 2016 and were part of the set of global laggers from 2016 to 2020.  6 Conclusion The BoD CI methodology for convergence assessments considering desirable and undesirable indicators presented in this paper was applied to singular healthcare circumstances, i.e., the convergence of the WHO Member States regarding the UN’s SDG 3. This study yielded contributions at two different levels: methodologically, the new models were proposed and successfully applied to a real-world context; empirically, the conclusions have the potential to be quite enlightening from a global health policy-making standpoint. Worldwide, our approach showed evidence of β ^   -divergence, due to an improved performance of the BPF, alongside a decline at a higher rate of WPF. Regarding σ ^   -divergence, the overall performance spread remained relatively stable between 2016 and 2020. A detailed analysis at a regional level showed that whilst all regions exhibited divergence in β ^   , only two exhibited divergence in σ ^    (African Region and South-East Asia Region). Two others showed convergence in σ ^    (Eastern Mediterranean Region and Region of the Americas), whilst the European and Western Pacific Regions remained relatively stable. Regarding the innovation and decline in terms of the UN’s SDG 3 from 2016 to 2020, all regions proved to have at least one globally innovative and one globally lagging Member State, apart from the African Region’s deficiency in developing innovative Member States. The European Region revealed the highest number of innovators (20) and the African Region showed the highest number of laggers (6). Essentially, the policy implications that can be withdrawn from these results should rely on the fact that:- Worldwide, most WHO Member States have not been able to close the gap between BPFs and WPFs between 2016 and 2020, given the decline of the WPF, although it occurred alongside an improvement at a lower rate of the BPF; this is the result of successful health and social policies and reforms targeted at the developed Member States, but, unfortunately, this was accompanied by the apparent decline of the health systems of the developing ones that may need increased national and international support towards the achievement of the UN’s SDG3 (see, e.g., Pereira et al. [52] );  - Some developing Member States have had significant progress in the same period, as is the case of those that belong to the Eastern Mediterranean Region, eventually due to the cooperation with developed Member States [47] ;  - The generalised decline of the BPF, detected both by the worldwide and regional benchmarking exercise, suggests that there is a need for improvement and, consequently, subsequent intervention in a vast number of developed Member States, especially those in the European Region. This may be explained by the higher burden that they have in guaranteeing the access to essential healthcare services in developing Member States while ensuring their own sustainability. There is a shortage of literature regarding the full advantages and disadvantages of international cooperation in the health sector [53] , so this topic deserves further research.    Regarding limitations, the incomplete GHO database prevented us from deriving more accurate conclusions, since it did not contain some of the UN’s SDG 3 indicators, and some inconsistencies in data collection from distinct years were noted. Besides, the inferential power of the BoD approach could be improved by resorting to bootstrapping techniques [54]  and the contemporary Efficiency Analysis Trees methodology [55] , with a view to obtaining confidence intervals for the performance spreads and avoid possible over-fitting issues, respectively. In the future, applying this methodology to other sectors could enable the attainment of insightful results, especially in international benchmarking studies. Finally, understanding the impact that COVID-19 had in the efforts of the WHO Member States towards attaining the UN’s SDG 3 would also be thought-provoking.

Appendix A Dual formulation of Models (13)  and (15)  Models (A.1)  and (A.2)  correspond to the dual formulation of Models (13)  and (15) , respectively. Note that, for the former, the directional vector is specified as g = ( − b k j 0    , y r j 0    )    and, for the latter, it is specified as g = ( b k j 0    , − y r j 0    )   .(A.1) D →  =   max  β j 0   + ε  ( ∑ k = 1  l  s k  + ∑ r = 1  s  s r  )          subject  to  ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  b k j   + s k  = b k j 0    + β j 0   g b  ,     k = 1 , ⋯ , l        ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  y r j   − s r  = y r j 0    + β j 0   g y  ,     r = 1 , ⋯ , s      ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  = 1         β j 0    is  free        λ j  ⩾ 0 ,    j = 1 , ⋯ , n ,        (A.2)  I →  =    min    β j 0   − ε  ( ∑ k = 1  l  s k  + ∑ r = 1  s  s r  )            subject  to    ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  b k j   − s k  = b k j 0    + β j 0   g b  ,     k = 1 , ⋯ , l           ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  y r j   + s r  = y r j 0    + β j 0   g y  ,     r = 1 , ⋯ , s            ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  = 1              β j 0    is  free              λ j  ⩾ 0 ,    j = 1 , ⋯ , n .         Additionally, the mix-period formulation for D →  t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )     is specified below in Model (A.3) .(A.3) D →  t  ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )  =   max  β j 0   + ε  ( ∑ k = 1  l  s k  + ∑ r = 1  s  s r  )          subject  to   ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  b k j  t  + s k  = b k j 0   t + 1   + β j 0   g b t + 1   ,     k = 1 , ⋯ , l      ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  y r j  t  − s r  = y r j 0   t + 1   + β j 0   g y t + 1   ,     r = 1 , ⋯ , s      ∑ j = 1  n  λ j  = 1          β j 0    is  free        λ j  ⩾ 0 ,    j = 1 , ⋯ , n ,         The formulation with the slack variables s k   ( k = 1 , . . . , l )    and s r   ( r = 1 , . . . s )    indicates the extent to which individual undesirable outputs and desirable outputs could be improved above the amount indicated by the performance score D →    in Model (A.1) , or adjusted beyond the proportional change corresponding to I →    in Model (A.2) . Clearly, at least one output (desirable or undesirable) of each DMU j 0    will have a zero slack at the optimal solution of each of these models. The information provided by the slack variables is used to ensure that all countries identified as innovators are strictly those that are located on the efficient subset of the BPF in t + 1    (with D t + 1   ( b t + 1   , y t + 1   )   →  = 0    and all slacks are equal to zero, i.e., s k  = s r  = 0 , ∀ k , r   ). If a DMU has a score D →  = 0   , with s k *  > 0    or s r *  > 0    for at least one k   or r  , then it lies on an inefficient segment of the frontier of the PPS defined by Model (A.1) . A similar rational, based on the information provided by the slack variables, is followed to identify the laggers. As in the case of the primal models, the estimation of convergence proceeds in line with Expressions (14)  and (3)  for σ ^  -convergence   , and Expressions (16)  and (12)  for β ^  -convergence   . To ease the interpretation of the BPF and the WPF computed by these models, Tables A.7   and A.8   presents the results of their application to a contrived illustrative example comprising eight DMUs, one desirable output, and one undesirable output. Table A.9   shows their convergence results. By looking at Fig. A.4  , we can see that both the BPF and the WPF improved from period t   to t + 1   , but the WPF improved at a higher rate than the BPF. In addition, the spread of the DMUs below the BPF increased. This means that σ ^  -convergence < 1    and β ^  -convergence < 1   , because the DMUs of the sample departed from the BPF and the gap between the BPF and the WPF decreased from period t   to period t + 1   . In particular, if we look at the inefficient DMU D, the directional vector in blue indicates the movement that this point should follow in order to reach the frontiers.    References [1] P.M.
