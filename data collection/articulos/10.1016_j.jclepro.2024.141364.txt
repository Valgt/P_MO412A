                  In the emerging landscape of Industry 5.0, the integration of innovative technologies such as Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) is pivotal for steering industrial processes towards sustainability and inclusivity, particularly in developing nations striving to align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study explores the transformative capabilities of CDTs in Industry 5.0, concentrating on India's quest for inclusive and sustainable industrialization in alignment with SDGs. The inclusion of the TOE-HOT framework enriches the research's analytical foundation, providing a nuanced perspective to investigate the multifaceted dynamics of technology, organization, environment, and human aspects within the sphere of industrial evolution. By employing the Best-Worst Method (BWM), Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), and MICMAC analysis, the study delves deep into the synergies between industrial strategies, technology, and sustainable development. The findings reveal the paramountcy of the Technological Dimension, emphasizing CDTs strategies like real-time optimization and data analytics, which are instrumental in dynamically adjusting manufacturing processes and fostering alignment with market demands. The research also stresses the roles of various CDTs strategies like strategic alignment, change management, job security, skill augmentation, and environmental compliance in industrial sustainability and inclusivity. The paper concludes with invaluable insights for policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers, emphasizing the necessity for a holistic, interconnected approach to fully harness the potential of CDTs in realizing the aspirations of Industry 5.0 and contributing to India's sustainable industrial advancement by 2030.

Fig. 5   Table 1 CDTs strategies for inclusive and sustainable industrialization.  Table 1     Dimensions Strategies Description References   Technological Dimension (TD) 1. Real-time Optimization (TD1) CDTs can adjust manufacturing processes in real-time based on a host of variables, such as energy use, raw material availability, and production speed, to ensure that operations are as efficient and sustainable as possible. He et al. (2021) ; Yitmen et al. (2021) ; Hu (2022) Maheshwari et al. (2023)   2. Data Analytics (TD2) CDTs have the capability to analyze market trends, thereby helping industries to avoid both overproduction and stock-outs. This aligns production with actual demand, making industries more sustainable in the long run. Rahmani et al. (2022) ; Zheng et al. (2022) ; Voipio et al. (2023)   3. IoT and Connectivity (TD3) By connecting various sensors and devices, CDTs can help monitor workplace conditions in real-time, ensuring that worker safety and well-being are prioritized, thereby contributing to inclusivity. Keane et al. (2020) ; He et al. (2021) ; Shi et al. (2022) ; Longo et al. (2023)   Organizational Dimension (OD) 4. Change Management (OD1) The insights provided by CDTs can be pivotal in training employees about the importance of sustainability and inclusion, thus helping companies to manage changes in organizational culture. Du et al. (2020) ; Lu et al. (2020) ; Yitmen et al. (2021) ; Zheng et al. (2022) ; Longo et al. (2023)   5. Strategic Alignment (OD2) CDTs can be central to a firm's strategy for achieving sustainability. For example, companies can set specific sustainability metrics that are continuously monitored by the CDT, ensuring alignment with broader sustainable development goals. Kalaboukas et al. (2023) ; Lv et al. (2023) ; Ünal et al. (2023)   6. Governance Structures (OD3) With real-time compliance tracking, CDTs can alert organizations to any breaches in environmental regulations or ethical norms, allowing for immediate corrective action. Yitmen et al. (2021) ; Zheng et al. (2022) ; Ünal et al. (2023) ; Kalaboukas et al. (2023)   Environmental Dimension (ED) 7. Emission Reduction (ED1) One of the most immediate environmental benefits that CDTs can offer is in the real-time tracking of emissions and waste by-products. By setting emission thresholds, CDTs can alert the industry when limits are exceeded, allowing for immediate corrective actions that contribute to reducing the overall environmental footprint of the industry Abburu et al. (2020) ; Leng et al. (2021) ; Hu et al. (2022) ; Kalaboukas et al. (2023)   8. Resource Conservation (ED2) CDTs can model the consumption rates of various resources like water, raw materials, and energy. Using predictive analytics, CDTs can suggest optimal use patterns that reduce unnecessary waste. For example, if a certain production line is consuming more electricity than needed, the CDT could suggest redistributing this energy to other lines or storing it for future use. He et al. (2021) ; Ma et al. (2022) ; Zheng et al. (2022) ; Rehman et al. (2023)   9. Environmental Compliance (ED3) CDTs can be programmed to be fully aware of existing environmental laws and regulations. Whenever a new law is enacted or an existing one is updated, this information can be input into the CDT. It will then continuously monitor operations to ensure that the industry is in compliance, reducing the risk of legal repercussions and helping to maintain a commitment to environmental sustainability. Leng et al. (2021) ; D'Amico et al. (2022) ; Zheng et al. (2022) Kalaboukas et al. (2023)   Human Dimension (HD) 10. Job Security and Skill Augmentation (HD1) CDTs are often misconceived as job-takers rather than job enablers. Through machine learning algorithms, CDTs can identify skill gaps within the workforce, suggesting targeted training programs. This focus on upskilling can aid in job retention and even job creation in specialized roles, thus providing assurances about job security. Shi et al. (2022) ; Maddikunta et al. (2022) ; Modoni and Sacco (2023) ; Wang et al. (2024)   11. Workplace Safety Monitoring (HD2) Utilizing sensor data and predictive analytics, CDTs can identify potential safety hazards before they become critical incidents. This pre-emptive approach allows industries to take timely corrective measures, thus creating a safer working environment. Jagatheesaperumal and Rahouti (2022) ; Modoni and Sacco (2023) ; Wang et al. (2024)   12. Employee Autonomy (HD3) By handling routine monitoring and data analytics, CDTs free up human workers to engage in more creative, complex problem-solving tasks. This not only enhances job satisfaction but also fosters a sense of autonomy and empowerment among workers. Expert     Table 2 Description of participants/experts.

Distinct from its predecessors that predominantly emphasized on automation, Industry 5.0 seeks a harmonious fusion of digital, physical, and biological domains, all underpinned by human intelligence and emotional context (Bednar and Welch, 2020 ; Ghobakhloo et al., 2022 ; Nicoletti, 2023 ). A pivotal component in this multidimensional amalgamation is the Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs). Diverging from traditional digital twins, CDTs are embedded with self-learning algorithms that adapt to dynamic conditions and forecast future scenarios, thus providing an unparalleled platform for real-time data analytics (Rehman et al., 2023 ). However, what sets them apart even further and aligns them with the human-centric ethos of Industry 5.0 is their ability to integrate human inputs, preferences, and decision-making patterns into their operational framework (Villar et al., 2023 ; Zhanbayev et al., 2023 ). This convergence of machine autonomy with human ingenuity enables CDTs to adapt proactively to varying conditions and anticipate future scenarios, revolutionizing fields such as real-time data analytics, predictive maintenance, and resource optimization (Maheshwari et al., 2023 ). In doing so, CDTs not only optimize industrial processes but also embody the ideals of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability from a human-centric perspective (Al Faruque et al., 2021 ; Zheng et al., 2022 ; Leng et al., 2022 ). This paradigmatic shift in industrial capabilities intersects with global sustainability objectives, prominently enshrined in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UNDP, 2017 ). However, the influence of CDTs in the realm of Industry 5.0, intersects significantly with several Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, in the realm of healthcare, under SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), CDTs offer groundbreaking prospects for personalized patient care and disease management through advanced data analytics, thereby transforming healthcare systems and outcomes. Similarly, the role of CDTs in optimizing energy use aligns them with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), as they contribute to enhancing energy efficiency and facilitating the shift towards sustainable energy sources. In urban development, under SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), CDTs have the potential to revolutionize urban planning processes. Their application can lead to the creation of smarter, more sustainable urban infrastructures, encompassing efficient traffic systems, improved waste management, and overall sustainable urban development. Furthermore, in the context of SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), CDTs emerge as key enablers of sustainable production patterns. By facilitating the efficient use of resources and minimizing industrial waste, they contribute significantly to the establishment of a circular economy. Additionally, their role in reducing industrial carbon footprints aligns CDTs with SDG 13 (Climate Action), highlighting their importance in climate change mitigation efforts (Hassani et al., 2022 ). Among these, Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) bears particular relevance to the present study, as it focuses on resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization, and innovation. Within SDG 9, Target 9.2 emerges as the specific locus of this research, articulating the need for industrial processes to extend beyond mere efficiency metrics and incorporate inclusivity and environmental sustainability. For a developing economy like India, with its diverse socio-economic landscape, the integration of SDGs—and particularly Target 9.2—into its industrialization strategy becomes a compelling imperative (Voola et al., 2022 ; Mahmood et al., 2023 ). This research explores how CDTs in the context of Industry 5.0 can be leveraged to achieve the specific tenets of SDG 9.2, thereby fostering a more sustainable and inclusive model of industrialization in India. While the potential of Industry 5.0 and Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) has been recognized globally, there is a pronounced research gap concerning their application and implications in developing economies, particularly in a diverse and rapidly evolving country like India (Dwivedi et al., 2021 ; Zheng et al., 2022 ). Addressing this gap is crucial, as the integration and impact of such advanced technologies can vary significantly in different socio-economic contexts. In developing economies, where resources are often constrained and technological infrastructure is still evolving, the adoption of CDTs poses both unique challenges and opportunities. Understanding and addressing these nuances is vital for policymakers, industry leaders, and society at large. For policymakers, this study's findings can inform the creation of supportive frameworks and policies that encourage the adoption of Industry 5.0 technologies in a manner that aligns with national development goals and addresses local challenges. For industry leaders, the insights offer guidance on how to effectively implement CDTs to enhance competitiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Lastly, for society, this research provides a perspective on how Industry 5.0 can contribute to broader socio-economic development goals, including job creation, skill development, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study aims to fill this research gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of how CDTs can facilitate inclusive and sustainable industrialization strategies in alignment with SDG 9.2. By conducting this analysis, the study seeks to answer the following research questions.R1. What are the key strategies that Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) contribute to achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization in Industry 5.0?  R2. In what order do the strategies of CDTs influence the achievement of inclusive and sustainable industrialization in the context of Industry 5.0?  R3. Which strategies among the CDTs have the highest driving power in influencing other strategies for inclusive and sustainable industrialization?    In order to fulfil the research objectives of evaluating the key strategies through which Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) influence inclusive and sustainable industrialization in the context of Industry 5.0, this study employs a combined methodology of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM). This comprehensive approach allows for an in-depth evaluation of data gathered from various stakeholders active in the fields of Industry 5.0, sustainability, and human-centric industrialization. The study concentrates its inquiry on the manufacturing sector, as this sector is crucial for economic growth, employment, and technological progress. Achieving advancements in inclusivity and sustainability within the manufacturing sector stands to have a ripple effect, substantially accelerating the broader goals of inclusive and sustainable industrialization in emerging economies such as India (Bhatia, 2023 ; Mukherjee et al., 2023 ). Given its critical role, the manufacturing sector serves as an ideal setting for investigating the potential of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) to contribute to the objectives outlined in SDG 9.2, particularly in the Indian context. Initially, an exhaustive literature review is undertaken, supplemented by expert consultations, to identify relevant CDTs strategies that influence inclusive and sustainable industrialization. These strategies are then classified according to the existing TOE-HOT framework and prioritized using the BWM, enabling a systematic appraisal of their relative importance. The application of ISM facilitates the quantification of interrelations among these strategies, thereby providing vital insights into their reciprocal influences and contributions toward attaining SDG 9.2 objectives. The remainder of the manuscript is systematically organized as follows: The second section explores the theoretical underpinnings of Industry 5.0, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and specifically, SDG 9 and Target 9.2. The third section explicates the research methodologies employed in this study, including BWM, ISM and the MICMAC analysis. The fourth section delves into the analysis of the gathered results. The fifth section provides an exhaustive discussion of the findings. The sixth section concludes the research, encapsulating its contributions and implications. The seventh and final section addresses potential limitations and suggests avenues for future research in this emerging field.  2 Literature review 2.1 Introduction to SDGs and their importance The concept of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emerged from the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; a landmark resolution adopted by all 193 United Nations member states in September 2015 (United Nations, 2015 ). This global commitment set forth an ambitious framework encompassing 17 interlinked goals, 169 targets, and over 230 indicators aimed at addressing a broad range of social, economic, and environmental challenges by the year 2030 (Chopra et al., 2022 ; Pandey and Asif, 2022 ). The criticality of SDGs lies in their capacity to serve as a unifying framework for translating the complex, interdependent challenges of the 21st century into actionable strategies (Maskrey et al., 2023 ). They offer an integrative approach to problem-solving that accommodates the intricacies of modern global challenges such as poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, peace, and justice (Hales and Birdthistle, 2022 ). Among these goals, SDG 9 focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation (Brodny and Tutak, 2023 ). Specifically, Target 9.2 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, which is essential for generating employment, driving economic growth, and hence, social development (Clement et al., 2023 ). The pursuit of SDG 9.2 is particularly compelling in the face of increasing global inequities, environmental vulnerabilities, and the advent of the Fourth and Fifth Industrial Revolutions, characterized by the fusion of physical and digital technologies (Kasinathan et al., 2022 ; Yin and Yu, 2022 ). Achieving this target necessitates radical innovation and transformative action, especially in the realm of industrial activities. It is here that our research into leveraging Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) in Industry 5.0 gains its critical relevance. By integrating advanced technologies with intelligent, data-driven decision-making, we aim to articulate and demonstrate how CDTs can substantially contribute to achieving SDG 9.2 b y harmonizing economic growth with environmental stewardship and social inclusivity in developing economies like India.  2.2 Cognitive digital twins (CDTs) The transition from Digital Twins (DTs) to Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) signifies a paradigm shift, driven by the multi-dimensional complexities of contemporary industrial landscapes. Digital Twins have served as a linchpin in Industry 4.0, facilitating tasks such as real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and data-driven analysis of physical systems (Lenz et al., 2020 ; Labucay, 2022 ). However, as industries transition into the Industry 5.0 epoch, which is hallmarked by enhanced human-machine collaboration and a deeper focus on individualized and sustainable production, the limitations of conventional DTs have become increasingly conspicuous. For instance, conventional DTs often struggle with handling the increased data complexity and personalization demands of Industry 5.0. A specific challenge arises in scenarios where real-time data from a multitude of sensors must be synthesized to make immediate, context-sensitive decisions (Eirinakis et al., 2020 ). Traditional DTs, primarily designed for static or less dynamic environments, lack the capability to autonomously learn from and adapt to such rapidly changing conditions (Liu et al., 2021 ). For example, in a highly variable manufacturing process, conventional DTs might not effectively predict equipment failure or optimize resource use when production variables frequently change. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios requiring bespoke production configurations to meet unique customer demands, where DTs may fail to adequately adjust to new specifications or integrate customer feedback in real-time. The inability of conventional DTs to dynamically learn and evolve thus hinders their effectiveness in the more agile and personalized environment of Industry 5.0. It was against this backdrop that the concept of ‘Cognitive Digital Twins' emerged, first introduced by Ahmed El Adl in 2016. Adl defined CDTs as “a digital representation encompassing intelligent capabilities that span across all lifecycle phases of its physical counterpart”  (Adl, 2016 ). Unlike DTs, which serve mostly as passive replicas for data representation and rudimentary analysis, CDTs are designed to perform complex cognitive tasks. They engage in human-like intellectual activities such as perception, situational reasoning, and autonomous decision-making, leveraging technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence (Dwivedi et al., 2021 ; De Kerckhove et al., 2022 ; Peladarinos et al., 2023 ). What sets CDTs apart is their ability to respond adaptively to dynamically changing environments and manage unforeseen events in real-time. For example, in the context of SDG 9.2, CDTs can significantly contribute to sustainable industrialization. Imagine a scenario where a manufacturing plant utilizes CDTs to continuously monitor and analyze energy consumption across its operations. By employing advanced predictive analytics, a CDT can foresee periods of higher energy demand and automatically adjust production schedules to utilize energy more efficiently, significantly reducing the plant's carbon footprint. Additionally, CDTs can identify patterns of waste generation and recommend changes in production processes to minimize waste, further contributing to sustainable practices (Kalaboukas et al., 2023 ). Moreover, in terms of inclusivity, CDTs enable more personalized and adaptable manufacturing processes. Consider a factory that produces consumer goods. A CDT, through its integration of market data and consumer feedback, can adapt production lines to create customized products that cater to the specific preferences of different consumer groups. This adaptability not only meets diverse customer needs but also addresses community-specific requirements, such as creating products that are more accessible to people with disabilities. Such integration of ethical and social considerations into industrial decision-making exemplifies how CDTs can support a more inclusive approach in line with the aspirational goals of SDG 9.2. This level of responsiveness contributes to creating a more human-centric industrial setting, thus meeting the dual demands of efficiency and inclusivity (Yitmen et al., 2021 ; D'Amico et al., 2022 ). This makes CDTs particularly well-suited for complex industrial applications requiring high degrees of automation without sidelining human involvement. Moreover, the cognitive abilities of CDTs are increasingly recognized as indispensable for overcoming challenges associated with the alignment to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in the context of achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization (SDG 9.2). The need for CDTs, therefore, is not just a matter of technological sophistication. It arises from the real-world complexities of industrial systems, the growing appetite for intelligent and humanized automation, and the urgent requirement to harmonize industrial activities with sustainability imperatives (Kopponen et al., 2022 ; Ivanov, 2023 ). While the technological infrastructure for DTs is relatively mature, CDTs represent an evolving frontier that necessitates continued research and development. This is particularly vital because they offer not just incremental improvements over DTs, but a transformative approach to harmonizing automation and human-centricity in the pursuit of sustainability and resilience (Ivanov, 2023 ). As industries increasingly navigate the complexities of the Industry 5.0 landscape, this study serves as a timely exploration of the untapped potential of CDTs to act as catalysts in achieving the aspirational goals of inclusive and sustainable industrialization (SDG 9.2).  2.3 Previous studies Research on Digital Twins (DTs) spans various domains, from architectural frameworks to specific industrial applications. For example, Tao et al. (2018)  laid the foundational architecture for a digital twin shop-floor, elucidating its characteristics and operating mechanisms. Their work holds seminal importance as it operationalizes the DT concept for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. Söderberg et al. (2017)  expanded this framework by incorporating real-time geometry to facilitate individualized production, contributing to the granular application of DTs. While most DT research has concentrated on the initial phases of the lifecycle, such as design and development (Tao et al., 2019 ), Wang and Wang (2019)  explored a DT-based system for recycling, recovery, and remanufacturing of waste electrical and electronic equipment, focusing on full lifecycle support. The advent of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) represents a natural progression from this foundational work on DTs. Researchers have increasingly emphasized the need to imbue DTs with intelligent capabilities, setting the stage for the emergence of CDTs. Semantic technologies, as proposed by Kharlamov et al. (2018) , have paved the way for this advancement, offering DTs the potential to understand and interact within complex systems. Gómez-Berbís and de Amescua-Seco (2019)  further advanced this discussion by introducing Semantic Digital Twins (SEDIT) that allow for more dynamic interactions and real-time decision-making. The work of Lu et al. (2020)  stands out for its comprehensive framework for developing CDTs, facilitated by a robust toolchain of software and platforms. Abburu et al. (2020)  offer a clarifying taxonomy of digital twins, hybrid twins, and cognitive twins, which provides invaluable insights for ongoing research in this area. Also, some work in is in the nuclear field proposed by Park et al. (2022) . They applied AR-assisted DT to radioactive waste safety management, ensuring human operators' safety. The studies surveyed indicate a growing, yet insufficiently explored, convergence of DTs and cognitive capabilities. Noteworthy is the recent work by Lv et al. (2023) , which underscores the practical application of bio-inspired cognitive architectures in DTs for automated maintenance of machine tools through a self-constructed, self-evaluated, and self-optimized manner. In addition to the DT and CDT-focused research, recent studies have been exploring the broader scope of Industry 5.0. For example, Xu et al. (2021)  examined the transition from the technology-focused Industry 4.0 to the value-driven Industry 5.0. Their study, structured around five key questions, aims to clarify the coexistence and distinctions between these two industrial phases. The objective is to foster ongoing debate and discussion in this evolving field, with a commitment to unbiased information sourcing and analysis. Ghobakhloo et al. (2022)  explore the transition to Industry 5.0, emphasizing sustainable development over the profit focus of Industry 4.0. They develop a reference model for Industry 5.0, identifying its key technical and functional properties. Utilizing interpretive structural modelling and a comprehensive literature review, the authors outline 16 sustainable development functions integral to Industry 5.0. Maddikunta et al. (2022)  demonstrate that the prospective application of Industry 5.0 technologies, such as the seamless exchange of sensor data across networks and the implementation of autonomous systems, contributes to heightened levels of customer satisfaction and confers greater value upon organizations. This phenomenon encompasses various areas such as personalized customization, user-centric design, and cooperative automation. Shahbakhsh et al. (2022)  conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine recent developments in the field. The proposal put forth was for the industry to expand its focus beyond the products that were prevalent in the preceding industrial revolutions and instead prioritize Industry 5.0 as a means of propelling itself towards “Maritime 5.0” or “Shipping 5.0”. Furthermore, Leng et al. (2022)  explored the concept of Industry 5.0, emphasizing its role in enhancing human well-being and sustainable development. The study reviews Industry 5.0's evolution, focusing on its three main characteristics: human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency. They propose a tri-dimensional system architecture for Industry 5.0, covering technical, reality, and application aspects. Later, Ghobakhloo et al. (2023a,b)  conducted a study to clarify the concept of Industry 5.0, addressing societal challenges linked to digital industrialization. The research involved a detailed literature review, leading to an architectural design for Industry 5.0. It highlights Industry 5.0's role in resolving socio-economic and environmental issues overlooked by Industry 4.0. Mukherjee et al. (2023)  studied the barriers to the adoption of Industry 5.0 in the Indian manufacturing context. In their study they briefly discussed about the barriers and their mitigating startegies and also propose the GRID framework in order to tackle these barriers. These broader explorations into Industry 5.0 complement our focus on CDTs, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the current industrial revolution. Specifically, the unique attributes and untapped potentials of Cognitive Digital Twins in aligning with sustainability and inclusivity objectives within the Industry 5.0 paradigm remain less explored. This gap underscores the significance of our research. The convergence of these diverse elements within Industry 5.0 sets the stage for our current research endeavor, emphasizing the need to investigate CDTs not only as advanced technological interfaces but as integral components fostering sustainable and human-centric industrial systems.  2.4 Research gaps In reviewing the existing literature, it becomes apparent that there is a substantive body of work examining Digital Twins (DTs) in the context of advancement in futuristic industrialization, ranging from real-time monitoring to predictive maintenance (Tao et al., 2018 ; Knapp et al., 2017 ; Söderberg et al., 2017 ). Similarly, early contributions in the realm of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) have begun to emerge, focusing on their enhanced capabilities like semantic understanding, intelligent decision-making, and adaptability (Kharlamov et al., 2018 ; Zheng et al., 2022 ; Lv et al., 2023 ). However, these studies, while technologically oriented, often do not extend to how CDTs contribute to sustainability and inclusivity. For example, Zheng et al. (2022)  delve deeply into the cognitive abilities of CDTs in data processing but overlook their application in enhancing sustainable industrial practices. This gap underscores the need for research that bridges CDTs' technological advancements with SDG 9.2's goals of inclusive and sustainable industrialization (Hassani et al., 2022 ). The existing literature primarily views CDTs through a technological lens, expounding on their cognitive abilities but rarely extending the discourse to their potential contribution towards sustainability and inclusivity (Zheng et al., 2022 ; Kalaboukas et al., 2023 ). Even in studies that focus on the intersection of CDTs and sustainability, the exploration is often narrowed down to environmental gains or process efficiencies, rather than an integrated approach that also encompasses social and economic dimensions (Fernández et al., 2019 ; Ali et al., 2021 ). For example, Fernández et al. (2019)  analyze CDTs' role in reducing environmental impact in manufacturing but do not extend the discussion to include social inclusivity or broader industrial sustainability. Furthermore, most existing studies restrict their scope to specific industry sectors or case applications, limiting generalizability. Even though Park et al. (2022)  have applied augmented reality-assisted DTs in the nuclear field, it doesn't necessarily account for broader industrial applications where CDTs can offer both technological and sustainable advantages. This sector-specific focus diminishes the ability to draw cross-sectoral implications, which is particularly critical when considering the universality of SDGs. Another gap lies in the unaddressed complexity of aligning high levels of automation with human-centricity. As industries transition into the Industry 5.0 paradigm, the balance between technological sophistication and human involvement becomes increasingly critical, an area where CDTs are hypothesized to have significant potential (Longo et al., 2023 ). Additionally, one notable research gap in existing literature is the theoretical foundation upon which these studies are based. Strategy identification and prioritization in the realm of Cognitive Digital Twins have employed various theoretical frameworks; however, to the best of our knowledge, none have utilized the TOE-HOT framework as a guiding lens. This represents a significant gap given the comprehensive nature of the TOE-HOT framework, which allows for an integrative analysis that can cover technological, organizational, environmental, human, organizational, and technological aspects. Moreover, in terms of methodological innovation, while various tools have been employed for strategy identification in previous research, the use of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) specifically in the context of inclusive and sustainable industrial development represents a novel approach. BWM offers a systematic and reliable way of identifying the most and least important criteria in complex decision-making scenarios, which is crucial for prioritizing strategies in the rapidly evolving landscape of Industry 5.0. Similarly, ISM provides a structured approach to analyze the relationships among different strategies, offering a comprehensive view of how various factors interact and influence each other in the pursuit of sustainable industrialization. The combined use of these methods in our study provides a unique and robust framework for understanding and prioritizing strategies that can drive inclusive and sustainable development in Industry 5.0. The aforementioned gaps accentuate the need for a more nuanced understanding of CDTs' role, not merely as advanced technological entities but as critical tools for achieving inclusive and sustainable industrial development in the Industry 5.0 era. This study aims to address these gaps, contributing to the literature by exploring the potential of CDTs in harmonizing the dual imperatives of automation and human-centricity, all within the framework of sustainable industrial development.  2.5 TOE-HOT framework In line with the multifaceted nature of Industry 5.0 and its implication on sustainable development, our study employs a conjoined theoretical paradigm, integrating the Technological, Organizational, and Environmental (TOE) framework with the Human, Organizational, and Technological (HOT) framework. This composite framework affords us a holistic perspective to examine the interplay between technological innovation, organizational dynamics, and human-centric elements in the context of sustainable and inclusive industrialization. These tenets fundamentally alter the research lens from merely focusing on efficiency and profitability to incorporating a human-centric and environmentally responsible approach in the industrial landscape. The TOE framework, substantiated by extant research (Raj and Jeyaraj, 2022 ; Aligarh et al., 2023 ; Das and Bala, 2023 ), serves as an instrumental tool for identifying pivotal strategies that facilitate technological innovations, particularly during their nascent phases of organizational diffusion. This framework empowers us to identify the technological innovations, organizational mechanisms, and environmental policies that catalyze the seamless integration of Industry 5.0 features, such as Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs), into the manufacturing sector, thereby influencing sustainability indices in alignment with SDG 9.2 objectives. Complementarily, the HOT framework has been acknowledged for its comprehensive reach across various research domains (Mohanraj et al., 2023 ; Nilashi et al., 2023 ). It underscores the criticality of human and organizational dimensions, alongside technological elements, in ensuring effective adoption and diffusion of innovations. By incorporating the HOT framework, our study extends its scope to assess the sociotechnical attributes and human-centric aspects that amplify the effectiveness of CDTs in sustainable and inclusive industrialization. In reviewing the literature, we observe key contributions across technological, organizational, and human strategies. Technological innovations, notably in advanced manufacturing and digitalization, have been widely examined for their capability to promote sustainable industrial practices (Kurniawan et al., 2022 ). Likewise, organizational measures like skill development and stakeholder engagement have been explored for their contribution to achieving SDG 9.2 targets (Cherrafi et al., 2022 ). Recent scholarship accentuates the role of human strategies, such as workforce training and participation, in driving the safe deployment of sustainable practices (de Jesus and Mendonça, 2018 ). By merging the TOE and HOT frameworks, as corroborated by previous literature (Orji et al., 2019 ; Feng et al., 2021 ), our research captures the multi-dimensionality of the strategies that govern the application of CDTs in Industry 5.0, targeting the objectives of SDG 9.2. We aim to advance the extant body of knowledge and inform policymaking by delivering a comprehensive analysis of the crucial strategies (as shown in Table 1  ) affecting sustainable and inclusive industrialization. Our findings promise to yield actionable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and academicians focused on fortifying sustainable practices within the realm of Industry 5.0. 2.5.1 Identification of strategies related to CDTs in promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization The theoretical decision-making framework presented in this research extends key dimensions crucial for implementing strategies that align with inclusive and sustainable industrialization, notably underscored in SDG 9.2. The dimensions addressed in this framework comprise technological, organizational, environmental, and human aspects. By attending to these dimensions, organizations can more holistically integrate Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) to achieve the dual objectives of inclusivity and environmental sustainability within the broader scope of Industry 5.0. Each of these dimensions hosts a variety of strategic elements that have been discerned through a comprehensive examination of existing literature and sector-specific expertise (as elaborated in Table 1 ). These strategic elements function as the pillars for ensuring the successful adoption and deployment of CDTs in fostering an industrial environment that is not only technologically advanced but also socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. Technological Dimension:  The technological dimension centres on the deployment of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) to stimulate both inclusivity and sustainability in the context of Industry 5.0. These technological strategies embody a blend of external and internal technological innovations, both in processes and equipment, and have been informed by previous studies in the field of technology adoption (Rejeb et al., 2022 ). This dimension focuses on embracing technologies that not only augment resource efficiency and curtail waste but also integrate human inputs and preferences into their operational framework, thereby adding a layer of inclusivity to technological solutions. Specific practices within this dimension include the utilization of CDTs for predictive maintenance and real-time analytics (Unal et al., 2022 ), the incorporation of various sensors and connected devices, CDTs can help monitor workplace conditions in real-time, ensuring that worker safety and well-being (Liu et al., 2022 ; Yin et al., 2023 ) and lastly, to analyze market trends, thereby helping industries to avoid both overproduction and stock-outs in order to promote sustainability. These strategies collectively contribute to minimizing risks and advancing the objectives of SDG 9.2 in the industrial sector. Organizational Dimension:  This dimension specifically addresses the organizational infrastructures and policies vital for harnessing Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) in Industry 5.0 settings to meet the milestones set by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9. Citing academic works such as Lu et al. (2020)  and Ghobakhloo et al. (2023a,b) , we emphasize the necessity of educational initiatives targeted at upskilling workers in the usage of CDTs. Such training promotes a culture of safety and inclusivity by facilitating digital dexterity, thereby ensuring a seamless human-machine collaboration (Lu et al., 2022 ; Mourtzis et al., 2022 ). Also, companies can set specific sustainability metrics that are continuously monitored by the CDT, ensuring alignment with broader sustainable development goals (Kalaboukas et al., 2023 ). Lastly, with real-time compliance tracking, CDTs can alert organizations to any breaches in environmental regulations or ethical norms, allowing for immediate corrective action (Ünal et al., 2023 ). By fostering these organizational attributes, we contribute to laying a foundation for both inclusive and sustainable industrialization, in line with SDG 9.2. Environmental Dimension:  This dimension concentrates on an organization's commitment to sustainable, eco-friendly practices facilitated by CDTs, aimed at enhancing cleaner production, lowering energy use, and minimizing waste. Utilizing CDTs, organizations can model energy consumption patterns, enabling the formulation of data-driven strategies for reducing carbon footprints, an approach corroborated by studies such as He et al. (2021)  and Arsiwala et al. (2023) . Moreover, this dimension accentuates the need for strict adherence to environmental regulations, which can be simulated and evaluated through digital twins (Mylonas et al., 2021 ). It also highlights the role of sustainability and inclusivity in optimizing supply chains for minimal environmental impact (Sharma et al., 2021 ; Walker et al., 2021 ). In this way, organizations can navigate the complex realms of industrial sustainability and inclusivity through CDTs, thereby contributing strategic insights toward achieving SDG 9 and its sub-goal of inclusive and sustainable industrialization. Human Dimension:  Human Dimension: This facet emphasizes an organization's commitment to cultivating a humane work environment, facilitated by Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs), which aligns with the objectives of SDG 9.2. Utilizing predictive analytics and sensor data, CDTs empower organizations to identify and mitigate safety hazards, corroborated by contemporary research (Eirinakis et al., 2020 ; Sasikumar et al., 2023 ). Additionally, the dimension stresses the importance of open communication channels for workers to report unsafe conditions without the fear of retribution (Islam et al., 2023 ). Skill augmentation is another focus, with CDTs identifying workforce skill gaps and suggesting targeted training programs, an approach that strengthens job security, as confirmed by research (Bécue et al., 2020 ; Yitmen et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, well-being analytics and ethical decision-making algorithms within CDTs assess both the physical and mental wellness of workers, ensuring an ethically balanced, healthy work environment (Wang et al., 2022 ; van‐Lopik et al., 2023 ). Lastly, the dimension highlights the potential for CDTs to free employees from monotonous tasks, fostering a sense of autonomy and job satisfaction. Collectively, these human-centric strategies facilitate an inclusive and sustainable industrial setting, contributing significantly to the actualization of SDG 9.2. The integration of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) in promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization is manifest in multiple dimensions—technological, organizational, environmental, and human. Our study reveals that the adoption of such multi-faceted approaches not only contributes to operational efficiency and environmental sustainability but also significantly enhances workplace safety and employee well-being. Leveraging CDTs, organizations can proactively identify and mitigate risks, facilitate open communication, and focus on continuous skill augmentation, as substantiated by key literature (Yitmen et al., 2021 ; García et al., 2022 ; Chen et al., 2023 ). These collective practices pave the way for a safer, more inclusive working environment while making tangible contributions to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 9.2 and fostering an industrial landscape that is not just technologically advanced but also socially equitable and environmentally responsible.    3 Methodology The present research employed a three-phase methodology to evaluate how Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) contribute to achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization within the framework of Industry 5.0, particularly in alignment with SDG 9.2 objectives. The methodological flow is visually depicted in Fig. 1   and consists of three primary stages. In the initial phase, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to gather insights from existing academic publications. Keywords pertinent to Industry 5.0, Cognitive Digital Twins, SDGs, and specifically SDG 9 and Target 9.2 were used for search queries in various scholarly databases. The articles selected for review were restricted to those published in English. Strategies associated with CDTs that influence inclusive and sustainable industrialization were extracted, later corroborated through expert consultation and empirical analysis. The second stage involved qualitative interviews with industry executives to validate and fine-tune the strategies identified in the literature review. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) was employed to prioritize these strategies, determining their significance in achieving the specific tenets of SDG 9.2. To ensure a comprehensive understanding, diverse sectors within the manufacturing industry were included to assess the replicability of the findings. In the terminal phase, Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) was utilized to dissect the intricate relationships among the pre-identified strategies. This resulted in a multi-level hierarchical structure that scrutinized the interdependencies and driving forces behind these strategies. The MICMAC analysis further categorized the strategies into different layers based on their influence and dependency. By synergizing the results from BWM, ISM, and MICMAC analyses, the research offers an in-depth understanding of how CDTs can be leveraged to facilitate inclusive and sustainable industrialization, aligning with the objectives of SDG 9.2. This methodological approach enriches the current discourse by elucidating the relationships, significance, and impact of these strategies, particularly within the context of India's manufacturing sector. Stakeholders can hence use these insights to make data-driven decisions for the incorporation of CDTs in building a more sustainable and inclusive industrial landscape. 3.1 Best-worst method (BWM) The best-worst method (BWM) was selected for prioritizing strategies in this study because it is a consistent and efficient method that can be used to rank a large number of strategies with fewer pairwise comparisons. The extensive utilization of BWM can be attributed to its numerous advantages compared to other commonly employed MCDM techniques, such as “Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)” and “fuzzy AHP.” According to Rezaei (2015) , BWM demonstrates a reduced need for pairwise assessments in comparison to AHP, while maintaining reliable outcomes. Another advantage of employing the Best-Worst Method (BWM) is that the inclusion of integers in the ranking procedure decreases computational intricacy, as opposed to the utilization of fractional values in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Tarei et al., 2021 ). One additional advantage of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) lies in its heightened reliability in generating the optimal weight when compared to alternative Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies. Furthermore, it exhibits greater resilience compared to alternative approaches (Rezaei, 2015 ; 2016). The BWM method works by comparing each strategy to standard strategies and then assigning weights to the strategies based on their relative importance. The five-step approach to BWM was adapted from Gupta et al. (2023)  work and is described in detail. The BWM is a method of multi-criteria decision modelling (MCDM) that involves the use of a weight vector, denoted as w j  = ( w 1  , w 2  , . . . , w n   )    , which must satisfy the conditions of ∑ n j  = 1 w j   = 1    and w j  ≥ 0   . The weight of each criterion c j     is represented by the variable w j    . From a probabilistic perspective, the occurrence of the c j     can be perceived as a stochastic event, while the w j     denotes its probability of happening.Step 1: Involves identifying the pertinent set of criteria for the research. Assuming that there are n criteria, the decision criteria would be represented as { c 1  , c 2  , . . . , c n    }  .   .  Step 2: After finalizing the criteria, it is recommended to choose the “Best' and “Worst' criteria from the main and sub-criteria. During this phase, the selection of the “best barrier' is indicative of its high level of importance, while the designation of the “worst barrier' suggests its relatively lower significance.  Step 3: The decision maker engages in a comparative analysis between the optimal barrier and the remaining barriers. The linguistic assessment scale ranges from 1 to 9, with a score of 1 indicating equal significance and a score of 9 indicating utmost importance. The vector A B j      can be derived as follows: A B j   = ( a B 1   , a B 2   , . . . , a B n    )  .    The variable ″ a B j   ″     represents the relative importance of the superior criterion B in comparison to criterion j.  Step 4: The decision maker engages in a comparison of the remaining criteria with the least favorable one. The construction of the “other-to-worst' vector by experts involves the utilization of a scale ranging from 1 to 9, as outlined in the third step. The resulting vector A j W      can be obtained by computing the relevance of the remaining criterion j with respect to the worst criterion W, denoted by a j W     . This vector is represented as ( a 1 W   , a 2 W   , . . . , a n W    )  T  .   .  Step 5: This step involves the computation of optimized weights ( w 1 *  , w 2 *  , . . . , w n *   )    for every criterion.    In other words, j may be minimized for { | w B  − a Bj  w j   |  , | w j  − a jw  w w   |   }   . From the weights of each enabler that were acquired. Following will be determined for the following min-max model (1):  minmax { | w B  − a Bj  w j   |  , | w j  − a jw  w w   |   }       s . t .  Σ j  w j  = 1     w j  ≥ 0 , for  all  j         With this model (1) has been improved while being transformed into a linear model (2), as seen below.  min  ξ L       s . t .      | w B  − a Bj  w j   |  ≤ ξ L  , for  all  j     | w j  − a jw  w w   |  ≤ ξ L  , for  all  j     Σ j  w j  = 1 ; w j  ≥ 0 , for  all  j          To obtain “optimal weights' ( w 1  * , w 2  * , … , w n  *  )    and “optimal value' ξ L    , model (2) can be solved. According to Gupta et al. (2023) , the pairwise comparison consistency (ξ L    ) score must be close to 0.  3.2 Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) is a well-known method in the field of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). It is used to identify the interconnected relationships between multiple strategies that are critical to achieving a desired outcome. Its applicability has been demonstrated in diverse research contexts, such as formulating actions and approaches that are instrumental for steering Industry 5.0-driven sustainable industrial transformation (Ghobakhloo et al., 2022 ). While several MCDM techniques exist, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), fuzzy cognitive mapping, and the Decision-Making Test and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), ISM surpasses them due to its unique capabilities. It is particularly effective for decomposing intricate systems into simpler sub-systems, subsequently creating a nuanced, multilayer structural model. This detailed stratification reveals the nuanced interrelationships among the delineated strategies based on their driving and dependent power. To enhance the analytical depth of ISM, MICMAC analysis is employed, categorizing strategies into coherent clusters. This method refines the interpretative scope of ISM, revealing the dynamic interplay between driving and dependent forces within a system. Furthermore, the utilization of the MICMAC analysis approach presents a distinct advantage in comparison to alternative techniques, as it permits the evaluation of the extent of each strategy, while simultaneously taking into account the strength of interactions among them (Mondal et al., 2023 ; Josaiman et al., 2023 ). The synergistic integration of ISM and MICMAC analysis provides a profound understanding of the multifaceted linkages among different strategies, paving the way for more informed and robust decision-making processes.  3.3 Experts information To fulfil the research aims of evaluating the key strategies through which Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) can facilitate inclusive and sustainable industrialization in alignment with SDG 9.2, a specialized panel of 10 experts was assembled. These professionals, each possessing a minimum of ten years of experience, represent diverse yet interconnected domains. The choice to include professionals from multiple disciplines was made intentionally to cultivate a rich, well-rounded interpretation of the topic. This strategy enhances the study's relevance and its potential for broader application in diverse industrial and organizational settings. Table 2   details the specific qualifications and affiliations of the ten experts engaged in the study.   4 Results 4.1 BWM results After finalizing the Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) strategies for inclusive and sustainable industrialization, ratings were assigned on a scale from 1 to 9 to determine their relative importance within the framework of Industry 5.0. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) analysis involved a detailed comparison between the most and least impactful strategies, as well as pairwise comparisons within each group of strategies. This approach allowed for the identification of strategies that are most and least significant within the context of achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization (as shown in Table 3  ). These strategies were then juxtaposed to others within their respective groups using a scale of 1–9, generating a “best-to-others” matrix for CDTs and sustainability strategies. Similarly, experts compared the relative importance of other strategies to the least impactful strategies on a scale from 1 to 9, creating an “Others-to-Worst” (OW) matrix, which is shown in Table 4   and Appendix. These comparisons and the derived ratings revealed invaluable insights into the prioritization and ranking of CDTs strategies for inclusive and sustainable industrialization. The ratings assigned by the experts determined the local weights (LW) of each strategy, reflecting the experts’ preferences and expectations regarding the relative significance of the strategies in promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization. By considering optimal weights for each group, the LWs were averaged to yield the final LWs for each strategy, which are shown graphically in Fig. 2  . In addition to local weights, the BWM analysis also generated global weights (GW) by multiplying the weights of the divisions with the weights of the correlating strategies, providing a holistic assessment of the overall significance of each strategy in achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization in alignment with Industry 5.0 and SDG 9. The strategies were ranked according to the global weights provided and the results are presented in Fig. 3  . A summary of the rankings can be seen in Table 5  , where the strategies with the highest GWs are positioned at the top. The BWM analysis, incorporating both local and global weights, facilitated a comprehensive evaluation of CDTs strategies for inclusive and sustainable industrialization. These results offer invaluable guidance for fostering advancements in inclusivity and sustainability within India's manufacturing sector. The rankings obtained from this analysis contribute to identifying impactful strategies for achieving the ideals of SDG 9.2 in the context of Industry 5.0. This robust and meticulous evaluation process offers a framework for assessing the contributions of CDTs strategies towards inclusive and sustainable industrialization. The insights derived from this analysis are pivotal in informing evidence-based decision-making, aiding policymakers, practitioners, and industry stakeholders in the implementation of effective measures to realize a more inclusive and sustainable industrial future in alignment with the principles of Industry 5.0 and the aspirations of SDG 9.2.  4.2 ISM result After identifying and prioritizing the key strategies through which Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) contribute to inclusive and sustainable industrialization in the context of Industry 5.0, this study employed Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) to explore the interrelationships among these strategies. The choice of ISM, in line with recommendations by Mondal et al. (2023) , was deemed appropriate for capturing the intricate connections and dependencies between human-centric industrialization and sustainable strategies. This decision was substantiated through a qualitative inquiry that leveraged expert-based methodologies and participatory decision-making processes. The ISM approach unfolds in a series of distinct stages, each pivotal in sculpting a nuanced understanding of the interplay among the key CDTs strategies. The following segments elucidate the steps involved in the ISM methodology as applied to this study. 4.2.1 Structural self-interaction matrix The initial phase of the ISM technique involves analysing the connection between each pair of CDTs strategies. The total pairwise comparisons is given by the formula n C2  or n*(n-1)/2, where n represents the count of cleaner production and sustainable practices. Pairwise comparison inquiries were formulated to establish context-specific linkages between key practices (Jafari-Sadeghi et al., 2021 ). Experts referenced in Table 2  were prompted to affirm or negate the relationships of each practice. The relations of the components were then examined and translated into a Structural Self-Interaction Matrix (SSIM) using VAXO, a symbolic system where the connecting path between the strategy ‘s' is expressed via four symbols (“VAXO'), with “i" indicating the row strategy and “j" indicating the column strategy (Mondal et al., 2023 ). As per expert insights, SSIM was constructed by suitably incorporating the letters “V,' “A,' “X,' and “O" to symbolize the connection, as illustrated in Table 6  .V: “strategy i affect strategies j.”  A: “strategy i is affected by strategy j.”  X: “Strategies i and j affect each other.”  O: “Strategies i and j have no relationship.”     4.2.2 Forming initial reachability matrix The generation of the Reachability Matrix involves two distinct stages, which include the creation of the initial reachability matrix (refer to Table 8 ) and the subsequent generation of the final reachability matrix, which is derived from the Initial Reachability Matrix (refer to Table 8 ). The Structural Self-Interaction Matrix is utilized as the fundamental framework for creating the preliminary reachability matrix. This process involves substituting the symbols “V, A, X, and O″ with binary values of ‘0′ and ‘1′, as illustrated in Tables 7 and 8   . This phase is aimed at verifying the reliability and coherence of the opinions provided by experts.  4.2.3 Creation of final reachability matrix The initial reachability matrix is created by replacing the values of “V, A, X, and O″ in Table 6  using the replacement procedure in Table 7 , and the resulting IRM is shown in Table 8 . Table 9   shows the final reachability matrix (FRM) generated by applying the transitivity rule to the IRM. According to the transitivity rule, “if strategies (a) is related to strategies (b), and strategies (b) is related to strategies (c), then strategies (a) is logically related to strategies (c)". However, in most circumstances, experts disregard this criterion while delivering input, resulting in a transitive relationship. The transitive elements in the FRM are denoted by the × marked cells, in which the values are changed to “0″ or “1″ in accordance with the transitivity rule (Mondal et al., 2023 ).  4.2.4 Level partitioning The present phase employs level partitioning as a means of establishing a hierarchical arrangement of cleaner production and sustainable strategies. The utilization of the “final reachability matrix' is of utmost importance in the identification of both the reachability and antecedent sets pertaining to each individual strategy. The antecedent set comprises the primary strategies and any additional strategies that can facilitate its execution. The intersection of these two sets is computed for all strategies. Strategies that exhibit identical “reachability set' and “intersection sets' are initially classified as belonging to level I. After the identification of top-level strategies as level I, they are excluded from the set of sustainable strategies. This iterative procedure is carried out until every constituent is allocated its corresponding level. Table 10   presents a comprehensive partitioning consisting of nine levels, whereas a more detailed partitioning at the individual level can be located in appendix (refer to Tables A5 to A13 ).  4.2.5 Formation of ISM diagram The utilization of the ISM methodology is employed to exhibit the interdependence of strategies across multiple levels, as depicted in Fig. 4  . The interdependence of the CDTs strategies, as depicted in Fig. 4 , is derived from the final reachability matrix (FRM) (Table 9 ) and linked by directed lines (Table 10 ). The presence of a unidirectional arrow originating from a source node denoted as “X" and terminating at a destination node denoted as “Y" indicates that node “X" is causally linked to node “Y" and can be considered as a precursor to node “Y". The presence of a bidirectional line connecting nodes “X" and “Y" indicates that there is a mutual relationship between the two nodes, highlighting the existence of reciprocal interactions between them. Fig. 4  depicts an Interpretative Structural Hierarchical Model of various CDTs strategies for inclusive and sustainable industrialization.  4.2.6 MICMAC analysis The utilization of the MICMAC analysis approach presents a distinct advantage in comparison to alternative techniques, as it permits the evaluation of the extent of each strategy, while simultaneously taking into account the strength of interactions among them (Mondal et al., 2023 ; Josaiman et al., 2023 ). The present investigation utilizes the MICMAC analysis technique to cluster strategies according to their driving and dependence power, utilizing the final reachability matrix. The efficacy of a strategy can be ascertained by aggregating the numerical values present in the corresponding row of the stabilized MICMAC matrix. Similarly, the level of dependence can be evaluated by summing the numerical values present in the respective column. The aforementioned facilitates the generation of a graphical depiction of strategies predicated on their driving and dependent power.    5 Discussion The primary aim of this research was to carry out an in-depth analysis of the key strategies through which Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) contribute to inclusive and sustainable industrialization in the context of Industry 5.0. The study was driven by the overarching objective to delineate how these strategies can be leveraged to meet the specific tenets of SDG 9.2, particularly in the Indian manufacturing sector. By synthesizing existing literature, the TOE-HOT framework, and expert opinions, this research offers pivotal insights into the symbiotic relationship between human-centric industrialization via CDTs and the sustainability goals articulated in SDG 9.2. The methodology employed in this research provided a holistic understanding of the subject matter, with the TOE-HOT framework serving as the analytical lens. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) were integrated into a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach, thereby enabling an exhaustive evaluation of the CDTs strategies in Industry 5.0. The BWM technique helped in ranking the strategies according to their influence on achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization, laying out their significance and relative importance. Table 5 , complemented by Figs. 2 and 3 , encapsulates the evaluations, local weights, and global weights of these prioritized strategies. The study's findings offer a prioritized set of strategies for achieving SDG 9.2, providing a data-driven framework crucial for informed decision-making and resource allocation. This has the potential to transform sustainable and inclusive industrial models, particularly in vital emerging economies like India. The research thus serves as a critical guide for policymakers and industry stakeholders. 5.1 Discussion of BWM results In the pursuit of unravelling the transformative capabilities of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) within Industry 5.0, especially in the backdrop of a developing nation like India, this research ventured into a systematic exploration of the primary dimensions and their associated strategies that are instrumental in driving inclusive and sustainable industrialization in alignment with SDG 9.2. With the aid of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) approach, the study yielded insightful outcomes. The findings primarily highlighted the Technological Dimension (TD) as the most influential, possessing a group weight of 0.386. Within this dimension, the Real-time Optimization strategy (TD1), with a global weight of 0.153, emerged as paramount. This underlines the transformative potential of CDTs in dynamically adjusting manufacturing processes, in turn, ensuring optimal efficiency and sustainability in real-time operations (Hu, 2022 ; Cui et al., 2023 ). Following closely, Data Analytics (TD2) obtained a weight of 0.132, emphasizing the imperative role of CDTs in aligning production with market demand through data-driven insights, thereby fostering long-term industrial sustainability (Zheng et al., 2022 ; Voipio et al., 2023 ). The Organizational Dimension (OD) ranked second, with a group weight of 0.273. The most prominent strategy within this dimension was Strategic Alignment (OD2), possessing a global weight of 0.122. It underscores the centrality of CDTs in consistently monitoring and ensuring alignment with broader sustainable development goals, thereby laying the foundation for a structured approach to sustainable industrialization (Hassani et al., 2022 ). In tandem, the Change Management strategy (OD1) held a global weight of 0.108, highlighting the transformative influence of CDTs in spearheading organizational shifts towards sustainable practices and inclusivity (Zheng et al., 2022 ; Longo et al., 2023 ). Positioning third, the Human Dimension (HD) secured a group weight of 0.197. Within this dimension, the Job Security and Skill Augmentation strategy (HD1), with a global weight of 0.092, surfaced as pivotal. This strategy elucidates the role of CDTs in identifying workforce skill gaps, advocating the narrative of CDTs as job enablers rather than job displacers, and signifying the intertwined relationship between human capabilities and machine intelligence in Industry 5.0 (Maddikunta et al., 2022 ; Modoni and Sacco, 2023 ). Lastly, the External Environmental Dimension (ED), although ranked fourth with a weight of 0.145, presented significant findings. Notably, Resource Conservation (ED2) and Emission Reduction (ED1) carried global weights of 0.055 and 0.054, respectively. These strategies accentuate the potential of CDTs in actively monitoring and managing resource consumption and emissions, in line with the overarching environmental sustainability objectives, underscoring the holistic approach required in Industry 5.0 to truly achieve SDG 9.2. The insights derived from the Best-Worst Method (BWM) analysis have profound implications for policymakers and industry leaders, especially in the context of developing economies such as India. The prominence of the Technological Dimension, and specifically the Real-time Optimization strategy (TD1), is indicative of its critical role in enhancing operational efficiencies. This finding aligns with contemporary research, which underscores the importance of real-time data utilization in manufacturing to achieve both economic and environmental sustainability (Hu, 2022 ; Cui et al., 2023 ). The Data Analytics strategy (TD2), with its focus on leveraging data for market-responsive production, is another key area that resonates with the current industrial trend towards data-driven decision-making. This aspect of the research suggests a significant avenue for industries to enhance their responsiveness to market demands, thereby reducing overproduction and waste (Zheng et al., 2022 ; Voipio et al., 2023 ). The practical application of these strategies can be envisaged in various real-world industrial settings within India. For instance, the implementation of Real-time Optimization (TD1) in a manufacturing setup could significantly reduce resource wastage and improve efficiency. This strategy, when applied effectively, could lead to a reduction in operational costs and a smaller carbon footprint, thereby contributing to the broader objectives of sustainable industrial development (Maddikunta et al., 2022 ; Modoni and Sacco, 2023 ). Furthermore, in an Indian manufacturing context, the application of IoT and Connectivity (TD3) could revolutionize the way industries operate, enabling them to be more agile and responsive to market and environmental demands. For instance, an Indian automotive manufacturer integrating IoT in its production line could significantly improve its operational efficiency and reduce its ecological footprint, showcasing the practical benefits of this strategy.  5.2 Discussion of ISM result In this study, the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) method played a crucial role in unravelling and contextualizing the relationships among the identified strategies aimed at leveraging Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) for inclusive and sustainable industrialization within Industry 5.0. Based on the collective insights of experts in the field, the ISM model unveiled a sophisticated, nine-level hierarchical structure, encapsulating the dynamic interactions of the twelve defined strategies. The meticulous application of the ISM method yielded a rich tapestry of insights into the inherent relationships among these strategies. This hierarchical representation showcased that level one was indicative of the highest “dependence power,' whilst level nine illustrated the zenith of “driving power,' enabling a holistic understanding of each strategy's relative importance and interdependencies within the intricate mosaic of inclusive and sustainable industrialization in context with SDG 9.2. Refer to Fig. 4  for a detailed representation of how some strategies, particularly TD1 (Real-time Optimization), serve as fundamental cornerstones in the realization of inclusive and sustainable industrialization. These strategies, with their expansive driving power, demand immediate and prioritized attention and strategic intervention from the decision-makers. Strategies like TD1 and TD2 (Data Analytics) demonstrated transformative potential, illustrating that the deployment of such advanced, cognitively integrated technologies can lead to optimal, sustainable, and real-time industrial process management. This facilitates a seamless alignment of production with actual demand, thereby significantly mitigating the challenges related to overproduction and stockouts and establishing a pathway to sustainable and inclusive industrial evolution (Zheng et al., 2022 ; Voipio et al., 2023 ). Progressing further, our ISM analysis uncovered that TD2 and TD3 (IoT and Connectivity) jointly act as catalysts propelling OD2 (Strategic Alignment). This signifies that a strategic convergence of advanced technologies and real-time compliance within organizations reinforces a robust commitment to sustainable practices and employee well-being (Longo et al., 2023 ; Voipio et al., 2023 ). Strategically aligned organizations, in turn, drive OD1 (Change Management), illustrating that a proficient implementation of strategic objectives nurtures an environment characterized by adaptability, inclusivity, and enhanced employee engagement. This alignment signifies an organization's capability to adapt and integrate new strategies effectively, fostering an inclusive environment and a participative organizational culture, thus facilitating continuous improvement and innovation in industrial processes (Yitmen et al., 2021 ; Zheng et al., 2022 ). OD1 subsequently influences HD1 (Job Security and Skill Augmentation), highlighting that organizational adaptability and inclusive environment not only secure employment but also nurture the continuous enhancement of skills and competencies within the workforce. Enhanced job security and skill augmentation play a pivotal role in fostering a work environment where employees feel valued and invested in, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction (Modoni and Sacco, 2023 ; Wang et al., 2024 ). In this empowered environment, employees are more likely to contribute innovative ideas and solutions, driving the organization towards sustainable and inclusive industrialization. HD1 then becomes a driving force for HD3 (Employee Autonomy) and HD2 (Workplace Safety Monitoring), suggesting that a skilled and secure workforce is intrinsically linked to enhanced autonomy and heightened safety within the workplace. The implementation of such strategies ensures a balanced and harmonious organizational atmosphere, promoting well-being and productivity by empowering employees to take control of their work and actively contribute to workplace safety (Wang et al., 2024 ). HD3 and HD2 collectively drive OD3 (Governance Structures), emphasizing the intertwined nature of employee autonomy, workplace safety, and optimal governance structures committed to ethical and environmental compliance. Proper governance structures, influenced by employee autonomy and safety, ensure adherence to ethical norms and regulatory frameworks, fortifying the organization's commitment to sustainability and inclusive industrialization (Kalaboukas et al., 2023 ). This integration of optimal governance structures subsequently influences ED1 (Emission Reduction) and ED3 (Environmental Compliance), showcasing that ethical governance and compliance are instrumental in fostering a conducive environment for sustainability and adherence to environmental norms. This convergence underscores the organizational commitment to ecological conservation and sustainable industrial practices. Finally, the combined impact of ED1 and ED3 drives ED2 (Resource Conservation), illustrating that an organization's commitment to environmental compliance and emission reduction underpins the integration of safety measures into product design, contributing significantly to resource conservation and enhancement of circular economy safety (Rehman et al., 2023 ; Kalaboukas et al., 2023 ). Through the intricate and detailed exploration facilitated by the ISM methodology, this study highlights the nuanced, interconnected relationships among the identified strategies, emphasizing their critical roles in leveraging Cognitive Digital Twins to foster inclusive and sustainable industrialization in alignment with SDG 9. 5.2.1 Correlation with sustainable development goal 9.2 The outcomes from the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) method reveal a strong alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 9.2, particularly with respect to the promotion of resilient infrastructure, inclusive industrialization, and innovation in the context of India's burgeoning manufacturing sector. The strategies identified, such as IoT and Connectivity (TD3) and Strategic Alignment (OD2), are directly in line with the objectives of this SDG. These strategies not only contribute to the modernization of the manufacturing infrastructure but also promote sustainable practices (Longo et al., 2023 ; Hassani et al., 2022 ). Exploring the Human Dimension (HD), strategies like Job Security and Skill Augmentation (HD1) are vital in ensuring that the workforce is prepared for the evolving industrial landscape. This strategy not only contributes to the human aspect of sustainable development but also aligns with SDG 9.2's emphasis on inclusive industrialization. The role of CDTs in facilitating this strategy by identifying skill gaps and promoting training initiatives is crucial (Maddikunta et al., 2022 ).  5.2.2 Contextualizing within the indian manufacturing landscape The relevance of these findings to India's manufacturing sector cannot be overstated. For instance, the strategic alignment of organizational goals with sustainable practices, as encapsulated in OD2, offers a blueprint for Indian manufacturers to integrate sustainability into their core operations. This approach is critical in a scenario where the manufacturing sector is a significant contributor to the nation's GDP yet faces challenges such as resource inefficiency and environmental degradation (Kalaboukas et al., 2023 ; Lv et al., 2023 ). The integration of Change Management (OD1) within Indian industries could facilitate a cultural shift towards sustainability and innovation. By focusing on training and development, companies can ensure that their workforce is not only adept at using new technologies but also aligned with the company's sustainability goals. This approach can lead to a more engaged and efficient workforce, contributing to the overarching goal of sustainable and inclusive industrial growth (Zheng et al., 2022 ; Longo et al., 2023 ). Adopting such strategies could lead to a paradigm shift in how Indian industries approach sustainable manufacturing, aligning them with international standards and practices, and contributing significantly towards the achievement of SDG 9.2. In the context of India's diverse socio-economic landscape, the advent of Industry 5.0 presents both unique challenges and opportunities. The Indian industrial sector, characterized by its vast array of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), alongside large conglomerates, requires a nuanced approach in the application of Industry 5.0 strategies (Mukherjee et al., 2023 ). The insights from this study, particularly regarding the application of CDTs, are instrumental in addressing these challenges. For larger enterprises, the implementation of CDTs can significantly drive efficiency, innovation, and global competitiveness. In contrast, for MSMEs, the focus might be on scalable and cost-effective solutions that CDTs can offer, such as improved process efficiencies and enhanced market responsiveness (Kalaboukas et al., 2023 ). Moreover, the strategies, such as IoT and Connectivity (TD3) and Strategic Alignment (OD2), are especially pertinent in addressing the unique challenges of the Indian manufacturing sector, such as the need for digitalization, addressing skill gaps, and embracing sustainable practices (Longo et al., 2023 ; Lv et al., 2023 ). The implementation of these strategies can help bridge the gap between the current state of Indian manufacturing and the envisioned future of an Industry 5.0-aligned sector, marked by inclusivity, sustainability, and technological integration. In essence, the findings of this study provide a roadmap for Indian industries to navigate the complexities of Industry 5.0, taking into account the country's unique industrial fabric and developmental aspirations. This tailored approach is key to ensuring that Industry 5.0's potential is fully harnessed to meet India's specific industrial and socio-economic goals.   5.3 Discussion of MICMAC analysis result The MICMAC analysis was performed to examine the influence of Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) on fostering inclusive and sustainable industrialization within Industry 5.0, with a special focus on various industrial activities and processes. The primary objective of this analysis was to scrutinize and interpret the multifaceted relationships between the deployed strategies for leveraging CDTs and their subsequent impact on achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization, in alignment with SDG 9.2. Based on the analysis, the strategies for leveraging Cognitive Digital Twins were categorized into four distinct clusters: Autonomous, Independent, Linkage, and Dependent strategies (as shown in Fig. 5  ). Each cluster offers profound insights into the driving and dependence power of the outlined strategies, elaborating on their pivotal roles and the resultant impact on advancing inclusive and sustainable industrialization. 5.3.1 Cluster 1: autonomous CDTs strategies None of the strategies were categorized into this cluster, highlighting that all twelve identified strategies in our research play a pivotal role in promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization. These strategies are forward-looking and have a direct impact on achieving sustainable industrialization across diverse activities, underscoring the crucial role of leveraging Cognitive Digital Twins and implementing human-centric and sustainable practices within Industry 5.0.  5.3.2 Cluster 2: dependent CDTs strategies The strategies categorized as dependent within the realm of Cognitive Digital Twins exhibit low driving power but exhibit substantial dependence power. This specific cluster envelops strategies OD3, ED1, ED2, and ED3. OD3 reflects Governance Structures, ED1 signifies Emission Reduction, ED2 is synonymous with Resource Conservation, and ED3 denotes Environmental Compliance. These strategies are critical, emphasizing regulatory adherence and environmental sustainability. The realization of these strategies is essential for mitigating environmental impacts and promoting cleaner, sustainable production within the Industry 5.0 framework in India's industrial sector.  5.3.3 Cluster 3: linkage CDTs strategies The linkage strategies manifest considerable driving and dependence power, serving as pivotal elements in the interconnected web of industrial strategies. Included within this cluster are strategies HD1, HD2, and HD3. HD1 denotes Job Security and Skill Augmentation, HD2 represents Workplace Safety Monitoring, and HD3 stands for Employee Autonomy. These strategies, being the linchpins of workplace safety and employee well-being, play a crucial role in achieving a harmonious integration of human intellect and advanced technologies. The implementation of these strategies is paramount in fostering a conducive and sustainable working environment, thereby promoting the ideals of inclusivity and environmental sustainability inherent to Industry 5.0 and aligned with SDG 9.2. By prioritizing these linkage strategies, industries can make significant strides towards realizing the vision of a more human-centric industrial paradigm, where technological advancements are leveraged to enhance human capabilities and foster sustainable and inclusive industrialization, particularly in the diverse socio-economic landscape of India.  5.3.4 Cluster 4: independent CDTs strategies Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) stand at the forefront of the Industry 5.0 revolution, marking a transformative leap in industrial operations. They embody an advanced integration of AI, machine learning, and real-time analytics, enabling industries to not just mirror physical processes but to anticipate, adapt, and optimize them.
