                  A key interlinking factor of many global issues is the accumulated negative effects of pollution and poor resource/land management of our remaining natural resources. Emerging applications of microalgal biotechnology demonstrate the potential for microalgae to solve some of these challenges by reducing aquatic pollutants, as well as providing a source of sustainably produced feedstock for product development. This review describes how microalgal biotechnology can assist in the achievement of a number of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Affordable and Clean Energy, Responsible Consumption and Production, Life Below Water and Life on Land.

University of Technology Sydney PO Box 123 Broadway NSW 2007 Australia       A key interlinking factor of many global issues is the accumulated negative effects of pollution and poor resource/land management of our remaining natural resources. Emerging applications of microalgal biotechnology demonstrate the potential for microalgae to solve some of these challenges by reducing aquatic pollutants, as well as providing a source of sustainably produced feedstock for product development. This review describes how microalgal biotechnology can assist in the achievement of a number of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Affordable and Clean Energy, Responsible Consumption and Production, Life Below Water and Life on Land.   Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image       Keywords Sustainable transformation  Bioremediation  Bioplastics  Nutraceuticals  UN SDG    1 Introduction The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) provide an evidence-based framework for the sustainable transformation of the wellbeing of both people and planet at regional, national, and global scales (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 , Allen et al., 2019 ). Unanimously endorsed by all 193 member states of the UN in 2015, the SDG framework is comprised of 17 global priorities and 169 associated targets that were set to be implemented over the next 15 years, to 2030 (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). All 17 SDGs are interlinked and integrated, meaning that an action in one SDG will affect the outcomes in other SDGs, and that any development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Ensuring delivery on all SDGs by 2030 will require a concerted global effort, particularly with respect to overcoming both technological and monetary constraints (Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ). The UN describes that due to the scale and ambition of the SDGs, a revitalized global partnership, coupled with international public finance is required to ensure its implementation (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). However, while many of the member countries have begun to develop policies and implemented actions in several SDGs, the 2020 SDG Index, a global ranking of each member’s current performance and activity trends in relation to the 17 SDG, highlights that most countries were not on track to achieve their SDGs by 2030 (Sachs et al., 2020 ). The 2020 SDG Index was assessed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and it is anticipated that the pandemic, and the associated global financial crisis, would result in significant setbacks for achieving the SDGs by 2030 (Sachs et al., 2020 ; Srivastava et al., 2020 ). In addition to this, there has, to date, been little in the way of global partnership for addressing the SDGs (Fues, 2020 ; Vaggi, 2020 ). Many countries face the challenge of achieving sustainability in times of growing population, uneven development across regions within their country and resource scarcity under rapidly developing economies, or poor countries (Xu et al., 2020 ). The 2030 agenda does recognise technology as the pillar for achieving SDG and that technological innovation is vital for more effective global goal implementation (UN Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs., 2018 , Schwindenhammer & Gonglach 2021 ). However, the forecasted failure of SDG achievement implies that existing technologies are not advanced sufficiently to balance economic, environmental, and societal needs, or may not provide a holistic balance between SDGs. Such setbacks highlight the need to accelerate novel technological innovation to progress sustainable development across the globe (Bhaduri et al., 2016 ). An alternative hypothesis for such technological setbacks is a perceived poor interface between researchers of novel technologies and stakeholders investing into, and applying, such technologies. This can often be the result of poorly communicated science, where researchers directly engage with non-academic stakeholder partners to present multifaceted and complex processes, particularly in sustainability science (Suldovsky et al., 2017 ). Improved science communication of novel technologies for sustainability science helps move communication processes away from one-way transmission models toward engaged approaches, where stakeholders are engaged with the science (Lindenfeld et al., 2012 ). Microalgae, including both eutrophic algae and cyanobacteria, are photosynthetic organisms that utilise sunlight to fix carbon into various organic compounds. While predominately autotrophic, some species can undergo heterotrophic growth, meaning that they can use an external carbon source for metabolism. Their biomass is rich in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, with a typical percentage composition (dry weight of biomass), ranging 7-69%, 15-84%, and 1-63%, respectively. In addition to these macromolecular compounds, microalgae are capable of producing a broad range of pigments, including chlorophylls, phycobilins and carotenoids, and a diverse range of secondary metabolites that are increasingly being recognised for their value in novel product production and biotechnological applications. With over 200,000 species recognised, to date, this highly diverse group of microorganisms can be found occupying habitats from the polar regions to hot springs, acid to alkaline environments and from fresh to hypersaline waters (Masojídek and Prášil, 2010 ; Guiry, 2012 ; Guiry and Guiry, 2021 ). Such ecological diversity reflects the breadth of chemical diversity amongst the secondary metabolites produced by microalgae, providing efficient metabolic adaptation to grow rapidly when favourable conditions allow (Smetacek, 1999 ; Litchman, 2007 , Chu and Phang, 2019 ). Secondary metabolites are thought to be play a role in predator defence, protection against infection by various microorganisms, sexual communication and competitor exclusion (Coates et al., 2013 ). Many of these secondary metabolites are structurally complex molecules, which are difficult, or impossible to produce by chemical synthesis (Dewi et al., 2018 ). Many microalgal species can be easily cultured and have short generation times, with average doubling times of 4 - 8 hours, which can be further optimised through modification of culture conditions (Chu and Phang, 2019 ). They are increasingly appealing for biotechnological applications as they offer several advantages over traditional crop cultivation (Khanra et al., 2018 ). This includes the ability to cultivate microalgae at large-scale on non-arable land that would otherwise preclude crop cultivation, their higher photosynthetic efficiency and production capacity compared to traditional crops, their ability to grow year-round, and they can even grow in brackish waters, seawater or wastewaters (Demirbas, 2009 ; Bhola et al., 2014 ; Benedetti et al., 2018 ). However, to date, only a small number of microalgal species are used for a relatively small number of industrial applications, including food and nutraceuticals, cosmetics, aquaculture feed, and pigments. Examples of current industrial applications of these species are provided in the sections below, as well highlights of some significant recent initiatives and investments taking place. The purpose of this review is to help facilitate science engagement with the broader community on novel microalgal biotechnologies and how they can assist in the achievement of a number of SDGs. Specifically, we outline microalgal technological innovation as it relates to sustainable development and how microalgae will assist with the achievement of SDGs. This review provides an overview of these technologies, the current limitations and steps needed to facilitate their advancement in broad terms for policy makers, stakeholders, end-users and the broader SDG community. The microalgal technological innovations and how they support SDGs, both directly and indirectly, are summarised in Table 1   and Figure 1  .  2 Sustainable development goal 2 – zero hunger Adequate nutrition and food security are of increasing concern, with an estimated 815 million people undernourished in 2017, 2 billion people suffering from micronutrient malnutrition and 42 million people overweight (Development Initiatives, 2017 ; Blesh et al., 2019 ). This has led to a decline in human health, which is anticipated to be further exacerbated under the impacts of climate change, including water scarcity, extreme weather events and decreased ecosystem health (Willett et al., 2019 ). SDG-2 (Zero Hunger), seeks to simultaneously address global food security challenges, improve human nutrition and promote sustainable agricultural practices (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Specifically, Goal 2.1 of SDG-2 states that “by 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round” (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). However, achieving global environmental sustainability and food security simultaneously will require transformative political and economic change, as well as transforming the way we grow our food (Blesh et al., 2019 ; Willett et al., 2019 ). Protein is an essential macronutrient and adequate intake is one of the key nutritional factors to maintain adequate health and functionality during developmental stages and to prevent sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and strength), frailty and associated comorbidities in later life (Bauer et al., 2013 ; Semba, 2016 ; Bradlee et al., 2018 ). With increased pressure on freshwater resources and the decline in arable land, the demand for dietary protein to support the growing human population is no longer sustainable through animal-based protein products alone (Lucas et al., 2015 ). In order to meet the goals of SDG-2.1, as well as those of SDG-6 (Clean Water & Sanitation), SDG-14 (Life below Water), and SDG-15 (Life on Land), alternative protein sources and more water-efficient food production systems need to be developed. Microalgae have long been recognised for their nutritional properties and are considered to be a rich source of protein, with some species having a protein content of up to 50% of dry biomass (Ishika et al., 2018 ). Microalgal-derived protein (of those screened, to date), is considered to be a complete protein, meaning that it contains all of the essential amino acids required in the human diet, whereas higher plant-based proteins are often lacking in one or more essential amino acids, such as leucine, lysine, or methionine (Gorissen et al., 2018 ; Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ). The overall amino acid profile of microalgal proteins is similarly well-balanced as the profiles of ‘gold standard’ proteins, such as egg albumin and lactoglobulin (Williams and Laurens, 2010 ). While microalgae have been used in human nutritional supplements over several decades, they are increasingly being utilised as bulk ingredients in manufactured foods, such as snacks, pastas, noodles and cereals, to increase not only the protein content, but the overall nutritional benefits (Liang et al., 2004 ). The cyanobacterium, Arthrospira platensis  (spirulina) and the green alga, Chlorella vulgaris  (chlorella) are two examples of microalgae that are currently used as a protein additive in human food manufacturing (Safi et al., 2014 ). More recently, microalgae have been used as a non-animal source of protein for food processing, aiding the development of animal-free meat substitutes (Grahl et al., 2018, 2020 ). In some cases, microalgae have been used to replace soy protein, in regions whose water is too salty or there is limited land area for traditional crops (Becker, 2004 ; Grahl et al., 2020 ). Much of the microalgal protein market is driven by consumer demand for both alternative and sustainable protein sources, to satisfy the increasing numbers of people adopting vegetarian and vegan diets (Willett et al., 2019 ). In addition to augmenting the human food market, microalgae are used as a food source and feed supplement in the aquaculture and agriculture industries, including shell and fin fish, ruminants, pigs and poultry (Sousa et al., 2008 ; Koyande et al., 2019 ). The rapid global expansion of the aquaculture industry has meant that supplies of traditional feedstocks, such as fishmeal, have been unable to meet demand and alternative feedstocks, such as microalgae, are needed (Shah et al., 2018 ). In addition to meeting feedstock demands, the use of microalgae feed in shellfish aquaculture provides a more sustainable source of seafood than using fishmeal and could even protect the marine environment from the pollution generated by fish farms by reusing the wastewater generated as a nutrient source for microalgal growth (Nunes et al., 2003 ; Holdt and Edwards, 2014 ). However, some challenges associated with microalgal replacement of fishmeal include production costs (Sarker et al., 2016 ), if not coupled with a microalgal treatment system such as food-waste and selecting suitable microalgal strains for optimal digestibility (Skrede et al., 2011 ). While Goal 2.1 addresses the need for adequate food supplies, Goal 2.2 addresses malnutrition, specifically “By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons” (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Micronutrient malnutrition is a term used to refer to diseases caused by a dietary deficiency of vitamins or minerals and is a major impediment to socioeconomic development and contributes to a vicious circle of underdevelopment, to the detriment of already underprivileged groups (FAO, 1997 ). For example, vitamin A deficiency affects children worldwide and anaemia and iron deficiency affect more than 2 billion people in virtually all countries (Miller, 2013 ; Ritchie, 2017 ). A number of strategies have been identified as measures to prevent and control micronutrient malnutrition including dietary improvement, including increased production and consumption of micronutrient-rich foods; food fortification and supplementation and other global public health and disease control measures (Cashman and O’Dea, 2019 ; Samuel et al., 2019 ; Kwasek et al., 2020 ). Microalgae are recognised as a valuable source of lipids, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals (Becker, 2004 ). Many polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial, or essential for human health, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), linolenic acid and α-linolenic acid, with cold-water fish the main dietary source of PUFAs for most humans. (Swanson et al., 2012 ; Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ). However, commercial fisheries are generally regarded as being environmentally unsustainable (Di Minin et al., 2019 ; Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ). Considering that fish derive their PUFAs from the consumption of microalgae, microalgal biomass represents an alternative dietary source of PUFA. With a biomass comprised of between 5 – 50% PUFA, microalgae could provide the same nutritional benefits without the environmental offsets of commercial fishing (Bhattacharya and Goswami, 2020 ; Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ). In addition to direct supplementation into human diets, consumption of DHA-rich microalgae has been shown to enhance the nutritional quality of lamb, pigs, cows and poultry, resulting in more favourable PUFA to saturated fatty acid ratios and increased levels of DHA (Díaz et al., 2017 ; Long et al., 2018 ; Moran et al., 2018 ). Another area where microalgae are increasingly being recognised is as dietary supplements, to address nutrient deficiencies, and as nutraceuticals, to support the treatment and prevention of disease. Currently, there are a number of microalgal supplements on the market. Predominantly these include unprocessed spirulina or chlorella powder, as well as Haematococcus  sp., Dunaliella  sp. and Chlamydomonas  sp., which are all internationally recognised as being safe for human consumption. The majority of microalgal nutraceutical clinical trials, to date, have focused on spirulina and chlorella powdered supplements. A systematic review of 25 randomised clinical trials analysed the role of dietary spirulina supplementation in dyslipidaemia (elevated blood lipids), diabetes, hypertension, exercise, immune response, inflammation and precancerous lesions and allergic rhinitis and found considerable benefits in health outcomes for all these conditions (de la Jara et al., 2018 ). Another meta-analysis by Serban et al. (2016)  found spirulina supplementation significantly reduced plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides and elevated HDL-C. In a study assessing the effects of spirulina supplements on undernourished children, Matondo et al. (2016)  found that the children’s nutritional status quickly and significantly improved when their diets were augmented with 10 g of spirulina daily. Studies have also shown favourable nutraceutical benefits of chlorella. For example, chlorella supplementation has been reported to improve levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose (Fallah et al., 2018 ). Evidence also suggests that chlorella supplementation can accelerate wound healing, enhance immune function and lowering serum and total cholesterol (Merchant and Andre, 2001 ). Clinical results with chlorella and spirulina, coupled with the overall nutritional properties of microalgae, their reported in vitro  biological activities, and the wide diversity that exists, makes microalgae attractive for further exploration as a micronutrient-rich food to improve targeted health outcomes (Borowitzka, 1995 ; Barkia et al., 2019 ; Fabris et al., 2020 ). These could address not only malnutrition, but also contribute to the prevention or treatment of disease. The metabolomic plasticity of algae in responding to environmental cues, ability to grown in controlled environments to promote production of targeted compounds also contributes to its appeal. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which whole powder supplement, as well as refined ingredients, interact at the cellular level, as well trials to clarify the clinical value of other microalgal strains (Merchant and Andre, 2001 ; Serban et al., 2016 ). Despite microalgae’s potential as novel protein, PUFA sources, health supplements and nutraceuticals, there are a number of challenges to overcome, in this regard, as they are not routinely recognised as a food and can be perceived negatively due to their association with algal blooms and water fouling. Currently, only six microalgal taxa are recognised as being safe for human consumption by the primary markets for algae food products (the U.S.A, European Union, Canada, China and Japan) (Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ). The legislation regulating the use of microalgae beyond the current accepted species, ingredients and applications is also difficult to navigate. Many countries lack a clear authority for regulating microalgae (Trentacoste et al., 2015 ) and offer little guidance for approving “novel foods” (Vigani et al., 2015 ). New laws clarifying the authority and process responsible for microalgae applications in each country are needed to support the adoption of more species for food sources, which would increase product lines, improve nutritional values and increase sustainable and cost-effective food productions. In addition to providing alternative food and nutraceutical sources in support of SDG-2, microalgal food production systems can support sustainable cultivation practices, in support of SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production), SDG-14 and SDG-15. For example, estimated protein yields from microalgal production ranges from 3.6 – 13.6 tonnes ha-1  yr-1 , compared to terrestrial crops production of 1, 1.8 and 1 tonnes ha-1  yr-1 , for wheat, pulse legumes and soybean, respectively (Van Krimpen et al., 2013 ; McCauley et al., 2020 ). With increasing demands on freshwater supplies and its security increasingly uncertain under climate change, as well as ever decreasing arable land, developing alternative food sources that do not rely on freshwater or arable land is vital. Farming microalgae offers a potentially feasible food and natural nutraceutical alternatives, providing food components of high nutritional value, using more sustainable farming practices in order to support the main goals of SDG-2. Improving nutrition and food supplies in low- and middle-income countries will also help to support the goals of SDG-10 (Reduced Inequalities) by ensuring everyone has access to nutritional food. The need to create a more resilient food system is evident in the efforts of companies such as Provectus Algae, an Australian based synthetic biology company and of Australia’s first commercial algae processing facilities (Provectus Algae Pty, 2021 ). Provectus Algae focuses on developing nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, food and feed supplements and have achieved recent success in obtaining a $3.25 million in Seed funding  led by Hong Kong-based Vectr Ventures. They have also been supported at a Government level having successfully received, to date, a $100,000 grant from the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund (MMF) to support transformative investments in new and innovative technologies and processes, as well as $250,000 Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre grant and a $40,000 Accelerating Commercialisation Fund (Cumbers, 2020 , Llew O’Brien, 2020a, 2020b , TCF Services, 2021 , Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre Ltd, 2021 ). In Australia alone, significant progress in microalgal research translation and commercialisation has been demonstrated. For example, the company Qponics, in partnership with the University of Queensland, received a AU$1 million Cooperative Research Centres Project (CRC-P) grant for the application of latest technologies for the production of high-value nutraceutical and food supplements, as well as protein from marine microalgae (Qponics, 2021 ; Australian Government Business, 2021 ) Other important milestones in the development of microalgal-based food supplements include the partnership of the algal company Corbion with the multinational company Nestle for the development of microalgae-based ingredients for plant-based products and the algal technology company Algenuity with multinational company Unilever for the development of innovative future foods (Algenuity, 2020 ; Cumbers, 2020 ; Nestle, 2021 ). Microalgae have been also recognised in The Future 50 Foods Report, produced in partnership with food and beverage company Knorr, The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWR) and the Director of The Center for Public Health Nutrition at the University of Washington (Knorr and WWF, 2019 ).  3 Sustainable development goal 6 – clean water and sanitation The availability of clean water is vital for the environment, human health, and economic development. Clean water availability is considered to be a major threat to sustainable development, with an estimated 4 billion people affected by water scarcity in 2015 (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016 ). By 2030, a 40 % shortfall in freshwater resources is anticipated without further action (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). SDG-6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) focuses on improving the global availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation, including increased wastewater treatment, pollution reduction and improved water recycling (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Specifically, Goal 6.3 states that “By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally” (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). While current models indicate that SDG-6 is physically achievable, yearly global costs to meet the targets are estimated to be within the order of US$100 billion, with an additional USD$1.5 – 3 trillion (in 2015 prices) required for existing infrastructure improvement, using mechanical / chemical treatment processes (Hutton and Varughese, 2016 ; Dilekli and Cazcarro, 2019 ). For many rural communities, towns and low- to middle- income countries, conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) for pollution mitigation and water recycling are not financially feasible (Lüthi and Panesar, 2013 ). The use of microalgae to bioremediate nutrient enriched wastewaters has been successfully demonstrated at a range of scales, including full-scale systems. The premises for microalgae wastewater treatment is that they require the major nutrients carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus for growth and assimilate these into their biomass from the overlying water. Aerobic bacteria grown in association with the microalgae, breaks down the organic matter in the wastewater, releasing dissolved nutrients in the process, making them accessible for microalgal uptake and growth. This coupled process results in a reduction in dissolved nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as biological and chemical oxygen demands, producing an effluent of higher quality. High Rate Algal Ponds (HRAP) are one type of microalgal-based treatment system that are recognised as a cost effective and efficient upgrade to conventional wastewater treatment ponds (Craggs et al., 2015 ). These specialised ponds have been used in the treatment of a wide range of wastewaters, including municipal, agricultural and industrial (de Godos et al., 2009, 2010 ; Craggs et al., 2015 ). HRAPs are shallow, paddlewheel-mixed, open raceway-style ponds designed to enhance both the growth of free-floating microalgae and their nutrient assimilation, resulting in higher levels of nutrient removal compared to conventional wastewater ponds (Benemann, 2008 ; Rawat et al., 2011 ; Craggs et al., 2012 ). Reported ammonium-nitrogen removal rates range from 50 - 75%, while phosphorus removal rates range from 5- 50%, in full-scale HRAPs treating municipal wastewater (Rawat et al., 2011 ; Craggs et al., 2012 ; Sutherland et al., 2018 ). In comparison, removal rates in conventional wastewater treatment ponds range from 10 - 20% for ammonium-nitrogen and 10 – 25% for total phosphorus (Nurdogan and Oswald, 1995 ; Craggs et al., 2003 ; Borowitzka and Moheimani, 2013 ). Biomass production and nutrient assimilation can be further enhanced through the addition of CO2 , from flue gas or biogas, into the ponds. Carbon is an essential nutrient for microalgal production, comprising approximately 50% of its organic biomass, and can often become limiting in HRAPs (Park and Craggs, 2010 ). CO2  augmentation into HRAPs have been shown to increase wastewater treatment as a result of increased biomass production and associated nutrient assimilation (Park and Craggs, 2010 ). In addition to nutrient removal, these open ponds enhance solar UV- mediated disinfection of pathogens, due to the photosynthetically elevated dissolved oxygen and pH in the HRAPs, resulting in a combined secondary and partial tertiary wastewater treatment (Davies-Colley et al., 2003 ; Rawat et al., 2011 ). HRAPs can be scaled to accommodate the treatment requirements from farm scale, local communities, and towns. The capital and operational costs of HRAPs are estimated to be only 25–33% of those of secondary-level activated sludge treatment, making them affordable for small towns, communities and low- to middle- income countries (Green et al., 1995 ; Downing et al., 2002 ). While HRAPs are a well-established technology, to date, only two full-scale wastewater treatment HRAPs have been built globally, both in New Zealand. The 5-ha HRAP system based in Christchurch, New Zealand was built in partnership with the Christchurch City Council, as part of a demonstration wastewater to biofuels project. The 2-ha Enhanced Pond System, comprising of covered anaerobic ponds, HRAPs, gravity harvesters and maturation ponds, based in Cambridge, New Zealand, was built in conjunction with Waipa District Council to demonstrate nutrient removal capabilities to meet statutory requirements. Both systems were retrofitted into existing conventional oxidation ponds, demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of such an upgrade. Details of the design, construction, operation, and performance of these two HRAP systems are provided in the literature of Craggs et al. (2012, 2014 & 2015)  and Sutherland et al. (2014, 2018 & 2020) . While both full-scale systems successfully demonstrated high microalgal productivity and wastewater treatment, the authors noted that there was further capacity for enhancing the HRAP performance for both increased nutrient removal and recovery (Sutherland et al., 2018, 2020 ). However, harvesting of microalgal biomass still remains one of the major drawbacks from HRAPs becoming applied technology. Microalgal biomass needs to be removed from the HRAP effluent in order to a) meet local authority discharge requirements and b) achieve cost-effective and efficient resource recovery in support of the circular bio-economy (Sutherland et al., 2018 ). Harvesting is discussed further below (Next Steps). In addition to nutrient and pathogen pollution, the presence of emerging contaminants (EC) in aquatic systems and their associated risks to human health have negative implications for SDG-6. ECs are primarily synthetic organic compounds that fall into several broad categories including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, illicit drugs, pesticides and flame retardants (Petrie et al., 2015 ; Norvill et al., 2016 ; Tran et al., 2018a, 2018b ). Most ECs enter waterways via human-mediated routes, with the greatest source coming from the discharge of raw, or treated, municipal and industrial wastewater streams (Tran et al., 2018a, 2018b ; Villar-Navarro et al., 2018 ). Expanding populations, coupled with increased water reuse, is likely to exasperate EC accumulation both in the environment and the food-chain, with potentially unpredictable long-term consequences (Martínez-Piernas et al., 2018 ). WWTP are not currently designed to sufficiently treat and remove ECs from the wastewater and adaptation of the WWTP to do so may not be practical, or financially feasible, so it is imperative that new technologies are developed that can be applied to a range of ECs, across a range of industrial scales. Microalgae can bioremediate ECs via three main pathways; bioadsorption, bio-uptake and biodegradation. EC bioadsorption occurs when the contaminant is either adsorbed to microalgal cell wall, or onto organic substances excreted by the microalgae, while bio-uptake of ECs involves the active transport of the contaminant into the cell, where it binds to intracellular proteins and other compounds (Sutherland and Ralph, 2019 ). Successful microalgal bioadsorption of ECs is dependent on the chemical nature of the compound itself, with cationic, lipophilic (lipid soluble) compounds able to bind to the microalgal cell wall more readily than hydrophilic (water soluble) compounds. Studies have shown microalgal bioadsorption rates of the lipophilic pharmaceuticals Biperiden, Trihexyphenidyl, Clomipramine and Amitriptyline exceeded 70%, whereas the hydrophilic pharmaceuticals Fluconazole, Trimetoprim, Codeine, Carbamazepine, Oxazepam and Tramadol, had low (0-20%) microalgal bioadsorption rates (Peng et al., 2014 ; de Wilt et al., 2016 ; Gojkovic et al., 2019 ). Both bioadsorption and bio-uptake processes act as a biological filter to remove ECs from the wastewater but there is no detoxification of the contaminant and this merely serves to concentrate and remove the EC from the water for more efficient management and disposal (Sutherland and Ralph, 2019 ). In contrast, microalgal biodegradation involves the transformation of the contaminant into simpler, less toxic compounds, effectively neutralising, or eliminating the EC. This provides one of the most promising technologies for the remediation of ECs from water sources, overcoming any issues associated with the disposal, or further treatment of, bioaccumulated or filtered EC-laden materials (Sutherland and Ralph, 2019 ). Biodegradation of ECs occurs through either direct metabolic degradation by the microalgal cell, or though indirect degradation (co-metabolism), where the EC is degraded by enzymes produced by the microalgae to catalyse other substrates present (Tiwari et al., 2017 ). Microalgal biodegradation of over 30 pharmaceuticals and personal care products have been reported in the literature, with synthetic hormones and antibiotics the most studied compounds (Norvill et al., 2016 ; Sutherland and Ralph, 2019 ). For example, microalgal biodegradation of the hormone progesterone and norgestrel (>95% degradation) has been demonstrated in the two freshwater microalgae, Scenedesmus obliquus  and Chlorella pyrenoidosa  (Peng et al., 2014 ). Similarly, Bai and Acharya (2016)  and Xiong et al. (2017)  reported up to 100% biodegradation of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin by Chlamydomonas mexicana  and Nannochloris  sp. While nutrient removal by microalgae is an established biotechnology, microalgal bioremediation of ECs is still in its infancy. Most studies have been conducted under controlled laboratory conditions and further research into bioremediation of prioritised ECs of concern is needed under outdoor, pilot-scale condition to better determine its effectiveness. In the case of biodegradation pathways, any toxicity associated with the breakdown product requires assessment. However, despite these challenges, coupling microalgal-based wastewater treatment with bioremediation of ECs has the potential to provide cost-effective remediation that will contribute to achieving SDG-6, particularly for communities where wastewater treatment would otherwise be cost prohibitive. Improved effluent water quality will lead to improved environmental outcomes in the receiving environment thus contributing to SDG-14 and SDG-15 as well as reducing the adverse per capita environmental impacts of cities in support of SDG-11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). Another advantage of using microalgae for wastewater treatment is the ability to recover resources, in the form of microalgal biomass and cleaner water, for beneficial re-use. The biomass can be processed in a biorefinery to produce products such as biogas, in support of SDG-7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), or algal-based plastics, to support SDG-12, while the water can be used for irrigation and non-potable applications and augmenting environmental flows for ecosystem protection in support of SDG-15. Wastewater treatment and resource recovery supports the principle of circular bioeconomy through the effective recycling and reuse of waste products for sustainable development, with flow-on effects that benefit other SDGs, including SDG-10, through reduced inequality, and SDG-13 (Climate Action), through reduced adverse environmental impacts. An excellent recognition of the ability of microalgae for wastewater treatment and resource recovery is evident in the EUR€1.7 million LIFE ALGAECAN project. This project, funded in 2017 explores a sustainable treatment model of high nutrient loaded and salty effluents that combines cost-effective heterotrophic algae cultivation with spray drying harvesting of microalgae, to obtain a product of commercial interest as raw material for the production of biofertilisers, animal feed and bioplastics. This project was established to promote the fulfilment of important directives and European Union (EU) priorities, such as the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, the Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste, Directive 2008/1/EC on the integrated prevention and pollution control (IPPC) and Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of renewable energies in the European Union (Algenuity, 2020 ).  4 Sustainable development goal 7 – affordable and clean energy Energy supply is considered essential for both the economic development of a country and the wellbeing of its people. However, in 2017, it was estimated that one-third of the global population suffers energy poverty, meaning that they do not have adequate access to affordable energy (Carrington and Stephenson, 2018 ). Sustainable and affordable energy is, therefore, one of the most important contributory factors for achieving global sustainable development (Villavicencio Calzadilla and Mauger, 2018 ). SDG-7 seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, specifically Goal 7.1 states “By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services” (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Biofuels have been highlighted as playing a key role in the development of affordable renewable energy, due to their proven low cost and sustainable technology (Acheampong et al., 2017 ; Wall et al., 2017 ). However, biofuels derived from food-crop plants (termed first generation biofuels), or general crops (termed second generation biofuels), grown on arable land, are a potential threat to food security and nutrition, particularly for low- and middle- income countries (Renzaho et al., 2017 ). Generating biofuels from food-crop plants, and associated resources, conflicts with the aim that all SDGs are interlinked and integrated, particularly negatively impacting on SDG-2, SDG-6, SDG-12, and SDG-15. Microalgae biomass is considered to be a suitable feedstock for third generation biofuel production, with demonstrated biofuel products including biodiesel, butanol, bioethanol, biogas (methane), bio-oil, and jet fuel (Chowdhury and Loganathan, 2019 ). With considerably higher biomass yields (20-30 times) and lower resource inputs than other feedstocks (Dragone et al., 2012 , Craggs et al., 2012 , Raheem et al., 2018 ), as well as their ability to grow under conditions unsuitable for crop plants, microalgal biofuels overcome a number of the shortcomings of first- and second- generation biofuels. However, one major limitation of microalgal biofuels is that the production costs for most of these microalgal biofuel products are still considered too high to be commercially viable, at this point (Chowdhury and Loganathan, 2019 ; Peng et al., 2020 ). This is mainly driven by the low percentage solids within microalgal cultures that require concentrating, or harvesting, for efficient biofuel production. However, to date, cost-effective concentrating and / or harvesting of microalgae remains elusive. Coupling microalgal biofuel production with wastewater treatment is one way to make it more economically viable, as costs associated with microalgal production and harvest are part of the wastewater treatment costs, essentially producing free feedstock for biofuel production (Benemann, 2003 ; Rawat et al., 2011 ). An additional environmental benefit from producing biofuels from microalgal wastewater treatment HRAP with CO2  addition, is greenhouse gas (GHG) emission abatement, in support of SDG-13. GHG offsets occur through (Benemann, 2003 ; Lundquist et al., 2010 ):1. Reduction in electricity used for wastewater treatment (HRAPs use considerably less electricity compared to conventional wastewater treatment systems);  2. Substitution of biofuels in place of fossil fuels, and;  3. Use of nutrient-rich microalgal biofuel residues (recovered wastewater nutrients) as a fertilizer (reducing GHG emissions associated with nitrogenous fertilizer production and phosphate rock mining).    While large-scale microalgal biofuel production is still not cost effective, biogas could potentially be sustainably produced from microalgae, providing a niche supply of energy to small communities such as on-farm electricity generation, or rural communities in low-income countries, where supply of other forms of fuel are unreliable. Microalgal biomass harvested from the HRAPs, as well as other organic solids from wastewater, could be used as a nutrient-rich feed source for anaerobic bacteria in the production of biogas (Kwietniewska and Tys, 2014 ). The decomposition of organic biomass by a microbial consortium in an oxygen-free environment, results in the production of methane and CO2 . Nitrogen and phosphorus are remineralised and released from the decomposed biomass into the liquid phase, which can be fed back into the HRAP to generate more biomass (Sialve et al., 2009 ; Craggs et al., 2015 ), providing effective nutrient bioremediation and improving the circular bioeconomy of microalgal biofuel production. The raw biogas produced (consisting of 50–70% methane and 30–50% CO2 ) can be used directly for low-tech applications, such as boiler fuel, while biomethane (>97% methane), produced as a result of biogas purification, is essentially identical to natural gas and can be used as fuel for machines, vehicles, heating and electricity generation (Heubeck and Craggs, 2010 ; Wall et al., 2017 ). Production costs of microalgal biogas can be further reduced through the use of simple covered anaerobic ponds (CAP). These ponds are considered low technology, as they can be built in-ground, are unmixed and unheated, operating at ambient temperature in the psychrophilic range (5–30°C), requiring no additional energy inputs, unlike the more sophisticated mesophilic digesters (Heubeck and Craggs, 2010 ). Wet biomass with as little as 2% solids is suitable for digestion in CAPs, as the pond promotes sedimentation of solids and subsequent anaerobic decomposition to methane. CAPs can work in conjunction with HRAPs to improve efficiencies of both systems. Smaller scale CAP digestion and biogas capture has been successfully demonstrated but a large-scale demonstration is needed to help advance the development of affordable energy technologies in support of SDG-7, particularly for low- to middle- income countries. Examples of research into microalgal biogas include that undertaken at the Murdoch University, where research in algal cultivation to maximise productivity and provide valuable by-products is being investigated with demonstrated success in using microalgae to treat piggery effluent and then produce lower value products aquaculture feed, plant fertiliser and biofuel (Ayre et al., 2017 , Murdoch University, 2021 ). Biogas production coupled to repeat microalgae cultivation using a closed nutrient loop was also recently demonstrated with results showing the microalgae Scenedemus dimorphus  is a suitable substrate for anaerobic digestion (González-González et al., 2018 ). Thus whilst, production costs of microalgal biofuel products are currently too high to be commercially viable, research is continuing to address these limitations and capitalise on this microalgal attribute. Provision of affordable energy helps to support a number of SDGs, including SDG-10, SDG-11, and SDG-12.  5 Sustainable development goal 12 – responsible consumption and production Over the last century, unsustainable economic and social development have negatively impacted on global environmental wellbeing (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Sustainable consumption and production are therefore identified as one of the essential requirements for achieving sustainable development, forming the basis of SDG-12 (UNGA 2015, Wang et al., 2019 ). Plastic is recognised as an essential product in modern-day life, with most advances of human society over the past century facilitated, in some manner, by the use of plastics (North and Halden, 2013 ). However, our high usage of plastics has raised concerns regarding its sustainability, due to the dependency on fossil fuel for its production, as well as plastic pollution negatively impacting on ecosystems and threatening human health (Beckstrom et al., 2020 ). It is now well recognised that our current plastics practice is not sustainable and enhanced sustainable production and use of bioplastic products is needed to support SDG-12 (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 , Copello de Souza 2019 ). Bioplastics are polymers that are produced from renewable natural sources such as polysaccharides, lipids, or proteins, or are synthesised from renewable resources such as polyesters produced from bio-derived monomers (such as polylactic acid from starch) (Karamanlioglu et al., 2017 ). The use of microalgae for bioplastics is currently in its infancy, with the technology routes for the production of algal-based bioplastics still under the research phase and are far from commercialisation (Balaji et al., 2013 ; Beckstrom et al., 2020 ). However, algal-based bioplastics are considered to be an environmentally friendly alternative compared to conventional petro-plastics and can be used in a range of consumable and disposable plastic products (Balaji et al., 2013 ). Estimated annual production costs for microalgal-based plastic are USD$ 970/tonne, which is within the estimated range for other bioplastic resources (USD$ 800-1200/ tonne) (Beckstrom et al., 2020 ). Production costs can be further reduced when coupled with microalgal wastewater treatment, in support of SDG-6, as described previously. Bioplastics from microalgae can be produced in three ways: (i) direct production of from microalgae; (ii) hybrid plastics, made by blending microalgae with commercially available synthetic plastics; or, (iii) extraction of different cellular components from the microalgae for production of bioplastics thereof. In hybrid plastics, the addition of algal biomass as a filler decreases the amount of petroleum used per unit plastic and, in some instances, can improve the biodegradability of traditional plastic (Zeller et al., 2013 ). Hybrid plastics have been shown to have improved mechanical properties compared to their petroleum derived plastic counterpart. For example, Shi et al. (2017)  found that the addition of A. plantensis  into poly(vinyl alcohol) film (PVA), with glycerol as plasticizer, improved the mechanical performance and the water-resistance of the film. Similarly, Tran et al. (2018a, 2018b)  studied the effect of the addition of lipid-extracted algal biomass (LEA) from the microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana  into poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and reported improved mechanical properties of the biocomposite with 20% loading of LEA (Torres et al., 2015 ). One microalgal bioplastic manufactured from cellular components is poly(lactic) acid (PLA). PLA is a promising biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic polyester derived from the polymerisation of lactic acid, following fermentation of feedstock (Rasul et al., 2017 ). Lactic acid can be produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate-rich microalgal biomass and is believed to be economically viable at large-scale, but yet to be proven (Noreen et al., 2016 ; Rasul et al., 2017 ). Microalgal strains, including Chlorella  sp., Nannochloropsis  sp., Synechococcus  sp., and Scenedesmus  sp., that are rich in carbohydrates are considered promising precursor material for PLA production (Aikawa et al., 2014 ). Similarly, bioplastics can be made from starch extracted from microalgae. Studies have shown that starch-based microalgal bioplastic has higher mechanical and physical properties than its traditional counterpart (Ho et al., 2013 ). Currently, starch-based bioplastics are manufactured using food crops creating competition between food supply and sustainable production (SDG-2 and SDG-12) (Sagnelli et al., 2016 ). This conflict can be resolved by substituting wastewater grown microalgae as the raw material. Other plastics derived from microalgal cellular constituents include edible films, biodegradable sheets, encapsulations and thermoplastic blends from microalgal proteins (Wang et al., 2016 ), while a novel mixed polyester with a high melting and crystallization temperature, has been produced from oil extracted from Phaeodactylum tricornutum  (Roesle et al.2014). Bioplastic manufacturing from microalgal-derived polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) has received considerable interest in recent years. These biopolymers have similar mechanical properties as synthetic polymers, such as polypropylene, and are fully biodegradable, thus making them applicable in industrial, medicinal, and agricultural fields (Abdo and Ali, 2019 ) and are in alignment with the goals of SDG-12. A large number of cyanobacteria genera capable of accumulating PHA, by both phototrophic and heterotrophic growth strategies, have been reported in the literature, and due to their relatively rapid growth and ease of culturing, are considered to be a commercially viable option for microbe-based PHA production (Bhati et al., 2010 ; Koller and Muhr, 2014 ; Bengtsson et al. 2017 ). Currently, only modest quantities of cyanobacterial PHA are produced due to a lack of optimised growth conditions, and downstream processes to recover cyanobacterial PHA (Koller and Muhr, 2014 , Hernandez 2017). Similarly, PHB production has been reported in both cyanobacteria and green algae, with PHB reported in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis  sp. and Chlorella  sp. (Troschl et al., 2017 ; Roja et al., 2019 ; Price et al., 2020 ). As with PHA, PHB-based bioplastics have significant benefits compared to conventional petroleum-based plastics but currently low productivity rates at commercial scale imposes a key challenge. Improved production strategies are therefore vital in order to make PHA- and PHB-based microalgal plastics an economically viable industry. These strategies may include pathway engineering, metabolic overexpression, and improved extraction processes coupled with bioprospecting for highly productive strains (Ansari and Fatma, 2016 ). The replacement of synthetic plastics with bioplastics reduces the sum total plastic pollutants (both from manufacturing and inappropriate disposal) also supports SDG-13, SDG-14 and particularly SDG-15. In support of this movement towards SG-12 and in recognition that the problem of plastic waste cannot be solved in isolation, the 2021 Virtual Rethinking Materials Innovation in Plastics brings together big multinational companies such as Unilever, PepsiCo, Kellogg Company and Lego and technology innovators such as Checkerspot, to discuss the changing landscape of plastics, bio-based alternatives, and circular solutions (Rethinking Materials, 2021 ). Checkpoint is one company using microalgae to produce performance materials and has already worked with WNDR Alpine to replace petroleum-based plastics used in skies with an algae-based performance material (Checkerspot, 2021 ; WNDR Wonder Alpine, 2021 ).  Similarly, the innovative company Native Shoes uses a foam technology that replaces 10% of plastic polymer with a ethylene-vinyl-acetate foam made, in part, from microalgal biomass (Zia and Zuber, 2017 ). Other applications of microalgae to support SDG-12 include protein source, pigments, nutraceuticals, animal and aquaculture feed and feed supplements, biogas and organic fertilisers (as discussed above and below). Other areas of increasing interest but early-stage research in microalgal application for SDG-12 include cellulose production for medicine, paper and textile industries, and enhanced production of existing and novel natural products such as sterols, antibodies and hormones through synthetic biology (Barolo et al., 2020 ; Fabris et al., 2020 ).  6 Sustainable development goal 14 – life below water Worldwide, water quality is a key concern for sustainable development. Land-use intensification and the associated run-off of contaminants, such as nutrients, sediment, and microorganisms, into waterways has resulted in eutrophication which, in turn, negatively impacts on aesthetic, biological, ecological, recreational, public health and economic values of the waterway (Sutherland et al., 2015 ). Such impacts are anticipated to negatively affect a large number of SDGs. Indeed, freshwater is considered to be so central to all SDGs that it is not currently recognised as a standalone SDG. Marine waterways, on the other hand, are recognised under SDG-14, with the UN committed to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Specifically, Goal 14.1 states that “By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution” (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Reducing nutrient pollution is, therefore, critical for improving aquatic habitats and ecosystem resilience. For the purpose of assessing the role microalgae can play in reducing nutrient pollution in waterways, we have incorporated freshwater alongside marine under SDG-14, due to the impacts that freshwater pollution can have on both on estuarine and coastal marine environments, as well as its impacts across all SDGs, particularly SDG-2, SDG-10, SDG-11, SDG-12 and SDG-13. Nutrient pollution entering waterways comes from both point and diffuse (non-point) sources (Lintern et al., 2020 ). Point source pollution, such as wastewater discharges, are addressed in SDG-6. On the other hand, diffuse pollution, such as agricultural runoff and storm-water, has been identified as a major source of nutrient input, in particular nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), into aquatic environments in many countries (e.g. Larsen et al., 1999 ; European Parliament, 2000 ; Strokal et al., 2016 ). While there are a number of diffuse nutrient pollution mitigation options currently available, these are not yet widely applied and even where they have been, they have not been as effective as anticipated and aquatic pollution has still occurred (McKergow et al., 2007 ). Inappropriate application, inadequate investment, or poor management of the mitigation option are all reasons identified for ineffective performance (McKergow et al., 2007 ). The development of new mitigation technologies that can be applied to a range of environments, operated along a pollution gradient and are cost-effective at a range of scales are vital to meet SDG-14 (Sutherland and Craggs, 2017 ). As with free-floating microalgae (see Section SDG-6 above), filamentous algae are able to quickly assimilate N and P from the overlying water into its biomass. By growing filamentous microalgae on an artificial stream, or flow-way, polluted water can be diverted onto the flow-way and the microalgae assimilate the nutrients from the water. This provides an opportunity to exploit filamentous microalgae as a biological treatment system for diffuse nutrient pollution in both fresh and coastal marine waterbodies. A range of filamentous microalgae treatment systems have been examined as potential cost-effective mitigation technologies for diffuse nutrient pollution, including algal turf scrubbers (ATS), filamentous algae nutrient scrubbers (FANS), periphyton-based storm-water treatment areas and periphyton ponds (Hydromentia, 2005 ; Mulbry et al., 2010 ). All treatment systems incorporate several key features, such as flowing water, shallow water depth, maximum light exposure, and frequent harvesting, that enhance both biomass production and nutrient assimilation by the filamentous microalgae (Sutherland and Craggs, 2017 ). Such systems have been trialled for a range of diffuse nutrient pollution, at a range of scales. In general, the amount of nutrient removed by the microalgae is dependent on the nutrient concentration in the polluted water, with removal rates increasing with increasing nutrient concentrations (Yun et al., 2015 ). On a one-hectare ATS, filamentous microalgae were able to remove up to 1.98 g m−2  d−1  of total nitrogen (TN) and up to 0.25 g m−2  d−1  of total phosphorus (TP) from stormwater, substantially reducing the nutrient loads entering Lake Okeechobee, Florida (Hydromentia, 2005 ). Similarly, on a 1.85 ha ATS constructed at the Egret Marsh Stormwater Park, filamentous microalgae removed an average 0.78 g m−2  d−1  of TN and 0.19 g m−2  d−1  of TP, equating to 5.3 tonnes of nitrogen and 1.3 tonnes of phosphorus removed from the stormwater per year (Calahan et al., 2015 ). In contrast, filamentous microalgae growing on a pilot-scale flow-way (2.5 m2 ) treating polluted reservoir water had much lower removal rates, averaging 0.18 g m−2  d−1  for TN and 0.02 g m−2  d−1  for TP (Yan et al., 2018 ). Reasons for the lower removal rates are unclear, as direct comparison between polluted water qualities could not be made. Filamentous microalgae flow-ways have also been used to remediate diffuse nutrient pollution associated with aquaculture facilities, including oyster, catfish, and shrimp farms (Valeta and Verdegem, 2009 ; Ray et al., 2015a, 2015b ; Mitchell, 2018 ). For example, a 1m2  ATS treating commercial oyster farm effluent, averaged TN and TP removal rates of 12.2 g m−2  d−1  and 0.25 g m−2  d−1 , respectively (Ray et al., 2015a, 2015b ). The authors estimated that, at full-scale, a total of 7.8 kg of N and 151.6 g of P could be removed per day, during peak production in the oyster farm (Ray et al., 2015a, 2015b ). Research on the optimisation of the operational parameters of the flow-ways, such as water depth, flow rates, nutrient loading and biomass harvesting, is anticipated to further enhance nutrient removal capacity of these systems. Constructed treatment wetlands (CTW) have traditionally been used a biological filter for diffuse pollution. However, CTW have a number of disadvantages over filamentous microalgae flow-ways, including higher construction costs, longer establishment times and lower nutrient removal rates (Sutherland and Craggs, 2017 ). In a review of available literature for the treatment of agricultural drainage water, Sutherland and Craggs (2017)  found that the average TN removal rates by filamentous microalgae were more than double that of CTW, while TP removal rates were more than four times that of CTW. The authors also noted that the main pathway for nutrient removal in a CTW was via nitrification and denitrification, for N and adsorption for P, while nutrient removal by the filamentous microalgae was via assimilation (Sutherland and Craggs, 2017 ). Higher nutrient removal rates coupled with higher hydraulic loadings, means that filamentous microalgae flow-ways have higher treatment capacity and lower capital costs per unit area of land compared to CTW (Hydromentia, 2005 ; Pizarro et al., 2006 ). Filamentous microalgal flow-ways also have the added advantage over CTW of recovering the microalgal biomass for use as feedstock for new products, in support of SDG-7 and SDG-12, as well as SDG-13.  7 Sustainable development goal 15 – life on land In the last 50 years, the total land for agriculture has only expanded by 10%, despite the world’s population increasing by 230%. (Foster, 2018 ). However, in order to meet SDG-2, we need to produce up to 100% more food, without accounting for climate change impacts (Pretty et al., 2010 ). Under current practices, this would mean an additional 109  hectares of land (~20% increase) converted to agriculture by 2050, with an accompanying 2.4 to 2.7-fold increase in eutrophication (Tilman et al., 2001 ). In addition to increased demand, climate change is likely to have an intensifying effect on current production stressors, including fertilizer use, overgrazing, higher atmospheric emissions, desertification, and a higher chance of crop failures (Minhas et al., 2017 ; Sivakumar, 2007 ). Such intensification would be unsustainable and fail to meet the objects of several SDGs, including SDG-2, SDG-12, and SDG-14. SDG-15 (Life on Land) aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). Specifically, Goal 15.3 states that “By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world” (UNGA (United Nations General Assembly), 2015 ). In order to meet the goals of SDG-15, whilst increasing food production to achieve SDG-2, sustainable agricultural practices need to be employed to ensure environmental, social, and economic needs are balanced. Fertilizers, often derived from fossil fuel sources, can increase nutrient run-off to waterways, when applied poorly, or in large quantities. As such, merely increasing fertilizer use will not achieve increased food production without environmental degradation (Tilman et al., 2001 ). Improving efficiencies through other means is therefore desirable and supports SDG-2, SDG-10, SDG-11, SDG-12, SDG-13 and SDG-14. One option is the use of biostimulants. Biostimulants are defined as products that enhance: nutrient use efficiency; tolerance to abiotic stress; quality traits; or availability of nutrients in the soil (Rouphael and Colla, 2020 ). These can either be addition of the entire microorganism (e.g. plant growth promoting (PGP) bacteria and fungi), or substances produced by biological organisms (e.g. phytohormones, humic substances, chitosan) (du Jardin, 2015 ). Algae are one promising source of biostimulants, as they produce several products that have been found to promote plant growth. Macroalgae already have a long history in being used as commercial soil additives, with seaweed extracts dominating the biostimulant market, with a market size estimated at USD$ 950 million in 2019. Microalgae on the other hand have only recently started gaining traction in this field, although they have demonstrated similar biostimulant properties as macroalgae (Chiaiese et al., 2018 ). Phytohormones are one of the major types of biostimulants, and can affect plants from germination to fruit budding, through to senescence. Several axenic cultures of algae have been demonstrated to possess these hormones (Labeeuw et al., 2016 ; Lu and Xu, 2015 ; Stirk et al., 2013b ; Stirk et al., 2013a ), as well as xenic cultures of algae and cyanobacteria (Tarakhovskaya et al., 2007 ; Tsavkelova et al., 2006 ). Biostimulant properties of microalgae have been demonstrated at a range of scales, including on seedlings in the lab, to hydroponics, to in greenhouse/open field experiments (Chiaiese et al., 2018 ; Renuka et al., 2018 ). For example, tomato seeds treated with the green alga Acutodesmus dimorphus  germinated 2 days faster than the control and resulted in greater number of flowers and branches per plant in greenhouses (Garcia-Gonzalez and Sommerfeld, 2016 ). Similarly, C. vulgaris  and Scenedesmus quadricauda  improved root traits in sugar beets that help with nutrient uptake (Barone et al., 2018 ). These same two algae also resulted in a 1.5 – 3-fold increase in tomato plant biomass when grown in a hydroponics system (Barone et al., 2019 ). In field trials with wheat, application of a 10% extract of A. plantensis  resulted in a 11% increase in the number of ears/m2 , while the number of grains per ear increased by 6% (Michalak et al., 2016 ). Microalgae have a range of biologically active metabolites (BAM), that can improve a plant’s ability to withstand environmental stressors. For example, microalgae can secrete tryptophan or arginine, which are the precursors for several plant hormones or polyamines, which in turn can improve the stress tolerance of the plant (Colla et al., 2016 ; Kalamaki et al., 2009 ). Some microalgal BAMs can act on the surrounding rhizosphere of the plants, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere. For example, the cyanobacterium Calothrix elenkinii  improved rice plant biomass almost 4-fold, while also increasing the culturable bacteria present (Priya et al., 2015 ). Microalgae (particularly cyanobacteria) can also aid in plant defence against pathogens, through the secretion of various antimicrobial compounds (Hernández-Carlos and Gamboa-Angulo, 2011 ; Renuka et al., 2018 ; Swain et al., 2017 ). For example, in cotton plants treated with cyanobacteria (C. elenkinii  and Anabaena laxa ), plant mortality decreased by 23%, while hydrolytic enzyme activity (a plant defence mechanism) increased (Babu et al., 2015 ). Similar increases in activity of enzymes associated with plant defence was noted in the treatment of willow plants treated with Chlorella  sp. (Grzesik et al., 2017 ). Microalgae can improve the soil quality, help in the mineralization and solubilisation of nutrients, and several cyanobacteria also have the ability to fix nitrogen (Coppens et al., 2016 ; Renuka et al., 2018 ). Inoculating the soil with cyanobacteria has been shown to potentially save 20-57% of chemical nitrogen fertilizers, without impacting crop yields (Renuka et al., 2018 ). In one study, this was estimated to save up to 25 kg nitrogen/ha, using cyanobacteria on grain and rice (Jha and Prasad, 2006 ). Cyanobacterial application (a combination of Anabaena doliolum, Cylindrospermum sphaerica,  and Nostoc calcicole  at 100 kg/ha) to semi-arid soil increased the available nutrients in the soil by up to 50% for carbon, 15% for nitrogen, and 45% for phosphorus (Nisha et al., 2007 ). The green alga Chlorella  spp. (6 x 108  cells/plant) also increased organic carbon available by 6% (Yilmaz and Sönmez, 2017 ). Microalgae (including diatoms and green algae, as well as cyanobacteria) can also improve the soil aggregation qualities, thereby reducing erosion (Sutherland et al., 1998 ; Yilmaz and Sönmez, 2017 ). This could also potentially help trap nutrients, prevent leaching of nutrients to the surrounding water systems, thus lowering the risk of eutrophication. As such, algae could not only reduce the fertilizer demand in agriculture, but the possibly of treat land at risk of desertification in order to improve the soil quality. However, there are several technical stages that need to be overcome before large scale production of microalgae can be used in agriculture. These include (Chiaiese et al., 2018 ; Michalak and Chojnacka, 2015 ; Povero, 2020 ):• Optimal microalgal strain selection;  • Biological efficacy and dosage assessment;  • Optimising treatment application (e.g. soil amendment, foliar treatments, slow release capsules);  • Determining the right processing method (e.g. whole cell vs lysed);  • Optimised productivity and;  • Reducing production costs.    Microalgal production costs may be reduced by utilising the microalgal biomass from wastewater treatment (SDG 6, see above), or diffuse nutrient pollution treatment (SGD 14, see above). However, further work would be needed to determine the effect, if any, on the food chain by using algae grown on wastewater (e.g. if it causes a bioaccumulation toxins, depending on the wastewater stream).  8 Barriers to microalgal bioeconomy supporting SDG achievement and next steps forward The microalgal biotechnologies described in this paper are at various developmental stages. Some technologies are already being successfully demonstrated, most often as a result of collaboration with early stage innovators with multinational companies and, or with support of Government grants (e.g. food and bioplastics). Other technologies are ready for implementation, while others still require some level of research and development to reach the deployment stage. For example, wastewater treatment HRAPs, having been successfully demonstrated at full-scale, are ready to be deployed in regions where wastewater treatment does not currently exist but is still constrained by the ability to cost-effectively harvest the biomass. On the other hand, microalgal-based biostimulants are still in early developmental stages, requiring further laboratory and field-based studies to assess efficacy before large scale production can occur. There are several barriers that need to be overcome to ensure that microalgal biotechnology can assist with achieving the goals of SDG. These include cost-effective large-scale cultivation, harvesting and downstream processing (discussed below). 8.1 Cost effective large-scale cultivation Production costs at full-scale remain one of the barriers to the establishment of a global microalgal bioeconomy, particularly for low value products. A renewed interest in microalgae production over the past decade, fuelled initially by stimulus investment in biofuels research, has produced several innovations for the large-scale cultivation of microalgae. These systems range from low technology, low capital and operational cost systems, such as HRAPs, to high technology, high capital and operational cost systems, such as photobioreactors. Which system is appropriate for cultivating microalgae, will depend greatly on the final product being produced (Hoffman et al., 2017 ). For example, food, animal feed, nutritional supplements, and biofuels made from microalgae are considered low value products and as such favour systems where high volumes of microalgae can be cultured at low cost (Borowitzka, 1999 ; Grobbelaar, 2009 ; Ray et al., 2019 . In contrast, high value products, such as medicines, require culture systems, such as enclosed photobioreactors or fermenters, to meet regulatory requirements for quality and purity and / or the containment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (De Swaaf et al., 2003 ). In recent years, much effort has gone into optimising the production of microalgae and / or the product of interest in an effort to reduce the cost per unit yield. Such optimisation has included, maximising nutrient loads, CO2  augmentation, depth, mixing and hydraulic retention time determination, culture recycling for species control, and grazer control to reduce system “crashes” (Park and Craggs, 2010 ; Park et al., 2013 ; Sutherland et al., 2015 ; Montemezzani et al., 2017 ). Continued work on optimising production at full-scale, as well as bioprospecting for novel strains, will further improve cost-effectiveness.  8.2 Harvesting Harvesting costs are considered to be one of the major bottlenecks for the microalgal bioeconomy. Large-scale harvesting of microalgal biomass is challenging due to low cell concentrations (<500 g m-3 ), small cell size (typically 3–30 μm), dilute culture (0.02 – 0.05%) and almost neutral buoyancy (Vandamme et al., 2013 , Muylaert et al., 2017 , Augustine et al., 2019 ). Up to 30% of the total production cost is attributed to microalgal harvesting (Şirin et al., 2012 ), which is arguably the most energy-intensive step in microalgal biotechnology, particularly for low value products. There are a number of harvesting techniques currently, available, ranging from low cost gravity harvesting, dissolved air flotation, or chemical flocculation through to more expensive techniques, such as membrane filtration and centrifugation (Vandamme et al., 2013 ; Bilad et al., 2012 ; Park et al., 2013 ). Each method has both advantages and disadvantages. The selection of harvesting method needs to consider the density and size of the microalgal cell, energy cost, specifications of the final product, any effluent discharge statutory requirements and feasibility at large scale production (Uduman et al., 2010 ; Rawat et al., 2011 ; Singh and Patidar, 2018 ). Cost-effective advances in harvesting would greatly advance the microalgal bioeconomy.  8.3 Downstream processing Downstream processing techniques and associated costs will be highly specific to the microalgal product. For example, biogas production relies on simple biological processing (anaerobic digestion of biomass), while nutraceuticals may require extraction and purification. There are a number of microalgal products already on the market demonstrating that downstream processing can be cost-effective. However, industry-scale extraction and purification of products from microalgae has not been widely studied, to date (Khanra et al., 2018 ), and cost-effective and efficient downstream processing is still a vital step in developing a sustainable microalgal bioeconomy. In addition, developing green processes that reduce the environmental impact of processing has generally not been shown at scale yet, but there is ongoing research in this field and how to reduce the manufacturing footprint (Michalak and Chojnacka, 2015 ). Over the last decade, much research has focused on improvements in all three areas but continued work with the aim to further improve cost-effectiveness is the vital next steps forward for the development of a successful microalgal biotechnology industry. Regardless of the application, research and development needs to focus on making microalgal biotechnology affordable and accessible to all nations in order to meet the objectives of SDG. Targeted investment into research and development needs to be supported by the appropriate legislation and policies to aid in the rapid assimilation of the technology once it reaches full-scale potential. Without such legislation in place, delays to the adoption of these technologies will impact on the role microalgae could have in assisting with the achievement of the SDGs.   9 Summary Sustainable development underpins the environmental, economic, societal, and public health values of a nation. The SDG framework was developed for, and adopted by, the UN member nations for the sustainable transformation of the wellbeing of both people and planet. However, the forecasted failure of SDG achievement implies that existing technologies are not sufficient to balance economic, environmental, and societal needs, and new technologies are required to progress SDG. Emerging applications of microalgal biotechnology demonstrate the potential for these organisms to assist with the achievement of a number of the UN SDGs. For SDG-2 (Zero Hunger), microalgal proteins provide a nutritional alternative to animal-derived proteins to meet the increasing global demand for protein, whilst nutraceuticals sourced from microalgae have the potential to address micronutrient deficiencies for improved health outcomes. For SDG-6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), microalgal-based wastewater treatment systems can provide cost-efficient and effective wastewater treatment for localities and countries where mechanical / chemical based treatment would be cost prohibitive. Biomass derived from microalgal wastewater treatment can be used to generate local source of biogas in support of SDG- 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). Alterative products produced from microalgae, such as bioplastics, can help reduce fossil fuel consumption and improve biodegradability, in support of SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Nutrient pollution reduction to improve the outcomes of SDG-14 (Life Below Water) can be achieved through the use of filamentous algae nutrient scrubbers to remove nutrients from both fresh and marine waters, while microalgal biostimulants can improve soil condition and plant growth, in support of SDG-15 (Life on Land). Microalgal biotechnology integrate and interlink a number of SDGs, with achievements in one SDG leading to positive benefits in other SDGs. Several barriers exist that need to be overcome to ensure that microalgal biotechnology can assist with SDG achievement, including production optimisation and cost-effective large-scale cultivation and substantial investment will be required to accelerate microalgal technological innovation. Despite these challenges, the appeal of microalgal biotechnology to mitigate many of the environmental impacts and wasteful production processes resulting from polluting industries, and provide sustainable alternatives, is clearly evident.
