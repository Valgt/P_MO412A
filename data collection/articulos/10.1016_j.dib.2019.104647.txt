                  The dataset describes the status of African countries on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Datasets on SDG Index (SDGI) scores and other selected variables were compiled from relevant secondary sources. Graphical illustrations were used to describe the type of association existing between the SDGI scores and each of the selected variables to corroborate [1]. Further rigorous statistical analysis can be carried out using these data, in conjunction with other datasets to establish scientifically proven cause and effect relationships among the variables.

Evidence from Nigeria Journal: Global Food Security 22, 1–12 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2019.08.001        Value of the Data • These data provide better a clearer picture of why the attainment of SDGs is of great importance on the African continent.  • Government, non-governmental organizations, public policy analysts, donor agencies and researchers would benefit from the data. The data provide African countries' progress report on SDGs and other selected indicators that are useful for policy formulation, decision making and advocacy.  • Further rigorous statistical analysis can be carried out using these data, in conjunction with other datasets to establish scientifically proven cause and effect relationships among the variables.  • These data provide useful cross-country comparisons that can lead to better implementation of the sustainable development goals in Africa.          1 Data Data were compiled from different secondary sources. The 2019 SDGI ranks and scores were extracted from [2 ], the total population in extreme poverty was gotten from [1 ,4 ], the stunting report was obtained from [2 ] while the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was obtained from [1 ,3 ]. Extensive desk research authenticated through consultations with experts and government officials were employed in obtaining the stunting (%) report, SDGI ranks and scores. The SDGI was computed by censoring extreme values from the distribution of each indicator, rescaling the data to enhance comparability across indicators and aggregating the indicators within and across SDGs. The data on total population in extreme poverty were obtained real time using scientifically peer-reviewed and published methodology while the CPI data were obtained from informed views of experts, analysts and businesspeople (in African countries) nationally and internationally. Table 1   shows the SGDI ranks and scores for each of the 52 countries (Seychelles and Libya are not captured). Tunisia has the highest SDGI score of 66.01 and is ranked 1st in Africa as the highest performer on all SDG goals. South Sudan with the least SDGI score of 29.18 is ranked 52nd in Africa, the worst performer on all SDG goals. Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Algeria and Angola are ranked 43rd, 10th, 6th, 3rd and 38th respectively. Table 2   compares the SDGI ranks and scores of each country with their respective percentage total population in extreme poverty, percentage population of under 5 stunted children and 2018 CPI Ranks. About 0.3% of the population of Tunisia live in extreme poverty, 10.1% of under 5 children are stunted [5 ] while the country has a 2018 CPI rank of 73. 84.8% of South Sudan's population live in extreme poverty with 31.1% prevalence of stunting among under 5 children and a 2018 CPI rank of 178. Figs. 1–3     support Table 2  by showing the type of associations existing between the SDGI scores and each of the selected variables.  2 Experimental design, materials, and methods Data on fifty-two (52) African countries were compiled from different secondary sources. The countries were ranked according to their SDGI scores; worst (0) and best (100). Percentage of the total population, in each African country, living in extreme poverty was computed. Prevalence of stunting, in each of these countries, among under 5 year children was measured using the WHO Child Growth Standards. Furthermore, the CPI ranks of these countries were obtained. Graphical illustrations, using Microsoft Excel 2013, were used to describe the type of association existing between the SDGI scores and each of the selected variables.
