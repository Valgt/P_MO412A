                  Studies have shown that monitoring the progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides a basis for evaluation of efforts in sustainable development and formulation of policy recommendations. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) may have profound implications for the sustainable development of the involved countries. However, the performance of these countries with respect to the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of SDGs is yet to be explored. In this paper, we addressed this gap by analysing the progress towards SDGs during 2000–2019 on both the BRI and national scales by accounting for the social, economic, and environmental SDGs. We found that the BRI SDG index (SDGI), calculated by summing up the results from the three dimensions, increased from 43.5 in 2000 to 60.2 in 2019. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the BRI nations were at least halfway towards reaching the best performance of SDGs as of 2019. Of the 65 BRI nations, European countries generally performed better, while Central and West Asian countries performed relatively poorly according to the SDGI. Overall, the BRI showed high, medium, and low scores in achieving the economic, social, and environmental SDGs, respectively. In addition, the three dimensions have shown significant synergistic relationships over the past 20 years, although the synergies are weakening. Our research described the progress of BRI towards the SDGs, revealing that more attention should be paid to the environmental dimension, particularly to SDG 15 (life on land), as it received the lowest score and had the steepest downward trend of all SDGs. Considering the spatial heterogeneity among the BRI nations, we proposed a geospatial division and management plan as a potential measure to achieve SDGs.

Handling Editor: Jing Meng Studies have shown that monitoring the progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides a basis for evaluation of efforts in sustainable development and formulation of policy recommendations. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) may have profound implications for the sustainable development of the involved countries. However, the performance of these countries with respect to the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of SDGs is yet to be explored. In this paper, we addressed this gap by analysing the progress towards SDGs during 2000–2019 on both the BRI and national scales by accounting for the social, economic, and environmental SDGs. We found that the BRI SDG index (SDGI), calculated by summing up the results from the three dimensions, increased from 43.5 in 2000 to 60.2 in 2019. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the BRI nations were at least halfway towards reaching the best performance of SDGs as of 2019. Of the 65 BRI nations, European countries generally performed better, while Central and West Asian countries performed relatively poorly according to the SDGI. Overall, the BRI showed high, medium, and low scores in achieving the economic, social, and environmental SDGs, respectively. In addition, the three dimensions have shown significant synergistic relationships over the past 20 years, although the synergies are weakening. Our research described the progress of BRI towards the SDGs, revealing that more attention should be paid to the environmental dimension, particularly to SDG 15 (life on land), as it received the lowest score and had the steepest downward trend of all SDGs. Considering the spatial heterogeneity among the BRI nations, we proposed a geospatial division and management plan as a potential measure to achieve SDGs.

(IPCC, 2021 ; Lade et al., 2020 ; Sterner et al., 2019 ). As a response, in 2015, a new agenda to reach social inclusion, economic growth, and environmental protection by 2030 has been adopted by most of the member states of the United Nations (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). Agenda 2030 consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), setting 169 targets and over 230 indicators. The SDGs take a step forward from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by looking beyond the primary goals of eradicating poverty, and by embracing a systemic set of social, economic, and environmental targets (Griggs et al., 2013 ; McArthur, 2013 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). The SDGs provide a reference for the international community to achieve sustainable development (Weitz et al., 2015 ). National action plans, resulting from the sustainable development agreements, require a sound assessment of their progress towards SDGs (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). To make such assessment comparable across the countries, composite SDG indexes have been developed (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2016 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). However, such indexes are often obtained at the expense of excluding useful information (Fang and Heijungs, 2015 ; Puertas and Bermúdez, 2020 ). For example, neither the composite indexes nor the 17 SDGs can communicate the differences among the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. However, such information is necessary for monitoring the progress towards SDGs (Fang et al., 2018 ; Lechner et al., 2018 ). In fact, many scholars have argued that the environmental dimension is overlooked in the current SDGs indicator system (Zeng et al., 2020 ), a major cause being the low availability of reliable environmental data (Elder and Olsen, 2019 ). For instance, SDG 13 (climate action) indicators represent the socio-economic losses from climate disasters, while ignoring the direct measurement of climate mitigation and adaptation (Iacobuţă et al., 2022 ). Moreover, information on the three dimensions is likely to be lost if the analysis is done based on each SDG, even if a composite index is constructed (Wackernagel et al., 2017 ). This eventually brings the classification of SDGs into focus. Despite a few exceptions that use additional classifications such as “Human development, Resource use, Earth system, and Governance & infrastructure” and “People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership (5 Ps)” (Tremblay et al., 2020 ; van Soest et al., 2019 ), existing studies obey the “social-economic-environmental” trichotomy (Allen et al., 2019 ; Costanza et al., 2016 ; Dalampira and Nastis, 2020 ). They share the central assumption that social, economic, and environmental sustainability must be aligned (Moldan et al., 2012 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, the scientific community has largely neglected a more critical issue, that is, the trade-offs and synergies between the social, economic, and environmental dimensions, which is key to the effective sustainability assessment (McGowan et al., 2019 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ). In other words, few studies have dealt with the cross-dimension integrated sustainability assessment (Kroll et al., 2019 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Sala et al., 2015 ). The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) launched by China in 2013 has received considerable attention in its progress towards achieving the SDGs, involving at least 65 nations that account for approximately one-third of the global economic output and two-thirds of the global population (Ascensão et al., 2018 ). The BRI provides vast financial and technical resources to the partnering countries, while simultaneously posing threats to socio-ecological systems (Ascensão et al., 2018 ; Hughes et al., 2020 ). Earlier studies have provided tangible evidence of the negative impacts, associated with economic growth, biodiversity, climate stability, resource security, and environmental sustainability (Huang, 2019 ; Laurance and Arrea, 2017 ; Lu et al., 2020 ; Tracy et al., 2017 ). Additionally, such impacts were found to be heterogeneous among the BRI countries at different stages of development (Hinsley et al., 2020 ). In September 2021, the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED) held the theme forum of “Green BRI and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, emphasizing that the progress of green BRI could bring new opportunities for the SDGs, and equal emphasis should be placed on achieving social and economic goals and promoting the improvement of environmental quality. This is a call for monitoring the progress towards the social, economic, and environmental SDGs throughout the BRI. By addressing the mentioned research gaps, this study aims to track the progress of the BRI towards reaching SDGs from a multi-dimensional perspective, by accounting for 2000–2019 achievements on social, economic, and environmental SDGs on both the BRI and national scales. To that end, this paper for the first time provides a full picture of the spatio-temporal variations in the SDGs, explores the relations between social, economic, and environmental dimensions of SDGs with the aim of avoiding omission of information, and presents a geospatial division and management plan for improving the monitoring of the progress towards SDGs.  2 Methods and data 2.1 Research framework and data The framework for measuring the progress towards SDGs is illustrated in Fig. 1  . In this study, 17 SDGs were divided into three groups, classified according to the three dimensions: eight social, five economic, and four environmental SDGs. The individual, dimensional, and overall progress toward SDGs during 2000–2019 was measured on both national and BRI scales. Then, the SDG index (SDGI) which represents the overall performance in achieving SDGs was quantified. Data on the SDG indicators were obtained from the United Nations Stats Open SDG Data Hub (http://unstats-undesa.opendata.arcgis.com/ ) and the World Bank (https://www.worldbank.org/ ). The Belt and Road is an inclusive and ever-expanding cooperation network, running through the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa. Given that there is no consensus on the exact number of the BRI members, this paper chooses to focus on 65 nations involved in the BRI, as suggested by many other papers (Cai et al., 2018 ; Lu et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). Abbreviations of the 65 BRI nations are provided in the Supplementary Table S1 .  2.2 Classification of SDGs This study follows the classic trichotomy that divides the 17 SDGs into three dimensions: social, economic, and environmental. The social SDGs aim to provide a prosperous, high quality life that is equitably shared and sustainable (Costanza et al., 2014 ), including SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals). The economic SDGs aim at building a strong economy and protecting capabilities for flourishing (Costanza et al., 2016 ), including SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent job and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption). The environmental SDGs aim at staying within planetary boundaries and operating in an environmentally sustainable way (Fang, 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2022a ), including SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).  2.3 Selection of SDG indicators Initially, given the data availability of the SDG indicators, suggested by the United Nations Security Council, 334 indicators have been collected. Out of these, 62 indicators with relatively complete panel data for 2000–2019 were selected for the 65 BRI nations. Detailed information on the indicators included in this study and data sources can be found in the Supplementary Table S2 .  2.4 Bound selection of SDG indicators To eliminate the impact of extreme values on normalization, the upper and lower bounds for each SDG indicator were set following the methods of Schmidt-Traub et al. (2017) . First, for the indicators with target values set within the SDGs (e.g., reducing under-5 mortality rate to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births), the upper bounds were adopted directly. Second, for the indicators that require full implementation (e.g., achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all), we followed the methods outlined by O'Neill et al. (2018)  who set a threshold of 95%, recognising that the 100% achievement is an ideal situation in which most countries are unlikely to achieve. Third, for the remaining indicators, we set the upper bounds equal to the average of the top five performers across the countries. With respect to the lower bounds, they were set to the value of the bottom 2.5% of all data.  2.5 Normalization of SDG indicators To ensure comparability across different SDGs, the value for each indicator was normalised to the range from 0 to 100. The value for each positive SDG indicator was calculated following Formula (1) , while the negative one was calculated following Formula (2) :(1) S = s − min ( s )   max ( s )  − min ( s )    × 100     (2) S = max ⁡ ( s )  − s  max ( s )  − min ( s )    × 100     where S    is the normalised value for each SDG indicator; s    is the original value for each SDG indicator; and max / min  ( s )     are the upper/lower bounds of each SDG indicator.  2.6 Calculation of SDG index The scores of individual SDGs at both national and BRI scales from 2000 to 2019 were calculated based on the arithmetic means, following Xu et al. (2020) . Likewise, the social, economic, and environmental SDGs were set equal to the arithmetic means of the corresponding SDGs. The SDGI representing the overall performance in achieving all the SDGs was quantified by adding up the results from the three dimensions, following the assumption that each dimension holds the same importance (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). By tracking the spatio-temporal variation in the progress towards SDGs of the 65 BRI nations, we examined the synergies and trade-offs of the three dimensions using the Pearson correlation analysis.   3 Results 3.1 Spatio-temporal progress towards SDGs Fig. 2   shows the overall trajectories of the 17 individual SDGs and the BRI SDGI scores over the past two decades. The BRI SDGI score increased from 43.5 in 2000 to 60.2 in 2019. As shown, nearly every SDG experienced an upward trend with fluctuations. We noticed prominent improvements in SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG 5 (achieve gender equality), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), with a growth of 305%, 185%, 92%, 66%, and 59%, respectively. By contrast, progress in SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 4 (quality education), and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) was slow, with the growth rate ranging from 0.1% to 43%. As most trend lines experienced a sharp change, we employed a geometric mean method to recalculate the scores for both the SDGI and 17 individual SDGs to examine whether potential outliers had led to such changes. By comparing the scores calculated through the arithmetic mean method and the geometric mean method, we found that the overall trajectories for the 17 individual SDGs and the BRI SDGI scores were generally consistent, showing no evidence of distortion by potential outliers (results based on the geometric mean method were illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Notably, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land) were the only two goals with a downward trend, experiencing drops in score of 3% and 16%, respectively. The score difference between the best and the worst performing SDGs was found to be substantial. SDG 13 (climate action) scored the highest, while SDG 15 scored the lowest, and their score difference was 59.8. Moreover, in 2019, five SDGs were not even halfway towards the results achieved by the best performing SDGs; they were, from the highest to lowest scores, SDG 14, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals), SDG 10, SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 15. Following the methods of Xu et al. (2020) , we displayed the proportion of the BRI nations that were halfway towards achieving the best performance on the SDGs (with a score of 50) in years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019 (Fig. 3  ). Over the past two decades, the share of the BRI countries that scored over 50 on the SDGI increased from 31% to 92%. At least 50% of the BRI countries achieved half of the progress in 12 SDGs, particularly in SDG 13, SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), and SDG 11. The BRI faced major challenges in achieving the SDG 2, SDG 15, and SDG 10, as only 6%–22% of the nations scored higher than 50 on these SDGs. The BRI's SDGI revealed a remarkable heterogeneity between the nations during the study period (Fig. 4  ), as the gap between the highest and lowest SDGI values ranged from 39.4 (with a mean value of 43.5) in 2000 to 34 (with a mean value of 60.2) in 2019, reflecting a 39% increase in the mean value of the SDGI across the 65 BRI nations over time. All BRI countries have improved their overall performance on SDGI, except Malaysia, which showed a 1% decline in its SDGI. The highest SDGI in 2019 were observed in Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria ranging from 74.7 to 70.7. Notably, Malaysia had the best performance on the SDGI in 2000, with a value of 61.4. However, it was replaced by Slovenia in 2005, 2010, and 2015, with the values of 71.4, 72.7, and 75.2, respectively. In 2019, Latvia ranked first on the SDGI, with a value of 74.7. Expectedly, Afghanistan scored the lowest in 2000, 2005, and 2015, with the values of 22.0, 25.6, and 30.6, respectively. In 2010, Uzbekistan had the worst performance on the SDGI, with a value of 29.5. Finally, in 2019, Yemen was at the bottom of the list, with a value of 40.7. Overall, European and Southeast Asian countries had relatively high SDGIs, as opposed to the South Asian nations. West Asia was the most unevenly developed region. Countries such as Israel and the United Arab Emirates performed well, while the other countries such as Iraq and Syria performed poorly. At the national level, the variation in the SDGI values showed considerable spatial heterogeneity. The largest growth in the SDGI was found in Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Moldova, Bhutan, and Laos by 134%, 123%, 118%, 106%, and 95%, respectively. Despite remarkable growth over the past 20 years, the average SDGI values for these countries in 2019 were still far behind the BRI average. Around 15% of the BRI nations improved their SDGI by less than 20%, especially Egypt with a less than 1% increase. Only Malaysia experienced a downward trend in SDGI. Upon comparing the SDGI values over the years (Fig. 5  ), the most dramatic increase was observed in Moldova during 2015–2016, reflecting a 71% increase in the SDGI, while the sharpest decrease was observed in Slovenia between 2015 and 2016, reflecting an 8% decrease in the SDGI. With respect to the 17 individual SDGs, the spatial distribution of the SDGs with a score higher than 50 in 2019 is shown in Fig. 6  . Overall, each BRI nation was halfway towards reaching at least six of the SDGs. Estonia was the country with the largest number of SDGs that scored higher than 50, followed by Latvia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, and Croatia. The numbers of SDGs that these countries were halfway towards achieving were 16, 15, 14, 14, and 14, respectively. None of these countries was even halfway towards reaching SDG 2 (zero hunger). By contrast, Yemen was identified to have the least number of SDGs that scored higher than 50, followed by Afghanistan, Lebanon, Pakistan, and India. Interestingly, the latter five countries were all observed to be halfway towards achieving the best performance of SDGs 4, 11, 12, 13, and 16.  3.2 Spatio-temporal progress towards social, economic, and environmental SDGs The progress towards the three dimensions of SDGs is illustrated in Fig. 7  . Evidently, a substantial imbalance exists in achieving the economic, social, and environmental SDGs. The SDGIs of the three dimensions were ranked in a descending order: economic SDGs (65), social SDGs (60.4), and environmental SDGs (55.2). Attributing to the good performance on SDG 5, SDG 4, and SDG 16, Belarus was identified to have the best performance on the social SDGs, followed by Poland, Czech Republic, Greece, and Estonia (Fig. 7 a). The social SDGs of these five nations were 73.7, 73.3, 70.6, 69.7, and 69.1, respectively. Conversely, Yemen had the lowest performance on the social SDGs (38.2), with poor performances on SDG 5, SDG 2, and SDG 10. Next four nations in an ascending order were: Afghanistan (45.9), Myanmar (48.4), Cambodia (50.9), and Bangladesh (51.5). As for the economic SDGs (Fig. 7 b), the largest scores were observed in Hungary, Latvia, Singapore, Slovenia, and Bhutan, with values of 75.9, 74.7, 73.7, 73.6, and 72.8, respectively. The common ground between them was found in a in achieving better performance for SDG 11 and SDG 12. The lowest performing countries on economic SDGs were Serbia (48), Egypt (50.8), Yemen (54.5), Maldives (54.9), and Turkmenistan (58.6). These countries should pay special attention to SDGs 8 and 9. From the perspective of the environmental dimension (Fig. 7 c), our results showed that Estonia (84.5), Latvia (83.6), Lithuania (78.8), Bulgaria (77.6), and Slovenia (76.8) were the five countries with the highest performance on the environmental SDGs. However, these countries faced severe challenges in achieving SDG 15. By contrast, Yemen (29.4), Iraq (29.8), Mongolia (34.9), Maldives (35), and Lebanon (35.6) were the five nations with the worst performance on the environmental dimension, predominantly due to their poor performance on SDG 14 and 15. At the national level, changes in the SDGI within the three dimensions for the 65 BRI nations during 2000–2019 are shown in Fig. 8  . All the BRI countries showed a steady growth in the performance on the social SDGs (Fig. 8 a). Afghanistan was identified as the country with the most significant improvement (196%), increasing from 15.5 in 2000 to 45.9 in 2019. Despite the greatest increase, its performance on social SDGs remained below the BRI average. The following four countries in the ranking were Iraq, Pakistan, Laos and Nepal, with the increase of 158%, 152%, 143%, and 130%, respectively. On the contrary, there was only a slight improvement in the performance on the social SDGs in Qatar, Israel, Slovenia, Philippines, and Estonia, ranging from 19% to 31%. In the terms of the economic SDGs (Fig. 8 b), five countries with the largest increase were, in a descending order, Bhutan (159%), Mongolia (90%), Laos (83%), Bangladesh (79%), and Afghanistan (75%). By contrast, Qatar, Lebanon, Yemen, Poland, and Slovenia were the five countries with slight fluctuations, with an increase of less than 3%. There were also several countries showing a downward progress in the economic dimension of SDGs. One example was Serbia, whose score declined by 23%. Egypt, Turkey, Israel, and Malaysia were also among the countries that experienced a downward trend in their performance on the economic dimension. In terms of the environmental SDGs, our results showed that nearly 75% of the BRI countries improved their performance (Fig. 8 c). Top five countries with the most significant improvements in this dimension were Uzbekistan (112%), Moldova (96%), Pakistan (65%), Armenia (63%), and Bulgaria (60%). The improvement in achieving the environmental SDGs was not remarkable in Sri Lanka, Jordan, Kuwait, Indonesia, and Afghanistan, with an increase of less than 5%. However, not all the BRI countries showed an increase in environmental SDGs performance. Brunei suffered the greatest decline in the environmental SDGs, followed by Maldives, Thailand, Malaysia, and Israel, with a decline of 29%, 23%, 22%, 15%, and 14%, respectively.  3.3 Synergies among social, economic, and environmental SDGs As per the results of our correlation analysis (Fig. 9  ), the social, economic, and environmental dimensions showed significant synergistic relationships with each other in the period 2000–2019 (p -value <0.05). The correlation coefficient between environmental and economic SDGs remained relatively stable between 2000 and 2015, but suddenly dropped in 2016 and stayed low afterwards. This suggests that the synergies between these two dimensions have weakened since 2016. The correlation coefficient between the environmental and social SDGs remained unchanged as of 2015, implying a potential co-beneficial relationship between the improved human well-being and environmental protection in the BRI nations. Conversely, this suggests a growing challenge to the realization of the social and economic objectives of the BRI countries, as evidenced by a sharp decline in the correlation coefficient between the social and economic SDGs since 2005. This calls for a careful consideration during the selection of priority goals and targets. In general, the highest synergistic relationship was witnessed between the social and economic dimensions, despite its slow decrease between 2000 and 2009. During that period, the degree of synergies between the environmental and the other two dimensions of SDGs appeared to be relatively weak, showing that socio-economic progress depended substantially on the natural resources. But in 2010, the synergy of the economic and environmental dimensions had surpassed that of the social and economic dimensions with a correlation coefficient of 0.556, and later in 2015, this relationship was exceeded by the environmental and social dimensions synergy, with a correlation coefficient of 0.710. Unlike the general focus on the complex impacts between environmental and socio-economic dimensions in the past (Fanning et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2022b ), this study shows that the synergetic effect between social and economic dimensions in the BRI nations appeared to be weak and thus deserves more attention. In other words, economic growth does not always keep pace with the social development. Large-scale infrastructure projects, for instance, would not only lead to a substantial loss of natural resources, but also exacerbate social inequalities (Li et al., 2021 ).   4 Discussion 4.1 Comparison between dimension and goal equal-weight methods Despite the increasing number of studies that track progress towards SDGs on the regional, national, and global scales, the spatio-temporal analyses of SDGs throughout the BRI currently remains underexplored. Our study, in this sense, provides new insights into the implementation of SDGs at both national and BRI scales. Our assessment was consistent with previous studies that focused on single countries. China, for instance, improved its SDGI score from 2000 to 2015, which was consistent with the results of Xu et al. (2020) . However, we found that improvement in the China's SDGI (37%) is much higher than theirs (21.9%). Apart from the indicator selection and data sources, the major discrepancy results from the way of weighting; that is, equal weighing of the 17 SDGs in Xu et al. (2020) , versus equal weighing of the social, economic and environmental dimensions in our work. By analysing the correlations between the SDGI scores obtained by the equal weighing of either the SDGs or the social, environmental, and economic dimensions (Fig. 10  ), we found that the dimension equal-weight method employed in our analysis would be more appropriate for a multi-dimensional assessment of the SDGs than the goal equal-weight method, as proven by the variation in the ranking of countries under the two weighting methods. For instance, China's ranking drops by nine places in 2019 based on the dimension equal-weight method, because of the poor performance on the environmental SDGs, such as SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14, and SDG 15 (life on land); as opposed to Sri Lanka that moved up nine places because of its high scores in SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (climate action). All this underscores the role of environmental dimension in the SDG assessment, which has often been overlook by previous studies.  4.2 Policy implications First, both the historical trend and status quo of the SDGs matter.   For example, despite an upward trend of SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 2 (zero hunger) on the BRI scale, these SDGs had low scores. Conversely, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) had a high score, although it was indeed one of the two SDGs that were on a downward trend. Focusing on both the historical trend and status quo would assist policymakers in obtaining a full picture of SDGs. Thus, a progress assessment shall consider historical trends and the status quo of the SDGs. Second, multi-dimensional synergies and trade-offs deserve attention.   As the SDGI is a composite measure covering all the three dimensions, a poor performance on one dimension might be concealed by a good performance on another (Sterner et al., 2019 ). For this reason, evaluating the performance of each dimension and understanding the potential synergies and trade-offs among them lays a basis for making effective and coordinated sustainability policies. While all three dimensions have generally shown significant synergistic relationships in the past 20 years, the degree of synergies between the environmental and economic SDGs, and the social and economic SDGs has been declining, particularly after 2016. Therefore, efforts to facilitate SDGs from multiple dimensions are needed (He et al., 2022 ). Third, “one size fits all” strategy for all the BRI countries does not work.   Focusing on the overall SDGI without looking at different dimensions may lead to ineffective decisions. For example, although the SDGI scores for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Singapore in 2019 were roughly the same, the contributions of each dimension were completely different. Bosnia and Herzegovina scored higher on the environmental SDGs (67.4), while Singapore scored the highest on the economic SDGs (73.7). This suggests a need for common but differentiated policies for BRI nations in support of the sustainable development (Chen et al., 2020 ). As a result, we prepared a geospatial division and management plan for the SDGs. Fig. 11   illustrates the six sustainable development zones based on national SDGs progress within the three dimensions. Our recommended actions for each zone are the following:● For countries that were progressing in all three dimensions (SH-ECH-ENH), more attention should be paid to those dimensions that were lagging compared to others and strive to achieve the SDGs in an effective and coordinated way.  ● For countries that experienced a retrogression in the social and/or economic dimensions, but made progress in the environmental dimension (SH-ECL-ENH, SL-ECL-ENH, or SL-ECH-ENH), it is necessary to promote the synergies between economic and social dimensions to maintain a sufficient socio-economic foundation without exceeding the biophysical boundaries (Hoekstra and Wiedmann, 2014 ; O'Neill et al., 2018 ).  ● For countries that achieved social and/or economic growth at the cost of environmental degradation (SL-ECH-ENL), environmentally-friendly policies should be formulated that ensure a sustainable foundation for the economy and society (Goodland, 1995 ; Meng et al., 2023 ; Moldan et al., 2012 ).  ● For countries with relatively low scores on all three dimensions (SL-ECL-ENL), improving social and economic performance, while simultaneously safeguarding environmental sustainability, poses a major challenge (Fang et al., 2023a ; Jia et al., 2019 ). Moreover, high priority should be given to the reinforcement of environment-oriented policies and raise of national environmental standards as industrial outsourcing could lead to environment abuse in nations with laxer environmental regulations (Fang et al., 2023b; Teo et al., 2019 ).     4.3 Scientific contributions The scientific contributions of this study are threefold. First, unlike the official annual assessment reports released by the United Nations on the process of national SDGs, our analysis did not only trace the progress in SDGs in recent years on both the BRI and national scales, but also looked at the historical trend before 2016. By considering the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development equally important, we observed that the BRI showed the lowest scores in achieving the environmental SDGs. This justifies the need for more attention to be paid to the environmental dimension, especially to SDG 15 (life on land). Therefore, our assessment is able to answer "WHAT" is the primary challenge faced by the BRI in sustainable development. Second, based on the spatio-temporal variations in the SDGs from different dimensions, a geospatial division and management plan were developed to further answer "HOW" the BRI countries can speed up the realization of SDGs through common but differentiated measures. Third, we also examined the synergies and trade-offs of the three dimensions of SDGs, with the aim of avoiding isolated and misleading decisions that could arise when formulating policies based on a single composite score. Such evaluations help analyze whether a policy would promote synergistic development between different SDGs and hence ensure the coherence of policy formulation in BRI. As such, this paper has managed to provide novel insights into studies on both the BRI and SDGs and therefore can be of both theoretical and practical significance.  4.4 Limitations and potential solutions While our multi-dimensional assessment provides a first picture of the progress towards the SDGs on both national and BRI scales, it remains limited as it relies on the selected indicators and availability of data. The indicators selected for this work were based on data availability across spatial and temporal scales, leading to some incomplete data being omitted, especially the environmental indicators. To maintain consistency with the United Nations in the SDG indicator framework as much as possible, 62 indicators that had relatively complete panel data for 65 nations in 2000–2019 were selected. To account for these limitations, assessment model should choose indicators more carefully, seeking for full datasets, as opposed to using any indicator that has a relatively complete set of data. Constructing indicators based on specific research questions is technically feasible. This approach would give a more representative picture of the progress towards SDGs (Shuai et al., 2021 ). Once the post-2019 data for BRI nations are available, the time span could be extended to show more recent trends in the BRI's SDG progress. Furthermore, the data used in this study were derived from reliable sources, such as the UN Stats Open SDG Data Hub and World Bank. Nevertheless, these indicators might be different from official statistics of individual countries. Therefore, special attention should be paid to data comparability across spatial and temporal scales (Allen et al., 2020 ; Warchold et al., 2022 ). To address this, remote sensing could be a potential instrument for obtaining quality environmental and socio-economic data (Malagó et al., 2021 ), particularly for monitoring the progress towards SDGs at a subnational scale (Avtar et al., 2020 ; Bennich et al., 2020 ; Merino-Saum et al., 2018 ). Our work took the first step towards exploring the synergies and trade-offs between the three sustainability dimensions, but requires further research on the dynamics of complex interactions between the dimensions and underlying mechanisms (Moreno et al., 2023 ; Pedercini et al., 2019 ). In relation to this, network analysis could be appropriate for evaluating the inter-relationships between SDGs and dimensions (McGowan et al., 2019 ). By estimating the network of SDG interactions, opportunities and challenges of SDG implementation can be captured (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). As common statistics may have difficulty in predicting nonlinear relationships (Fang et al., 2021 ), network analysis could be effectively combined with data-driven techniques, such as data mining and machine learning algorithms (Laumann et al., 2022 ).   5 Conclusions Early studies often focused on accounting the overall indexes, without adequate consideration of the relations between social, economic, and environmental dimensions of SDGs. While such composite indexes can be useful for policy-making – due to the overall progress measurement towards SDGs – such indexes cannot be used to design targeted policies for the BRI countries at different stages of development. Therefore, this study measured the progress towards the SDGs in 2000–2019 on both the BRI and national scales by accounting for the social, economic, and environmental SDGs. The results demonstrated that the SDGI for the BRI increased from 43.5 in 2000 to 60.2 in 2019, and more than 90% of the BRI nations were already at least halfway towards reaching the best performance of SDGs as of 2019. We found that special attention should be paid to the environmental dimensions, as it received the lowest scores among the three dimensions. Significant synergistic relationships were found between the three dimensions over the past 20 years, although the synergies have been steadily weakening. Finally, common but differentiated policies in support of the BRI's sustainable development were put forward in the form of a geospatial division management plan. The methods outlined in this paper are of value for exploration of the relations between social, economic, and environmental dimensions of SDGs. The policy implications might also lay a foundation for proposing a geospatial division and management plan for other countries to improve the progress towards SDGs. Further research could focus on forecasting the future trends as well as the development pathways towards achieving the SDGs, especially by premeditating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, research should focus on the application of consumption-based indicators (e.g., environmental footprints) for capturing trade-related impacts and extending the coverage of SDG indicators (Fang et al., 2021 ; Leach et al., 2012 ; Vanham et al., 2019 ). Research for computing the weighted indexes that would relax the assumption of the equal importance of the three dimensions of sustainable development, is also needed.
