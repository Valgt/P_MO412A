                  The world is currently confronted with water scarcity which is associated with deteriorating public sanitation and health, pollution, and ecosystem damage. Maintaining the performance of water supply schemes during a long-term demographic transition would achieve sustainability. This study employs a hydraulic modeling tool to predict the future performance of a water supply system, Najjembe Town water supply scheme, Uganda. Results showed that the flow velocity in the network ranges from 0.01 to 2.36 m/s. The pipeline velocities in the network are generally low under the predicated scenario, and pipes never run full. Flow velocities in some areas are below the recommended minimum velocity (0.6 m/s). The negative pressures were observed in some areas of the network due to high nodal water demand. The proposed hydraulic infrastructural changes improved the global technical performance indexes for pressure (TPIP) and velocity (TPIV) to 89.9–99.3% and 80.9–99.5%, respectively. The implementation of the water supply management plan complied with several sustainable development goals (SDGs) interlinked to targets regarding the provision of clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), supporting agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2), promoting good human health and well-being (SDG 3), promoting gender equality (SDG 5), and economic growth (SDG 8). Defining the linkage between water supply management planning and SDGs would assist in the long-term planning of water infrastructural needs in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, addressing anomalies in coverage and assisting water supply managers and policy-makers in the sector in making well-informed decisions.

The world is currently confronted with water scarcity which is associated with deteriorating public sanitation and health, pollution, and ecosystem damage. Maintaining the performance of water supply schemes during a long-term demographic transition would achieve sustainability. This study employs a hydraulic modeling tool to predict the future performance of a water supply system, Najjembe Town water supply scheme, Uganda. Results showed that the flow velocity in the network ranges from 0.01 to 2.36 m/s. The pipeline velocities in the network are generally low under the predicated scenario, and pipes never run full. Flow velocities in some areas are below the recommended minimum velocity (0.6 m/s). The negative pressures were observed in some areas of the network due to high nodal water demand. The proposed hydraulic infrastructural changes improved the global technical performance indexes for pressure (TPIP ) and velocity (TPIV ) to 89.9–99.3% and 80.9–99.5%, respectively. The implementation of the water supply management plan complied with several sustainable development goals (SDGs) interlinked to targets regarding the provision of clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), supporting agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2), promoting good human health and well-being (SDG 3), promoting gender equality (SDG 5), and economic growth (SDG 8). Defining the linkage between water supply management planning and SDGs would assist in the long-term planning of water infrastructural needs in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, addressing anomalies in coverage and assisting water supply managers and policy-makers in the sector in making well-informed decisions.

Accordingly, the worldwide level of investment in water supply schemes is noticeably high (Almheiri et al., 2021 ). Engineered water supply schemes in developing countries face various functional and structural changes over their lifespan resulting from development pressures. Therefore, future changes in socioeconomic developments, the capacity of hydraulic infrastructure, population, climatic conditions, urbanization, industrialization, agricultural practices, and water pollution from domestic and industrial sources are key drivers for the system's performance over time (Rihendyh et al., 2020 ; Almheiri et al., 2021 ). Due to hydraulic systems' complexity, central governments, cities, municipalities, and town councils require sustainable approaches for upgrading and operating existing water supply schemes to guarantee a sufficient service level at all times (Zischg et al., 2017 ). In Uganda, most water supply infrastructures are managed and operated by a national parastatal body of the National Water and sewerage corporation (NWSC) (MWE 2017 ). The corporation is a fully government-owned body established under the NWSC statute (1995) to provide water and sewerage services (Murungi and Blokland 2016 ). The body currently has 258 towns, of which Najjembe town is part. Najjembe town has recently experienced momentous growth in buildings, land developments, markets, and residential and commercial buildings. These development are projected to increase steadily (UBOS 2020 ). The Najjembe town water supply system was constructed in 2014 to serve about 10,503 people. However, the water network currently supplies water to a population of 4900 out of the target population. This leaves no assurance of the reliability and efficiency of the existing water supply system to continuously meet the present and future water demand. The high population of 10,503 people and the annual growth rate of 3.8% in Najjembe town will automatically cause an upsurge in daily cleaning and drinking water requirements (UBOS 2020 ). Modeling and predicting the system's performance is largely necessitated due to expected population growth, the annexation of areas, urbanization, and industrialization (Agudelo-vera et al., 2014 ). Modeling water distribution networks have been central to overcoming the hydraulic challenges (Seyoum and Tanyimboh 2017 ). For instance, it's applied in detecting leakages in the network, monitoring and evaluating water quality, assessing the system's capacity to meet future demands due to new developments in the supply area, and annexing new areas with water distribution services (Herve et al., 2014 ; Sardinha-lourenço et al., 2018 ; Vasant et al., 2021 ). The EPANET hydraulic model developed by Rossman (2000)  is a vital modeling tool for gaining insight into the real-time status of the water distribution system by consideration of the present condition and also forecasting the future performance of the supply network based on an ideal condition. Moreover, uncertainties in the distribution systems can be addressed by the EPANET model with the automatic creation of stochastic future network structures for various loading scenarios (Le Quiniou et al., 2014 ; Zischg et al., 2017 ). Predicting the future performance of a distribution network smoothens planning activities and scheduling maintenance sessions to ensure the long-term service of the system (Agudelo-vera et al., 2014 ). Achieving precise predictions regarding the performance of water supply systems can immensely improve efficiency and foster sustainable development. The concept of sustainability in terms of sustainable development goals (SDGs) has recently been interlinked with water and wastewater management (Delanka-Pedige et al., 2020 ). The Sustainable development goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030) of the United Nations (UN) are comprised of seventeen goals and their corresponding targets (169) (https://sdgs.un.org/goals ). Specifically, targets 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4 of SDG 6 are addressed to achieve access to adequate water and sustainable withdrawal of freshwater to address water scarcity challenges and eventually reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity (United Nations 2015 ). The SDGs focus on promoting social dignity and prosperity while protecting the environment from pollution and the planet from deprivation. Between 2016 and 2030, investments associated with fulfilling SDGs for water and wastewater management were estimated at US$46 and US$25 billion for urban and rural areas, respectively (Delanka-Pedige et al., 2020 ). However, low-income countries struggle to achieve the above water supply-related targets for most SDGs, especially those related to SDG #6, attributed to financial constraints. Thus, within this context, the evaluation and prediction of the drinking water supply network through modeling are fundamental for effective decision-making and investment in the sector. However, the linkage between water supply systems’ modeling outputs and related SDGs for effective support and financing of the developed management plans has not yet been revealed in the literature. This is the first study demonstrating the linkage between the modeling outputs of water distribution networks and SDGs. In particular, the objectives of this study are fourfold: (1) to model the drinking water supply network using EPANET software under different demand loading scenarios, (2) to evaluate the performance of the water supply system in its present state based on the global technical performance indicators, (3) to predict the performance of the water supply system after a long-term transition based on the global technical performance indexes, and (4) to determine the interactions between the implementation of the management plan for drinking water supply systems and achievable SDGs.  2 Methodology 2.1 Study area description The study area is located in the central part of Uganda in Lugazi Municipality, Buikwe District. This area was nominated for this study due to its high annual population growth attributed to the boom in economic activities, especially the Najjembe market. The town has a population of 10,503 people, with an annual growth rate of about 3.8% (UBOS 2020 ). Topographically, the town is approximately 1265m above sea level at 36N 501089.10 mE 43426.61 mN (see Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The current water demand, supply population, and total connections on the system are 598 m3 /day, 4900 people, and 205 connections, respectively.  2.2 Data collection and description The secondary data for the water distribution system in its present state were obtained through initial design details from responsible institutions. The water supply system comprises two boreholes (i.e., BH1 DWD and BH2 DWD). Borehole BH1 has a safe yield of 2.5 m3 /h and 9 m3 /h for borehole BH2, giving a total safe yield of 11.5 m3 /h. Twin reservoir circular tank with a storage capacity of about 60 m3  and diameter of 4.6 m, the height of each tank is 3.543 m located at a base elevation of 1295.676 m above datum. The pipe network has a total length of 3.6 km transmission line and a 14.0 km distribution network. The transmission line comprises HDPE pipes of pressure rating PN16, whereas the distribution line comprises HDPE pipes of PN16 and PN10. The pipe sizes of DN 90, 75, 63, and 40 were used in the distribution network. The water distribution network of this present study is of a branched type. The pipelines installed throughout the pipe network are high-density polyethylene (HDPE), totaling 11.2 km. The nominal diameters for the already existing pipelines are 40, 63, 75, and 90 mm. There are currently 18 valves (i.e., 8 pressure-reducing valves (PRV) and 14 control valves). The 90 DN mm pipe is fed by the 60 m3  capacity twin reservoir under gravity via DN 110 mm GI pipes. After, the water is sent out to the DN 63 mm pipelines through a reducer fitting to reach the far-served points. Topographical data for the future annexed areas were estimated using Google Earth, following the previously reported procedure (Ragade et al., 2018 ). Briefly, the spatially bound network model of the predicted status was created using ArcView GIS software by manipulating the polyline theme. The network model was developed following the road pattern of the case study area. The developed network was then imported from ArcView GIS into the EPANET. Nodal elevations were obtained from generated topographical profiles (see Supplementary Table S1 ).  2.3 Water demand forecasting For modeling of systems’ future scenarios, the input nodal demand data were based on the input data of the current scenario, projected using Eq. (1)  (Mekonnen 2018 ). The future nodal daily water demand was determined using Eq. (2) (1) P n  = P O  ( 1 + G R  )  n      (2) D F  = P 2035  × P C D F u t u r e       where, P n     is the projected population after the nth year from the base year, P O     is the population in the base year, G R    is the average annual population growth rate (3.8%), n    are the years between P O     and P n    , D F     is the predicted nodal demand, P 2035     is the predicted population served by that node, and P C D F u t u r e      is the future per capita demand for medium-income households (MWE 2017 ).  2.4 Framework for hydraulic modeling of the water supply network Some rural water utilities with the competence of maintaining and updating real-time models have used hydraulic imitation models in conjunction with GIS, permitting them to perform criticality studies with higher precision (Goovaerts 2017 ). This can be cost-effective as it provides decision support in operating and maintaining their systems. Hydraulic modeling tools are capable of imitating the behavior of a real-time system. They have the aptitude to forecast the performance of the same system for future ‘what if’ scenarios (Seyoum and Tanyimboh 2017 ). Computer simulations are usually cheaper and safer than conducting experiments with a final product prototype. Simulations can often be performed faster than in real-time (Goovaerts 2017 ). This allows using them for efficient alternative analyses, particularly when the required information to set the simulation can be easily obtained from the operational data. The hydraulic modeling tool used in pipe network analysis was EPANET software. This program was selected for the following reasons; (a) EPANET is a window-based public domain model that can be freely copied and distributed, and (b) it offers different ways of modeling the network. The user can physically draw the network if the drawings and the dimensions are available. Similarly, the user can import data files from AutoCAD. Steps followed in executing the simulation of the hydraulic network were: (1) drawing the pipe network or importing a text file describing the network; (2) editing the objects' properties of the network system; (3) definition of the operation parameters of the system; (4) choosing a set of analysis options; (5) running a hydraulic/water quality analysis; and (6) analysis and interpretation of results (Rossman 2000 ). EPANET iteratively calculates the nodal heads and pipe flows by instantaneously solving each node's mass conservation equation and energy loss equation for each pipe in the network. The program uses a “Gradient Algorithm” to calculate the nodal heads by iteratively resolving a linearized set of equations till a specific convergence criterion that may be user-defined is fulfilled (Rossman 2000 ). The flow chart in Fig. 1   summarizes the executed logical steps. The developed model was then calibrated by the adjustment of; (i) roughness coefficient values, (ii) demand at specified nodes, and (iii) minor loss coefficients for the considered valves in the system (Agudelo-vera et al., 2014 ). In the first instance, the baseline analysis was performed in the program to determine the current system behavior based on available system, topographical, and demographic data obtained. After, the water demand prediction was conducted following a methodology described by authorities (MWE 2013 ). Then, the future scenarios for 2035 were simulated following the previously reported procedure by Agudelo-vera et al. (2014) .  2.5 Evaluating the performance of the water supply scheme The performance evaluation of the water network in terms of hydraulic components' behavior (nodes and pipes) was established using the technical performance indexes (TPI) as reported elsewhere (Muranho et al., 2014 ; Zischg et al., 2017 ). The global technical performance indexes (TPIp ) and (TPIv ) for pressure and velocity, respectively. The TPIs range between 0% (poor performance) and 100% (efficient performance) (Muranho et al., 2014 ). The TPIs for the velocity and pressure state variables were computed using weighted averages, which consider the weights for the respective pipes proportional to their conveyance water volume and nodes concerning their loads (demand). The global technical performance index for pressure (TPIp ) was computed by Eq. (3)  (Desta and Befkadu 2020 ). This index was determined following criteria adopted by Muranho et al. (2014)  and Zischg et al. (2017) . Thus, the nodal pressures heads were selected as P min     = 10 and P max     = 100 m, which characterize adequate pressure states as stipulated by the water supply schemes’ design standards (MWE 2013 ).(3) T P I  p  = ∑ i = 1  N C   Q i  T P I i    ∑ i = 1  N C   Q i        where, NC is the number of system nodes; Q i     defines the nodal demand and T P I i     is represented by Eq. (4)  (García-Ávila et al., 2019 )(4) T P I i  = { 0 , P i  <  P min     1 , P min  ≤ P i  ≤ P max     1 − P i  − P max   P max  − P min    , P max  ≤ P i  ≤ 100    0 , P i  > 100          where, P i     is the pressure at a specified node (m); TPIv was determined considering the excessive velocities that would result in abrasion and consequently lead to head loss, i.e., Vmin  = 0.6; Vmax  = 2 m/s (MWE 2013 ). While considering this design criterion, TPIv was determined by Eq. (5)  (Muranho et al., 2014 ).(5) T P I  v  = ∑ i = 1  N P   Q i  T P I i    ∑ i = 1  N C   Q i        Where NP is the number of system pipelines; Q i     is defines the nodal demand and T P I i     is represented by Eq. (6) .(6) T P I i  = { 0 , V i  <  V min     V i  − V min   V m e a n   − V min    , V min  ≤ V i  ≤ V m e a n      V i  − V max   V m e a n   − V max    , V m e a n   ≤ V i  ≤ V max     0 , V i  > V max           Where V i    , represents the flow velocity in the i t h      water pipeline (m/s); V m e a n      is the average water velocity in the pipeline defined by Eq. (7) ; NP is the number of pipelines in the distribution system; and Qi  is the water flow rate in the i t h      pipeline.(7) V m e a n   = V min  + V max   2        2.6 Hydraulic constraints Hydraulic restrictions were used based on the project purpose as defined by the study area's demographic characteristics, topological characteristics, and water demand behavior. The following restriction was considered in EPANET (MWE 2013 ): (1) mass conservation in each water network node; (2) energy conservation in the network pipelines; (3) compliance with maximum and minimum operating pressures; and (4) compliance with maximum and minimum operating system flow velocities. Due to large-sized tanks and low safe yield by one of the wells (2.5 m3 /h), filling these tanks takes a long time. Besides, these tanks needed to remain quarter-filled to maintain the necessary pressures. Since both tanks were on the same ground elevation with the same inlet and outlet pipes, they had the same rule-based controls set as: (1) if the tank water level is above 2.943 m, then pump PMP-1 status is closed; (2) if the tank water level is above 2.943 m, then pump PMP-2 status is closed; (3) if tank water level below 0.74 m, then pump PMP-1 status is open; (4) if tank water level below 0.74 m, then pump PMP-2 status is open.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Water demand pattern and peak hour factors The water scheme continuously experiences varying demands daily, weekly, and monthly. Fig. 2   illustrates a typical diurnal curve of daily water use and “peak hour factors” for Najjembe town. It was observed that the town's maximum demand took place between 7 and 11 a.m. (morning hours) and 7–9 p.m. (night hours). The lowest consumption was from midnight to 6 a.m. (early morning hours). It is worth noting that the difference between consumption at night was almost half of the daily average water consumption in the town. These results are related to those reported in the case studies of Nagpur, India (Gupta and Kulat 2018 ), Surabaya City, Indonesia (Rihendyh et al., 2020 ), Detroit, USA (Goovaerts 2017 ), and Andean city, USA (García-Ávila et al., 2019 ).  3.2 Model exploration Fig. 3   shows the simulated water network in EPANET software. For steady-state analysis of the network, four (04) water demand loading scenarios were well-thought-out and assigned to the nodes specifically: (1) average hourly demand (AHD); (2) daily peak demand (DPD); (3) hourly peak demand (HPD), and (4) daily peak demand (DPD) + fire flow (FF). The peak hour factor of 1.5 was considered for computing the peak hour demand (m3 /day). The per capita water demand (L/c/d) was considered 35 L/d for towns with 5000–20,000 persons (MWE 2013 ). A fire flow of 8 L/s was added to the maximum day demand (MDD) of node J-1 to cater for firefighting. With these considerations catered for, the spatial distribution of predicted water demand at each node in the water distribution network is shown in Fig. 4  . 3.2.1 System flow velocity Investigating the flow velocity in the developed hydraulic model enables us to establish whether there are sections of the network whose diameter is oversized (Teichmann et al., 2020 ). Fig. 5  (a) shows flow velocities for the simulations conducted during AHD, DPD, HPD, and DPD + FF. The town's velocity range under steady-state flow conditions was 0.01–2.36 m/s. The evaluation of the hydraulic model depicts that pipeline velocities are generally unfavorable in the farthest sections of the distribution network, and the pipes never run full because of high demand exceeding water supply in the predicted future state. The simulation results indicated that velocities in some areas are less than MWE's recommended minimum velocity (0.6 m/s). At the start of the network, the highest velocities are present. The pipeline velocities at the twin reservoir outlet ranged between 0.50 and 1.0 m/s. Besides, the pipeline velocity tends to decrease in the farthest parts of the twin reservoir tank. Moreover, the high pipeline velocities were established at the start of the network at the twin tank with velocities ranging between 0.82 and 2.36 m/s. Besides, velocities in the system network's farthest regions tend to drop below 0.01 m/s. Therefore, it can be inferred from the flow velocity analysis of the developed hydraulic model that under the predicted state of the system, there are low velocities in the distribution network due to excessive demand in the upstream areas of the town near the reservoir tank. Even during the peak demand periods, the flow velocities did not satisfy the recommended minimum velocity value of 0.6 m/s. The supply system's low velocities in the yet-to-be-annexed areas indicate that the supply system will not meet the required flows by 2035, as projected by this present study. Although it has been previously reported that low velocities are due to oversized pipes (Barton et al., 2019 ), for the case of the present system in its future state, it was attributed to the excessive water demand in the upstream areas of the network restricting water flow at far points. Sediments accumulate at the bottom of the distribution pipes at low velocities, especially over long distances, posing a risk of bacterial proliferation. Moreover, Kara et al. (2016)  reported that low flow velocity in the water distribution system was responsible for the gradual decrease in the active diameter of the pipe due to the continuous deposition of particles. Therefore, during the annexation of new areas by the system operators, the flow velocity should be within the recommended range (0.6–2 m/s) by the authorities (MWE 2013 ). Flow velocities in the distribution systems have been reported to range from 0.3 to 2.5 m/s, depending on the pipeline diameter (Barton et al., 2019 ). For self-cleaning purposes, a flow velocity of 1.5 m/s has been recommended to transport sediments in the distribution pipeline.  3.2.2 Nodal pressure variation The simulation results of pressure variation within the distribution network model are shown in Fig. 5 (b). Evidently, the pressure was strongly connected to the area topography, i.e., the nodes in low-land areas were subjected to larger pressures than those relatively located in high-level topographical areas. Based on the water supply design standards, the maximum pressure at consumer service connections should be > 60 m, while the residual pressure should not be < 10 m (MWE 2013 ). Previous studies reported optimal pressure in the water distribution network between 10 and 75 m (Kara et al., 2016 ). For the case of the present study, the future performance of the system under steady-state analysis showed the minimum pressure within the distribution network as 15.38 m during AHD, −2.09 m during DPD, −15.75 m during HPD, and −23.97 m during DPD + FF while the maximum pressure within the distribution network as 80.47 m during AHD, 76.32 m during DPD, 72.74 m during HPD, and 54.45 m during DPD + FF. It can be observed that the negative pressure occurred at junction node J-15 during the DPD simulation, junction nodes (J-11, J-12, J-13, J-14, J-15) during HPD simulations, and junction nodes (J-10, J-11, J-12, J-13, J-14, J-15) during DPD + FF simulation. The minimal pressures are experienced in far areas of “Kitoola,” “Kafutanu,” and “Bati Camp.” The minimum residual pressure in these areas is attributed to their height above the reservoir tank. Thus, they could not be supplied by gravity. Moreover, García-Ávila et al. (2019)  reported that it was impossible for places located at a higher height above sea level than the reservoir tank to be supplied by the gravity system. However, excessive pressure was observed at J-3, J-7, and J-17 under the AHD scenario, J-3, J-7, J-16, and J-17 for the DPD scenario, and J-3, J-7, and J-17 for the HPD scenario. At the observed nodes with pressure above 60 m, a phenomenon of “pipe rapture” could occur under different studied scenarios (Barton et al., 2019 ; Teichmann et al., 2020 ). Thus, it is recommended to install pressure-reducing valves in such areas if they are to be annexed in the future by the water authorities. Therefore, it is recommended that the water authority develop a maintenance and annexation plan for the system while considering the four demand scenarios to ensure its sustainability.   3.3 Performance of the water supply system To assess the performance of the water supply network both in its present and future state, pressure and velocity values obtained by the EPANET program were integrated into Eq. (3)  and Eq. (5) , respectively. Fig. 6   shows the technological performance indexes for pressure and velocity in the distribution network, both in the present and future, associated with demand growth and the annexation of new supply areas. The TPIP  and TPIV  values variation for the four scenarios considered under the predicted state are depicted in Fig. 6 (a). TPIP  values of 18.66, 16.46, 14.10, and 11.49% of pressure for simulated scenarios of AHD, DPD, HPD, and DPD + FF were obtained, respectively. The TPIv values were 5.94, 8.54, 14.25, and 19.43% for AHD, DPD, HPD, and DPD + FF scenarios, respectively. Although it has been previously reported by Zischg et al. (2017)  that low TPIV  values are due to oversized pipes in the water distribution system, the low TPIV  for the future state of this present study could be directly attributed to relatively low flow in the network compared to the demand. The water distribution network was highly efficient in its predicted state after the addition of three boreholes with an average yield of 5.75 m3 /h in the model, producing TPIp  values of 99.25, 96.45, 94.34, and 89.85% under AHD, DPD, HPD, and DPD + FF scenarios, respectively (Fig. 6 (b)). However, in the simulation of the model with four fire hydrants installed across the DN 75 mm pipeline (2 along “Nsakya A″ and the other 2 along “Nsakya B” pipeline”), the respective value of the TPIp  for the considered scenarios reduced by 15.41–25.63%. The simulation of the model network in its present state with the installation of two PRV on the DN 75 mm along P-2 and P-3 with two fire hydrants along each pipeline showed no significant change in the TPIp  values (p  < 0.05, at 5% significance level). These results, therefore, echo the requirement for the installation of PRV to improve the TPIP  in case more fire hydrants are to be installed along P-2 and P-3 pipelines located in the major town centers. Moreover, García-Ávila et al. (2019)  reported that installing the PRV along water pipelines would improve the TPIP  by more than 17%. Concerning the system velocity, the values obtained from EPANET under the current state of the water distribution network were applied in Eq. (3) . Results disclosed that the performance of the water distribution network based on flow velocity produced TPIV  values of 80.94, 87.54, 93.25, and 99.49% for the AHD, DPD, HPD, and DPD + FF scenarios, respectively (Fig. 6 (b)) on simulating with three additional pumps. This indicated that the system performs efficiently in its present state without adding excessive load demand subjected to the nodes. Therefore, it is recommended that a sustainable management plan for the supply system, including the functional and structural changes in the infrastructure over time to attain sustainability.  3.4 Evaluation of the water scheme operation In terms of maximizing appropriate pressures in the predicted state of the water distribution network, it was determined that the appropriate pressure be maximized to meet the demand requirements in the future. Diurnal analysis results from the network model under the predicted state showed that the hourly water demand exceeds what is produced. This implied that the current supplied flow from the two system boreholes would be far less than the projected (in 2035) hourly demand, necessitating additional boreholes to supply the network. Presently, the system operates with two underground boreholes (i.e., BH1 and BH2), producing safe yields of 2.5 and 9 m3 /h, respectively. The dual boreholes supply a safe yield of 11.5 m3/hr, far less than the projected water demand. This was projected to create a balance of supply of 14.361 m3 /h by 2035. Based on the objective function for maximization of adequate pressures and flow in the network, it is suggested that three additional boreholes with an average yield of 5.75 m3 /h if the current system is to meet the future demand and also allow the annexation of new areas currently not being served. The aforementioned recommendations would tackle the entire complexity of network transition over time due to demographic changes. Once the management and extension plans are successfully developed, further studies should be conducted on redesigning and rehabilitating the existing water supply network. Considering model outputs, several sustainable development goals (SDGs) related to implementing the water supply management plan could be achieved. The related SDGs are presented in the succeeding section of this paper.  3.5 Sustainable water supply management plan The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by world leaders in 2015, comprises 17 SDGs associated with 169 targets and 232 indicators (United Nations 2015 ). The three fundamental but interconnected pillars of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental, and social dimensions, are acknowledged by experts and multi-stakeholders globally (Browne 2015 ). Based on the performance evaluation and final flow balance requirement results, a substantial part of the study area would be exposed to water scarcity by 2035 if the water authority undertakes no extension or system modification plans. In other areas, the responsible authorities have established water supply management and extension plans to meet and maintain SDG 6 (UN-Water 2018 ). Water scarcity has been attributed to anthropogenic/human practices or/and natural factors. Previous studies conducted on SDGs reported that there are linkages with sustainable water supply management, which could be classified as reinforcing (in support of water supply management), enabling (that facilitates water supply management), constraining, counteracting, and conflicting (negatively impact drinking water supply management) (Bhaduri et al., 2016 ; Taka et al., 2021 ). Drinking water supply and extension management plans should be adopted through sustainable strategies to abate possible water scarcity challenges in the study area or worldwide. For instance, Zischg et al. (2017)  and Rihendyh et al. (2020)  introduced appropriate sustainable drinking water supply management plans to lessen the negative consequences associated with pipe network failure, low yields, inadequate storage, low velocities, and low pressures in the distribution network, which would consequently result into water scarcity. Although these drinking water supply management plans were conceptualized mainly to SDG 6 of ‘‘Clean Water and Sanitation,’’ the present study disclosed that proper management of water supply systems could be linked with several economic, environmental, and social-related sustainable development goals of the UN “Agenda 2030.” Previously, these linkages were classified as direct, indirect, and dependent (Diep et al., 2021 ). Implementing the developed drinking water management plans by authorities would achieve several SDGs in developed and low-developing countries. Table 1   shows relevant achieved SDGs, while Fig. 7   depicts the percentage target contribution per goal corresponding to this study. The SDG targets related to goal 6 showed direct linkages to developing and implementing a sustainable management plan for drinking water hydraulic systems via several practices. For instance, properly managing water supply systems promotes sustainable water withdrawal from underground and surface water sources to address the possible challenges of limited water resources. This addresses Target 6.4 “Ensure sustainable water withdraws.” Moreover, low water tariffs/charges could be applied in the highly vulnerable zones to ensure access to potable water for everyone in the community, meeting Target 6.1 ‘‘Equitable access to water.’’ The objectives of the developed hydraulic model obtained in the present study could be broadened to simulate and optimize water quality and pumping discharges for groundwater under different stress scenarios. Stress events which may include a shortage in subsurface recharge, uncontrolled water withdrawal from boreholes, or insufficient rainfall, should be adequately monitored, meeting Target 6.6 ‘‘Protect groundwater aquifers.’’ Accordingly, it is recommended that stringent laws that govern the practices of drilling private underground wells in the study area, particularly in the low aquifer zones, be developed and implemented. The previously-mentioned targets and the sustainable supply of drinking water in the study area could be strengthened through various activities such as (1) the application of strict laws towards deforestation to ensure adequate recharge of underground aquifers, (2) sensitization of water consumers on the potential effects of wastage, (3) drill additional boreholes to cater for the projected increase in population in the area, (4) adopt timely wastewater treatment and recycling technique as an artificial source for the recharge of aquifers, and (5) promote the installation of rainwater harvesting systems among residents. The execution of these actions would protect groundwater sources and the possible yield reduction. The reliable water supply in the area would support intensive agricultural practices by applying modern irrigation systems such as subsurface, drip, and sprinkler techniques on agricultural lands (Obura et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, fully functioning water supply schemes regularly supply water to poultry and animal farms. Adequate water supply via irrigation would promote more crop yield production without intensifying or expanding cultivated land. This guarantees agricultural sustainability and the possibility of abating food insecurity, achieving Target 2.1 ‘‘End hunger’’ and Target 2.3 ‘‘Increase agricultural productivity.’’ In the same context, sustainable water supply facilitates the growth of income-generating activities that use water as raw material, directly relating to Targets 1.1 “Eradication of extreme poverty” and 1.2 “Reduction in the proportion of people living under poverty,” particularly for people in poor communities. The provision of employment to majorly the youth would meet SDG Targets 8.5 and 8.6 “Creation of employment opportunities.” The improved water security would ensure its reliable supply to industries as a raw material for enhancing productivity (SDG target 8.4). Accordingly, this would synergize SDG targets 8.5 and 8.6. Moreover, time and money saved from walking long distances to collect water can be used for other productive uses due to the adequate and reliable supply of the water schemes. Furthermore, implementing such actions would combat desertification through appropriate irrigation practices, achieving Target 15.3 “Combat desertification, and restoration of degraded land/soil.” The recommended strategies of Targets 6.1 and 6.4 could maximize humans' good health and well-being and positively contribute to SDGs. For instance, secure and reliable water supply benefited livelihoods and decreased the socioeconomic status of the diarrheal burden, as observed in countries like India, Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia (UN-Water 2018 ). Adequate water availability for household uses can impact the water consumed and the available time to care for children. The reduction of long distances required to collect water is related to the lesser occurrence of diarrhea, better nutrition, and decreases in child mortality, consequently improving children's health (Hutton and Chase 2016 ). These actions meet Target 3.9 “reduce the number of water-related deaths and illnesses.” Moreover, an adequate water supply promotes sustainable food production, which directly reduces child deaths. A nutritious diet directly links to a reduction in the spread of non-communicable diseases. The good health of young children would enable them to attend school, meeting Target 4.2 and 4.7 “Access to education.” Improved water supply would provide people with increased convenience, safety, dignity, comfort, and status. The aforementioned benefits have been reported among the most significant attributes of reliable water supply and could apply to women. Reliable water supply to households would provide greater well-being to household members, especially young girls, and women traditionally responsible for fetching water (Fisher 2006 ; UN-Water 2018 ). Long distances to water sources might increase the time women would have spent carrying out income-generating activities. In this context, reliable piped water supply in the communities directly relates to improved gender equality, achieving SDG Target 5.5 “Promote gender equality.” Implementing the water supply plan would reinforce the loop for designing and constructing resilient infrastructures in the economy, meeting SDG target 9.1 “Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure.” Moreover, reliable piped water is connected to increased usage, safety, and comfort life in towns and cities, achieving SDG Target 11.1 “Adequate, safe, and affordable basic services.” The sustainability of drinking water schemes is directly influenced by community participation, reliability of the hydraulic infrastructure, and technical planning (Fig. 8  ). A logical framework based on this relationship could be applied to assess the sustainability of water supply systems in any low-developing country with or without major modification (Masduqi et al., 2010 ). The considered sustainability approaches would be beneficial to planners, decision-makers in the water supply sector, local authorities, and officials responsible for drinking water schemes in implementing water supply extension-related projects. Accordingly, it is highly suggested that SDGs and their related targets be considered during the planning stages for future activities concerning the extension or upgrade of the water supply network and its performance management. Furthermore, it is suggested that groundwater recharge and the extent of water quality variations within the distribution network should be estimated because both water quantity and quality are crucial for establishing appropriate management strategies (Rihendyh et al., 2020 ). Implementing the aforementioned recommendations in future studies would support attaining other SDG targets.  3.6 Supporting the implementation process of SDGs The complexity of implementing SDGs, especially Goal 6, arises from majorly inadequate budgets and dysfunctional water governance challenges in the low developing countries. Lack of institutional capacity contributes to the poor performance of water governance in most developing countries (UN-Water 2018 ). Therefore, implementing a water supply development plan should support institutional capacity building to achieve SDGs. The water governance strategy should embrace transparency, efficiency and effectiveness, participatory, equitable and inclusive, accountability, and respect for the country's laws. Fostering good water governance and institutional capacity requires the engagement of different stakeholders of the water supply network and the formulation of incentives that would promote harmonized regulations and policies (Gumeta-Gómez et al., 2021 ). Moreover, it is significant to recognize that implementing a water supply management plan is a community development process that requires political will and public acceptance (Browne 2015 ). Therefore, the aforementioned key issues must be addressed at all planning stages for implementing a sustainable water supply management plan.  3.7 Financing the development and implementation of the water supply management plan Most developing countries struggle to implement targets set for most SDGs, especially those related to SDG 6 “Water and sanitation,” due to financial limitations (UN-Water 2018 ). The annual investments for meeting SDGs related to water and wastewater have previously been valued at 25 billion US dollars for rural areas and 46 billion US dollars for urban areas from 2016 to 2030 (Delanka-Pedige et al., 2020 ). Successfully implementing water supply management plans requires innovative and holistic approaches for financing the designed projects that would turn present plans into hydrological and hydraulic infrastructures for achieving sustainable development goals. Projects implemented through external aid have been reported to be less sustainable, yet consumer-paid ways of financing, such as taxes, bonds, and tariffs, can be more feasible options (UN-Water 2018 ). Before choosing the financing plan, addressing the evaluation and accounting for the planned projects is vital in applying different paths to achieve SDGs related to water supply management. It is suggested that financing models generating a unique set of incentives that could be attractive for the different relevant stakeholders of the water supply system be studied in future studies. This could endorse further investments in the existing water supply schemes to meet future demand requirements.   4 Conclusion This study revealed that the performance of the water supply scheme is currently hydraulically sound but will not have the potential to serve the whole town by 2035. The yield from the current two existing wells (11.5 m3 /h) is far less than the projected water demand of 25.86 m3 /h. Thus, there is a need for an additional yield (14 m3 /h) to supplement the current supply. Overall improvements on the hydraulic infrastructures and other appurtenances could be carried out following this study on a basis considering the town's growth in the future. After analyzing the simulation results, we suggest drilling extra wells to supplement the two existing boreholes before 2035. An additional storage reservoir with a capacity of 190 m3  should be constructed to meet the required storage capacity of the system. Water quality must be incorporated into the modeling and simulation of the water system to develop a holistic management plan. Improving the desertification system's performance in alignment with future requirements would assist in promoting attributes required for meeting the water supply-related SDGs. The obtained model outputs would promote better management practices for the water distribution networks, which reveal direct/indirect linkages with SDGs that are relevant to water security, poverty eradication; zero hunger; economic growth; sustainable cities and communities; good health and well-being; and conservation of life on land. The proposed model approach could be upgraded by incorporating water quality performance for the system to ensure effective and robust future management plans.
