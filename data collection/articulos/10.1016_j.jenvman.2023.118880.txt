                  Ecosystem services (ESs) play vital roles in meeting the needs of human well-being and supporting sustainable development. However, there is limited research on how the types, amounts, interactions, and changes of the ESs collectively impact human well-being under the context of sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. This study selected Qinghai Province of China as the study area and intended to make such an attempt to fill this gap in terms of the following aspects: (1) analyzing the spatial patterns and changing trends of ten ESs (food supply, water supply, carbon sink, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, flood mitigation，cultural service，net primary productivity, and habitat quality) in Qinghai Province from 2000 to 2018; (2)constructing a multi-level index system of human well-being under the framework of the SDGs, and setting the criteria to assess the level of local human well-being; and (3) building a structural equation model to explore the direct and indirect impacts of the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. The findings revealed that: (1) most of the ecosystem services fluctuated with significant downward or upward trends during 2000–2018, except for four ESs (i.e., carbon sink, soil retention, flood mitigation, and habitat quality); (2) only a few indicators of local residents' well-being such as meat production, milk production, the numbers of medical technical personnel in hospitals and health centers, and the numbers of scientific and technical personnel met the SDG criteria in most time, while other indicators remained at low levels and there were large gaps between them and the SDG criteria; (3) actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were affected by the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs with different degrees directly or indirectly. The approaches and results in this study are instructive for other regions of the world to make certain the roles of ESs in promoting human well-being and substantiating the SDGs.

However, there is limited research on how the types, amounts, interactions, and changes of the ESs collectively impact human well-being under the context of sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. This study selected Qinghai Province of China as the study area and intended to make such an attempt to fill this gap in terms of the following aspects: (1) analyzing the spatial patterns and changing trends of ten ESs (food supply, water supply, carbon sink, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, flood mitigation，cultural service，net primary productivity, and habitat quality) in Qinghai Province from 2000 to 2018; (2)constructing a multi-level index system of human well-being under the framework of the SDGs, and setting the criteria to assess the level of local human well-being; and (3) building a structural equation model to explore the direct and indirect impacts of the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. The findings revealed that: (1) most of the ecosystem services fluctuated with significant downward or upward trends during 2000–2018, except for four ESs (i.e., carbon sink, soil retention, flood mitigation, and habitat quality); (2) only a few indicators of local residents' well-being such as meat production, milk production, the numbers of medical technical personnel in hospitals and health centers, and the numbers of scientific and technical personnel met the SDG criteria in most time, while other indicators remained at low levels and there were large gaps between them and the SDG criteria; (3) actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were affected by the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs with different degrees directly or indirectly. The approaches and results in this study are instructive for other regions of the world to make certain the roles of ESs in promoting human well-being and substantiating the SDGs.

The relationship between ESs and human well-being has drawn more attention since the MA, and has become an important theme of sustainability science (Wu, 2013 ; Bennett et al., 2015 ). Understanding the relationship between ESs and human well-being is essential for promoting effective environmental management and policy-making. Until now, many scholars have explored the relationship between ESs and human well-being. Some studies revealed the impacts of ESs on human well-being based on subjective questionnaires or expert scores. For example, Xu et al. (2018)  explored the contributions of the residents' perceived changes in ESs to well-being. Zhang et al. (2021)  investigated the impact paths of land use, demographic features, and provisioning and regulating services on human well-being using questionnaires and structural equation model Sultana and Alam (2023)  selected Rajshahi City in Bangladesh as the study area and explored how settlements dwellers perceived the relationship between four categories of ESs and their livelihood. And there were also studies investigating the associations between ESs and well-being by using statistical analyses. Qiu et al. (2022)  explored the influential paths of supplies and demands of provisioning and regulating services on well-being. Liu et al. (2023a)  examined the ES-HWB relationship and found that the relationships between different ESs and human well-being varied with time. There is growing recognition of the crucial role of ESs in supporting human well-being. However, how do the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs collectively affect human well-being are still less discussed. Sustainable development has always been a hot issue concerned by the international community. Firstly, the Millennium Declaration set out 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for sustainability by 2015 in 2000 (United Nations, 2015a ). In 2015, the United Nations officially adopted “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” to address the precarious environmental situation and the pressing need for socioeconomic growth in the future and 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets were set by 2030 in this program (United Nations, 2015b ). Many scholars carried out comprehensive assessments on sustainable development levels in different regions under the SDGs framework. Roy and Pramanick (2019)  constructed a comprehensive evaluating and monitoring approach towards the SDG6 in India. Liu et al. (2023b)  devised a systematic method for assessing the progress in terms of the 17 SDGs in 254 cities of China. Chen et al. (2023)  analyzed the progresses of natural resources-related SDGs in countries along the Maritime Silk Road. The studies mentioned above all adopted human well-being indicators (such as poverty rate, available drinking water, unemployment rate, crime rate, school attendance, etc.) to assess the progresses of the SDGs. It should be noted that the comprehensive assessment on the progress of the SDGs may neglect the organic nexus among the components of the SDGs as well as the region-specific features in strengthening the maneuverability of the SDGs. ESs are one of the key indicators to weigh up human well-being (Wood and DeClerck, 2016 ; Geijzendorffer et al., 2017 ). Improving human well-being is the ultimate goal and inextricable part of sustainable development (Wu et al., 2014 ). Thus, ESs, human well-being and the SDGs are complementary and interconnected. However, studies that analyze the combinations impacts of the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on human well-being under the framework of the SDGs are still lacking. Additionally, due to the inadequate and uneven development across the current world, the implementation of the SDGs should include region-specific features. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an approach to explore the roles of the ESs in improving the level of human well-being towards substantiating the SDGs. Qinghai Province of China is strategically important in providing multiple vital ecosystem services for local residents, China and even the world, while due to the priority protection of the ecological environment, the local economy is restricted and backward and the level of human well-being of local residents is relatively low. Towards the cohesive aims of promoting ecological conservation, improving local human well-being and substantiating the SDGs, it is reasonable and representative to choose Qinghai Province as the research area. The specific objectives of this study are to: (1) quantify the spatial patterns and changing trends of the ESs during 2000–2018 to make certain the changes of local ecological conditions; (2) assess the level of local human well-being under the framework of the SDGs; (3) explore the direct and indirect impacts of types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being.  2 Research framework constructing 2.1 Theoretical framework Ecosystem services are called the benefits of human society obtaining from the nature (Daily, 1997 ). ESs were classified into four categories: supporting services, provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural services (MA, 2001 ), which have been widely accepted by the world. Human well-being means the state of life, which can also be described as a state of material abundance, health, and happiness (Costanza et al., 2007 ; Wu, 2013 ; Huang et al., 2016 ). MA classified human well-being into five categories: basic living conditions, security, health, good social relationships, and freedom of choice and action (MA, 2005 ). There are several frameworks conceptualizing the links between ESs and human well-being, including the MA (MA, 2005 ), the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB, 2010 ), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (Díaz et al., 2015 ), etc. As described by the MA, ESs had closely connection with human well-being and different categories of ESs had varying connections with the layers of human well-being. Provisioning services such as food, water and materials are related to basic living conditions and health of human well-being; regulating services such as climate regulation connect with the security of human well-being. Cultural services are related to subjective human well-being. However, the interactions (synergies and trade-offs) among ESs and the changes in ESs make the impacts of ESs on human well-being complex (Fu et al., 2022 ). Therefore, it is scientifically sound to explore the impacts of the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on human well-being based on the frameworks of the MA and the SDGs.  2.2 Research framework Based on the frameworks of ESs, the MA and the SDGs, this study developed the research framework as Fig. 1  . Firstly, the data were collected and processed. Then, the ten ESs were assessed using various models with different data as the inputs. Thirdly, the levels of three layers of human well-being system through combining the MA with the SDGs were evaluated. Finally, the impacts of ten ESs in terms of the types, amounts, interactions, and their changes on actual and targeted human well-being of local residents were explored. The results of this study are helpful to make policies towards substantiating the integrated aims of ecological conservation and socioeconomic sustainable development.   3 Materials and methods 3.1 Study area Qinghai Province is located in the western part of China and the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 2  ), and its name originated from Qinghai Lake, the largest inland saltwater lake in China. With a vast territory of 7.22 × 105  square kilometers, Qinghai Province has magnificent mountains, lots of rivers, numerous ethnic groups and colorful cultures. Qinghai is characterized by its original ecosystem, with significant ecological importance and unique charm. Annual average temperature ranges from −5.1 °C to 9 °C, annual rainfall varies from 15 mm to 772.8 mm, and the general precipitation distribution gradually decreases from southeast to northwest. It has long sunshine duration and high solar radiation intensity. Annual total solar radiation can reach 5860∼7400 MJ/m2 . The elevation ranges from 1708 m to 6452 m, and the average elevation is 4061 m. The terrain is low in the east and north, and high in the west and south. Grassland makes up the majority of land use types. The administrative division of the Qinghai Province included the eight cities and 45 counties (Fig.A1 ). There is a critical ecological function area called the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) in Qinghai Province, which is famous for the cradles of the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang Rivers. It has a high natural endowment and provides the shelter for many rare plants and animals, while the ecosystems are vulnerable to unreasonable human activities and climate change. In order to conserve the critical and fragile ecosystems, China declared to establish the Sanjiangyuan National Park here, one of Chinese first list of national parks in 2021, which consists of Yangtze River Source Area, Yellow River Source Area, and Lancang River Source Area. Qinghai is a multi-ethnic province, and the seventh census showed that ethnic minorities account for 49.47% of the population. The proportion of employed persons in the tertiary industry is the highest, followed by the primary industry and the second industry.  3.2 Data collection Data used in this study included two major categories: environmental data and statistical data. Environmental data were mainly used to calculate ESs (except for food supply service). All spatial data had a resolution of 1 km × 1 km and a unified spatial projection. Statistical data were mainly used to calculate the amounts of food supply and the index values of actual human well-being. Details of data used in this study were showed in Table A1 .  3.3 Methodology 3.3.1 Mapping the distribution of ecosystem services Ten items of ESs were selected and quantified during 2000–2018, which were classified into four categories by the MA, i.e., provisioning services (food supply, water supply), regulating services (carbon sink, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, flood mitigation), cultural services (cultural service value), and supporting services (net primary productivity (NPP), habitat quality). Food supply was calculated by adding the outputs of major farm and livestock products according to the Qinghai Statistical Yearbook. Food supply was only calculated at the county scale (45 counties in Qinghai Province) due to data availability. For several water-related ESs (including water supply, hydrological regulation and flood mitigation), the amount of water in each component of the water cycle process was estimated using the Community Land Model (CLM) (Lawrence et al., 2019 ), which was proved to be robust to simulate hydrological process in Qinghai Province (Yu et al., 2022a ), and then the corresponding quantities of water-related ESs were calculated using the following equations:(1) W S = W c a n   + W s f c   + W s n o   + W s o i l l i q   + W s o i l i c e   + W a  + q o v e r   + q d r a i       (2) H R = W s o i l l i q   + W s o i l i c e   + E T     (3) F M = q d r a i       where W S    is the quantity of water supply service (m3 ), H R    is the quantity of hydrological regulation service (m3 ), F M    is the quantity of flood mitigation service (m3 ), W c a n      is canopy water and canopy snow water (kg/m2 ), W s f c      is surface water (kg/m2 ), W s n o      is snow water (kg/m2 ), W s o i l l i q      is soil water (kg/m2 ), W s o i l i c e      is soil ice (kg/m2 ), W a     is water in the unconfined aquifer (kg/m2 ), E T    is evapotranspiration (kg/m2 ·s), q o v e r      is surface runoff (kg/m2 ·s), and q d r a i      is sub-surface runoff (kg/m2 ·s). Carbon sink was presented by the difference between gross primary product (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RECO), which was calculated using the machine learning methods (i.e., random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN)) with meteorological observation data, multi-source remote sensing data, flux observation data and soil organic carbon data as the inputs (Yu et al., 2022a ). Soil retention was calculated based on the modified Chinese soil loss equation (CSLE) (Liu et al., 2002 ). The equations are expressed as follows:(4) S E  p  = R * K * L * S     (5) S E  a  = R * K * L * S * B * E * T     (6) S R = S E  p  − S E  a      where S R    is the quantity of soil retention service (t/ha), S E  p     is potential soil loss by water (t/ha), S E  a     is actual soil loss by water (t/ha), R    is rainfall erosivity (MJ·mm/(h·ha·y)) that was calculated based on the daily precipitation, K    is the soil erodibility factor (t·ha·h/(ha·MJ·mm·y)) that was calculated based on the content of each component in the soil, L    and S    are the slope length and slope steepness factors that were calculated based on Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using ArcGIS10.3, and B   , E    and T    are dimensionless factors of biological-control, engineering-control, and tillage practices, respectively. Sand fixation service was measured using the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) model (Fryrear et al., 1998 ). The equations are expressed as follows:(7) Q m a x p   = 109.8 * W F * E F * S C F * K      (8) s p  = 150.71 * W F * E F * S C F * K   − 0.3711      (9) S L  p  = ( 2 x / s p  2   )  * Q m a x p   * exp ( − ( x / s p   )  2  )      (10) Q m a x a   = 109.8 * W F * E F * S C F * K * C O G      (11) s a  = 150.71 * W F * E F * S C F * K * C O G   − 0.3711      (12) S L  a  = ( 2 x / s a  2   )  * Q m a x a   * exp ( − ( x / s a   )  2  )      (13) S F = S L  p  − S L  a      where S F    is the quantity of sand fixation service (kg/m2 ), S L  p     is potential soil loss by wind (kg/m2 ), S L  a     is actual soil loss by wind (kg/m2 ), Q m a x p      is the potential maximum transport capacity, Q m a x a      is the actual maximum transport capacity, W F    is climatic factor, E F    is soil erodibility factor, S C F    is soil crust factor, K ′     is soil roughness factor, C O G    is combined vegetation factor, s p     is the length of the potential critical field (m), s a     is the length of the critical field (m), and x    is the distance to the upwind edge of the field (m). Cultural services were measured using the tool of the Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) (Sherrouse and Semmens, 2015 ). Developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center (GECSC), the SolVES is a geographic information system (GIS) application, which can integrate user's preference data obtained through questionnaire and environmental data to evaluate and map social values of the ecosystems. We collected 300 corresponding questionnaires and environmental data (including slope, mountain shading, land use, spatial patterns of roads and railroads, distribution of attractions, and distribution of rivers) as the inputs of the SolVES model to calculate the value of cultural services (Yu et al., 2022a ). NPP was calculated using the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model (Potter et al., 1993 ; Field et al., 1995 ; Zhu et al., 2006 ). The equation is expressed as follows:(14) N P P = A P A R * ε     where N P P    is net primary productivity (g C/m2 ), A P A R    is the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (MJ/m2 ) that was calculated with solar radiation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as the inputs, and ε    is actual light use efficiency (g C/MJ), which was calculated with temperature and precipitation as the inputs. Habitat quality was assessed using the Habitat Quality module of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) (https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest ) model (Sharp et al., 2016 ). Firstly, land use types in the study area were divided into habitat and non-habitat. Then the threat sources that may affect the habitat, such as roads, farmland and urbanized area were selected to assess the degree of the impact of each threat on the habitat (i.e., threat distance, threat weight, and threat types: linear or exponential). Finally, the habitat quality was mapped using the module.  3.3.2 Changing trends of ecosystem services Changing trends of the ESs during 2000–2018 were examined using the Mann-Kendall method (Mann, 1945 ; Kendall, 1975 ). In the Mann-Kendall test, under the null hypothesis H0 , the time series data (x 1  …, x a  ) include a sample of a    independent and random variables with the same distribution. Under the alternative hypothesis H1 , there is an increasing or decreasing trend in the time series. Statistic S    of the test was calculated as follows:(15) S = ∑ i = 1  a − 1   ∑ j = i + 1  a  s g n ( x j  − x i   )      (16) s g n ( x j  − x i   )  = { + 1 , x j  − x i  > 0    0 , x j  − x i  = 0    − 1 , x j  − x i  < 0          In this study, the time series length a    was 19 (from the year of 2000–2018), and the test was conducted using the Z    value. At the given significance level of α = 0.05, the null hypothesis is accepted when | Z |  ≤ Z 1 − α / 2     , and the changing trend within the time series is considered not to be significant. When | Z |  > Z 1 − α / 2     , the null hypothesis is rejected, and the changing trend is considered to be significant.(17) Z = { ( S − 1  )  / V A R ( S )    , S > 0    0 , S = 0    ( S + 1  )  / V A R ( S )    , S < 0          (18) V A R ( S )  = [ ( a ( a − 1  )  ( 2 a + 5  )  − ∑ i = 1  b  t i  ( t i  − 1  )  ( 2 t i  + 5  )   ]  / 18     where b    is the number of the nodes in the time series, and t i     is the width of the node. The slopes of the changing trends of the ESs were calculated using Sen's slope (Gilbert, 1987 ):(19) β = M e d i a n [ ( x j  − x i   )  / ( j − i  )   ]      where M e d i a n    represents the median value, β > 0    means upward trend, β < 0    means downward trend, and β = 0    means no change.  3.3.3 Evaluating actual human well-being Firstly, we constructed a multi-level system of human well-being in Qinghai Province, which integrated the frameworks of the MA (MA, 2005 ) and Maslow's demand levels (Maslow, 1958 ). The first level included three element layers: basic need well-being, health and safety well-being, and mental fulfillment well-being. The second level were divided into six criterion layers. The last level was named as the index layer. The indicators in this layer correspond to six criterion layers. The data of index layer were collected from the Qinghai Statistical Yearbooks, covering 45 counties of Qinghai Province during 2000–2018. Due to data availability, we actually evaluated the well-being levels of local residents in 33 counties of Qinghai Province. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the consistency of human well-being indicators within the period of 2000–2018, the missing data of well-being indicators in some years were replaced with data from the nearest year. Secondly, based on the “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (UNSC, 2015 ), the targeted SDG layers were screened, and each human well-being index layer was linked to the corresponding targeted SDG layer. Finally, an evaluation indicator system of the local human well-being under the framework of the SDGs in Qinghai Province was established (Table 1  ), which was used to assess the levels of actual human well-being and the gaps between actual human well-being and the corresponding criterion of the SDGs (we called the targeted human well-being in this study). Some reference values of human well-being were created in response to the relevant SDG criteria in order to measure the targeted human well-being in Qinghai Province under the framework of the SDGs. Concretely, we referred to the “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (UNSC, 2015 ) or the 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards report (Sachs, et al., 2018 ) to identify the corresponding SDG criteria. If no reference values of the SDG criteria were listed in the above report, we used the national per capita data from the “Statistical Bulletin of National Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China” or “China Statistical Yearbook” in recent ten years to project the national per capita data in 2030 as the criterion using a gray Markov prediction model, or referred to the well-off standard formulated by China as the criterion (Chen, 2004 ; Gong, 2004 ). The specific evaluation indicator system linked with the SDGs for targeted human well-being were shown in Table 1 . At the same time, the years exceeded the SDG criterion in each indicator were counted and divided by 19 (the study period) to obtain the attainment rate of the SDG criterion of each human well-being indicator, which was used to analyze the level of actual human well-being in Qinghai Province. Entropy method was adopted to calculate the weights of various layers of actual human well-being, namely that the values of criterion layers and element layers of actual human well-being could be obtained through the standardized values of the evaluation indicator layers of human well-being and their weights. The entropy method determined randomness and dispersion of the indicators through calculating the index weight and entropy value, and thus can avoid the deviation caused by human subjective factors (Shannon, 1948 ; Guo, 1998 ). The specific calculation steps are as follows:(20) X s − i j   = ( X i j   − X min   )  / ( X max  − X min   )      (21) X s − i j   = ( X max  − X i j    )  / ( X max  − X min   )      First, the indicators were standardized to eliminate the dimension of each indicator. X s − i j      is the standardized value of the sample j    in the indicator i   , X i j      is the value of the sample j    in the indicator i   , and X max     and X min     are the maximum and minimum values of the indicator i   , respectively. The selection of the standardization formula depends on the positive or negative characteristics of the indicator. To normalize the positive and negative indicators, formulas (20) and (21)  were adopted respectively. Then, the weight of each indicator was calculated according to the following equations:(22) Y i j   = X s − i j   / ∑ i = 1  m  X s − i j       (23) D i  = − ( 1 / ln  m  )  ∑ i = 1  m  ( Y i j   * ln  Y i j    )      (24) E i  = 1 − D  i      (25) W i  = E i  / ∑ i = 1  n  E i       Y i j      is the proportion of the value of the sample j    in the indicator i   , D i     is the entropy value of the indicator i   , m    is the total number of the samples in this study, E i     is the information utility value of the indicator i   , W i     is the weight of the indicator i   , and n    is the total number of indices in the criterion layers or element layers. Finally, the numerical values (C   ) of actual human well-being of the criterion layers or element layers were obtained according to formula (26) . The weight calculation results of actual human well-being layers were shown in Table A2 .(26) C = ∑ i = 1  n  ( X s − i j   * W i   )       The same approach was applied to calculate the numerical values of the criterion layers or element layers of the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being, and the results were shown in Table A3 .  3.3.4 Assessment on the impact paths of ESs on the human well-being Structural equation model (SEM) is a statistical method to analyze the relationship between the variables based on the covariance matrix (Jöreskog, 1970 ; Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1982 ). For some variables that are difficult to be directly measured, which are called the latent variables, they can be indirectly expressed by the observed variables that can be measured directly. SEM reveals the complex causal relationship between these variables using corresponding model equations. It includes structural model component and measurement model component. Structural model refers to the relationship between latent variables, and measurement model refers to the relationship between the observed variables and the latent variables. The impact path of SEM includes two patterns, namely direct and indirect. The direct impact path means that one variable has direct impact on the other. For example, if there are three direct impact paths: A to C, A to B and B to C, and the indirect impact path means that A indirectly impacts C with B as the bridge. SEM is an important tool for multivariate data analysis and can process multiple dependent variables simultaneously, which makes it widely used in the field of ecology (Zhang, et al., 2021 ; Qiu et al., 2022 ; Hu et al., 2023 ). In this study, the SEM theoretical model was established including the latent variables and corresponding observed variables (Fig.A2 ), namely supporting service supply, provisioning service supply, regulating service supply, cultural service supply, changes in supporting services, changes in provisioning services, changes in regulating services, changes in cultural service, actual human well-being, and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. Changes in the ESs were represented by the slopes of changing trends of the ESs, which were calculated using the Mann-Kendall method. Actual human well-being was represented by the data obtained from the Statistical Yearbooks. The gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were represented by the differences between actual human well-being and the SDG criterion of each indicator. The hypotheses in the SEM were detected as shown in Table 2  . In this study, the types, amounts and changes of the ESs were assumed to have direct impacts on actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being, while the types of the ESs were supposed to affect actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being indirectly through the interactions and changes of the ESs. Specific indirect impact paths of each hypothesis were detailed in the Supplementary Material. The SEM was conducted in the platform of AMOS (IBM SPSS Amos 26), and the fitting results were evaluated and analyzed. The following evaluation indices were used to evaluate the robustness of the SEM: Ratio of Chi-Square and Degrees of Freedom (CMIN/DF) < 3, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08, and Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI) > 0.9 (Zhang, et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Finally, the regression weights and standardized regression weights of the direct impacts in the structural model were obtained. The indirect impacts were obtained according to the sum of the specific indirect impact path coefficients under the corresponding hypothesis. Specific indirect impact path coefficients were obtained through multiplying the standardized regression weights of the direct impacts under each specific indirect impact path. If the weight was significant (p < 0.05), the hypothesis was considered to be valid, and otherwise, the hypothesis was invalid. The greater the weight, the larger the influence of the ecosystem service-related variable(s).    4 Results 4.1 Spatial patterns of the ESs Spatial patterns of the ESs in Qinghai Province during 2000–2018 were shown in Fig. 3  , and their corresponding changing trends during 2000–2018 were shown in Fig.A3 . For food supply, the high value areas were mainly distributed in the eastern part of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 a). 59.39% of Qinghai Province exhibited upward trend in food supply and was predominantly distributed in the northern part of Qinghai Province, while 40.61% of Qinghai Province showed downward trend in food supply and was mainly located in the southern part (Fig.A3a ). As for water supply, the high value areas were mainly distributed in the southwestern and central-northern parts of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 b). The areas with downward trend accounted for 39.23% of Qinghai Province and were mainly observed in central and southern parts, while the areas with upward trend accounted for 59.51% of Qinghai Province and were mainly distributed in the northern and southeastern parts (Fig.A3b ). The areas with high values of carbon sink were mainly distributed in the eastern and southern-central parts of Qinghai Province, while the areas with low values in this service were mainly located in the northwestern part of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 c). The areas with upward and downward trends in carbon sink accounted for 4.01% and 5.16% of Qinghai Province, respectively, and were scattered in the east and south (Fig.A3c ). The high-value areas of soil retention were mainly distributed in the southern-central and eastern parts of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 d), while most areas had no significant change in soil retention (Fig.A3d ). Sand fixation were high in the western part of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 e). Overall, the areas with upward trend in sand fixation were scattered in the central-eastern part, while the areas with downward trend in sand fixation were mainly located in the western part; the areas with upward and downward trends in sand fixation accounted for 28.33% and 43.24% of Qinghai Province, respectively (Fig.A3e ). For hydrological regulation, the high value areas were mainly distributed in the western and central parts of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 f). The regions with upward trend in hydrological regulation were mainly located in the northern and southeastern parts and accounted for 67.07% of Qinghai Province, while the areas with downward trend in hydrological regulation were mainly located in the central-southern and southwestern parts and accounted for 30.56% of Qinghai Province (Fig.A3f ). The high value areas of flood mitigation were main located in the central-northern parts of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 g). As for flood mitigation, most areas showed no significant change. The areas with significant and insignificant upwards in flood mitigation were mainly scattered in central-eastern and western parts of Qinghai Province, while the areas with significant and insignificant downward trends in flood mitigation were mainly distributed in the southwestern and northeastern parts (Fig.A3g ). The high value areas of cultural services were mainly distributed in the eastern part of Qinghai Province where many famous tourist sites are located (Fig. 3 h). NPP was higher in the eastern and southern-central parts and lower in the northwest part and increased from the northwest part to the southeast part of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 i). 87.43% of Qinghai Province indicated significant upward trend in NPP, and only some western and central parts indicated downward trend in NPP(Fig.A3i ). Most areas in habitat quality were relatively high, and the low-value areas were mainly located in the eastern and northwestern parts of Qinghai Province (Fig. 3 j). For habitat quality, the areas with downward trend were mainly distributed in the eastern part, while the areas with upward trend were mainly located in the northern part (Fig.A3j ).  4.2 Status of actual human well-being The changing trends in each indicator of actual human well-being and the gaps with the SDG criteria were shown in Fig.A4-Fig.A6 . The attainment rates of actual human well-being of 33 counties in Qinghai Province from 2000 to 2018 were illustrated in Table A4-Table A6 . The status of three element layers and the total level of actual human well-being in Qinghai Province were evaluated according to the weights calculated by entropy method. 4.2.1 Basic need well-being For basic need well-being, the indicators of M2 and M3 showed relatively higher levels, and 51.52% and 42.42% counties were above the SDG criteria in these two indicators during 2000–2018, respectively. The indicators of M1 and M5 had relatively lower levels, with 84.85% counties below the SDG criteria all the years (Table A4 ). The overall level of actual human well-being at the basic needs layer in Qinghai Province was obtained through integrating the nine standardized indicators in basic income and basic material layers with the corresponding weights (Fig.A7 ). For basic need well-being, most counties showed increasing trends over time, while the level of well-being in Banma County in Golog decreased during 2000–2018, and some counties were stable (such as Yushu, Chengduo, and Nangqian) over time.  4.2.2 Health and safety well-being For health and safety well-being, the indicator H3 showed relatively higher level, with 45.45% counties above the SDG criterion during 2000–2018, and the attainment rates of all counties were over 60%. The indicator H1 had relatively lower level, and 96.97% counties were below the SDG criterion during 2000–2018 (Table A5 ). The overall level of actual human well-being at the health and safety well-being layer in Qinghai Province was obtained through integrating the seven indicators in physical health and safety layers with the corresponding weights (Fig.A8 ). For health and safety well-being, different counties had different trends: most counties were stable (such as Datong and Xunhua), while some counties indicated decreasing trends (such as Maqin and Delingha) over time.  4.2.3 Mental fulfillment well-being For mental fulfillment well-being, the indicator E2 showed higher level, with 87.88% counties above the SDG criterion all the years, and the attainment rates of all counties were over 68%. The indicators of E3 and E5 also had relative higher levels, with the attainment rates of all counties over 52% and 47%, respectively. The indicators of R1 and E1 had relatively lower levels, with 100% and 84.85% counties below the SDG criteria all the years, respectively (Table A6 ). The overall level of actual human well-being at the mental fulfillment well-being layer in Qinghai Province was obtained through integrating the nine indicators in social relationship and education layers with the corresponding weights (Fig.A9 ). For mental fulfillment well-being, most counties showed increasing trends (such as Qilian and Haiyan) over time. The above three element layers (i.e., basic need layer, health and safety layer, and mental fulfillment layer) were standardized and multiplied by the corresponding weights to obtain the overall level of total actual human well-being in Qinghai Province (Fig. 4  ). For total actual human well-being, most counties showed increasing trends (such as Qilian and Haiyan) over time, while some counties (such as Yushu, Chengduo, and Nangqian) indicated few changes during 2000–2018.   4.3 Impacts of the ESs on the human well-being According to the model fit results, CMIN/DF was 2.813 (<3), RMSA was 0.001 (<0.08), and GFI was 0.919 (>0.9), indicating that all the three indicators met the evaluation criteria of model fitting, and the structural equation model was robust to study the impacts of the ESs on the human well-being in Qinghai Province. The direct impact paths of ESs on actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were presented in Fig. 5   and Table A7 . The correlation between the supporting service supply and provisioning service supply was insignificant, while the correlations between other pairs of ecosystem service supply were significant, and the correlation between the supporting service supply and regulating service supply was negative, indicating that there was a trade-off between them. The other ecosystem service supply pairs were positively correlated, showing synergistic relationships. The results indicated that the hypothesis H1a was invalid and the other hypotheses in H1 were valid. The direct promotion impacts of supporting service supply, regulating service supply and cultural service supply on the changes in supporting, regulating and cultural services were significant, respectively, while the direct promotion impact of provisioning service supply on the changes in provisioning services was insignificant, invalidating H2b and validating other hypotheses in H2. Cultural service supply had significant direct impact on actual human well-being, indicating that the hypothesis H3d was valid and the other hypotheses in H3 were invalid. Provisioning service supply and the changes in regulating services had insignificant direct impacts on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being, indicating that the hypotheses H4b and H4g were invalid while the other hypotheses in H4 were valid. The indirect impacts in the structural model component were shown in Table 3  . The results showed that supporting service supply, provisioning service supply, and cultural service supply had significant indirect impacts on actual human well-being, which validated the hypotheses H5a, H5b and H5d, respectively. Provisioning service supply had insignificant indirect impact on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being, invalidating the hypothesis H6b and validating other hypotheses in H6. Meanwhile, the indirect impacts of cultural service supply on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were larger than other ecosystem service supplies.   5 Discussion 5.1 Reasons for the changes in ESs The trends of the ESs dynamics reflected the changes of local ecological environment to some extent. For provisioning service, water supply service decreased in the central and southern parts of Qinghai Province during 2000–2018. Yu et al. (2022a)  revealed the area of wetland was the mainly impact element on water supply in Qinghai Province. The land use transformation matrix in Qinghai Province between 2000 and 2015 showed that the conversion of wetlands to other land use types in the central and southern regions was relatively high (Fig.A10 ), indicating that the area of wetland decreased in these regions and possibly resulted in a downward trend in water supply. Since the regions with a downward trend in water supply were involved in or neighbored Yangtze and Lancang River Source Areas, suitable policies should be put in place to protect wetlands and ensure a stable provision of water supply. For regulating services, carbon sink remained no obvious change in most areas of Qinghai Province, which may be related to the similar growth rates of the RECO and GPP (Yu et al., 2022b ), thus keeping the amount of carbon sink stable. Soil retention service remained no obvious change in most areas of Qinghai Province during 2000–2018, probably due to the fact that rainfall did not reach the intensity at which large-scale erosion occurred so that soil conservation service remained at a stable level. Wind speed was the environmental factor that had the most influence on sand fixation (Li et al., 2022 ), so the downward trend in sand fixation service in the western part of Qinghai Province may be due to the significant downward in wind speed in this region (Fig.A11 ). Since the Yangtze River Source Area is located in the downward trend area in sand fixation service, more many efforts to prevent wind and sand erosions in this region are needed. Hydrological regulation service increased in the northern and southeastern parts and decreased in the central and southern parts of Qinghai Province during 2000–2018. This distribution pattern was mainly determined by the elements that make up the hydrological regulation service. As shown in previous study (Yu et al., 2022a ), the changing trends in soil water and evapotranspiration were upward in the northern part and downward in the southwestern part. Flood mitigation service remained no obvious change in most areas of Qinghai Province from 2000 to 2018, and previous study indicated that there was a constraining effect of NPP on subsurface runoff, and an increase in NPP led to a decrease in subsurface runoff (Hao et al., 2022 ). Although vegetation cover increased in most areas of Qinghai Province from 2000 to 2018 (Fig.A12 ), the increase in vegetation cover may not exceed the threshold that can significantly affect subsurface runoff, and thus subsurface runoff remained at a steady level. We used questionnaires and environmental data as the inputs of the SolVES model to calculate cultural service value in 2018. We then used the value in 2018 to calculate cultural service values during 2000–2017 through constructing a conversion index that included the inflation rate and tourist growth rate. The upward trends of inflation rate and tourist growth rate contributed to the increase an in culture services in most regions. Additionally, the improvement in the infrastructures such as transportations, restaurants and hotels also facilitated the travelers to visit and thus promoted the increase in cultural services in Qinghai Province. For supporting services, NPP showed an upward trend in most areas of Qinghai Province during 2000–2018, and previous study indicated that NDVI had the greatest effect on this service (Li et al., 2022 ), so the upward trend may be due to the increase of vegetation cover in this region (Fig.A12 ). The main reason for the downward in habitat quality in the eastern part of Qinghai Province was that the cities were mainly distributed here, and frequent human activities associated with urbanization have put great pressure on the nearby habitat. The areas with no obvious change in habitat quality were far away from the threats sources such as roads, farmlands, and urbanized areas.  5.2 Impact mechanisms of the ESs on the human well-being The importance of ESs is reflected in maintaining a good quality of life for people (Breslow et al., 2016 ). Therefore, clarifying the impact paths of the ESs on human well-being can help meet the actual needs of people at different development stages. The improvement in human well-being and maintenance in ecological sustainability are the ultimate goals of ecosystem management. This study evaluated the impact paths of the type, amounts, interactions and changes of ten ESs on the six criterion layers of actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. The results showed that actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were affected by different ESs with different degrees. The direct impacts of the ESs on the human well-being can be explained through the correlation relationship between the observed variables (Table A8 ). Cultural service supply had significant negative direct impact on actual human well-being mainly due to the fact that the negative correlations between cultural service value and the indicators of actual human well-being (i.e., between cultural service value and income, material, and education) were stronger than positive correlations between them (i.e., between cultural service and heath, safety, and relationship). The positive correlations between cultural service and heath, safety, and relationship may be due to high cultural service value can improve fiscal revenue, which could be used to promote public services. While the negative correlations between cultural service and income, material, and education may be the reason that an increase in cultural service value meant that some people moved from primary and secondary industries to tertiary industries, which may reduce their household income due to a reduction in agricultural and animal husbandry production in a short period. Supporting service supply, regulating service supply, changes in provisioning services, and changes in cultural service had significant negative direct impacts on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. The negative direct impacts meant that the higher these ecosystem service supply and the slopes of changes in ecosystem services, the lower the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. The reason may be that the correlations between ecosystem service supply, changes in ecosystem services and the indicators of the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were all negative. Cultural service supply and changes in supporting services showed significant positive direct impacts on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were mainly due to the positive correlations between the observed variables of cultural service supply and changes in supporting services with the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being. The indirect impact coefficient for each type of the ESs was the sum of the specific indirect impact path coefficients under its corresponding hypothesis. Therefore, indirect impacts of the ESs on human well-being were mainly determined by the numerical magnitude of the specific indirect impact path coefficients, which was in relation to the interactions or changes of the ESs. Supporting service supply and provisioning service supply had significant negative indirect impacts on actual human well-being (Table 3 ). For supporting service supply, the positive interaction between supporting service supply and cultural service supply magnified the negative direct impact of cultural service supply on actual human well-being, so that the negative indirect impacts of supporting service supply on actual human well-being through cultural service supply (H5a, indirect impact path (3) and (6)) were larger than the other indirect impact paths. Therefore, the sum of indirect impact of supporting service supply on actual human well-being was negative. As same as the supporting service supply, the indirect impacts of provisioning service supply on actual human well-being through cultural service supply (H5b, indirect impact path (3) and (6)) were negative and larger than the other indirect impact paths, resulting in the sum of indirect impact of provisioning service supply on actual human well-being was negative. Cultural service supply had a significant positive indirect impact on actual human well-being (Table 3 ), mainly due to that the positive indirect impact of cultural service supply on actual human well-being through changes in cultural service (H5d, indirect impact path (10)) was larger than the other indirect impact paths. Supporting service supply, regulating service supply and cultural service supply had significant indirect impacts on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being (Table 3 ). For supporting service supply, the indirect impacts of supporting service supply on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being through regulating service supply (H6a, indirect impact path (2) and (5)) were positive and larger than the other indirect impact paths. Therefore, the sum of indirect impact of supporting service supply on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being was positive. For regulating service supply, the positive indirect impact was related to the negative interaction between regulating service supply and supporting service supply (H6c, indirect impact path (1) and (4)) and positive interaction between regulating service supply and cultural service supply (H6c, indirect impact path (3) and (6)). For cultural service supply, four indirect impact paths were notable: significant positive interactions between cultural service supply and other three ecosystem service supply (H6d, indirect impact path (1)–(6)), and significant positive direct impact of cultural service supply on the changes in cultural services (H6d, indirect impact path (10)). As the result showed in Table 3 , the direct and indirect impacts of cultural service supply on actual human well-being were inverse. Direct and indirect impacts of supporting service supply, regulating service supply and cultural service supply on the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were also inverse. These results indicated that the interactions or changes of ESs could reverse the direct and indirect impacts of the ESs on the human well-being.  5.3 Implications for promoting regional sustainable development Assessment on the relationship between ESs and human well-being is indispensable to evaluate whether the regional development routes are reasonable, and whether they can meet the criteria of sustainable development, which is helpful for the government to adjust the future development policies. The result showed that the status of actual human well-being in Qinghai Province was at a low level, and many indicators were much lower than the SDG criteria. Therefore, the following suggestions are put forth for the future development planning for Qinghai Province. First of all, it is feasible to make full use of beautiful natural landscape of Qinghai Province to develop tourism. Developing tourism within the scope of natural carrying capacity can greatly increase the income of local residents and improve the level of human well-being, and meanwhile has less negative environmental impact. Due to the vulnerability of the ecosystem in Qinghai Province and its importance to the downstream regions and counties, it is crucial to raise public awareness of the value of preserving Sanjiangyuan National Park and other ecologically protected areas. Landscape protection should be given full priority in policy-making. Secondly, Qinghai Province currently relies on the development of primary industry, while the structure of the primary industry should be further adjusted and optimized. Combined with the natural and cultural conditions of Qinghai province, agriculture should concentrate on producing the plateau-specific biological resources such as Chinese Tibetan medicine and specialty foods. As for the livestock industry, the yields of meat and milk in most counties exceeded the SDG criteria. Therefore, it should be noted that the scale of feeding and grazing intensity should not exceed the ecological carrying capacity. At the same time, livestock products should be further fine-processed to improve the accessory value of the products. Thirdly, more attention should be paid to public services. Improvements of the basic conditions of road infrastructure are needed to reduce traffic accidents. Measures for environmental conservation should be further adopted. The government should provide some beneficial services to local people, such as popularizing communication infrastructure. More extra efforts on ensuring and improving women's equal opportunities in public life are needed. Then, governmental financial investment towards improving human well-being should be allocated reasonably. Medical investment should be appropriately guaranteed to improve medical conditions and increase the number of health care institutions and health care beds. Social security investment should also be increased so that more people can enjoy the benefits of pension insurance and medical care insurance. Educational subsidies should be set up so that the students from the families with economic difficulties can go to school and enjoy good educations. Finally, it is possible to carry out employment training courses for the local residents, so that they have special skills to increase employment opportunities. It is also possible to exploit the advantages of regional characteristics to promote the development of related industries with ethnic characteristics such as Tibetan clothing and handicraft processing.  5.4 Limitations and prospects In this study, we used the SDG criteria to appraisal the level of actual human well-being in Qinghai Province and the gaps between them were also obtained. The direct and indirect impacts of the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on actual human well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being were then revealed. Although the findings of this research can help decision-makers develop effective strategies towards protecting ecosystems, improving human well-being, and substantiating the SDGs, there were still some limitations. Firstly, we constructed an indicator system of human well-being in Qinghai Province and linked it to the SDGs, however, only 8 of the 17 SDGs were involved due to data availability of human well-being, resulting in a more comprehensive assessment of the level of sustainable development in Qinghai Province being impossible. Secondly, the absence of human well-being data in some counties made it impossible to assess the whole impacts of ecosystem services on actual well-being and the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being in these counties, and thus special care should be given to these counties when making ecological, social and economic management countermeasures. Further research should be conducted in the following directions in the future. Firstly, further field measurements and surveys are needed to obtain more many items of subjective human well-being in the future work so as to fully reflect the panorama of the human well-being in the study area. Secondly, it's valuable to assess the overflow impacts of ecosystem services provided by Qinghai Province on the human well-being of other regions, which is helpful for the nation to make ecological compensation countermeasures towards balancing the benefits and losses among regions. Finally, since the scale between ecosystem service supplies and the requirements of meeting human well-being on them usually mismatch, the multi-scale research on the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being in Qinghai Province should be further conducted.   6 Conclusion In this study, we completed a comprehensive evaluation on the impacts of the types, amounts, interactions and changes of the ESs on human well-being in Qinghai Province under the framework of the SDGs. The results indicated: (1) spatial patterns and changing trends of ten ESs were heterogeneous during 2000–2018; (2) most indicators of the human well-being in Qinghai Province were at a relative low level and have not reached the SDG criteria in most time; (3) for actual human well-being, current cultural service supply had significant negative direct impacts, and supporting service supply and provisioning service supply had significant negative indirect impacts, while cultural service supply had significant positive indirect impacts; (4) for the gaps between actual and targeted human well-being, supporting service supply, regulating service supply, changes in provisioning services and changes in cultural service had significant negative direct impacts, cultural service supply and changes in supporting services had significant positive direct impacts, and supporting service supply and regulating service supply had significant positive indirect impacts, while cultural service supply had significant negative indirect impacts; (5) The direct and indirect impacts of the types of the ESs on human well-being can be reversed by the interactions or changes of the ESs. Given the level of actual human well-being, the impacts of the ten ESs on the local human well-being, natural conditions and cultural tradition in Qinghai Province, ecological and socioeconomic management solutions towards promoting ecological conservation and sustainable socioeconomic development were proposed. The findings of this study can provide a place-based and problem-based reference for other regions to balance the requirements between ecological preservation and improvement of human well-being towards regional sustainable development.
