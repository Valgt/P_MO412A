                  Over the last two decades, earthquakes across the world have taken hundreds of thousands of human lives and caused countless injuries. However, limited information is available on how these natural disasters, such as earthquakes, impact healthcare institutions and communities and how this is reflected in global health indicators. We aim to assess how earthquakes impact communities’ public health and healthcare service providers by using select global health indicators. We used retrospective cohort study design, and retrieved ten districts’ monthly data. We determine, uniquely, that the geographic area most affected by the earthquake in 2015 is the area with the highest tuberculosis prevalence rate. The study found that, in the area severely affected by the earthquake, the baseline number of women attending the antenatal clinics in January 2011 was 3,718, and, throughout that year to 2016, there is a slow, but steady, increase in the number of women visiting the antenatal clinics. The same month of earthquake, number of fully immunized children drops significantly, likely due to the interruption of regular health services provided in the aftermath of earthquake. This is the first comparisons of pre and post-earthquake health indicators of two region most and least affected by the earthquake. By analyzing selected health indicators before and after the earthquake, it is clear that earthquakes impact public health and cause various vulnerabilities.

Introduction  According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), the number of earthquakes  worldwide has increased roughly four-fold in the past twenty-five years while the number of individuals affected by  earthquakes has increased roughly three-fold over the same period [1]. Earthquakes incur widespread physical,  economic, and social costs as well as damage the environment [2]. As well, loss increases exponentially if earthquakes  are followed by secondary hazards [3]. For health and economic loss, earthquakes are a major issue of concern both  for developing and developed countries. The 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2015- 2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Sendai Framework) agenda both intend to reduce the number  of lives lost and minimize human suffering from natural disasters across the globe [4]. Nevertheless, without  specifically integrating global public health concerns and disaster risk reduction, there is a high probability that goals  conceived to reduce human loss and suffering cannot be achieved [5]. For effective disaster management on a global  scale, strategies are shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach [6] and this has proven to be quite successful so  far [7]. We propose that the same approach could be implemented for public health so as to focus on prevention rather  than cures and treatment when preparing for natural disasters.   A limited number of these studies, however, are undertaken with natural disasters in mind, and those  conducted in this way mainly focus on the psychological and mental health of individuals following a disaster [8].  Since the field of disaster management is an emerging field, few studies systematically analyze the impacts of  earthquakes on key health indicators [8]. Thus, there is a serious need to study the effects of disaster on health and  identify the most effective ways to prepare and respond to disasters so as to improve health indicators, which is a  process that will hopefully lead to saving more lives overall. Despite the lack of such studies, it is a well-established  fact that the impact of earthquakes increases exponentially if they are accompanied by an outbreak of disease [9].  Whenever an earthquake hits any part of the world, inhabitants of that area are affected regardless of sex, age,  economic standing, or social status [10]; nevertheless, very often, the highest mortality and morbidity rates belong to  some specific group of the population: the poor, women, children, elderly, disabled people, etc. [11]. Additionally,  the devastating impact of two earthquakes of the same magnitude and intensity are very different when they occur in  developing rather than developed countries [11].   It can be argued that this is the first study of its kind since the SDGs, which were created to be achieved  through 2030 and endorsed by 187 countries, and since the adoption of the Sendai Framework agenda. Further, this  study is unique because it will provide insight for all stakeholders so that they may take into account disastrous  events\when planning interventions and strategies to achieve and monitor SDGs. By undertaking and integrating  public health assessments within preparedness plans, both monetary and physical efforts will be spared when  responding to disasters. As well, this study emphasizes the need to study the impact of natural disasters on different  groups within the population in real time [12]. It is exceedingly difficult to study this phenomenon as it occurs since,  most often, disasters affect a large area and affect a large population all at once [13]. While numerous researchers in  different studies attempt to analyze the impact of these disasters, most of the studies simply estimate the damage  created by disasters, and only an exceedingly small number of studies attempt to consider the epidemiological impact;  therefore, there is a need to look into real cases and determine precise data to depict the situation accurately instead  of approximately.   2. Methodology   2.1. Objective  We aimed to use selected indicators from the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) global health indicators list  and those included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to assess how the Hindukush earthquake of 2015  impact the trends of prevailing health risks and vulnerabilities.   2.2 Study site  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) is a province containing twenty-six districts in the north-west part of Pakistan.  The 2015 earthquake was the second deadliest earthquake in the area since 2005, badly affecting five districts of the  3 Junaid Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed Ahmad, Nafees Ahmad / Procedia Engineering 00 (2017) 000â€“000  province. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) [15], this earthquake had the epicentre located  forty-five km southwest of Jarm and about sixty-seven km north-west of the Chitral district in Pakistan. The  earthquake was initially given a magnitude of 7.7, though it was later revised to 7.5 by the USGS [15]  Figure 1. Study area map and selected districts indicating active seismic fault line and epicentre of earthquakes,  2005 &amp; 2015     Source: Authorâ€™s own work using open-source Esri Delorme, USGS, NOAA  2.3 Study design, indicators and data source   This study employed a retrospective study design where we purposely select ten districts located in an area  highly vulnerable to earthquakes. These ten districts are then grouped into two categories, each containing five districts  (Figure 1). The District Health Information System (DHIS), managed by the provincial government, was used to  retrieve data about the selected health indicators at both pre- and post-earthquake intervals. Notably, information in  the database is entered by specially trained staff in the healthcare facility. The DHIS covers all twenty-six districts of  the province, and reporting compliance at the study site was noted at 100% [16]. The WHO uses one hundred  indicators to monitor health and wellbeing across the world [16]. We purposely select indicators in three major  domain, which are closely linked to the objectives of the study to consider i.e maternal health, child health and  communicable diseases. In our research, we use monthly prevalence and incidence trends reported from public health  facilities to avoid, or at least minimize, any bias within study. It is also worth mentioning that the data we utilize,  collected from the registry database of the earthquake-prone area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, is actual data.  3. Results  3.1 Maternal health and pregnant women visiting ANC facilities  According to Glynn et al. (2001) [17], while earthquakes possess a significant public health risk to pregnant  women, their effect is usually not realized due to humanitarian services that bring antenatal clinics closer to these  women, increasing the number of women likely to utilize ANC services. Categorically similar to the findings reported  by Glynn et al.

According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) [15], this earthquake had the epicentre located  forty-five km southwest of Jarm and about sixty-seven km north-west of the Chitral district in Pakistan. The  earthquake was initially given a magnitude of 7.7, though it was later revised to 7.5 by the USGS [15]  Figure 1. Study area map and selected districts indicating active seismic fault line and epicentre of earthquakes,  2005 &amp; 2015     Source: Authorâ€™s own work using open-source Esri Delorme, USGS, NOAA  2.3 Study design, indicators and data source   This study employed a retrospective study design where we purposely select ten districts located in an area  highly vulnerable to earthquakes. These ten districts are then grouped into two categories, each containing five districts  (Figure 1). The District Health Information System (DHIS), managed by the provincial government, was used to  retrieve data about the selected health indicators at both pre- and post-earthquake intervals. Notably, information in  the database is entered by specially trained staff in the healthcare facility. The DHIS covers all twenty-six districts of  the province, and reporting compliance at the study site was noted at 100% [16]. The WHO uses one hundred  indicators to monitor health and wellbeing across the world [16]. We purposely select indicators in three major  domain, which are closely linked to the objectives of the study to consider i.e maternal health, child health and  communicable diseases. In our research, we use monthly prevalence and incidence trends reported from public health  facilities to avoid, or at least minimize, any bias within study. It is also worth mentioning that the data we utilize,  collected from the registry database of the earthquake-prone area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, is actual data.  3. Results  3.1 Maternal health and pregnant women visiting ANC facilities  According to Glynn et al. (2001) [17], while earthquakes possess a significant public health risk to pregnant  women, their effect is usually not realized due to humanitarian services that bring antenatal clinics closer to these  women, increasing the number of women likely to utilize ANC services. Categorically similar to the findings reported  by Glynn et al. (2001) [17], we found that, in the area severely affected by the earthquake, the baseline number of  858 Junaid Ahmad  et al. / Procedia Engineering 212 (2018) 855â€“8624 Junaid Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed Ahmad, Nafees Ahmad / Procedia Engineering 00 (2017) 000â€“000  women attending the antenatal clinic in January 2011 was 3,718, and, throughout that year to 2016, there is a slow,  but steady, increase in the number of women visiting the antenatal clinics. Figure 2 shows monthly trends related to  antenatal care. In October 2015, when the earthquake occurred, 5,098 women visited ANC. This number, however,  cannot be definitively attributed to the earthquake as it continues on in a slow rise and, even after the earthquake, the  rising trend is still discernable in 2016. Hence, the earthquake did not significantly affect the visits paid to ANC in  this group. Among the second group of ANC visits in areas least affected by the earthquake, the trend is similar to the  first group; these incidences increase steadily from the year 2011 to 2016, uninterrupted in any way by the disaster. A  similar trend is also seen in women attending ANC for the first time in both regions of the study. It is, therefore,  apparent that the earthquake did not create any real form of interruption to this critical public health service.    Figure 2. Monthly trend in antenatal care visits and revisits by the pregnant women who received TT-2 vaccination.  Source: Authors own calculation using the data sets retrieved from provincial government DHIS      3.2 Child health and immunization  Figure 3 shows monthly trends related to childrenâ€™s immunization statuses. During the baseline year 2011,  among the people residing in the area least affected by the earthquake, the number of children fully immunized at  twelve months is relatively low at 3,000 children. There is a slight fluctuation toward 2016, but the overall trajectory  rises steadily; however, in August 2012, there is a great decline in the number of children fully immunized, though  the number starts picking up again and is restored within a month. The same month of earthquake, fully immunized  children drops significantly October 2015, likely due to the interruption of regular health services provided in the  aftermath of earthquake. After the low prevalence of full immunization during that October, though, the trend picks  up again, but at a very slow pace, and then plateaus from November 2015 to 2016, in the same month. Grais et al.  (2011) [18] explains that, on the one hand, humanitarian services in earthquake-stricken areas do usually shield the  victims from experiencing the full effect of the disaster as these services provide necessary undertakings, such as  offering immunizations to children. On the other hand, in 2011 when the research started, the baseline in the area hit  severely by the earthquake has relatively high numbers as more than ten thousand children received full immunization.  -3000 2000 7000 12000 17000 22000 Ja n- 11 A pr -1 1 Ju l-1 1 O ct -1 1 Ja n- 12 A pr -1 2 Ju l-1 2 O ct -1 2 Ja n- 13 A pr -1 3 Ju l-1 3 O ct -1 3 Ja n- 14 A pr -1 4 Ju l-1 4 O ct -1 4 Ja n- 15 A pr -1 5 Ju l-1 5 O ct -1 5 Ja n- 16 A pr -1 6 Ju l-1 6 O ct -1 6 Group-I-Antenatal Care revisit in the facility - Group-I-First Antenatal care visits (ANC-1) in the facility - Group-II-Antenatal Care revisit in the facility - Group-II-First Antenatal care visits (ANC-1) in the facility - Group-II-Pregnant women received TT-2 vaccine - Group-I-Pregnant women received TT-2 vaccine - N um be r o f p at ie nt s r ep or te d  5 Junaid Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed Ahmad, Nafees Ahmad / Procedia Engineering 00 (2017) 000â€“000  The prevalence of immunization then increases drastically in the following months to about twenty thousand children.  Starting from January 2013, though, the rate drops to almost the same number attained during the baseline year,  marked with occasional rises and falls before stagnating until November 2016 when it drops to its lowest ever in the  region. It does, in more recent years, rise again. In this case, the earthquake cannot be associated with the constant  fluctuations in the prevalence of immunization.      Figure 3.

In the same group, even though drug adherence was high, there were still a  few cases between 2011 and 2014, where patients missed their medication, a situation that resulted in an increased  number of new infections. From 2014 on, however, the drug-adherence rate is exceedingly high, and, even during  the period of the earthquake and after, the drug adherence does not substantially alter.   -3000 2000 7000 12000 17000 22000 27000 32000 Ja n- 11 A pr -1 1 Ju l-1 1 O ct -1 1 Ja n- 12 A pr -1 2 Ju l-1 2 O ct -1 2 Ja n- 13 A pr -1 3 Ju l-1 3 O ct -1 3 Ja n- 14 A pr -1 4 Ju l-1 4 O ct -1 4 Ja n- 15 A pr -1 5 Ju l-1 5 O ct -1 5 Ja n- 16 A pr -1 6 Ju l-1 6 O ct -1 6 Group-I-Children under 12 m fully immunized - Group-I-Children under 12 m received 1st Measles vaccine - Group-I-Children under 12 m received 3rd Pentavalent vaccine - Group-II-Children under 12 m fully immunized - Group-II-Children under 12 m received 1st Measles vaccine - Group-II-Children under 12 m received 3rd Pentavalent vaccine - N um be r o f P at ie nt s r ep or te d   Junaid Ahmad  et al. / Procedia Engineering 212 (2018) 855â€“862 8594 Junaid Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed Ahmad, Nafees Ahmad / Procedia Engineering 00 (2017) 000â€“000  women attending the antenatal clinic in January 2011 was 3,718, and, throughout that year to 2016, there is a slow,  but steady, increase in the number of women visiting the antenatal clinics. Figure 2 shows monthly trends related to  antenatal care. In October 2015, when the earthquake occurred, 5,098 women visited ANC. This number, however,  cannot be definitively attributed to the earthquake as it continues on in a slow rise and, even after the earthquake, the  rising trend is still discernable in 2016. Hence, the earthquake did not significantly affect the visits paid to ANC in  this group. Among the second group of ANC visits in areas least affected by the earthquake, the trend is similar to the  first group; these incidences increase steadily from the year 2011 to 2016, uninterrupted in any way by the disaster. A  similar trend is also seen in women attending ANC for the first time in both regions of the study. It is, therefore,  apparent that the earthquake did not create any real form of interruption to this critical public health service.    Figure 2.

Source: Authors own calculation using the data sets retrieved from provincial government DHIS      3.2 Child health and immunization  Figure 3 shows monthly trends related to childrenâ€™s immunization statuses. During the baseline year 2011,  among the people residing in the area least affected by the earthquake, the number of children fully immunized at  twelve months is relatively low at 3,000 children. There is a slight fluctuation toward 2016, but the overall trajectory  rises steadily; however, in August 2012, there is a great decline in the number of children fully immunized, though  the number starts picking up again and is restored within a month. The same month of earthquake, fully immunized  children drops significantly October 2015, likely due to the interruption of regular health services provided in the  aftermath of earthquake. After the low prevalence of full immunization during that October, though, the trend picks  up again, but at a very slow pace, and then plateaus from November 2015 to 2016, in the same month. Grais et al.  (2011) [18] explains that, on the one hand, humanitarian services in earthquake-stricken areas do usually shield the  victims from experiencing the full effect of the disaster as these services provide necessary undertakings, such as  offering immunizations to children. On the other hand, in 2011 when the research started, the baseline in the area hit  severely by the earthquake has relatively high numbers as more than ten thousand children received full immunization.  -3000 2000 7000 12000 17000 22000 Ja n- 11 A pr -1 1 Ju l-1 1 O ct -1 1 Ja n- 12 A pr -1 2 Ju l-1 2 O ct -1 2 Ja n- 13 A pr -1 3 Ju l-1 3 O ct -1 3 Ja n- 14 A pr -1 4 Ju l-1 4 O ct -1 4 Ja n- 15 A pr -1 5 Ju l-1 5 O ct -1 5 Ja n- 16 A pr -1 6 Ju l-1 6 O ct -1 6 Group-I-Antenatal Care revisit in the facility - Group-I-First Antenatal care visits (ANC-1) in the facility - Group-II-Antenatal Care revisit in the facility - Group-II-First Antenatal care visits (ANC-1) in the facility - Group-II-Pregnant women received TT-2 vaccine - Group-I-Pregnant women received TT-2 vaccine - N um be r o f p at ie nt s r ep or te d  5 Junaid Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed Ahmad, Nafees Ahmad / Procedia Engineering 00 (2017) 000â€“000  The prevalence of immunization then increases drastically in the following months to about twenty thousand children.  Starting from January 2013, though, the rate drops to almost the same number attained during the baseline year,  marked with occasional rises and falls before stagnating until November 2016 when it drops to its lowest ever in the  region. It does, in more recent years, rise again. In this case, the earthquake cannot be associated with the constant  fluctuations in the prevalence of immunization.      Figure 3.

According to Tang et al. (2015) [19], during an  earthquake the internal and external migration is likely to interfere with anti-tuberculosis adherence and diminishes  follow-up effectiveness. Similarly, the second region in the study, which was less affected by the earthquake, shows  relatively low prevalence of TB throughout the period of study as compared to the areas largely affected by the  earthquake. Firstly, this region had a good drug adherence policy throughout the intensive face, which contributes  significantly to its low incidence rate. Secondly, the stability of the trend is not interrupted by the earthquakeâ€™s  impact in both the regions, therefore demystifying the notion that the earthquake had any effect on public health  agenda in this sector.

Discussion  Of the 1.35 million people killed by natural disasters over the past twenty years, more than half of this number  died in earthquakes with the remainder having succumbed to weather- and climate-related hazards, though more  thorough data is needed on overall disaster mortality [20]. The number of empirical studies that have validated how  much and why certain groups of people are more vulnerable than others during disasters is exceedingly limited,  especially those studies regarding public health [8]. In the early 1970s a series of well-publicized disasters triggered  the scientific interest of the international public health community. These studies emphasize elderly people, pregnant  women, children under the age of five years, and disabled people as they are the most vulnerable population, but until  recently, no concrete evidence has been presented to validate such data [21].  None of the databases that look into these disasters fulfil the demands of the healthcare system so that health  professionals can have the answers to how healthcare institutions and the people they serve are affected by earthquakes  0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Ja n- 11   A pr -1 1  Ju l- 11   O ct -1 1  Ja n- 12   A pr -1 2  Ju l- 12   O ct -1 2  Ja n- 13   A pr -1 3  Ju l- 13   O ct -1 3  Ja n- 14   A pr -1 4  Ju l- 14   O ct -1 4  Ja n- 15   A pr -1 5  Ju l- 15   O ct -1 5  Ja n- 16   A pr -1 6  Ju l- 16   O ct -1 6  Group-II-Intensive phase TB-DOTS patients missing treatment &gt;1 week - Group-II-Intensive-phase TB-DOTS patients - Group-I-Intensive phase TB-DOTS patients missing treatment &gt;1 week - Group-I-Intensive-phase TB-DOTS patients - N um be r o f P at ie nt s r ep or te d  N um be r o f P at ie nt s r ep or te d  7 Junaid Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed Ahmad, Nafees Ahmad / Procedia Engineering 00 (2017) 000â€“000  [22]. It is worth mentioning that no database to date contains health-related objectives for natural disasters, which  includes but is not limited to the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), the United Nations International Strategy  for Disaster Reductionâ€™s (UNISDR) Disaster Statistics, DesInverter, and the Index for Risk Management (INFORM)  [22]. The lack of healthcare-related data when it comes to earthquakes and other natural disasters certainly is a major  gap in disaster risk management [24]. This is true within the context of our study, as well. We retrieved data from  DHIS, but no single data set maintained by this database specifically links relevant information to earthquake events.  One of the ignored areas in the response-and-recovery phase of disaster management in Pakistan is disease  surveillance. Disease surveillance in the area affected by disasters is very important in order to comprehend the impact  of disasters on illness and deaths by communicable diseases. Obtaining significant surveillance information in these  situations, however, is often challenging. The destruction of the established public health infrastructure can exaggerate  or eliminate what may have already been weak pre-disaster systems of surveillance and response. Surveillance  personnel and other public health workers may be killed or missing, as in the earthquake of 2015. Also, population  displacement can misrepresent census information, which makes the verification of rates for comparison more  difficult.   From past events in Pakistan, like the earthquake of 2005 and floods of 2010, it is apparent that health services  were severely disrupted during such disasters, especially the 2005 earthquake. During these tragic events, health  facilities are often damaged directly or they remain inaccessible because of road blockages and damage; lack of a  clean water supply and power failure also make health facilities inaccessible  or non-functional [23]. It is evident from  our findings that, at the present time, the gaps in the healthcare system need to be studied seriously through a disaster  management perspective.  5. Conclusions  This study used the earthquake of 2015 in Pakistan, to provide a baseline for future research regarding how  and what aspect of public health can be affected by natural disasters. Our findings are notable in that we propose  earthquakes do impact the health status of communities and the utilization of such services as well as their access to  healthcare institutions in many areas. It is possible to build or enhance community health resilience fortifying against  these disasters, but knowing the risks and vulnerabilities in that specific area is the key. Applying existing knowledge  and data-based decision making is especially challenging in disaster situations because of the nature of the risks and,  subsequently, the lack of relevant, reliable data. A critical factor that further compounds this challenge is the limited  development of, or partial (or total) collapse of, systems for routine information collection and analysis as a result of  a disaster. Therefore, it is a pressing need to enhance the compromised information systems that often suppress the  process of prioritizing the response and preparedness interventions at all levels and to limit the capacity to detect,  analyze, and monitor the trends regarding earthquake impact.

                  <ce:simple-para id="spara0173" view="all">Over the last two decades, earthquakes across the world have taken hundreds of thousands of human lives and caused countless injuries. However, limited information is available on how these natural disasters, such as earthquakes, impact healthcare institutions and communities and how this is reflected in global health indicators. We aim to assess how earthquakes impact communities’ public health and healthcare service providers by using select global health indicators. We used retrospective cohort study design, and retrieved ten districts’ monthly data. We determine, uniquely, that the geographic area most affected by the earthquake in 2015 is the area with the highest tuberculosis prevalence rate. The study found that, in the area severely affected by the earthquake, the baseline number of women attending the antenatal clinics in January 2011 was 3,718, and, throughout that year to 2016, there is a slow, but steady, increase in the number of women visiting the antenatal clinics. The same month of earthquake, number of fully immunized children drops significantly, likely due to the interruption of regular health services provided in the aftermath of earthquake. This is the first comparisons of pre and post-earthquake health indicators of two region most and least affected by the earthquake. By analyzing selected health indicators before and after the earthquake, it is clear that earthquakes impact public health and cause various vulnerabilities.</ce:simple-para>
