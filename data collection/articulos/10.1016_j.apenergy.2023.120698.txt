                  The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7, Affordable and Clean Energy) is the key to achieving climate goals and constructing effective policies have an immense role to foster the actions. The three major components of SDG 7 include energy accessibility, renewable penetration and energy intensity. Energy consumption characteristics in a country can predominantly influence all three components of SDG 7. Further, energy consumption is intrinsically linked to several energy policies. Understanding the nexuses will be conducive to the policymakers and energy community. This study aims at providing deeper perspectives on the influence of energy consumption by analyzing the changes incurred in renewable penetration, energy installed capacity, production and consumption-based emission, and emission intensity. The analysis is extended to four major energy consuming sectors (including industrial, transportation, residential and commercial sectors) in 40 countries. A thorough investigation is performed based on a clustering approach to identify the pattern among the energy consumption. This yielded three scenarios where countries have the highest energy consumption in the industrial (Scenario 1), transportation (Scenario 2), and residential sector (Scenario 3), respectively. Scenario 1 has higher energy consumption growth and renewable penetration can be achieved with a proper policy framework. Scenario 2 is observed to have stagnant energy consumption and promoting renewables needs additional efforts to decouple fossil fuel usage. Scenario 3 has moderate energy consumption growth and the renewable penetration is the highest. The residential sector is observed to possess the highest renewable energy consumption among the four energy-consuming sectors in all the scenarios. For the identified energy consumption patterns, a policy framework is proposed to substantiate energy sustainability in which policies are constructed in two stages, i.e., one to form the core policy and the other to sustain the core policy. The contributions of the study is further extended to delineate the relation between energy consumption and the three elements of SDG 7 (energy accessibility, renewable penetration, and energy intensity). Understanding the influence exerted by energy consumption patterns will be highly supportive in directing energy policies and the existing policies can be optimized with the findings of this study.

Graphical abstract       The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7, Affordable and Clean Energy) is the key to achieving climate goals and constructing effective policies have an immense role to foster the actions. The three major components of SDG 7 include energy accessibility, renewable penetration and energy intensity. Energy consumption characteristics in a country can predominantly influence all three components of SDG 7. Further, energy consumption is intrinsically linked to several energy policies. Understanding the nexuses will be conducive to the policymakers and energy community. This study aims at providing deeper perspectives on the influence of energy consumption by analyzing the changes incurred in renewable penetration, energy installed capacity, production and consumption-based emission, and emission intensity. The analysis is extended to four major energy consuming sectors (including industrial, transportation, residential and commercial sectors) in 40 countries. A thorough investigation is performed based on a clustering approach to identify the pattern among the energy consumption. This yielded three scenarios where countries have the highest energy consumption in the industrial (Scenario 1), transportation (Scenario 2), and residential sector (Scenario 3), respectively. Scenario 1 has higher energy consumption growth and renewable penetration can be achieved with a proper policy framework. Scenario 2 is observed to have stagnant energy consumption and promoting renewables needs additional efforts to decouple fossil fuel usage. Scenario 3 has moderate energy consumption growth and the renewable penetration is the highest. The residential sector is observed to possess the highest renewable energy consumption among the four energy-consuming sectors in all the scenarios. For the identified energy consumption patterns, a policy framework is proposed to substantiate energy sustainability in which policies are constructed in two stages, i.e., one to form the core policy and the other to sustain the core policy. The contributions of the study is further extended to delineate the relation between energy consumption and the three elements of SDG 7 (energy accessibility, renewable penetration, and energy intensity). Understanding the influence exerted by energy consumption patterns will be highly supportive in directing energy policies and the existing policies can be optimized with the findings of this study.   Keywords Energy consumption  Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7)  Energy sustainability  Energy policy  Renewable energy penetration  Energy efficiency    1 Introduction The pernicious effect of climate change is inevitable if actions to address the root causes of climate change are given less priority and not urgently implemented. To substantiate a coherent action against climate change and shift to sustainable development, the United Nations General Assembly framed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1] . Cumulatively, SDGs emphasize energy-efficient economies, environmental sustainability, innovation, and sustainable development for all [2] . The current climate crisis is highly powered by the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels and increased energy consumption. SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (Climate action) are solely dedicated to tackling climate change [3,4] . However, researchers suggest that SDG 7 is the action-based goal while SDG 13 is the consequence-based goal [5] . Therefore, SDG 7 is crucial in decoupling future energy development without harming the environment. In addition, SDG 7 can foster progress in other SDGs through SDGs interaction as well [5,6] . The prime aspects of the SDG 7 revolve around energy accessibility, renewable penetration, and energy intensity [7] . The efforts towards these three milestones of SDG 7 have an influence on energy consumption and thus, a specific focus on energy consumption will bolster the understanding between energy consumption and various entities related to energy sustainability. Energy consumption directly influences the response to climate change. The higher the energy consumption in a country, the harder it becomes for the strategies and policies to witness a rapid positive change in a country. Besides, energy consumption depends on several factors such as population growth, lifestyle, energy efficiency, development scenario of the country, banking sector performance and many other factors [8–12] . Research studies suggest that increasing energy efficiency is pivotal for reducing energy consumption and its associated emissions [13,14] . However, energy efficiency improvement can also lead to the rebound effect and Jevons paradox [15–18] . Such rebound effects are promising when savings in energy consumption is conducive to expanding the production and growth which augments the overall demand [19–24] . Satisfying the growing energy demand with renewable energy projects while promoting socio-economic sustainable development links the energy consumption with environmental sustainability which also forms an integral part of SDG 7. Therefore, renewable penetration is crucial to decouple the influence of energy consumption on climate change. The renewable energy policies are robust when they are inclusive of the causality between energy consumption, emission and economic development [25] . Further, evaluating the drivers and barriers to renewable energy deployment can yield prospective outcomes in constructing the energy policies [26–30] . When these two aspects, i.e., energy efficiency and renewable penetration are entrenched, the foundation for energy sustainability in harmony with environmental sustainability can be underpinned. This can be accomplished by enacting appropriate policies, and programs by federal and state entities. The framework of policies can be based on many different approaches, but most commonly they work on establishing restriction limits, enacting a supportive approach by means of incentives and financial aid, and adopting a taxation approach. Other approaches of policies involve refined concepts such as energy sovereignty for making a coherent and consensus decision to accelerate the policy effectiveness [31] . Policy sequencing is another policy framework where different policies are implemented sequentially to overcome the economic, environmental, political and societal challenges that emerge with the implementation of one policy in order to improve its effectiveness, and such an approach is accomplished for EU climate and emission policies [32] . With the increase in energy models, policies are influenced by the results and simulations based on various and not always transparent policy assumptions. It can also be seen that both policy makers and energy modelling influence each other [33] . Therefore, both policy-based modelling and modelling-based policy making exist. Concerning climate goals, renewable energy policies emerge to be effective, especially at the local scale. On the other hand, energy efficiency policies are ineffective when are implemented without taking measures to control the rebound effects or coupling with renewable energy policies [34] . Policies favoring the deployment of renewable energy (RE) projects include feed-in-tariffs, net-metering and billing programs, investment incentives, tax incentives and relaxation in market entry for energy producers. Studies also suggest that net metering programs and feed-in-tariff have a strong correlation with RE penetration [35] . Public opinion often has less congruence with the energy and climate policy decisions made by politicians. This might be attributed to the conflicting views between the advisory policy panels and the people towards the solution, meaning that there is a lack of transparency or awareness among the people in perceiving the vision targeted by the energy policy [36] . On the other hand, studies and evidence suggest that people are willing to engage in the decision-making process [37] . In such a case, revamped public engagement through awareness campaigns, as well as understanding the behavioral drivers, are crucial for generating consensus, necessary for effective policy implementation. Meta-analysis of policies is of utmost since it can force out the interference and lack of coherence between various policies and the objective that the country desires [38] . One such example can be found in Estonia, Finland and Scotland where the lack of coherence is highlighted between low-carbon energy transition and national security policy which prioritizes hydrocarbons in policy documents [39] . The analysis of Emission Trading System in Hubei demonstrated that energy transition is promoted by reducing energy consumption as well as altering the energy mix [40] . At times, the intended objective of framing a policy, after implementation, might not serve the actual progress and becomes ineffective. This is mainly due to the misconstrued variables in the existing scenario which makes the policy framework ineffective [41] . Moreover, the choice of policy for a particular objective is less significant than its structured framework and robustness that clings to its objective [42] . On the other hand, policies should be built on a coordinated approach among the different hierarchical levels of governance in a country. This is of utmost importance for pursuing the energy transition without which the local economies and communities tied up to the fossil-fuel-based business would face immediate and acute uncertainties [43] . All of the discussions indicate the nuance of the policy framework, but the optimization of the policy approach can be accomplished only with the aid of a comprehensive analysis of the issue. In this context, the proposed work analyzes the changes that occurred in energy consumption, renewable penetration and emission intensity in 40 countries that have been selected based on the availability of data obtained from the International Energy Agency. The energy consumption pattern in each country is interpreted by using the sectoral-wise energy consumption variations. This is accomplished by assessing the variations in renewable energy intake, energy consumption growth, emission aspects and many others in four energy-consuming sectors. A proper interpretation is made to identify the influence of energy consumption patterns on renewable penetration and emission intensity to propose a modified policy framework. In addition, the linkages between the energy consumption and three milestones of SDG 7, (i.e., increasing energy accessibility, increasing total final renewable energy consumption and decreasing energy intensity) are entrenched. Altogether, a deeper understanding of energy consumption is presented and is not yet accomplished in the literature available in this area. The core contributions of this study are presented below:• Deeper perspectives on sectoral wise energy consumption’s influence on renewable energy penetration, increase in renewable penetration and energy consumption, installed capacity, energy preference, production and consumption-based CO2  emissions and emission intensity.  • Drawing out the energy consumption characteristic influence in identifying the suitable approach to achieve SDG 7 and climate action attributes.  • Presenting an optimized policy framework with core and tangential elements in the context with the identified energy consumption pattern.  • Associating the role of energy consumption on SDG 7 components including energy access, renewable energy penetration and energy intensity.    The structure of the study is organized as follows: Section 2  elucidates the methodology of this study. Section 3  briefs the energy consumption characteristics where three scenarios are framed. Section 4  presents an optimized policy framework essential to drive energy sustainability. Section 5  elaborates on the role of the energy consumption pattern on SDG 7. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6 .  2 Methodology A brief of the methodology utilized in this study is illustrated in Fig. 1  . In short, energy consumption in a country can be mapped to the prominent energy-consuming sectors such as industrial, transportation, residential, and commercial and public services. The energy consumption in the industrial sector includes the energy consumed by all types of industrial activities with the exception of the energy used for transportation (logistics) outside the industry. Energy consumption in the transportation sector covers all transportation modes regardless of the economic sector which is served. Residential energy consumption includes the energy utilized by the households, excluding the fuels that are used for private transport. Commercial sector energy consumption includes the energy used by the activities defined under the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) and public services. In this study, the analysis focused on establishing the influence of sector-wise energy consumption on renewable penetration, energy preference, changes in installed capacity, production and consumption emission on a global scale. The parameters considered for the assessment include total energy consumption, renewable penetration, increase in renewable penetration for each of four sectors, the year-on-year installed capacity of various energy resources, annual production and consumption-based CO2  emission, and emission intensity. The performed analysis can be categorized into four parts: energy consumption, renewable penetration, energy installed capacity and emission characteristics as highlighted in the top left corner of Fig. 1 . The data and calculations involved in each of the parts are as follows: Part 1: Energy consumption  The sectoral wise energy consumption data is directly obtained from the IEA database for 40 countries from the year 2009 to 2018 [44] . Part 2: Renewable penetration  The renewable energy consumption data is also obtained from IEA [44] . The renewable penetration percentage can be obtained by using Eq. (1) .(1) Renewable  p e n e t r a t i o n ( R P )  = Renewable  c o n s u m p t i o n  Total  e n e r g y  c o n s u m p t i o n   × 100      The above equation is used to calculate the renewable penetration for each of the four sectors considered and for 10 years of data. The difference in the renewable energy penetration over two consecutive years is evaluated for 10 years from 2009 to 2018 and is averaged to obtain average renewable penetration increase. This is mathematically expressed as given in Eq. (2) .(2) Average  r e n e w a b l e  p e n e t r a t i o n  i n c r e a s e = ∑ i = 2009  2018  [ ( R P )  i + 1   - R P   i  ]   9      where i corresponds to the year that the data belongs. RE penetration average is another parameter that is directly obtained by taking the average value of RP for 10 years. Part 2: Energy installed capacity  The energy installed capacity data is obtained from the IRENA dataset [45]  which includes year-on-year energy installed data for the considered country for the various energy resources that the country depends on. In this case, the energy installed capacity data is converted and represented in the form of the annual installed capacity of various energy resource data. This is calculated by obtaining the fraction of installed capacity data of a particular energy resource to the total installed capacity for the same year under consideration as shown in Eq. (3) .(3) Annual  e n e r g y  m i x  b a s e d  i n s t a l l a t i o n  c a p a c i t y  o f  x  r e s o u r c e = ( R e s o u r c e  i n s t a l l a t i o n  c a p a c i t y )  x  ∑ i = 1  n  ( R e s o u r c e  i n s t a l l a t i o n  c a p a c i t y )  i        where x represents the energy resource under consideration for a country for a given year, and n indicates the total number of energy resources installed in the given year for the considered country. The set of data resulting from Eq. (3)  is then processed through Eq. (2)  to assess the increase in installed capacity for each year. This yields the average energy installed capacity increase for each energy resource. Also, the average installed capacity for 10 years is calculated from the raw data obtained from the IRENA dataset. Part 3: Emission characteristics  The emission data in terms of annual production and consumption CO2  emissions are obtained from the Our World in Data platform [46] . Production-based CO2  emissions include the CO2  emissions emitted within the country's borders that are emissions produced by burning fossil fuels, cement production and many other emission sources, within the country. Consumption-based CO2  emissions consider the emissions traded with goods in addition to production-based emissions. The year-on-year increase or decrease in emissions for each country is calculated by using Eq. (4) .(4) Average  e m i s s i o n  i n c r e a s e = ∑ i = 2009  2018  ( ( E m i s s i o n )  i + 1   - ( E m i s s i o n )  i  ) / E m i s s i o n   i  )   9       Emission intensity is a significant parameter that represents the amount of CO2  emissions produced per unit of energy utilized. It can be obtained as the ratio of average consumption-based CO2  emission to the total final energy consumption. This is represented in Eq. (5) ,(5) Emission  i n t e n s i t y = Average  c o n s u m p t i o n  CO  2   e m i s s i o n  Total  a v e r a g e  f i n a l  e n e r g y  c o n s u m p t i o n        Here, the total final energy consumption can be obtained by summing the energy consumption of all the energy-consuming sectors. After evaluating all these parameters to assess the energy consumption pattern, Countries are classified under three scenarios depending on the highest energy consuming sector in a country. Under each scenario, the energy consumption pattern is identified and the corresponding renewable penetration, fossil fuel dependency, and emission characteristics are logically interpreted. Key attributes of each scenario are also highlighted. The methodology is further extended to propose a policy framework suitable for each scenario with a focus on promoting renewable penetration, energy efficiency, and energy sustainability. Further, the influence of energy consumption patterns on SDG 7 is specifically focused to identify the effective approaches.  3 Tracing energy consumption characteristics – A clustering approach A clustering approach is adopted since the characteristics of energy consumption and its influence on various parameters are based on pattern identification. This involves logical interpretation of the processed data combined with qualitative analysis. Through these calculations, parameters required for analyzing the influence of energy consumption are obtained. Tables 1 and 2    show the results of processed data through Eq (1)  – Eq (5) . Based on Tables 1 and 2 , it can be inferred that energy consumption is primarily dominated by any one of the sectors in the country, especially industry, transportation and residential. Among the 40 countries considered for the analysis, none of the countries emerged to exhibit a higher energy consumption in the commercial sector. Therefore, the energy consumption pattern was investigated in each of the clustered scenarios such as countries with higher energy consumption in (i) industrial sector (Scenario 1), (ii) transportation sector (Scenario 2), and (iii) residential sector (Scenario 3). 3.1 Scenario 1: Countries with higher energy consumption in the industrial sector Out of the 40 countries considered in this study, 15 countries exhibit higher energy consumption in the industrial sector. The observed pattern or influence is detailed as follows: Renewable energy penetration:  In this scenario, the countries with the highest energy consumption in the industrial sector have the highest renewable penetration in either the residential or the industrial sector. Only in Iceland, the commercial sector has the highest renewable penetration. Renewable penetration increase:  The average increase in renewable penetration is dominated by the progress in industrial and transportation sector. The progress of the commercial and residential sectors in renewable penetration plunges while the transportation sector exhibits the highest progress. This can be interpreted from higher values of average renewable penetration increase. Only in China, the commercial sector exhibits the highest increasing trend in renewable penetration. Energy consumption increase : When compared to other scenarios, the average energy consumption increase is drastically higher in the transportation, residential and commercial sectors. Only in this scenario, the residential sector shows an increasing trend in energy consumption. Commercial sector witnesses a 2% year-on-year increase which is four times higher relative to other scenarios. This can be attributed to the established industrial activities, fueling the developments across commercial and residential sectors. With the maximum energy consumption concentrated in the industrial sector, the frequency of the usage of vehicles for industrial purposes is more likely to increase which, in turn, can increase the energy consumption in the transportation sector. Installed capacity:  Out of 15 countries that fall under this scenario, only 4 countries have the highest average installed capacity focused on renewables, specifically hydropower. The remaining countries satisfy their energy expansion through the utilization of fossil fuels as is indicated by the higher average installed capacity value in the past 10 years. Thus, it can be concluded that industrial countries are primarily dependent on energy extracted from fossil fuels, and hydropower is dominated only in countries that are blessed by large hydropower potentials, such as Norway and Brazil. On contrary, the industrial sector in China is heavily backed up by fossil fuels even though China is the largest hydropower consumer in the world [47] . When considering the average renewable energy installed capacity, hydropower-based power expansion is predominant in industrial countries excluding Belgium, the Netherlands and South Africa where solar and wind power shines. Increasing energy preference:  On analyzing the progress in renewable energy installed capacity of various energy resources, it can be observed that solar and wind energy exhibits the highest increasing trend in most countries. Exceptions include Indonesia and Iceland where fossil fuel and geothermal resources have a higher increasing rate of installation, respectively. Solar and wind energy are preferred owing to their accelerating declining trend in cost [48] . Regarding fossil fuels, the industrial energy requirements have led to only a mild decrease in installation rates. Production and consumption-based CO2  emissions:  Under this scenario, two cases are observed. When a country has higher renewable penetration in the residential sector, the production, as well as consumption-based CO2  emissions, are very high. This is due to the higher energy consumption but lesser renewable penetration in the industrial sector. Meanwhile, in a country where renewable penetration is higher in the industrial sector, the production-based CO2  emission drops and the consumption-based CO2  emission rises by a lower rate (3.9 times lower than in the previously mentioned case). Emission intensity:  The emission intensity of all the countries in Scenario 1 is graphically represented in Fig. 2  . The emission intensity is lower than the other two scenarios which may be primarily due to higher export rates as marked by higher industrial prevalence. Table 3   represents the results of Scenario 1 energy consumption analysis for the 15 countries with higher energy consumption in the industrial sector.  3.2 Scenario 2: Countries with higher energy consumption in the transportation sector Among 40 countries, 17 countries have higher energy consumption in the transportation sector. The influence of dominant energy consumption in the transport sector on renewable penetration, installed capacity and energy preference, as well as production and consumption emissions, are discussed in this sub-section. Renewable energy penetration:  A deeper perspective on those countries having higher energy consumption in the transportation sector yielded higher renewable energy penetration only in two sectors which include the industrial and residential sectors. Renewable penetration increase:  Interestingly, the average increase in RE penetration is found to have a random pattern in this scenario. However, when aggregating all the country’s average renewable penetration increment in this scenario, it can be observed that the transportation sector tends to possess higher progress in renewable penetration followed by the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors. Energy consumption increase:  In this scenario, the average energy consumption increase is lower than in other scenarios. It marks a stagnant growth in energy consumption. Mostly, the commercial and transportation sectors possess relatively higher increment in energy consumption in this case. Installed capacity:  The fossil fuel-based expansion of energy needs prevails in the countries where the transportation sector dominates the energy consumption. The installed capacity of renewables is higher only in those countries where the energy mix is considerably dominated by renewables (especially hydropower) such as Austria, Canada and New Zealand. Only in France, the nuclear energy-based installed capacity was higher than any other energy resource. When looking at renewables, the average installed capacity in 10 years is highest for hydropower in most countries, while wind energy is more prominent in European countries. Increasing energy preference:  The increasing preference for solar and wind energy is growing as it is shown by the values of the highest average energy installed increase. It is noteworthy that in this scenario, the solar and wind energy penetration is marginally higher when compared to Scenario 1. Also, it can be observed that the solar and wind energy penetration as well as fossil fuel decrement is the highest in this scenario when compared to the others. Since the energy consumption growth is almost stagnant, renewable penetration can be accomplished only by reducing fossil fuel usage. This explains the highest decrement in fossil fuel dependence relative to other scenarios. Production and consumption-based CO2  emissions:  On analyzing the emission characteristics, the annual production-based CO2  emission witnesses a considerable negative trend while the annual consumption-based CO2  emission experiences a meagre decrement. This may be attributed to increasing electric vehicle penetration in recent years and subsequent improvement in fuel standards and efficiency enhancement of vehicles. Emission intensity:  The emission intensity of all the countries in Scenario 2 is graphically represented in Fig. 3  . Countries belonging to this category possess higher emission intensity than countries having higher energy consumption in industrial sector . Due to the lack of sectoral emission data, the sector that contributes more to the cumulative emissions cannot be identified. The transportation sector has higher energy consumption and the sector solely stands on fossil fuels which may be the potential cause for their higher emission intensity. In addition, the average renewable penetration of all the countries in this scenario for the transportation sector is the lowest when compared to other scenarios. Table 4   represents the results of the energy consumption analysis for the 17 countries with higher energy consumption in Scenario 2.  3.3 Scenario 3: Countries with higher energy consumption in the residential sector Among the 40 countries included for analysis, 8 of them have higher energy consumption in the residential sector. In such countries, the energy consumption of the residential sector differs only marginally from either the industrial or transportation sectors, which means that in the pace of development, these countries may resemble the characteristics of the above-mentioned scenarios. Renewable energy penetration:  On analyzing the renewable penetration characteristics, it can be observed that only the residential sector possesses the highest renewable penetration with an average value of 32.26 %. One key observation is that in this scenario, the renewable penetration in every sector is comparatively higher than in the previously discussed scenarios. In particular, the commercial sector almost exhibits three times higher renewable penetration than in Scenarios 1 and 2. Renewable penetration increase:  On investigating the progress of renewable penetration in the past 10 years for this scenario, the sectoral wise analysis indicates that either the industrial or transportation or residential sector pertains to have the highest average renewable penetration increment. To infer a unique conclusion, a wider set of countries exhibiting higher energy consumption in the residential sector needs to be investigated. Energy consumption increase:  Regarding the increase in energy consumption, the industrial and transportation sectors witness a higher increase in energy consumption. Installed capacity:  In the scenario where the industrial and transportation sector have higher energy consumption, hydropower constitutes the major installed renewable source. However, in this scenario, wind power dominates the renewable penetration as is evident from the average renewable energy installed capacity. Increasing energy preference:  Since the residential sector possesses higher renewable penetration in this scenario, the growth of solar energy is astonishing, followed by wind energy. Only in Latvia, bioenergy dominated the progress in the past 10 years. Production and consumption-based CO2  emissions:  The countries falling under this category on average has an increasing trend of emissions but the increasing rate is lesser than that of Scenario 1. To be precise, every country in this category possesses average negative growth in emissions except India, Estonia, and Poland where the use of fossil fuels is soaring in the energy mix. Such higher usage of fossil fuels in a few countries shifts the average value of CO2  emission for 8 countries to net positive growth. Emission intensity:  On analyzing the emission intensity, this scenario marks the highest average value of 4.13 kilo tonnes of CO2  equivalent for every kilo tonnes of oil equivalent consumed. The reason behind this could be geographical and population influence. Only India belongs to Asia, whereas the rest of the countries presented under this category belongs to the European continent where in general a large amount of heat energy is required for the residential sector. However, in Europe, the penetration of renewables for providing heat energy is less and fossil fuel dominates the heating sector [49] . Though renewable penetration is higher in this scenario, it is limited to the power sector while the heating sector needs much more progress to witness energy transition. Table 5   represents the results of the energy consumption analysis for Scenario 3 with 8 countries having higher energy consumption in the residential sector. The emission intensity of all the countries in Scenario 3 is graphically represented in Fig. 4  .  3.4 Comparative analysis A comparison of all the scenarios is provided in Table 6  . Figs. 5 and 6    represents the influence of energy consumption on various energy resource preference and emission characteristics, respectively. Overall, the key observations from analyzing the energy consumption of 40 countries include:• Scenario 1 has lower emission intensity but higher average emission increment. It can be observed that renewable penetration results in line with energy consumption increase. The changes in energy consumption are captured by increase in energy consumption parameter. The overall increase in energy consumption is higher in countries in Scenario 1 than in other countries. The increase in energy consumption is higher in transportation sector in Scenario 1 which is followed by commercial and industrial sectors. This provides opportunities for increasing renewable penetration in transportation and industrial sector as it is witnessed in higher renewable penetration increase parameter. The residential sector in Scenario 1 witnesses a near stagnant growth in energy consumption and thus, a negative increase in renewable penetration is observed (due to lack of opportunity to deploy renewables).  • In Scenario 2, the transportation sector has higher energy consumption, and the energy consumption looks saturated as marked by less year-on-year increase, followed by the accelerated decreasing trend of emission. This can be interpreted as the best scenario for decoupling emissions from the rest of the energy-consuming sectors since the average fossil fuel increment value is the least in this scenario. Besides, the renewable penetration is also the lowest in this scenario and this can be explained by stagnant energy consumption increase. As the energy need raises, the opportunity to install renewable-based energy resources increases. But in this scenario, due to a lower increase in energy consumption, a transformative energy scenario is needed, which makes the RE penetration process slower. Carbon tax schemes and other decarbonization can be effective in this scenario.  • Scenario 3 highlights the highest renewable penetration since the industrial and transportation sector is not a major energy-consuming sector. The industrial and transportation sectors are predominately run by heat engines and cycles based on fossil fuels, but the residential sector depends on electricity. Thus, the raising energy consumption trend in residential sector creates more opportunities to support renewable penetration. Interestingly, higher energy consumption in the residential sector aids in bioenergy utilization as compared to any other scenario. Besides, the emission intensity is higher in this sector for which the reason is quite unfamiliar and requires more investigation of countries that falls under this scenario.  • Irrespective of the type of scenarios, the residential sector has good progress in RE penetration than the rest since the energy in the residential sector is commonly consumed in the form of electric power which can be supported by renewables easily. Recent progress in RE penetration is well-established in the transportation and industrial sector.  • The transportation sector has poor renewable penetration, and transforming the transportation sector towards energy sustainability would require huge efforts ranging from decreasing the fossil fuel use and increasing the electric vehicle penetration, to higher use of renewable energy in processing the fuels, and increasing the penetration of renewable fuels.  • In all the scenarios, renewable penetration increase is higher in transportation sector while is the lowest in residential sector. Nevertheless, the average renewable penetration in residential sector is almost 5.6, 6.1, 10.3 times higher than transportation sector corresponding to Scenario 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This implies that higher progress in renewable penetration is accomplished in renewable penetration in residential sector which reasons the lesser progress in renewable penetration in comparison with renewable penetration increase in transportation sector. Similar trend can also be observed on comparing transportation sector with industrial sector. On the other hand, commercial sector does not possess higher renewable energy mix as indicated by average renewable penetration value as well as the renewable penetration increase is lower which marks slower progress in renewable expansion. This is of concern in promoting renewables and policies should be tailored to direct the commercial sector towards clean energy utilization.  • The dependency on fossil fuels in all three scenarios witnesses a declining trend with average declining rate of 0.82, 1.4, 1.22 corresponding to the Scenarios 1, 2, and 3. It can be observed that Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 demonstrate a higher declining trend which is attributed to stagnant energy consumption increase in Scenario 2 while it may be due to the trend of energy consumption dominated by power consumption in Scenario 3.  • Wind and solar energy emerged as the most preferred energy resources to be installed in the past 10 years. This is driven by the decreasing trend of cost and increasing preference for renewables [48] . Further, geographical location influences the selection of energy resources, for instance, geothermal in Iceland; solar energy in Italy and Germany; wind energy in Denmark.  • Hydropower is the most-installed energy resource among renewables (cumulative value) and fossil fuel is the highest-installed energy resource on average. On contrary, both hydropower and fossil fuel energy resources face decreasing trends in year-on-year installed capacity.  • The average production and consumption-based CO2  emission is the highest in Scenario 1 than in other scenarios. This can be attributed to the predominant industrial activities since Scenario 1 marks high energy consumption in industrial sector. Despite Scenario 2 depends on fossil fuels, the average production and consumption-based CO2  emissions witnesses a decreasing trend which can be pinpointed to stagnant energy consumption pattern. It is interesting to note that the average emission intensity of Scenario 1 is the least in relative to other scenarios despite the higher emission levels. This is because of the dependency of the emission intensity factor on the GDP which is generally increases with increasing industrial activities. Nevertheless, more insights are required for further analysis as the sectoral wise emission data is absent.      4 Scenario specific policy implications As the residential sector has predominantly higher renewable penetration than all the other sectors in the considered timeframe (2009–2018), it might be possible that current policies succeeded in making the renewable energy solutions affordable to the households. However, prevailing policy measures might not be considered inclusive since the economic growth pattern in the countries is not able to internalize the negative environmental externalities in the industrial and transportation sector. Further, all the four major energy-consuming sectors exhibit different characteristics of influence on energy consumption, renewable penetration and emission attributes under each scenario. Thus, considering a generalized policy framework would be ineffective, while an optimized policy approach combined with these three scenarios is required. Therefore, a policy realignment is necessary, and the policy framework will vary across the three scenarios presented. These policy frameworks will have two components, namely the core and the tangential frameworks. The core framework will be focused on scenario-specific policy implications to enhance renewable penetration and energy efficiency and substantiate energy sustainability. The tangential framework will be focused on sustaining the core framework by addressing developmental policies and socio-economic approaches. These two frameworks might be implemented in two phases which are discussed in subsequent sections. 4.1 Core policy framework 4.1.1 Scenario 1 The proposed policy framework for Scenario 1 is represented in Fig. 7  . Under this scenario, the industrial sectors of the countries are majorly dependent on fossil fuel-based solutions, and therefore, these countries are characterized by low penetration of renewable energy solutions. Now, in such a situation, the policy initiative needs to look into transformation in the use of energy sources, so that the dependence on fossil fuel-based solutions is reduced. However, while carrying out this transformation, it is also needed that the economic growth pattern remains intact. Hence, a phase-wise transformation method should be adopted, and in this transformational process, the financialization channel should be utilized. The policymakers need to make the renewable energy solutions available to the industrial sector at a pro-rata rate, and the firm needs to obtain those solutions from the public agencies. Now, to obtain those solutions, firms will require loans and advances, and there the role of the financialization channel will come through the financial institutions. The financial institutions need to adopt a Differential Interest Rate  mechanism for providing loans and advances to the industrial firms, and the differentiation should be based on the carbon footprint of the firms, i.e., a firm with a higher carbon footprint will have to bear a higher rate of interest, and a firm with lower carbon footprint can be provided with a lower rate of interest, with certain interest rate holiday. It will thus incentivize the firms to implement renewable energy solutions and disincentivize the usage of fossil fuel-based solutions. This initiative will gradually increase the demand for renewable energy in the industrial sector, and hence, gradually the installed capacity of renewable energy solutions will rise. With this rise in renewable energy demand, policymakers need to promote the research and development toward energy innovation. There are two reasons behind this: (a) to enhance the energy efficiency of the existing production processes, and (b) to increase the scope of the renewable energy solutions. Promoting energy innovation will help these nations in enhancing their renewable energy portfolio, and while these nations will achieve economies of scale in terms of renewable energy generation, they will achieve further cost reduction and make these solutions more affordable. This will help in diffusing renewable energy solutions more effectively. Realization of this initiative will also help these nations in creating more jobs, thereby, creating a social multiplier effect of the implementation of renewable energy solutions.  4.1.2 Scenario 2 The proposed policy framework for Scenario 2 is represented in Fig. 8  . Unlike the previous scenario, the countries listed in this scenario utilize more energy in the transportation sector, and this sector being a major enabler of economic growth, any policy reorientation should not harm the operational aspects of this sector. Therefore, even if this sector is characterized by a higher share of fossil fuel-based solutions, mere shifting away from energy resources might harm the functioning of this sector. Therefore, the policy intervention should be primarily looked into making this sector more carbon neutral. In doing so, policymakers might rely on energy innovations for ensuring energy efficiency in the existing production processes. It can be anticipated that the rising demand for energy in this sector might not be fulfilled by existing renewable energy generation solutions, and the surplus demand needs to be fulfilled by fossil fuel-based solutions. In such a scenario, it might be assumed that through the fossil fuel generation process, the economic growth pattern is exerting a negative environmental externality by causing ambient carbon emissions. Hence, the policymakers should be concerned about the rising emission problem, while shifting towards cleaner energy sources. To promote energy efficiency, policymakers need to encourage innovation. However, it might not be possible for these countries to immediately scale up the existing research and development. Hence, solutions can be imported from other nations, and this initiative can have a negative impact on the trade balance, and the overall economic scenario. This economic loss incurred by the countries can be recovered by following a Pigouvian Tax regime, according to which the policymakers can introduce a Differential Taxation mechanism based on the carbon footprint of the firms, i.e., a higher carbon footprint might attract a higher tax rate. This initiative will gradually compel the firms to bring forth changes in the operational structure so that the level of carbon emissions can be reduced. Saying this, it should also be remembered that the coexistence of fossil fuel-based energy sources and energy efficiency solutions might reduce environmental degradation, but won’t be able to eradicate it. Hence, the implementation of energy efficiency solutions could be considered the first phase of the policy framework. In the next phase, policymakers need to emphasize the domestic capacity development for research and development towards the discovery of alternate and clean energy sources, as dependence on technology import might not be a viable long-term solution for these countries. While encouraging these solutions, policymakers should also look into the scalability of these solutions, as achieving economies of scale might reduce the implementation cost of these solutions. Along with this, the policymakers also need to reduce the harmful subsidies on fossil fuel-based energy sources, so that the price of those solutions starts moving up, thereby reducing their demand. This move will gradually pave the way for renewable energy solutions to be diffused across the nation, and a gradual decline in the implementation cost will not only increase their demand in the transportation sector but also will increase the installed capacity of these solutions. With this rise in the renewable energy demand, the policymakers need to promote the research and development towards transportation infrastructural development. There are two reasons behind this: (a) to enhance fuel efficiency by reducing the travel time, and (b) to increase the scope of portable and off-grid renewable energy solutions. Promoting transportation infrastructural development will help these nations in reducing the renewable energy intensity, and while these nations will achieve the portability of the off-grid renewable energy generation, they will achieve further cost reduction, without increasing the load for the on-grid energy supply. This will help in diffusing the renewable energy solutions in this sector in a more effective way.  4.1.3 Scenario 3 The proposed policy framework for Scenario 3 is represented in Fig. 9  . In the third scenario, the countries are characterized by higher energy consumption in the residential sector. As this sector is already showing growth in terms of renewable energy adaptation in comparison with the other sectors, the policymakers might consider expanding the scope of renewable energy solutions in these countries. There are two possible reasons behind this policy initiative: (a) affordability of the renewable energy solutions might have helped these nations in achieving a higher level of penetration compared to other countries, and (b) the acceptance of renewable energy solutions might have gone up. Given this situation, policymakers should be interested in scaling up renewable energy solutions by exploring new sources of renewable energy. As the residential sector has sustained demand for renewable energy solutions, policymakers might need to look into industrial and transportation sectors for a higher level of renewable energy penetration. As the residential sector has shown a sustained higher level of renewable energy penetration, the policymakers might choose to introduce new renewable energy solutions, which might be able to cater to the energy demand in the rest of the sectors. In this pursuit, the policymakers might choose to either scale up the production capacity of solar, wind, and hydropower solutions, or new renewable energy solutions can be implemented. However, this transformation might not be carried out overnight, as it might have a detrimental impact on the economic growth pattern of these countries. Hence, these countries should initially focus on enhancing the energy efficiency of the existing production and operational processes in these two sectors, and in this pursuit, cleaner production technologies can be imported from other nations. While saying this, it also needs to be remembered that the existing research and development facilities in these nations have made renewable energy solutions affordable to the residential sector and owing to this, the dependence on the imported technologies might be a short-term phenomenon. Once the technologies are developed within the nation, diffusion of these technologies might be pushed by means of the financialization channel, similar to the way it has been carried out for Scenario 1. This will help both these sectors to (a) initiate the carbon reduction process, and (b) understand and realize the need for cleaner energy alternatives. This particular phase should be focusing on improving the energy efficiency of these sectors so that the readiness of the sectors for renewable energy adaptation can be ascertained in the next phase. During the second phase, the focus of the policymakers should be on shifting the energy sources from non-renewable to renewable, and achievement of the economies of scale might help in reducing the renewable energy price. This is necessary for the initial stage of the implementation of the second phase since a certain rise in price due to higher initial implementation costs might impact the energy usage pattern of the residential sector. This is when the policymakers need to introduce an interim Differential Pricing mechanism so that the energy consumption pattern of the residential sector remains unaffected. The certain financial losses incurred during this period might be recovered through the interest income generated from the loans and advances taken by the industrial and transportation sectors for the procurement of renewable energy solutions. While these initiatives are in place, it is also necessary to remember that the existing renewable energy infrastructure in these countries might not be able to cater to the rise in energy demand. Therefore, the policymakers need to emphasize further research and development for the discovery of alternate energy sources, while boosting entrepreneurship ventures in this direction. It will help these nations to create an environment of energy innovation to secure their sustainable energy future.  4.1.4 The impact on sustainability While these solutions are in place, these nations will be able to make progress towards making cleaner energy resources available to industry and households at an affordable rate. This initiative will not only help these nations in ensuring their energy security, but also will help them in advancing towards attaining the objectives of SDG 7, i.e., affordable and clean energy. As these policy initiatives will gradually bring forth a transformation in the energy sources, the negative environmental externality exerted by the economic growth trajectory will gradually start to be internalized. Shifting away from fossil fuel-based solutions and the emergence of renewable energy solutions will cause carbon emissions to come down. Achievement of this objective will help these nations in making advancements towards attaining the larger objectives of SDG 13, i.e., climate action. In the process of enhancing the renewable energy penetration, the encouragement of policymakers to initiate entrepreneurship ventures for the discovery of alternate energy resources will have a larger economic impact. Besides internalizing the negative environmental externalities, the newly formed ventures and operational scaling up of the existing renewable energy generation firms will eventually create several job opportunities, which might be referred to as the Green jobs. The creation of such job opportunities will also help these nations to achieve further economic growth while assuring an upliftment of the living standard of the citizens. The multiplier effect exerted by these ventures will help these nations to create decent work opportunities and attainment of economic growth, which in turn will assist in adhering to the objectives of SDG 8. On the other hand, the country’s energy consumption pattern might not be significantly similar to the aforementioned scenarios. For instance, a country can have its energy consumption closely dominated by any two sectors, maybe, the industrial and transportation sectors. In this case, hybridization of policy approaches can be accomplished but it is suggested to frame the policy by closely pursuing the changes incurred by the existing energy consumption pattern. The provided core policy implication will be supportive once when the changes are mapped and the most suitable policy approach can be implemented.   4.2 Tangential policy framework Any policy framework will have both core and tangential impacts. While a policy framework is developed with certain core policy agendas, operationalization of those agendas will have spillover effects on other policy dimensions. These spillover effects are completely undeliberated. Yet, the very existence of these impacts will add to the effectiveness of the policy framework. The nature of the spillover effects might be derived demand-driven, and hence, they will also add to the sustained operationalization of the core policy framework. These tangential policies will create further opportunities to expand the core policy framework by making it more inclusive in nature. Therefore, the discussion of a policy framework will be incomplete without bringing the aspects of tangential policy framework, which will help in sustaining the basis of the core policy framework [65–67] . The fundamentals of the core policy framework are grounded on the research and development capacity of the nations. Moreover, the environmental awareness of the citizens is also necessary to ascertain intergenerational equity, which is the fundamental target of any sustainability-oriented policy framework. For this, the policymakers might need to reach the grassroots level, so that both these objectives can be fulfilled. In order to enhance the capacity to innovate or generate environmental awareness, educational attainment is the most important policy instrument. A thorough redesign of the educational curriculum at the elementary level is necessary so that the future labor force can be elucidated about the environmental benefits of renewable energy solutions, the importance of environmental protection, the significance of biodiversity for sustainability, and the latest developments in the field of science and technology in pursuit of the discovery of alternate energy solutions. This particular initiative will help these nations in sustaining the core policy frameworks, by making the future generation of the labor force about the importance of environmental awareness. At the same time, the policymakers will also have to be careful about maintaining the social order during the implementation of these policy frameworks. While renewable energy sources are being implemented across the nations and the demand for renewable energy solutions is rising, it can be assumed that the demand for traditional fossil fuel-based energy solutions will start declining. In such a scenario, the fossil fuel-based energy generation sector will start facing a downside demand pressure, which will be reflected in terms of the rising unemployment situation in that sector. Without adequate vocational rehabilitation facilities, this rising unemployment scenario might prove to be detrimental to the sustainable development of these nations. This is where policy intervention might be necessary. To absorb the surplus labor in the renewable energy generation and allied sectors, the policymakers need to introduce adequate skill-development facilities, so that the workers can develop new skills and can be employed again. It will help these nations to keep the social order intact amidst the policy-level transformation. In a nutshell, the tangential policy framework should be focused on improving the educational attainment, enhancing the quality and focus of the curriculum, and introducing skill-development facilities, and these initiatives cumulatively help in improving the quality of education. To maintain intergenerational equity, education and society need to come together for envisaging the economic growth trajectory from the lens of sustainability. This policy framework might make these nations start moving towards attaining the objectives of SDG 4, i.e., quality education.  4.3 Policy caveats and assumptions Developing any policy framework entails making some assumptions and considering certain caveats. Notwithstanding these aspects might lead to ineffectiveness of the policy design. First, the purpose of the differential rate of interest is to reduce the level of emissions by discouraging the firms to use fossil fuel-based solutions. So, these rates should not be kept within the operational limits of the firms. The similar condition is applicable for the Pigouvian Tax rates, as well. Second, the innovation initiatives should be gender-inclusive. This will not only help reducing the social cost of these initiatives but will also help in maintaining the cognitive balance in the research and development process. Third, the existing renewable energy generation infrastructure might not be able to fulfill the rise in the renewable energy demand. This surplus demand might encourage new firms and entrepreneurship ventures to enter this segment. Smoothening of the operations of these firms should be ensured by minimizing the rent-seeking behavior and maintaining transparency in the bureaucratic process to initiate the business. Lastly, the quality of governance should be maintained for sustaining the social balance within the nation. This sustenance is necessary for the effective implementation of the policy framework.   5 The influence of energy consumption pattern on SDG 7 5.1 Energy accessibility Typically, energy accessibility contains the two dimensions of electricity and clean fuels. These are the two pipelines to lay the foundation for substantiating energy sustainability. Innovative financial schemes to drive the installation of decentralized energy systems are required for low-income actors [50] . Awareness about the purpose of energy access, and motivation play a vital role in electrifying remote and disparate populations. On the other hand, when people have access to both unclean traditional fuel and clean fuel in households, the former is preferred due to the inhibition to change, lack of awareness and their free availability in nature, especially in developing countries [51] . Government subsidies and cost competitiveness of clean fuels have a significant role to play in increasing the usage of clean energy. A coordinated measure by using both top-down and bottom-up approaches is required to engage the community, energy companies, and public and private sectors to promote accessibility [52] . The various factors influencing energy accessibility are depicted in Fig. 10  . When energy access is considered, it mainly promotes energy access to people who are in remote areas, households not connected to the centralized grid system, lack the localized infrastructure to harvest and transmit the energy, and lack reliable and affordable access [53] . Therefore, analysis of the residential sector under each scenario would mark the influence of energy access. As energy accessibility is progressed year-on-year, the energy requirement and so does the energy consumption increase as a whole. This would push the country’s energy capacity by installing energy projects if the existing generating capacity is not sufficient to tackle the rise in energy consumption. In Scenario 1, the per year increase in energy consumption is the highest in the transportation sector. The residential sector does not show any major upheaval in energy consumption in Scenario 1 but has a positive little growth. Here, the industrial sector plays a vital role in enhancing energy accessibility since industries aid in the development of the economy. In addition, the societal infrastructure improves when industries are the backbone of the development. Scenario 1 has the highest average installation rate as well as the highest TFEC when compared to any other scenario. This indicates that the possibilities of promoting energy accessibility in Scenario 1 are higher. In Scenario 2, the residential sector’s energy consumption increase was the least when compared to other sectors. Further, the average rise in TFEC, as well as average installed capacity rise, is lesser than in the other scenarios. Promoting energy accessibility in this scenario needs various effective strategies. In Scenario 3, the residential sector emerges to be the highest energy consumer but their per year increase sees a downward trend. In this scenario, the industrial sector distinctly possesses a higher increase in energy consumption and this favors a moderate increase in TFEC. The average installation rate though lesser than Scenario 1, rounds off to a 3% increase per year. Overall, the possibilities of promoting energy accessibility are higher in Scenario 3, especially due to higher energy consumption directed towards the residential sector and the increase in energy consumption being shifted to the industrial sector. Further, the increase in energy consumption may be attributed to several factors such as lifestyle changes, increased per capita energy consumption, population increase and many other factors. While it is also seen that when the rural population migrates to urban areas, the residential energy consumption decreases [54] . Accessibility often goes in hand with affordability. Therefore, this study gives the possibilities of interaction between energy consumption characteristics and energy accessibility but without considering the aforementioned factors, a clear picture is difficult to obtain. This calls for further research in this area.  5.2 Renewable energy penetration The energy consumption pattern has a clear influence on renewable energy penetration. The identified three patterns (scenarios) of energy consumption have different characteristics of renewable penetration marked by the increase in energy consumption. Scenario 1 portrays a higher renewable penetration in the residential sector. However, the increase in renewable penetration occurs proportionately with the increase in energy consumption in each sector. Maybe the degree of penetration will vary from sector to sector. In Scenario 1, the policy perception to promote renewable energy penetration is easier as the energy consumption increase will sustain . This provides plenty of opportunities to shift focus to renewable energy. The promising approach includes providing incentives or support to solar panels and battery systems, low rate of interest for renewable energy projects, tax incentives for renewable project infrastructure supporting companies, and favoring entrepreneurial activities would play its role in accelerating renewable penetration in Scenario 1. In the case of the industrial sector, renewable energy adoption and energy conservation policies might be effective when compared to policies that emphasize industrial upgradation [55] . Also, energy conservation policies and economic incentive tools have a conducive effect on enhancing energy efficiency [56] . Although the energy conservation policy can reduce energy consumption [57] , the direct rebound effect should be controlled which relies on the policy framework [58] . A detailed policy implication is framed in Section 4 . In Scenario 2, due to its stagnant growth in energy consumption, the renewable penetration is difficult to progress. This forces to focus on energy efficiency and transformative energy scenario, i.e., to replace the existing non-renewable based energy projects with renewable energy projects. This requires investigation to tradeoff the support that makes the non-renewables functional in society. The incentives for the extraction of non-renewable resources should be avoided. The employment opportunities should be considered as a driving force to promote social acceptance within Scenario 2. On the other hand, the inefficient fossil fuel-based power plants should be replaced at the first level, then the focus should shift to producing renewable-based thermal energy. Further, the reskilling of workers should be accomplished. Policies should be framed in a way to curtail the use of fossil fuels instead of promoting renewable penetration [59] . Industrial energy usage should align with sufficient renewable energy penetration and a scheme, similar to the carbon tax, can be propounded to proportionately increase the tax for the industry that depends entirely on non-renewables. In both Scenario 1 and 2, the highest energy consumption increase is attained by the transportation sector. Thus, focusing on electric vehicle penetration can pave a pathway to accelerate renewable energy penetration in both scenarios. In scenario 3, the renewable penetration can be easily accelerated since the residential sector possesses higher energy consumption and higher renewable penetration than other sectors. Here, solar and wind energy play a crucial role. In the context of integrating solar energy with energy storage technologies, especially in the residential sector, policies such as incentives in proportion to self-consumption of PV generated electricity, feed-in-tariff bonus for additional battery storage, dynamic retail pricing mechanism favors the economic profitability of residential solar PV integrated with battery storage systems [60] . On the other hand, the energy consumption increase is interestingly higher in the industrial and transportation sector when compared to other sectors in this scenario. Therefore, if the increase in energy consumption induced by the industrial and transportation sector is satisfied by renewables, then the renewable penetration can be further enhanced in these sectors.  5.3 Energy intensity Energy intensity is a measure of economic inefficiency which is evaluated as the ratio of primary energy supply to GDP. The energy intensity of the considered 40 countries is summarized in Fig. 11  . Energy intensity is sensitive to factors such as standards of living, weather conditions in a country, energy efficiency, energy affordability, effective transport utilization and productive economy. A 1% rise in energy intensity can account for a 0.74% increase in carbon emissions and therefore, reduced energy intensity is intrinsically linked with climate action [61] . In context with various energy-consuming sectors, the major role of energy intensity relies on the industrial sector in developing countries and the residential or transportation sector in developed countries. The reason behind this would possibly lower energy consumption associated with the residential sector in developing countries. This might be attributed to a lack of energy access or the inability to use high energy-consuming equipment such as air conditioners and heat pumps which are widely accessible in the residential sector of developed countries. The intensity of the use of high energy consuming devices is profoundly distributed in harsh climatic zones such as Canada, Iceland and South Africa where the energy intensity peaks. On the other hand, the importation of energy resources would affect the energy intensity through the cost of energy factor. Renewables not only would solve this problem, but also substantiates energy security in the country [62] . Further, according to a study, the GDP per capita and economy-wide energy prices are observed to be inversely related to energy intensity [63] . On analyzing the energy intensity data (Data source: [64] ) of 40 countries considered for the analysis, it can be evaluated that the average energy intensity corresponding to Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are 1.57, 1.16 and 1.19 kWh/$, respectively (as shown in Fig. 12  ). Thus, it can be inferred that energy consumption in the industrial sector has a higher influence on energy intensity than transportation and residential sectors. In Scenario 1, the energy consumption in the industrial sector is higher but the transportation and commercial sectors witness a higher energy consumption rise. Besides, there are possibilities to see a decrease in energy intensity if the GDP raise is more than the increase in energy consumption. Though the energy consumption in the industrial sector is higher, they contribute to increasing the GDP but the cumulative effect in energy intensity cannot be generalized and is country-specific. In Scenario 1, the energy intensity can be reduced by focusing on entertaining highly efficient processes and coupling them with power-to-x technologies. Further, waste heat recovery and electrifying feasible processes would support reducing energy intensity. In harsh climatic regions, for sustainable heating, a built environment inclusive of industries is pivotal for slashing energy intensity. While the cooling load can be reduced by improving the thermal performance of the buildings. In Scenario 2, the commonly observed characteristic is stagnant energy consumption growth and the energy intensity corresponding to this scenario is the lowest. The primary approach to reducing energy intensity in this scenario is to focus on the effective and efficient use of energy. The transportation sector has a higher energy footprint and this can be reduced considerably by increasing the penetration of electric vehicles. Further, developing cities' infrastructure to reduce the frequent commuting distance and encouraging the use of public transport is highly favorable. In Scenario 3, higher energy consumption in the residential sector and higher energy consumption increase exhibited by the industrial sector are utmost in influencing the energy intensity. Measures to use efficient household energy applications, promoting community renewables and sustainable heating would reduce energy intensity in context with the residential sector.   6 Conclusions This study is aimed at providing deeper perspectives on the role of energy consumption patterns in driving the energy policies and their influence on SDG 7. The analysis is focused on obtaining an inference by investigating the changes that occurred from 2009 to 2018. The changes investigated include energy consumption, renewable penetration, installed capacity, production and consumption-based emission, and emission intensity. A cumulative large picture of energy consumption is obtained, and its pattern is classified into three scenarios. Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are characterized by the highest energy consumption in the industrial, transportation and residential sectors, respectively. The rise in energy consumption is cumulatively higher in Scenario 1, and Scenario 3 has a moderate increase in energy consumption. Meanwhile, a stagnant rise is observed in Scenario 2. Renewable energy penetration is higher in Scenario 3 while the residential sector has the highest renewable penetration among all the major-consumers in all three scenarios. The highest fossil fuel decrement is observed in Scenario 2 and because of its stagnant energy consumption growth, the renewable penetration increase is highly related to fossil fuel decrement. Among all the renewable energy resources, wind and solar witnesses the highest growth while hydropower preference is decreasing. Concerning the emissions, both production and consumption-based emission are lower in Scenario 2 while it is vice-versa in Scenario 1 due to higher energy consumption in the industrial sector. On the other hand, the emission intensity is the highest in Scenario 3 followed by Scenario 2. The reason for this is unclear and it may be attributed to geographical influence for entrenching human comfort. A policy framework is developed based on the results of the study. The core dimensions of the policy framework aim at attaining the objectives of SDG 7 by improving energy efficiency, promoting cleaner and renewable energy technologies, reorienting financialization channels for achieving energy security and environmental sustainability, encouraging research and development, and catalyzing the creation of green jobs. Alongside this, the tangential dimensions of the policy framework focus at sustaining the core policy framework through augmenting the educational curricula and rehabilitation of the labors employed in the traditional fossil fuel generation sector. Therefore, on one hand, the policy framework is aiming at achieving energy security and environmental sustainability, on another hand, it is sustaining the social balance. Involvement of both industrial and residential sectors will help in maintaining the inclusivity of the policy framework. Further, the study is extended to elaborate on the influence of energy consumption patterns on three major milestones of SDG 7, i.e., energy accessibility, renewable energy penetration and energy intensity. The possibilities to improve energy accessibility is highest in Scenario 3 since the residential sector is marked by higher energy consumption. Besides, this might not be true in the case of developed countries or countries that already achieved 100% energy accessibility. The relation between energy consumption and energy accessibility further demands deep investigation. Concerning the renewable penetration, it is observed that the tendency to uptake the renewables can be possibly higher in the scenarios where energy consumption increase is higher. This corresponds to Scenarios 1 and 3. Meanwhile, Scenario 2 exhibits higher per year renewable penetration growth. The policies that aid in renewable penetration in each of the three scenarios are also suggested. Energy consumption is closely related to energy intensity. Higher energy intensity is observed in Scenario 1, followed by Scenario 3 and Scenario 2. The various strategies to reduce energy intensity in respective scenarios are also elucidated. Collectively, the intended objective of this study is well-established. The results of this study can drive the energy community as well as a deeper understanding of energy consumption can be perceived. All the policy approaches to enhance the renewable penetration in a country need to analyze their energy consumption pattern, and the framework of the policy should be built upon it. In this way, the policies can be effective to establish energy sustainability. For the issues like climate change, effective policies have a larger role to play. This study would act as an unique interpretation of the existing problem and bridge the knowledge gap to frame optimized policies.
