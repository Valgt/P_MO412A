                  Purpose
                  The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature in order to examine how digital technologies are used to effectively utilize natural resources.
               
                  Design/Methodology/Approach
                  The paper employs a two-level analytical approach that includes bibliometric analysis and an integrative literature review comprising of mechanical analysis and manual interpretation of 138 publications from the Web of Science (WoS) database.
               
                  Findings
                  The findings identify the most influential articles, and sources on the subject based on their publication, citation, and importance to the intellectual network; additionally, the study sheds light on the subject's intellectual structure (thematic analysis), which is supported by seven major clusters focusing on ‘water resource management,’ ‘environmental impact,’ ‘economic and social impact,’ ‘technological innovation and digitalization,’ ‘circular economy,’ ‘alternative energy resources,’ and ‘energy resource management’.
               
                  Originality
                  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrative review of its kind that provides a thorough examination of the literature on the natural resource utilization in digital era in attaining select SDGs. We conducted an inductive analysis and built aggregate dimensions from the study's core subjects and themes using keyword co-occurrence and thematic analysis, which led to a conceptual framework for integrating natural resource utilization and SDGs. Our conceptual framework synthesizes how innovation, digitization, and technology transfer and dissemination contribute to resource management and sustainable use, achieving SDGs.

Natural resources are becoming increasingly limited, and environmental degradation is rising by the day (Gupta et al., 2020 ). The world leaders attending the United Nations High-Level Meeting on Climate and Sustainable Development were cautioned that just a little more than a decade is left to prevent irreparable climate change damage. According to the recent UN report, no country or community is immune to climate-related catastrophe, and the world's poorest countries are the first to suffer and most impacted (Puthalpet, 2022 ). To save our natural resources and energy, as well as to avoid, eliminate, or reduce ecological destruction, each country is focusing more on digital innovation for sustainable development and the maximum economic and ecological benefits at the lowest possible cost and pollution (Zhou, 2021 ). United Nations (2022)  identifies areas requiring immediate action to save the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and provide significant progress for people and the earth by 2030, and climate action has been given a “code red” warning as the opportunity window to avert climate change quickly closes. Growing reliance on natural resources has placed the planet on an unsustainable path, and the report notes that reducing this pressure would need better natural resource efficiency, circularity measures, and general efforts to dematerialize economic growth. The vast body of extant research leaves little question regarding the importance of digitization and innovation in the dynamics of environmental devastation and socioeconomic progress (J. Chen et al., 2018 ; Lundvall, 2016 ).  Technological innovation improves and adjusts the utilization and allocation of natural resources, as well as the utilization efficiency of raw materials and energy, in order to develop a wide range of energy-saving products (Diaz-Rainey and Ashton, 2015 ). Eco-innovation (environmental innovation, green innovation, or sustainable innovation) is a form of innovation that has lately attracted increased attention. It consists of inventions that contribute to sustainable development, an improved environment, and favorable economic exchange (Hazarika and Zhang, 2019 ). This is the sort of innovation in which the inventor expects a good market diffusion with a decent profit while also contributing to a better environment. When analyzed using the diffusion of innovation theory (DOI), which was developed in 1962 and seeks to explain why and at what rate information about new technologies and capabilities spreads across, resulting in its uptake, eco-innovation helps in determining how adopters perceive eco-innovations in relation to their individual characteristics and preoccupations (Chiappetta Jabbour et al., 2020a ). The introduction of a new phase of technological revolution and industrial transformation is both a problem and an opportunity for the world's green development. It is critical to use scientific and technical innovation as a strategic foundation to increase the efficiency of natural resource exploitation. Leading the development of green innovation, the technological innovation that solves the economic low-carbon development mode and environmental protection paradox has become a hot zone for researchers all over the world. Samylovskaya et al. (2022)  examined the current and future prospects of introducing digital technologies into the oil and gas mining industry and concluded that digitalization is being more actively introduced into general enterprise management processes, and the main goal of oil and gas sector digitalization is to increase the efficiency of business process management, while the key constraining factors are a lack of qualified personnel, a lack of material and technical base. Madhu et al. (2021a)  presents a life-cycle assessment of the current demonstration of Direct air capture (DAC) technologies coupled with carbon storage, revealing that carbon storage DAC requires roughly the same amount of renewable energy and land occupation as a switch from gasoline to electric vehicles, but with approximately five times the material consumption and varies between $250  and $600 today  depending on the technology choice, low-carbon energy source, and the scale of their deployment. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is another alternative CO2 capturing technology that plays an important part in worldwide attempts to reduce emissions while costing less than DAC. Natural resources are a critical material foundation for economic and social growth. The massive demand for natural resources, as well as their large-scale exploitation, has resulted in the deterioration of the resource base as industrialization and population growth have progressed. With the lowest environmental costs assuring the sustainable usage of natural resources, has become a key issue in the process of national economic and social growth. Xu and Lin (2017)  stated that determining the driving factors of carbon emissions is critical for making effective environmental policies, made an empirical analysis using China's steel industry as a research object, and the results show that energy efficiency plays a leading role in the green development of the steel industry. Emodi et al. (2017)  studied the influence of Nigeria's future energy demand determinants using the scenario analysis approach, analyzing Nigeria's energy policy from four distinct scenarios. Recent technological breakthroughs have heightened scholarly interest in the concept of digital natural resource usage (NRU). Year after year, scholarly interest in this topic has increased, with 132 journal publications, 11 review papers, and 29 average citations per document. The majority of the 132 journal publications studied the area using quantitative methodology. Despite a growing corpus of empirical data indicating that digital technologies have the potential to improve natural resource utilization and its management all around the world, the findings are scattered. Very few review papers were found in our data. In a recent review, Yu et al. (2021a)  discusses the global energy supply and environmental challenges and transitions, as well as natural gas hydrates (NGHs) and their role in the energy supply, carbon cycle, and historical and future climate change, and summarizes the state-of-the-art developments in hydrate-based technologies and NGH exploitation methods, as well as their potential environmental impacts, thereby providing a perspective on the roles of NGHs and their related technologies in the future energy supply and climate change mitigation. In another conceptual work, Imoro et al. (2021a)  investigate the potential of indigenous knowledge and technologies for the sustainable management of water, land, and food security in the face of climate change, pointing out that indigenous technologies and knowledge such as agroforestry, the use of sacred groves to conserve water, land, and biodiversity resources, crop rotation, mixed cropping and the practice of conservation agriculture are discussed as solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional agricultural practices are resilient to climate change and indigenous sustainable food conservation practices like to storing, recycling, and upcycling also helps to conserve and restore natural resources. However, the authors also revealed that if these indigenous innovations are not utilized to their full potential, they will be less helpful in today’s society (Sung, 2017 ). The scholarship in this critical area is evolving quite rapidly, but the staggered nature of the findings points towards an early need for synthetization and agenda-setting. In fact, several critical areas are still under-researched, including the unique motivations, problems, preferences, and advantages that all stakeholders (e.g., government, public and private-sector organizations, and people) will encounter. There is also a need to create awareness of and advertise the benefits of natural resource utilization; document the participation of the private sector in conservation efforts; and provide a framework for integrating natural resource management into the larger sustainable development agenda. To address this gap, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature in order to examine how digital technologies are used to effectively utilize natural resources, propose a conceptual framework for integrating natural resource management with the SDGs, and finally offer broad level implications for researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders beyond individual studies. To meet these objectives, we used an integrated review technique comprising of mechanical analysis and manual interpretation of 138 publications from the SCOPUS database. The findings identify the most influential articles, and sources on the subject based on their publication, citation, and importance to the intellectual network; additionally, the study sheds light on the subject's intellectual structure (thematic analysis), which is supported by seven major clusters focusing on ‘water resource management,’ ‘environmental impact,’ ‘economic and social impact,’ ‘technological innovation and digitalization,’ ‘circular economy,’ ‘alternative energy resources,’ and ‘energy resource management’ (Mahendru et al., 2022 ). We also conducted an inductive analysis and developed aggregate dimensions from the study's core subjects and themes using keyword co-occurrence and thematic analysis, which led to the establishment of a conceptual framework for the integration of natural resource utilization and SDGs (Thomas and Tee, 2022 ). A conceptual framework, according to Hulland and Houston (2020) , facilitates in the integration of inductively detected themes. Our conceptual framework, in particular, synthesizes how innovation, digitalization, and technology transfer and diffusion contribute in resource management and its sustainable utilization, ultimately contributing to the accomplishment of SDGs. Since resources are primarily restricted and finite, humankind must employ approaches that allow for the efficient and long-term utilization of the environment's available resources (United Nations Environment Program, 2015 ). Therefore, sustainable development becomes a strategy for ensuring the continued and long-term use of resources. Approximately half of the SDGs are directly environmental in nature or concern natural resource sustainability. With this in mind, our research focuses on affordable and clean energy (Goal-7), responsible consumption and production (Goal-12), climate action (Goal-13), life below water (Goal-14), life below land (Goal-15), and industry, innovation, and infrastructure (Goal-9) (see section 4 ). The paper is also organized as follows. The subsequent section discusses the study’s methodology, which is followed by results and findings (thematic evolution) in section 3 . Section 4  discusses the conceptual framework for future research directions, and Section 5  concludes the study along with its theoretical and public policy implications.  2 Review strategy Literature reviews can take many forms, and each method has the potential to add to theory in a distinctive way (Fan et al., 2022 ). A narrative review is an informal process of reviewing literature that is based on incremental knowledge expansion (Jones and Gatrell, 2014 ), whereas a systematic literature review (SLR) is an approach that identifies, analyzes, and interprets all available evidence related to a specific research question in an unbiased and replicable manner (Yadav and Bansal, 2021 ). Meta-analysis is another review strategy that incorporates information from several research to evaluate the effect magnitude of a specific group of connections (Elsbach and Van Knippenberg, 2018 ). Finally, there is an integrative review. We used a two-level analytical approach that included bibliometric analysis and an integrative literature review since these approaches are more suited to assess an emerging research subject (Rialti et al., 2019 ). The integrated review aims to solve some of the weaknesses of narrative techniques by conducting a more systematic literature search. Thus, integrative reviews aim to evaluate, critique, and synthesize "representative" literature in order to produce new theoretical frameworks and viewpoints (Cronin and George, 2020 ; Torraco, 2016 ). Furthermore, it allows for more effective compliance with systematic review standards, which are based on a replicable, systematic, and transparent process (Kraus et al., 2020 ) (see Fig. 2 ). 2.1 Data collection protocol We constructed our dataset by searching, selecting, and uploading bibliographic references, which allows other researchers to replicate, update, or duplicate the methodology in other reviews. This technique is made up of several steps (see Fig. 3  for the summary). First, we acquired bibliographic data by ensuring thorough coverage of natural resources and technical research. There are numerous data access sources, such as Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Google Scholar; however, in this study, we used data from journals indexed primarily in the SCOPUS database, because using other databases concurrently is unproductive owing to record duplication (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016 ). Then, a search was conducted for all articles and reviews published up to June 2022 that contained search terms relating to natural resources and technology. Previous relevant reviews were used to identify search terms. The search produced a dataset of 536 documents. On June 28, 2020, the search was concluded. The data were then narrowed based on document type (articles and reviews), English language, and appropriate subject areas (environmental science, energy, social sciences, business, management, and accounting, economics, econometrics, and finance). Finally, we refined the dataset by removing publications that did not pertain to natural resources and technology. The primary exclusion criterion was the articles that use any of the natural resource words used in the search criteria and technology in their title abstract or keywords but show no interrelationship between both categories when full-text articles are analyzed. This technique resulted in a total of 143 articles in the final dataset.  2.2 Publication output and growth trend Fig. 1     highlights the study's field's year-to-year publication and citation trends. The statistics show that interest in this subject of study has grown year after year. From one article in 1974 to 19 in 2021 and 8 in 2022 (July). Recent technology advancements have heightened scholarly interest in the topic of natural resource utilization (NRU) in the digital era. With a total of 2625 citation records, 2022 is the year with the most citation records. Although the use of mobile devices, satellites, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) in NRM is still in its early stages. However, a growing body of evidence has emerged over the last decade demonstrating how these technologies can bring incremental, and sometimes transformational, improvements to the way organizations fight climate change, reduce biodiversity loss, and optimize nature's contribution to resilient livelihoods. This continuous attention shows that this topic is still important and that researchers can still address numerous gaps.  2.3 Data analysis The initial step of the study provided us with a descriptive overview of the field, including the publishing and growth trend, source impact, country collaboration, and dataset co-citation analysis. Following that, we independently analyzed all 143 articles to identify research themes in the literature with the goal of establishing a theoretical and domain-based framework for natural resources and technology-based research. The specific research subjects addressed in the publications are described in further detail below as part of our study (see section 3 ). After identifying the thematic clusters, all publications included in each cluster were extensively studied with the goal of identifying their most noteworthy contributions, as well as the key research methodologies and theoretical perspectives used. According to (Alayo et al., 2022 ), the results of the bibliometric analysis should be interpreted and supplemented by extensive reading, because a literature review allows us to deepen the main findings of bibliometrics by providing valuable information about key dimensions of the research, identifying research gaps, and speculating about the field's future development. As a result, the research themes were divided into seven broad categories. Finally, we compiled these themes based on the research topics to offer a domain-based framework for the study.   3 Thematic evolution Fig. 3  depicts thematic map consists of 41 keywords and 7 themes. For a period of 48 years, topic of digitalization has been evolved. We have manually reviewed the literature and divided it on the basis of four themes namely, motor, basic, niche and emerging/declining themes. The degree to which a theme connects to other themes is indicated by centrality, while the number of internal links within the themes is represented by density. The prominent seven themes have been distributed among four quadrants on the basis of development and relevance. The green cluster forms ‘water resource management’, blue and orange clusters form ‘environmental impact’, ‘energy resource management’ and ‘economic and social impact’, violet cluster forms ‘alternative energy resources’, brown cluster forms ‘technological innovation and digitalization’, and red cluster forms ‘circular economy’. Motor themes dominate the quadrant with the highest centrality and density. High density and low centrality represent niche themes. The low density/low centrality quadrant incorporates emerging themes. The fundamental themes are focused on having a high centrality and a low density (Murgado-Armenteros et al., 2015 ). Based on the thematic map (Fig. 3 ) and seven prominent themes, keyword co-occurrence (Fig. 4  ) has been formulated. Keyword co-occurrence refers to the common existence, frequency of recurrence, and close proximity of similar keywords found in many research (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017 ). Each node in the keyword co-occurrence network represents a potential search phrase, and the edges reflect co-occurrences of two terms in the study's title, abstract, or tagged keywords (Grames et al., 2019 ). There are six clusters in the diagram. The green cluster forms ‘water resource management’, blue and orange clusters form ‘environmental impact’, ‘energy resource management’ and ‘economic and social impact’, violet cluster forms ‘alternative energy resources’, brown cluster forms ‘technological innovation and digitalization’, and red cluster forms ‘circular economy’(Figs. 3 and 4 ). The largest cluster depicts the inter-relations of ‘water management’ with ‘water resources’ (Xiao and Hu, 2017 ). The second most significant cluster represents the connections between ‘sustainability’, ‘water quality’ and ‘economic growth’ (Issaoui et al., 2022 ). The third most significant cluster indicates inter-connectedness between ‘environmental technology’ and ‘global warming’ (Z. Chen et al., 2021 ). Fig. 5   depicts the framework of Inductive analysis (Thomas and Tee, 2022 ). This is the extended version of Thematic map (Fig. 3 ) in which the main themes are shown by 2nd order themes, sub-themes are shown by 1st order concepts. By clubbing different themes, aggregate dimensions have been found out. There are 4 aggregate dimensions. Resource management  is the first aggregate dimension that has been discovered through clubbing of ‘water resource management’ and ‘energy resource management’. Being the motor theme, water resource management has high centrality as well as high density. Extant literature reveals that industrial water treatment, water conservation, ground water, rain water harvesting, sewage treatment, and effluent treatment have high internal links with each other. Xiao and Hu (2017)  states that the structure of water consumption is inextricably tied to economic development. Because utilization structure influences water consumption, addressing it is the first step in managing water use and preventing water shortages. Industrial water treatment is necessary to maintain the ground water level and conserve water in a sustainable manner (Issaoui et al., 2022 ). Being the basic theme, energy resource management has high centrality but low density. This depicts that resource scarcity, energy planning and policy, resource depletion, and resource consumption have internally developed so far. Lieberei and Gheewala (2017)  states that mineral resource depletion is accelerated by renewable energy technologies that utilize renewable energy flows such as wind and solar energy. Energy planning and policy is important for sustainable resource consumption in the era of resource scarcity (He et al., 2021 ). Innovation and digitalization  are the second aggregate dimension that has been identified through clubbing of ‘economic and social impact’ and ‘technological innovation and digitalization’. It has high centrality but moderate density due to its position in the quadrants of basic and motor themes. Previous literature indicates that cost-benefit analysis, industrial development, R&D (Research and Development), and community empowerment are major keywords that have strongly evolved internally, but linkages among these keywords have not been noticed considerably. Community empowerment serves to bridge the knowledge gap among individuals (particularly, scholars); thus, further research and development in this area is required to discover the subsequent economic and social impact (Sianipar, 2022 ). Being the basic theme, technological innovation and digitalization has high centrality but low density. Artificial intelligence, resource-saving technologies, reverse osmosis, operations technology, agricultural robots, desalination, and chemical analysis are the significant keywords comprising this theme. Gupta et al. (2020a)  states that artificial intelligence promoted the inventiveness of operations technology, resulting in the use of agricultural robots in resource management. Technology transfer and diffusion  is the third aggregate dimension through the combination of ‘technological innovation and digitalization’ and ‘alternative energy resources’. Being a niche theme, alternative energy resources come under the quadrant of high density as well as low centrality. The prominent keywords under this theme are wind energy, solar energy, petroleum and coal deposits, natural gas, soil conservation, and geothermal energy. Previous research indicates that the sub-themes have developed significantly but the inter-linkages between them have not evolved much. Yu et al. (2021a)  states that how global energy supplies, environmental problems and transitions, and natural gas hazards interact to have a possible environmental influence on climate change mitigation. Alkhasov, Alkhasova, Ramazanov and Kasparova (2017)  states that geothermal energy has facilitated the development of energy-efficient advanced technologies. Sustainable natural resource utilization  is the fourth important aggregate dimension discovered by clubbing ‘environmental impact’ and ‘circular economy’. Being a motor theme, environmental impact comes under the quadrant of high density as well as high centrality. Global warming, greenhouse effect, climate change, alternative energy, emission control, ecotoxicity, and environment regulation are the major keywords that have been utilized collectively in the literature, and their respective sub-themes have been established accordingly. Z. Chen et al. (2021)  states that there is a positive relationship between global warming and the greenhouse effect, catering to the requirement for energy conservation in the case of environmental control. Climate change is influenced by alternative energy, which leads to energy planning and efficiency (Pourmoosavi et al., 2021 ). Being an emerging theme, circular economy comes under the quadrant of low centrality as well as low density. The notable keywords comprising this theme are sustainable development, ecology, industrial investments, recycling, e-waste, lifecycle assessment, and sustainable development goals. Sustainable resource consumption contributes to the achievement of sustainable development goals in the circular economy, and rising economies, with the assistance of Industry 4.0, transform the scenario into a sharing economy (Chiappetta Jabbour et al., 2020 ).  4 Conceptual framework for future research agendas Fig. 6   shows a conceptual framework based on the Thematic map (Fig. 3 ) and Inductive Analysis (Fig. 5 ). The concept of aggregate dimensions has been carried forward to elaboratively discuss on the conceptual framework (Thomas and Tee, 2022 ). The problem arises with the environmental degradation Wang et al. (2021)  when pollution started arising as an alarming situation and resource conservation found to be the main agenda. The journey from environmental degradation to sustainable development has shifted along a number of aggregate dimensions. Resource management is the first factor in this pathway to achieve Responsible Consumption and Production  (Sustainable Development Goal-12), Affordable and Clean Energy  (Sustainable Development Goal-7) and Life Below Water  (Sustainable Development Goal-14). Resource management aims to ensure sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources by 2030, as measured by material footprint and domestic material consumption (Hoballah and Averous, 2015 ). The ultimate goal of water resource conservation is to protect and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development (Huck, 2022a ). By 2030, energy infrastructure and sustainable energy technology have fostered international collaboration (Huck, 2022c ). Effluent discharge demonstrates the necessity of installing a proper wastewater treatment facility that supports the ongoing production of safe and clean drinking water (Abu Hasan et al., 2020 ). Innovation and digitalization is the second significant factor to achieve Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure  (Sustainable Development Goal-9). By encouraging inclusive and sustainable industrialization by 2030, which will greatly increase industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, social change will be promoted by digitalization and industry development (Faremo, 2015 ). Community empowerment on the edge of digitalization has the potential to have a social impact, and resource-saving technology will assist developing nations in encouraging innovation for industrial growth (Issaoui et al., 2022 ; Sianipar, 2022 ). Technology transfer and diffusion is the third important factor to achieve Life on Land  (Sustainable Development Goal-15). To conserve soil and biodiversity, land resources are protected, restored, and promoted for long-term usage (Huck, 2022b ). The notion of technology transfer is becoming increasingly important in the era of safeguarding land resources and determining the potential of alternative energy resources to disseminate expertise in a certain(be it geothermal energy, natural gas etc.) sector (Adero et al., 2020 ). The fourth prominent aggregate dimension is sustainable natural resource utilization to achieve Climate Action  (Sustainable Development Goal-13). Climate change indicators may be integrated into national policies, strategies, and planning through long-term strategies, national adaptation plans, and adaptation communications, as well as total annual greenhouse gas emissions (Figueres, 2015 ). Global warming and ecotoxicity are one of the alarming situations where sustainability feels the question mark. Global climatic and economic shifts are the outcome of escalating major issues in the food-energy-water basket (Miao and Khanna, 2020 ). Energy Policy  is the connecting point among all the aggregate dimensions. In order to address climate change challenges, it is necessary to use indigenous knowledge and technology due to the limitations of traditional climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. Due to this, we must implement an appropriate energy policy to address the issue of environmental deterioration (Imoro et al., 2021a ). 4.1 Future research agendas This study aims to conduct a two-level analytical approach of the existing literature in order to examine how digital technologies are used to effectively utilize natural resources, propose a conceptual framework for integrating natural resource management with the SDGs, and finally offer broad level implications for researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders beyond individual studies. Future research agendas (Table 1  ) have been divided among four notable aggregate dimensions (Fig. 5 ). Under ‘resource management’, more studies are needed on resource scarcity to understand the problem of managing resources in a sustainable manner. Literature on energy planning and policy needs to be enhanced to utilize natural resources in the era of digitalization (Pourmoosavi et al., 2021 ). Relatively, future scholars must take into account the development of these sub-themes in a utilized format to combat the gaps in the previous literature. More research in the field of cost-benefit analysis is needed under ‘innovation and digitalization,’ as digitalization increases the cost of maintenance (Nadal et al., 2013 ). However, if the advantages outweigh the costs, innovation and societal change can coexist. Because economic and social impact fall between the basic and motor theme, there is a need to enhance the research and development field to improve the methodological aspect of developing industrial sustainability. Another aspect of this significant dimension is that the future scholars should consider the collaborations among artificial intelligence and chemical analysis to identify the future prospects of AI in chemical analysis of natural resources (Zhao et al., 2021 ). Being the part of the basic theme, the sub-themes of technological innovation and digitalization have less collaborations with their respective sub-themes. Previous literature opened the door for future researchers on the collaboration of operations technology and desalination. Under ‘technology transfer and diffusion’, lack of studies has shown in the field of wind energy and soil conservation collaboratively. Water is the most notable natural resource on which most studies have been conducted, according to existing literature. Alternative energy resources, on the other hand, that can also develop to a large extent to shift the picture from water to geothermal energy and solar energy, must be explored by prospective scholars. To reap the most benefits from the digital world, technological innovation must be diffused and transferred (Jin et al., 2019 ). Policymakers must address the potential in technological innovation research and its subsequent dissemination. ‘Sustainable natural resource utilization’ has one motor theme (environmental impact) and one emerging theme (circular economy). The development of the subthemes under environmental effect reflects the potential in this area. However, in order to use natural resources sustainably, life cycle assessment must evolve in several aspects and emerge as a standalone issue to comprehend how examining the life cycle of a given natural resource might be connected to achieving sustainable development goals (Madhu et al., 2021a ). On the other hand, research on the cooperation of ecology, life cycle assessment, and e-waste are limited. Future researchers and practitioners shall analyze these particular issues and collaborate to create notable studies in order to attain sustainability.   5 Conclusion and policy implications The paper has reviewed the evolution of the area of natural resources over the past four decades and its growing significance in the age of digitalization. Human health and well-being are closely linked to the environment, which includes clean air, water, land, and energy. This relates to wider public health policy challenges. Industrial energy’s greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change. United Nations (2022)  outlines areas requiring immediate action to save the SDGs and achieve significant progress for people and the world by 2030. The planet's growing reliance on natural resources has set it on an unsustainable course. Reduced pressure would need more natural resource efficiency, circularity initiatives, and dematerialize economic growth. Diffusion of invention theory has come to the rescue since creation cannot be contained in a black box with no ideas or perspectives from varied practitioners. To minimize the efficiency gap and identify the root reasons of investment inefficiency, innovation must be widely spread (Diaz-Rainey and Ashton, 2015 ). Despite increased empirical evidence that digital technology can improve natural resource consumption and management, the findings remain fragmented. We identified very few review articles in our database. An integrated review technique and bibliometric analysis helped to identify the most influential articles, and sources on the subject based on their publication, citation, and importance to the intellectual network; the study also sheds light on the subject’s intellectual structure (thematic analysis), which is supported by seven major clusters focusing on ‘water resource management,’ ‘environmental impact,’ ‘economic and social impact,’ ‘innovation and digitalization,’ ‘circular economy,’ ‘alternative energy resources,’ and ‘energy resource management’. We also conducted an inductive analysis and developed aggregate dimensions from the study’s primary issues and themes using keyword co-occurrence and thematic analysis, resulting in a conceptual framework for integrating natural resource usage and SDGs. Our paper provides a conceptual framework for integrating natural resource management with the Sustainable Development Goals and contributes to the portion of review articles that examines the use of digital technology to sustainably utilize natural resources. Humanity must use limited and finite resources efficiently and sustainably (United Nations Environment Program, 2015 ). Sustainable development ensures long-term resource usage. Half of the SDGs are environmental or involve natural resource sustainability. Our research focuses on cheap, clean energy (Goal-7), responsible consumption and production (Goal-12), climate action (Goal-13), life below water (Goal-14), life below land (Goal-15), and industry, innovation, and infrastructure (Goal-9) (see section 4 ). The findings of this study have significant policy implications. Programs like drip irrigation require government backing since there are concerns about not just how these programs have been suggested but also how their implementation processes and strategies are carried out (Sampedro-Sanchez, 2022 ). With the advent of digitalization, rural locations may now more easily create and regulate assistance programs. From the perspective of a stakeholder, environmental degradation is one of the key problems to address in order to reduce the harmful effects of environmental pollution as new illnesses start to appear as we enter the period of experimentation and expansion. The promotion of economic development shouldn't come at the expense of economic carelessness. From the viewpoint of an investor, ecologically acceptable technology should be catered to as rural areas are deprived of development due to a lack of investment (Sianipar, 2022 ). As eco-innovation has the potential to harness natural resources in the age of digitization, investors should prioritize investments for the betterment of society, as well (Diaz-Rainey and Ashton, 2015 ). Future scholars can employ other databases such as web of science and Google Scholar, as well. Covid-19 has not regarded as an important setback for developing results. However, future researches may include the effect of pandemic on utilizing natural resources in the digital economy. Future research in the domain of alternative energy resources (Fig. 3 ) and their economic and social effects can be conducted to address the issues of water scarcity and wastewater treatment, both of which can be solved by using alternative energy resources.
