                  The paper deals with an immensely important and topical issue related to the implementation of sustainable development policies at the regional level. It focuses on assessing the level of sustainability in building stable infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation between 2015 and 2021 at the regional level in Poland. The areas included in the assessment relate to Goal 9 of the UN Agenda 2030 adopted by member states. The basis for the assessment was a developed research methodology based on a selected set of 19 indicators characterizing the development of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure at the regional level. The research covered 16 regions (provinces) in Poland from 2015 to 2021. In addition to determining the dynamics of change of individual indicators, characterizing the rate of change of the sustainable economy in these 16 regions, their ranking was created, reflecting the status of implementation of Goal 9 of the Agenda. The ranking was made using the developed new approach to analyzing a multi-criteria problem based on the MCDM methodology. The CODAS and CoCoSo methods and the Laplace criterion were used to determine the final value of the index for assessing the level of sustainable development of regions. Meanwhile, the values of the indicator weights were determined based on the Shannon Entropy and CRITIC methods and the aforementioned criterion. The determined index values formed the basis for making a ranking of the studied regions and assessing their level of development. The result of this process was their division into four classes differing in the level of achievement of Goal 9 of the Agenda. With the use of non-parametric tests (Kendall's Rank and Spearman Rank), an evaluation was carried out of the relationship between the values of the determined index and selected economic and social parameters characterizing the studied regions between 2015 and 2021. The results show that Poland is highly differentiated both temporally and spatially at the regional level. Throughout the entire analyzed period, the high level of development in the assessed scope was reported for the Masovia, Lower Silesia and Pomerania provinces, and the low level – for the Holy Cross Province. The results also confirm the relationship between a high degree of innovation, industrialization and stable infrastructure and economic development and living standards. The results show regions that need a decision on their nature and the role they are to play in the national and European economy.

The paper deals with an immensely important and topical issue related to the implementation of sustainable development policies at the regional level. It focuses on assessing the level of sustainability in building stable infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation between 2015 and 2021 at the regional level in Poland. The areas included in the assessment relate to Goal 9 of the UN Agenda 2030 adopted by member states. The basis for the assessment was a developed research methodology based on a selected set of 19 indicators characterizing the development of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure at the regional level. The research covered 16 regions (provinces) in Poland from 2015 to 2021. In addition to determining the dynamics of change of individual indicators, characterizing the rate of change of the sustainable economy in these 16 regions, their ranking was created, reflecting the status of implementation of Goal 9 of the Agenda. The ranking was made using the developed new approach to analyzing a multi-criteria problem based on the MCDM methodology. The CODAS and CoCoSo methods and the Laplace criterion were used to determine the final value of the index for assessing the level of sustainable development of regions. Meanwhile, the values of the indicator weights were determined based on the Shannon Entropy and CRITIC methods and the aforementioned criterion. The determined index values formed the basis for making a ranking of the studied regions and assessing their level of development. The result of this process was their division into four classes differing in the level of achievement of Goal 9 of the Agenda. With the use of non-parametric tests (Kendall's Rank and Spearman Rank), an evaluation was carried out of the relationship between the values of the determined index and selected economic and social parameters characterizing the studied regions between 2015 and 2021. The results show that Poland is highly differentiated both temporally and spatially at the regional level. Throughout the entire analyzed period, the high level of development in the assessed scope was reported for the Masovia, Lower Silesia and Pomerania provinces, and the low level – for the Holy Cross Province. The results also confirm the relationship between a high degree of innovation, industrialization and stable infrastructure and economic development and living standards. The results show regions that need a decision on their nature and the role they are to play in the national and European economy.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals are intended to help countries strive for sustainable economic and social growth and protect the environment from negative changes resulting from this development (United Nations, n.d. ; Sustainable Development Goals , n.d. ). All of these goals are interrelated, and progress toward one goal is best achieved in conjunction with progress toward others (Sani and Scholz, 2021 ). One of the most important goals of Agenda 2030 is Goal 9, which is “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.” Since its implementation should create favorable conditions for the implementation of the other sustainable goals, its relevance and importance for the entire Agenda is very important. Sustainable industrial development, taking into account economic inclusion of this process, need to include the participation of all citizens who should benefit from its effects. This, in turn, should help increase income and improve the living standards of communities with environmental considerations. Today, the implementation of such processes requires the development of an innovative knowledge-based economy. Developing innovative environmentally friendly technologies and improving energy and material efficiency are also key factors. Productivity and income growth, improved health care and better education are, in turn, highly dependent on investment in modern infrastructure. It is also obvious that economic, social climate-sensitive development without modern technologies and innovative solutions will be very difficult. Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 can therefore be seen as one that is intended to create favorable conditions for the future development of civilization as a whole. Its task is to build a modern and sustainable industry to be the main engine for job creation and economic growth, as well as for the transfer of technology, investment flows and development of competencies necessary for the implementation of the sustainable development process, and at all levels of activity. Despite the importance of the issues included in Sustainable Development Goal 9, relatively little attention has been paid to evaluating its implementation in academic works. The exceptions are several papers (Saieed et al., 2021 ; Szopik-Depczyńska et al., 2018 ). In the first of these (Saieed et al., 2021 ), the authors presented an indicator developed to assess progress in achieving Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 at the national level or groups of countries. By contrast, another paper (Szopik-Depczyńska et al., 2018 ) presents the results of an assessment of EU countries in terms of innovative development, one part of the issues included in Goal 9 of Agenda 2030. Most of the studies related to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals deals with economic (Bennich et al., 2021 ; El Wali et al., 2021 ), energy and climate (Bekun et al., 2021 ; Brodny and Tutak, 2023 ; Włodarczyk et al., 2021 ; Adenle, 2020 ), environmental (Arora and Mishra, 2019 ), as well as social (Tan et al., 2018 ; Ruiz-Mallén and Heras, 2020 ; Owens, 2017 ) issues, the most important areas of the concept. However, they do not directly address Goal 9 of Agenda 2030, which is a gap in the scope of the research presented. This is because sustainable development is only possible in countries with very good and stable infrastructure and with sustainable development of innovative industries. Thus, linking the issue of sustainable economy with Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 is most reasonable and expected. In addition, the reference of this issue to the regional level, where, in fact, the operational implementation of related tasks takes place, can be treated as an expected and legitimate research direction. The implementation of solutions covered by this objective, should be considered very broadly, as reflected in the growing number of studies devoted to the importance of regions in the implementation and realization of sustainable development goals (Rahma et al., 2019 ). Achieving these goals at the regional level has a number of advantages, the significant of which is their integration with the principles of regional development and planning (Bakri et al., 2018 ). Indeed, sustainable regional development can be defined as “the integration of sustainable development principles into the practice of regional development” (Clement et al., 2003 ). From the point of view of prosperity, SDG refers to development that ensures that the region's population achieves an acceptable level of prosperity both in the present and in the future (Malik and Ciesielka, 2011 ; Jovovic et al., 2017 ; Streimikiene, 2014 ). Thus, it can be seen that sustainability should be more broadly linked to regional economic, social and climate parameters. The social factor is particularly important in this case, as without local and regional public support, it is difficult to introduce significant economic and climate changes, which very often disrupt the functioning order. Therefore, taking into account the role and importance of Goal 9 of the Agenda for the sustainable development of the world economy, treated as the sum of regional achievements in this regard, a study was carried out, based on the developed methodology and concerning the implementation of this Goal in the regions (provinces) in Poland. This is because it was assumed that the assumptions of central (national, European, global) concepts and ideas should primarily be achieved at the regional level. This applies to all sustainable development and Goal 9 of Agenda 2030. Achieving success in this regard will only be possible with support and public acceptance at the regional level, that is, where innovative solutions are actually implemented. Success at this level should, in turn, transfer very positively to the entire national economy, the European Union and, further, the world economy. They should also provide examples from which other regions, countries and their groups can benefit. It focuses on assessing the level of sustainability in building stable infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation between 2015 and 2021 at the regional level in Poland. It was also important to determine the degree of differentiation of sustainable development in different regions of Poland, as one of the larger countries of the EU. The EU pays a great deal of attention to regional development, which aims to integrate and equalize the level of development. Regional policy is a very important factor in the development of the EU as a whole. This makes the approach presented in the work even more legitimate and in line with the most expected areas of EU activity (Cohesion Policy legislation 2021-2027 , n.d. ). Taking into account the validity and relevance of the subject matter undertaken, the following two research questions were formulated, to which the study provided answers:RQ1:  Is there temporal and spatial variation in the implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 in Poland by regions (provinces)?  RQ2:  Is there a correlation between the value of the index for assessing the implementation of Goal 9 of the Agenda, in the Polish provinces (regions), and their level of economic and social development characterized by selected economic and social parameters?    In order to obtain answers to the questions posed, a research methodology was developed based on selected indicators that characterize the studied regions in terms of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure (in the context of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030) and the analytical methods used. A set of 19 indicators that were characterized by relevance to Sustainable Development Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 were used for the primary research. The weights of these indicators were determined using the following methods: CRITIC and Shanon-Entropy and the Laplace criterion. Since the problem addressed in the paper is multi-criteria, two methods from the MCDM group, namely CODAS and CoCoSo, and the Laplace criterion, were used to determine the level of sustainability in building stable infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. The choice of methods for analyzing a multidimensional problem, which is undoubtedly the topic addressed, is not a simple process. In the case studied, it was assumed that the use of two different methods would yield reliable results. In turn, two non-parametric tests, such as Tau Kendall and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between the level of achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 9 and selected economic and social parameters. The research conducted and the results obtained represent a new approach to studying and evaluating the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 9 at the regional level. The main factors confirming the originality of the conducted research can be taken as:– filling the research gap in assessing the level of achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 9 at the regional level of one EU country,  – determining a relationship between the level of achievement of this Goal and selected economic and social parameters of the studied regions,  – developing a universal approach, in the form of a new research methodology for assessing the level of achievement of sustainable development goals under the uncertainty of choosing an appropriate MCDM-type method, allowing a transparent and unambiguous comparative assessment of studied objects (regions, countries), taking into account multiple factors.    The presented motivation for undertaking the presented topic and the research questions posed, as well as the identified factors indicating the originality of this research fully justify this choice. This is because assessing the level of sustainable development in terms of building stable infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation at the regional level is extremely important for this development at the national level. Therefore, this more detailed approach provides an opportunity to assess and make changes at the regional level, which is crucial for assessing the national level.  2 Literature studies In 2015, 193 United Nations member countries signed an agreement for joint efforts to pursue sustainable development and address the social, economic and environmental problems occurring in these countries referred to as the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (United Nations, n.d. ; Sustainable Development Goals , n.d. ). This Agenda defines 17 major sustainable development goals and 169 sub-goals that should be achieved by 2030. Since the enactment of this Agenda, its goals and assumptions have become the subject of many research papers. The main focus of this work was on the implementation and progress of these goals, in different regions of the world. The topics of greatest interest are those devoted to energy, climate, environmental and social goals. In addition, the literature is dominated by assessments of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals at the national level or groups of countries, which are compared among themselves (D'Adamo et al., 2022 ; Çağlar and Gürler, 2022 ; Dello Strologo et al., 2021 ; Stanujkic et al., 2020 ). The issue of assessing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the regional level has been addressed in relatively few works, using different methodological approaches. For example, in one paper (Nagy et al., 2018 ), the authors evaluated the implementation of the 16 Sustainable Development Goals for metropolises located in Romania. For the evaluation, they developed a composite index based on simple arithmetic mean aggregation and the Min-Max data standardization method. The results for each local metropolitan area were then transformed into a spatial representation using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Salvati and Carlucci (2014) , on the other hand, developed a composite index to assess the level of sustainability at the micro level, i.e., at the level of municipalities. They used a set of 99 indicators and principal component analysis (PCA) to rank municipalities according to a composite sustainability index. The approach presented is relatively easy to implement using the PCA method and allows identification of regional differences in sustainability. On the other hand, the problem is access to such a large amount of reliable data (indicators) for evaluation, especially in developing countries. And Kawakubo et al. (2017)  proposed a modified version of a tool, the so-called CASBEE-City (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency), developed to assess and monitor the levels of sustainability achieved in municipalities and cities around the world under the SDG indicators. The tool was applied in 79 urban areas from 39 countries. The results reflect the better performance of well-developed urban areas in terms of quality of life and lower in terms of environmental burden. Liang et al. (2017)  evaluated the realization of regional sustainable development goals in Sichuan Province using a proprietary index that was based on information entropy and the Brusselator principle. This indicator consisted of 46 sub-indicators, representing economic, social and environmental aspects of regional development. The system of these indicators makes it possible to assess the sustainability of regional development on an annual basis. An index of sustainable regional development consisting of 29 sub-indices, developed based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method for describing the spatial and temporal characteristics of this development is presented in another paper (Li et al., 2018 ). The results of this research were used to assess the level of sustainable development at the provincial and municipal levels along the Yangtze River-Economic Belt. The results of assessing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the local level in China are presented in another paper (Wang et al., 2020 ). To achieve this goal, the authors developed a sustainability index, which is the arithmetic average of the values of 52 standardized indicators included in the assessment (such as Poverty headcount ratio, Access to improved, sanitary toilet in rural areas, R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP). The authors used it to assess provincial sustainability. The results showed that the state in China is characterized by great diversity and distinct geographic zones. Eastern provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have the highest scores on the China SDG Index. By contrast, western provinces, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi, have the lowest scores. In turn, Alaimo and Maggino (2020)  assessed the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals for Italian regions. The process of evaluating these goals was carried out based on the adjusted Mazziotta-Pareto index. Puertas and Marti made a regional analysis of the sustainable development of two Mediterranean countries: Spain and Italy (Puertas and Martí, 2023 ). The purpose of their study was to determine whether the achievement of the designated sustainable development goals in the regions of these countries is homogeneous or the opposite. The results indicate that some regions are underperforming and require special treatment. On the other hand, only in the dimensions of People (Sustainable Development Goals: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and Well-being (Sustainable Development Goals: 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) the desired territorial homogeneity was achieved. In turn, another paper (Shevchuk et al., 2023 ) presented the results of a study aimed at determining the impact of crisis factors (annexation of Crimea and the industrial areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, hostilities in the Donbass, the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and, from 2022, hostilities in Ukraine) in the Ukrainian economy on the sustainable development of the country's regions. The results showed that these factors adversely affect the growth dynamics of gross regional product. There are also large economic disparities between regions and social problems are exacerbated. By contrast, Wen et al. examined the sustainable development of China's provinces in the context of carbon neutrality (Wen et al., 2023 ). The results of their study show that most provinces in China have made progress in their efforts to reduce carbon emissions between 2007 and 2018. The research also showed that the gap between these emissions between provinces has widened, in addition to intra-regional differences. In terms of the implementation of some part of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030, noteworthy is one study (Szopik-Depczyńska et al., 2020 ), in which the authors showed an indicator to compare regions from EU countries in terms of their level of innovation. The procedure for determining the index is based on a multi-criteria taxonomic method. This method assesses the level of innovation of each EU region based on the results obtained in each group of indicators considered. As a result, EU regions can be divided into groups according to their level of innovation in all areas considered, and not just by the average value of their development. The presented review of selected literature items included only those in which the problem of assessing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 9, at the regional level was addressed. An analysis of this work indicates that this problem is relevant and important for the implementation of a sustainable development economy, but also very complex. This complexity, along with the availability of reliable data necessary for this type of analysis, means that it takes a lot of work to undertake. Issues related to the process of analyzing this data are also not easy. The review presented here presents some very interesting solutions in this regard. The process of finding a good analytical tool, in addition to the selection of indicators, is crucial to the quality and interpretation of the results obtained. Therefore, it can be concluded that the topic of evaluating regions in terms of the implementation of Goal 9 is topical, and the method of studying this problem for regions in Poland, presented in the paper, should fill the existing research gap on this issue. The developed methodology also represents a new approach to the study of multi-criteria problems related to the implementation of economic, social, and economic tasks.  3 Research methodology The research presented here uses indicators (data) contained in the Local Data Bank, which is Poland's largest database of economic, social, and environmental data (Local Data Bank , n.d. ). The research was conducted based on a set of 19 indicators relating to the implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 at the regional level (Table 1  ). These indicators characterize the three areas of this Goal, namely innovation, industrialization and infrastructure. The indicators used for the study had to be statistically reliable, official and available, as well as complete for the entire period analyzed, i.e., 2015–2021. Filling the research gap in assessing the level of achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 9 at the regional level of one EU country applies to both time and objects (regions) under study. The study was carried out for 16 regions, corresponding to Poland's administrative and territorial division units, which are provinces (Fig. 1  ). The following criteria were used when selecting indicators for the study:– the necessity of the existence of a substantive link with Goal 9 of the UN Agenda 2030 (possible best reflection of the phenomena related to the implementation of this goal);  – quality, comparability, timeliness and availability of data;  – formal correctness (correctness of indicator construction).    The indicators adopted for the study are in line with the priority goals related to the development and implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 in Poland, as presented in the report (Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in Poland The 2018 National Report , n.d. ). To assess the level of achievement of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 and to determine an index for its evaluation, the author's approach was used, based on MCDM methods and objective methods for determining weights of the adopted indicators with the simultaneous application of the Laplace criterion. This criterion allows decisions to be made under uncertainty as to the choice of appropriate methods for determining indicator weights and an evaluation index. There are many different methods, including MCDM, for determining synthetic indicators. Due to the different computational algorithms used in them, there is a problem of choosing the right method for the study of a given decision-making problem. It is obvious that different results can be obtained from each of such methods. This situation makes the selection of a research method (which allows the determination of a synthetic index – an evaluation measure, an evaluation index) a multi-criteria problem. Taking this fact into account, an author approach was proposed, in which the final value of the evaluation measure was determined based on the results of a minimum of two different methods, such as the MCDM method (there may be more) and based on the Laplace criterion. The proposed approach for determining an index for assessing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 includes the following steps:1) To determine evaluation indicators.  2) To determine weights of these indicators. These weights should be determined by at least two objective methods. In this study, two methods were used to determine them: Shannon Entropy and CRITIC.  3) To determine final weights of the evaluation indicators based on the Laplace criterion, which considers all weight values as equally likely to occur (Srivastava and Rego, 2008 ).  4) To determine an index for assessing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 9 in each region based on at least two different MCDM methods. CODAS and CoCoSo methods were used in this study.  5) To unify index values obtained from the methods used (CODAS and CoCoSo). Unification is carried out according to the zero-unitization Eq. (1) :   (1) As ij  = x ij  − minx ij   maxx ij  − minx ij       6) To determine a final value of the evaluation index (SDG 9   ) for implementing Sustainable Development Goal 9 for each region on the basis of the Laplace criterion, assuming that the index values obtained by each method and the ranking positions determined based on them are equally likely. Index SDG 9    is determined based on the Laplace criterion:(2) SDG 9  = 0 , 5 × H i ∗  + 0 , 5 × k i ∗      is the evaluation index for a given alternative after unitization in the CODAS method, and k i ∗    is the evaluation index after unitization for a given alternative in the CoCoSo method.  7) To determine the level of achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 9 for each region based on the final value of the composite assessment index (determined in Step 5):The division (grouping) of objects (regions) into levels, was based on the value of the mean of the determined index (SDG9) and its standard deviation. In this method (when grouping linearly ordered objects), objects (regions) are divided into groups based on the deviation of the SDG9 index value and its mean value, taking into account the values of these deviations. The set of studied objects (regions) is divided into four groups, containing objects with SDG9 index values belonging to the following four classes:Class I – high level – development leader         (3) SDG 9  ≥ SDG 9  ¯  + s SDG 9      Class II – medium-high level – strong development:   (4) SDG 9  ¯  + s SDG 9   > SDG 9  ≥ SDG 9  ¯     Class III – medium low level – moderate development:   (5) SDG 9  ¯  > SDG 9  ≥ SDG 9  ¯  − s SDG 9      Class IV – low level – poor development:(6) SDG 9  < SDG 9  ¯  − s SDG 9       where: SDG 9    is the index of achievement of the UN Agenda 2030 Goal 9 for the provinces, SDG 9  ¯    is the average value of the index for Polish provinces, s SDG 9     is the standard deviation from the average value of the index SDG 9 .        In the following sections, the analytical tools used in the developed methodology are discussed in a synthetic manner. 3.1 The Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method The CRITIC method was proposed by Diakoulaki, and its analytical approach allows the use of all the information contained in the criteria being evaluated (Diakoulaki et al., 1995 ). This method makes it possible to determine objective values for the weights of indicators, taking into account the intensity of contrast and conflict contained in the decision problem under consideration. The weighting values are obtained by quantifying the inside information for each evaluation criterion. This technique uses the standard deviation values of the indicators and the correlations determined between them (Rostamzadeh et al., 2018 ; Abdel-Basset and Mohamed, 2020 ; Čereška et al., 2016 ; Paradowski et al., 1874 ). To determine the objective weight of an indicator (evaluation criterion) using the CRITIC method, the following procedure is adopted:1) To create a decision matrix:   (7) X = x ij   m × n   = x 11   ⋯  x 1 m .     ⋯  ⋯  ⋯   x n 1    ⋯  x nm         2) To normalize the decision matrix:   (8) r ij  = x ij  − x j min   x j max  − x j min     for stimulants    (9) r ij  = x j max  − x ij   x j max  − x j min     for destimulants    3) To determine standard deviation values for evaluation indicators after their normalization:   (10) SD = ∑ i = 1  n  x i  − x ¯     n − 1       4) To determine correlation coefficients between the evaluation indicators of the normalized decision matrix:   (11) r jk  = ∑ i = 1  n  x ij  − x ¯  j    x ik  − x ¯  k     ∑ i = 1  n  x ij  − x ¯  j    2  ∑ i = 1  n  x ik  − x ¯  k    2        5) To calculate the weight of the evaluation criteria (indicators):(12) w ij  = C j  ∑ i = 1  n  C j        where: C j   is the amount of information contained in the j -th criterion, SD  is the standard deviation of the j -th criterion, and r jk   is the correlation coefficient calculated for the j -th and k -th criteria     3.2 The Shannon-Entropy method The Shannon Entropy method is a method for determining indicator weights (evaluation criteria), which is based on Shannon's theory (Shannon, 1948 ). Entropy evaluates the expected information content of a particular message. The concept of entropy in information theory can be viewed as a criterion for the degree of uncertainty represented by a discrete probability distribution. The idea of entropy can be used effectively in the decision-making process, as it measures existing contrasts between data sets and explains the average internal information provided to the decision-maker (Hwang and Yoon, 1981 ). To determine the objective weight of an indicator (evaluation criterion) using the Entropy method, the following procedure should be used:1) To create a decision matrix (Eq. (7) );  2) To normalize the decision matrix:   (13) p ij  = x ij  ∑ i = 1  m  x ij       3) To calculate the entropy measure of indicators using the following equation:(14) E j  = − k ∑ i = 1  m  p ij  ln p ij      where:   (15) k = 1 ln m       4) To determine the objective weight based on the concept of entropy:   (16) d j  = 1 E j   ∑ j − 1  n  1 E j         5) To determine the weight for each indicator:   (17) w j  = d j  ∑ j − 1  n  d j         3.3 The Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method The Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method is presented in the paper. The method integrates the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS), aggregate simple additive weighting (SAW) and exponentially weighted product (EWP) methods (Yazdani et al., 2019 ). Although the CoCoSo and WASPAS methods have different normalization processes, in the third step of the CoCoSo method, the sum of power weight value (Pi ) is calculated based on the multiplicative property of WASPAS. The CoCoSo method is a decision-making technique based on combinatorial and trade-off perspectives. This method uses the concepts of aggregate simple additive weighting (SAW) and exponentially weighted product (EWP) models, combining the advantages of both. In this way, internal equilibrium can be achieved, which has the advantage of avoiding compensatory decision problems and achieving ultimate utility. In addition, the computational complexity in this method is relatively low. The algorithm for dealing with this method consists of the following steps:1) To create a decision matrix (Eq. (7) );  2) To normalize the decision matrix (Eqs. (8) and (9) )  3) To determine power weight of comparability sequences (P i  ) and the total of weighted comparability sequences (S i  ) for all alternatives:   (18) S i  = ∑ j = 1  n  r ij  w j     (19) P i  = ∑ j = 1  n  r ij w j      4) To determine the performance rating ki, which is calculated from the three aggregated sub-ratings k ia  , k ib   and k ic  , as follows:(20) k i  = 1 3  k ia  k ib  k ic   + k ia  k ib  k ic   1 3       where:(21) k ia  = S i  + P i   ∑ i = 1  m  S i  + P i         (22) k ib  = S i  min i  S i    + P i  min i  P i       (23) k ic  = λ S i  + 1 − λ   P i   λ max i  S i  + 1 − λ   max i  P i        where λ is a coefficient λ∈ [0.1] and most often its value is taken as λ = 0.5 (Chang, 2023 ).  5) To rank alternatives in descending order.     3.4 The COmbinative Distance-Based ASsessment (CODAS) method This method belongs to the group of multi-criteria decision support methods. It uses Euclidean distance as the primary distance and Taxicab distance as the secondary measure, which are calculated according to the negative ideal distance (Keshavarz-Ghorabaee et al., 2016 ; Chen and Gou, 2022 ). If the Euclidean distance of two alternatives is very far apart, then Taxicab distance is not used. On the other hand, when the Euclidean distance of two alternatives is very close to each other, then Taxicab distance is used to compare them. Thus, to perform this process, each pair of alternatives must be compared. The alternative with the greatest distance from the negative ideal distance is the best result. The algorithm for dealing with this method consists of the following steps:1) To create a decision matrix (Eq. (7) );  2) To normalize the decision matrix:   (24) n ij  = x ij  max i  x ij     for stimulants    (25) n ij  = min i  x ij   x ij    for destimulants    3) To calculate a weighted normalized decision matrix:   (26) r ij  = n ij  ∙ w j     4) To calculate the negative-ideal solution:   (27) ns = n s j    1 × m      (28) n s j  = min i  r ij     5) To calculate two distances: Euclidean and Taxicab for each alternative from the negative-ideal alternative:   (29) E i  = ∑ j = 1  m  r ij  − ns j    2       (30) T i  = ∑ j = 1  m  r ij  − ns j       6) To calculate the relative evaluation matrix of alternatives:(31) R a  = h ik   n × n       where:(32) h ik  = E i  − E k    + ψ E i  − E k    × T i  − T k          where k  ∈ {1,2, …, n } and ψ   is a threshold function for recognizing the equality of Euclidean distances of two alternatives and is defined as:(33) ψ = 1  if  x  ≥ τ   0  if  x  < τ         where τ is taking the value from 0.01 to 0.05 (the value taken by the decision maker).  7) To determine the scoring of each alternative:   (34) H i  = ∑ k = 1  n  h ik     8) To rank alternatives in descending order.    3.4.1 Non-parametric tests Two non-parametric tests in the form of Kendall's Rank and Spearman Rank correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship between the index for assessing innovation, industrialization and infrastructure development in Polish provinces between 2015 and 2021 and selected economic and social parameters. In both of these tests, each pair of synthetic variables being compared is assumed to be a two-dimensional random variable (X ,Y ), while (X 1 ,Y 1 ), …, (X n  ,Y n  ) is a random sample of that variable. The determined values for both coefficients are in the range [−1; 1]. The higher the absolute value, the stronger the relationship between the variables under study. To determine the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, the elements of Xi are ordered in ascending or descending order, and then r (X i  ) is assigned to them. In turn, the elements of Y i   are given r (Y i ) ranks, which are consecutive natural numbers. It is necessary to adopt the same way of ranking the values of both variables of the two-dimensional variable under consideration. In the case of repeated ordered values of a variable, they are assigned arithmetic averages of the corresponding ranks (Kaczmarczyk, 2018 ). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is calculated as follows:(35) ρ n  = 1 − 6 ∑ i = 1  n  d i 2   n n 2  − 1        where:(36) d i  = r X i   − r Y i      In turn, to determine the values of the Kendall's Rank correlation coefficient, realizations of the two-dimensional variable (X ,Y ) are ordered according to increasing X i   rank. The value of this coefficient is determined from Eq. (37) :(37) τ n  = 4 ∑ i = 1  n  S i   n n − 1     − 1    where S i    is the number of pairs X j : n   Y j ∗   , j > i   in which Y j ∗  > Y i ∗    The algorithm of the research procedure, taking into account the discussed analytical tools, is shown in Fig. 2  .    4 Results The main objective of the study was to make a comparative assessment of Polish regions (provinces) in terms of achieving Goal 9 of the UN's Agenda 2030, related to the development of innovation, industrialization, and infrastructure. The study was conducted for the period covering 2015–2021. This section presents the results of the preliminary statistical analysis of the indicators included in the research (Section 4.1 ) and the core research (Sections 4.2 –4.3). 4.1 Descriptive statistics In the first stage of the research, an analysis of the indicators determining the achievement of Goal 9 in innovation, industrialization and infrastructure was carried out by determining their indices of dynamics of change (Table 2  ). The value of the dynamics of change index shows by how much the value of a given indicator has increased or decreased with respect to the base year, which allows us to gain knowledge about the strength and direction of the changes taking place. For regions that in the base year reached a value of any of the indicators equal to “0”, it was not possible to determine the index of the dynamics of change. Fig. 2  shows the values of the indicators adopted for the study for each province in 2015 and in 2021, as well as the determined indices of the dynamics of change (in the form of red dots). When analyzing the determined dynamics of change of the indicators included in the study in the various regions of Poland during the period under study (Table 2 ), it is possible to note their great diversity. In the case of expenditures on research and development activities in relation to the region's GDP (X1), only in the Holy Cross Province did these expenditures decrease (by 21 %) in 2021 compared to 2015. The undisputed leader in the growth of these outlays is the Warmia-Masuria Province, where expenditures for R&D in 2021 accounted for 378 % of those incurred in 2015. For their absolute values, the leader in 2015 was the Masovia Province, and the runner-up was the Lesser Poland Province. In 2021, there was a swap and the Lesser Poland Province was in the leading position (Fig. 3 a ). These two provinces are among the largest academic centers in Poland with a large number of units conducting research and development activities. By contrast, the smallest expenditures on R&D activities were incurred throughout the analyzed period by the Lubusz Province. In the case of indicator X2 (expenditure on R&D of the business sector in relation to GDP), the largest decrease in the period under review occurred in the Holy Cross Province (−19 %), while the Warmia-Masuria Province experienced the largest, 5-fold increase in these expenditures (+500 %). When analyzing the absolute values of these expenditures, in 2015 the Podkarpackie Province was the leader in this regard, and in 2021 the Lesser Poland Province. The worst situation in this regard was in 2015 in the Warmia-Masuria Province, and in 2021 in the Holy Cross Province (Fig. 3 b). Increases in the indices of the dynamics of change of X1 and X2 indicators are particularly important for developing regions, because one of the most important factors determining the pace and level of economic development of a region is its innovativeness, which is influenced by the transfer and use of knowledge (Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2017 ). The region's research and development activities affect access to original solutions, technological services, as well as the process of consulting and education, which is why it is so important to steadily increase expenditures on R&D activities. In the context of education, indicators X3 (researchers per 1000 economically active people), X4 (students per 10,000 population) and X5 (university graduates per 10,000 population) are also very important for the regions. The largest increase (in percentage terms) in the number of researchers between 2015 and 2021 occurred in the Warmia-Masuria Province (+57 %). For Number of researchers per 1000 economically active people, the largest decrease (by 12 %) was recorded in the Lubusz Province (the number of researchers fell from 1.7 in 2015 to 1.5 in 2021). Declines in the value of this indicator also occurred in Subcarpathia, West Pomerania and Greater Poland. Such a situation may result, among other things, from the mobility of scientists who have moved to other, more attractive regions of Poland and/or outside the country. In general, the highest number of researchers per 1000 economically active people in 2015 occurred in the Lesser Poland Province and amounted to 9.2, and in 2021 – in the Masovia Province and amounted to 13 (Fig. 3 c). As indicated by the data included in the paper (Stam and Wennberg, 2009 ; Białek-Jaworska et al., n.d. ), companies developing R&D activities are largely responsible for the increase in the number of researchers. A negative phenomenon that can be seen in every region of Poland is the decline in the number of students and the number of graduates between 2015 and 2021. The largest decrease in the number of students was reported in the Warmia-Masuria Province (25 %), while the number of graduates in the Holy Cross Province – by as much as 42 %. The largest academic centers in Poland are the provinces of Lesser Poland and Masovia, which translates into the number of students and graduates. However, in these provinces as well, declines in this area are evident. The main reason for this is the demographic changes that have been taking place for years. Poland is among the aging countries, where the population is projected to decline sharply by about 5 million by 2050 and 12 million by 2100 (Malesa, 2015 ). A consequence of this is the already apparent significant decline in the population aged 19–24, which makes up the largest portion included in the set of people called students. A very important indicator in terms of regional innovation and business activity is patents granted (indicator X6). This is because patents make it possible to maintain a strong position in technology (Gaessler et al., 2021 ), affect higher returns on investment, the ability to license and sell the invention/innovation or increase negotiating power, and ultimately a positive corporate image (Kim et al., 2016 ). The significance of this indicator is confirmed by the increase in granted patents in all provinces in Poland, of which the highest rate of change occurred in Subcarpathia (251 %) and the lowest in Masovia (114 %). However, an analysis of absolute values shows that the leader in terms of granted patents invariably remains the Masovia Province, from which comes the largest number of entities to which patents were granted (Fig. 3 f). In terms of industrialization, an important factor shaping the regions' activities is the indicator for the number of registered business entities per 1000 residents (X11). This is because this indicator shows the level of entrepreneurship in a region. This is one of the indicators that characterize the economic situation of the region. The more entities, the greater the positive pro-development impulses entrepreneurship exerts on the economy of a region and, consequently, a country. In Poland, the highest number of registered business entities per 1000 residents was in the Masovia Province, and the lowest in Subcarpathia (Fig. 3 k). The Masovia Province registered approx. 17.4 % of all business entities in the country (Analiza zmian w działalności podmiotów gospodarki narodowej na Mazowszu w kontekście realizacji RIS Mazovia 2007-2015 , n.d. ). The value of the index of the dynamics of change of this indicator, for the surveyed regions in Poland in the period 2015–2021 remains at a very similar level and ranges from 112 % for West Pomerania to 121 % for the Lublin and Subcarpathia Provinces. This means that the process is proceeding steadily in the country. In the context of the saturation of regions with enterprises, the indicator that determines the share of innovative enterprises in the total number of enterprises (X7) is very important. In Poland, there is great regional variation in this regard. The highest percentage of innovative enterprises occurred in 2015 in the West Pomeranian Province, and in 2021 in the Masovia Province. The lowest spatial saturation of innovative enterprises in 2015 occurred in the following provinces: Lubusz, Holy Cross and Warmia-Masuria, and in 2021 Lubusz, Holy Cross and West Pomerania. The average share of innovative enterprises in the total number of enterprises (X7), between 2015 and 2021, decreased in Poland only in the West Pomerania Province (−22 %). All other provinces recorded increases. This is a very positive development that strengthens the competitiveness of the regions and, as a result, the entire Polish economy. The largest increase in the share of innovative enterprises in the total number of enterprises was recorded in Pomerania (+88 %) and Warmia-Masuria (+86 %). Overall, the largest share of these enterprises occurred in 2015 in Podlasie Province (15.3 %), and in 2021 in Pomerania (23.7 %). In terms of indicators characterizing infrastructure development, it is particularly worth looking at such indicators as bicycle paths per 10,000 population (X14), total railroads per 10,000 population (X16), and the percentage of residential buildings connected to water supply (X18) and sewerage infrastructure (X19). In particular, indicators X18 and X19 are important to society as part of the country's municipal infrastructure. Data shows that in Poland, about 8 million residents live without access to sewage systems, about one million apartments do not have a toilet, and half a million premises do not even have running tap water. In both 2015 and 2021, two provinces: Lesser Poland (70.7 % and 72.1 %) and Subcarpathia (72.5 % and 74.6 %) had the lowest percentages of residential buildings connected to water supply infrastructure (Fig. 2 s). On the other hand, in the case of connection to sewage systems, the worst situation is in the Lublin Province, where only 27.9 % and 32.9 % of residential buildings had access to this infrastructure in 2015 and 2021, respectively (Fig. 3 t). In general, the level of equipment of Lublin Province in water supply and sewage systems is lower compared to other provinces. The development of these networks was relatively slow in relation to the region's needs. The sewerage network is secondary in nature, and its development is strictly determined by the availability of water supply and higher technical complexity and capital intensity of investment than others. An important indicator related to infrastructure in Poland is that characterizing paths for bicycles (X14) and the availability of railroads (x16). Bicycle paths and railroads relieve the burden on traditional traffic by promoting alternative modes of transportation and contribute to reducing emissions of exhaust fumes and other air pollutants (low-carbon transportation), improve fluidity and thus increase the comfort of traffic (including by reducing travel time), as well as the level of safety (Zayed, 2017 ; Simonofski et al., 2023 ; Wolniak, 2023 ). In the case of bicycle paths, intensive development is taking place in all regions of Poland. The largest increase between 2015 and 2021 occurred in the Lesser Poland Province, where their number per 10,000 residents increased significantly (from 1.1 in 2015 to 2.4 in 2021). On the other hand, in the case of the availability of railroad lines per 10,000 residents (X16), there is a negative phenomenon related to their decrease in three Polish regions (Masovia, Lesser Poland and Pomerania) (Fig. 3 p). This is of concern because large urban centers are located in these provinces, which force a large movement of people for work or education. Thus, a reduction in rail lines results in a significantly higher burden on other forms of transportation. The results presented and their brief analysis indicate the relevance of the subject matter undertaken its timeliness and the great analytical and interpretative potential of the results obtained.  4.2 Fundamental research 4.2.1 Determination of weights of indicators According to the developed methodology, after identifying the indicators of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure, characterizing the implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 in Polish provinces, their weights were determined. Two objective methods were used for this purpose: CRITIC and Shannon-Entropy (Fig. 2 ). The largest differences in terms of weight values occurred for indicators X6, X11, X12, X14 and X16. Therefore, assuming that the values of the weights obtained by the CRITIC method and the Shanon-Entropy method are equally likely, the Laplace criterion was used to determine their fundamental value. The indicator weights obtained by the CRITIC and Shannon-Entropy methods and their weights determined using the Laplace criterion are shown in Fig. 4  . Finally, the highest weight value was achieved by the infrastructure indicator (X16), which characterizes the length of railroad lines per 10,000 population. On the other hand, the lowest value of weight was characterized by indicator X11, which determines the number of registered business entities per 1000 residents. Considering the three analyzed areas (according to Agenda Goal 9), namely innovation, industrialization and infrastructure, Table 3   shows the values of the weights of the indicators characterizing them. Infrastructure-related indicators had the highest aggregate weights, while industrialization-related indicators had the lowest value. The differences in the values of the weights are small, but the number of indicators characterizing industrialization was the largest and amounted to 7. The areas of innovation and infrastructure were each described by 6 indicators.  4.2.2 Determination of evaluation indices of the studied regions and their rankings In the next stage of the research, sub-indices for each of the MCDM methods (CODAS, CoCoSo) were determined, allowing the Polish regions to be assessed in terms of achieving Goal 9 of the UN Agenda 2030. Based on the evaluation indices obtained by each method, rankings of these regions were created. The study was conducted for the period covering 2015–2021. The results of the calculations for 2021 are shown in Table 4  , and for each of the years 2015–2020 in Appendix 1 . The results presented in Table 4  show that the designated ranking position for most provinces changes depending on the method used. This applies to all years under review. In 2021, only 6 provinces (Lublin, Masovia, Pomerania, Silesia, Holy Cross, and West Pomerania) regardless of the method used received the same ranking position. For three provinces (Opole, Subcarpathia and Warmia-Masuria), the differences as to ranking position are small, amounting to only one position. The largest difference was recorded for the Lubusz Province, which for 2021 is as high as 8 positions (in the CODAS method – 6th position, and in the CoCoSo method – 14th position). These discrepancies show that the method adopted for the analysis affects the ranking positions, which makes it difficult to clearly assess a region's status in terms of the state of implementation of the goal of sustainable development in comparison with other regions. Thus, in order to fairly reflect the actual state of this goal, the Laplace criterion was adopted. It provides the opportunity to make decisions under conditions of limited information and assumes that all obtained results of the analysis performed are equally likely (Taylor, 2019 ; Stevenson, 2012 ; Belton and Stewart, 2002 ). In the case under review, we are dealing with just such a situation. The application of this criterion requires unifying the orders of magnitude of the evaluation indices determined with the MCDM methods to later determine their ranking position. The unified evaluation index values for the MCDM methods used and the Laplace criterion-based index values of this evaluation for each province (region), along with the actual ranking position, are shown in Table 5  . The results indicate that in terms of the implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030, related to the development of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure in Poland, the Masovia Province performed best in 2021. The Pomernia and Lower Silesia Provinces also achieved very good results. The worst situation was in West Pomerania and Holy Cross Provinces.  4.2.3 Determination of the ranking of studied regions (provinces) Taking into account the adopted research course of action, analyses were carried out for the entire study period, i.e., 2015–2021. Fig. 5   shows the values of the index for assessing the achievement of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 (SDG  9    index), for studied regions for the entire period under study. The SDG  9   , index was determined using the CODAS and CoCoSo methods and the Laplace criterion. Each region in a given year was evaluated against all other regions (provinces) of Poland. In turn, Fig. 6   shows the ranking positions of each region in each year of the analysis, which were determined based on the value of the SDG  9    index. When analyzing the results, it can be seen that for most provinces, the evaluation index fluctuated significantly during the evaluation period. The Mazowieckie Provice achieved its highest value throughout the period and thus always ranked first in the ranking (Fig. 4 ). A noticeable upward trend occurred for Warmia-Masuria, while a downward trend is evident for Pomerania and West Pomerania. The determined values of the indices for assessing regions in Poland between 2015 and 2021 in terms of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure made it possible to assess their differentiation in this regard and to divide them into classes with different levels of achievement of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030. The basis for the division into classes with different levels of achievement of this goal, in addition to the value of this index, was also two additional parameters of this taxonomic measure, namely the arithmetic mean and standard deviation (Eqs. (2)–(5) ). The division criteria adopted made it possible to carry out a process of hierarchization of the studied regions. Fig. 7   presents a graphical depiction of the results, showing the spatial differentiation of Poland in terms of sustainable development related to the implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030. This division highlights the developmental disparities in different regions of Poland. The results show that only the Masovia Province was the best developed region in terms of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure throughout the analysis period. A similar situation also exists in the Pomerania Province, which between 2015 and 2019 and in 2021 was also characterized by a high level of this development. In 2020, the first year of the global pandemic caused by coronavirus, this development was somewhat slowed down, causing the Pomerania Province to reach only a medium-high level. The Lower Silesia Province is also doing very well in terms of development related to the implementation of Goal 9 of the UN's 2030 Agenda, reaching the high level in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021, and the medium-high level (strong development) in 2016, 2018, 2020. The least developed region in Poland in terms of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure, during this period was the Holy Cross Province. The Warmia-Masuria Province was also characterized by low levels between 2015 and 2018 but improved its indicators in subsequent years. The Podlasie Province also had a low level between 2016 and 2017, and the Lublin Province in 2015, 2017, 2019. Of particular interest is the situation of the West Pomerania Province, which fell from medium-high development in 2015 to low development in 2021. In general, it can be noted that most of the provinces of eastern Poland, conventionally counted as part of the so-called “Poland B,” was characterized in the analyzed period by a low average and low level in terms of the achievement of UN Agenda 2030 Goal 9, but among them there is a visible tendency to improve this condition. This is evidenced by the periodic changes in this level that occurred in the years under review. The exception among the eastern provinces in terms of the level of development is Masovia, which is the most developed region and the outlier, showing favorable changes in the development of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure. However, it should be noted that this position is mainly influenced by the capital city of Warsaw and its surroundings, which is the largest labor market in Poland (employment is about 2.7 million people). As much as 19 % of the country's businesses are concentrated in this region. The Masovia Province is also distinguished by the largest share of foreign capital invested in enterprises amounting to as much as 45 % of total investments in Poland (Strategia rozwoju województwa Mazowieckiego 2030+ , n.d. ). The results also confirm the division of Poland into two areas with different degrees of economic development. Regions located in the western parts of the country fare much better than those in the eastern parts. Yet the slow disappearance of these differences is apparent. This means that disparities in innovative development, industrialization and infrastructure are also due to the geographic location of the provinces. Neighboring countries and the historical conditions existing in these areas are also important in this case. This, in turn, translates into their attractiveness, that is, among other things, for entrepreneurs, including those with foreign capital, or the availability of human resources with the right competencies. Some of these regions have relatively weak industrialization and entrepreneurship, low R&D activity (e.g., characterized by low R&D expenditures, low number of patents, low number of students, researchers and graduates), resulting in low labor productivity, higher unemployment rate compared to other provinces, and poor performance in terms of revenue from sales of innovative products. The results also show that the compositions of the various taxonomic classes due to the level of development associated with UN Agenda 2030 Goal 9 changed little between 2015 and 2021. Therefore, the average value of the index for assessing the development of regions for the entire period analyzed was determined, and as a result, the level of development related to innovation, industrialization, and infrastructure. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 8  . The results confirm that after averaging the results of the sub-years, the leader in terms of innovative, industrialization and infrastructural development, throughout the analyzed period, is the Masovia province, and the runner-up –Pomerania. The Lower Silesia Province was also in the lead. The least developed region in Poland in terms of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure, during this period, was the Holy Cross Province., Based on the study, the development levels of each province (region) for the period 2015–2021 were also determined, and so:– the high level was reported for the provinces of Masovia, Lower Silesia and Pomerania,  – the medium-high level was reported for: Lesser Poland, Silesia and Greater Poland,  – the medium-low level was reported for: Kuyavia-Pomerania, Lublin, Lubusz, Lodzkie, Opole, Subcarpathia, Podlasie, and Warmia-Masuria,  – the low level was reported for the Holy Cross Province.    In general, a very good development situation in Poland related to the implementation of UN Agenda 2030 Goal 9 was present in 38 % of Polish provinces, and a situation requiring improvement and immediate improvement in the remaining 62 % of regions. Thus, it can be assumed that Poland is dominated by regions that are relatively poor at innovation, industrialization and basic infrastructure development. In order to indicate the differences that occur as to the values of the indicators included in the assessment, which occur in the created taxonomic classes, their average values were determined for each class during the analyzed period, i.e., for the years 2015–2021 (Fig. 9  ). The results provide ample opportunities for their analysis and interpretation. In this regard, it can be noted that the Masovia, Lower Silesia and Pomerania Provinces, belonging to the first taxonomic class (high level of sustainable development in terms of innovation, industrialization and infrastructure) had the highest average values of as many as 14 of the 19 indicators included in the study. This includes R&D expenditures as a % of the region's GDP (X1), R&D expenditures of enterprises in relation to GDP (X2), the number of researchers (X3), students (4) and graduates (X5), the share of innovative enterprises in the total number of enterprises, or the number of enterprises that have introduced service innovations. The provinces in this taxonomic class also have the highest percentage of buses adapted to transport people with disabilities and the highest percentage of residential buildings equipped with water and sewage infrastructure. The high level of development in these provinces also contributes to one of the highest levels of bicycle paths accessibility per 10,000 residents. The situation is only slightly worse with the number of railroads. On the other hand, on average, the highest number of railroads and bicycle paths is found in the provinces belonging to the third most numerous taxonomic group. The highest number of expressways and highways per 100 km2 , on the other hand, is found in the provinces of the second taxonomic group. The expansion of infrastructure for bicycle paths and railroads allows residents to use bicycles or railroads more often, as more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. For regional policy, a green approach is very important in building a friendly environment for both working and living. The expansion of the high-speed road network in the form of highways or expressways is also an important part of this process. Faster and more efficient travel, for example, on the home-work-home line, results in time savings and is good for the environment. More free time should also have a positive impact on social aspects, which in the era of work-life balance allows for better time management and finding a balance between “work” and private life.  4.2.4 Results of non-parametric tests The final stage of the research examined whether and to what extent selected economic and social parameters characterizing the regions under study are related to their innovative, industrialization and infrastructure development as measured by the value of the evaluation index (designated in Section 4.2.2 , Fig. 5 ). Two non-parametric tests in the form of Kendall's Rank and Spearman Rank correlation coefficients were used to determine these relationships. The economic parameters were indicators that characterized the regions in terms of: GDP per capita (PLN), gross value added per capita (PLN), revenue of provincial budgets (PLN) and investment expenditures per capita (PLN). In turn, the social parameters included gross disposable income per capita (PLN), registered unemployment (%) and poverty risk (% of the region's population). The Kendall's Rank and Spearman Rank correlation coefficients were determined for a statistical significance level of p  = 0.05, and the determined values are shown in Table 6  . The results show that all tested relationships are statistically significant (at p  = 0.05). Their strength is slightly higher for Spearman rank correlation coefficients than for Kendall rank coefficients. A strong correlation is found in Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the assessment index and gross domestic product per capita, gross value added per capita, provincial budget revenues, registered unemployment, and investment expenditures per capita. A moderate positive relationship, on the other hand, exists between the evaluation index and gross disposable income per capita. A moderate negative relationship exists between the index and the population at risk of poverty. These results show that provinces with successful implementation of Agenda 2030 Goal 9 have fewer problems related to unemployment and poverty in the population, while at the same time residents have more disposable income. Larger provincial revenues and investment expenditures positively affect the economic potential of the regions, and consequently the income level of residents. Importantly, regions with high and moderately high innovation, industrialization and infrastructure development have lower unemployment, which of course has the potential to reduce the risk of poverty. Thus, these relationships show that the development of innovation, infrastructure and industrialization of regions have a very positive impact on the economic and social aspects of their residents.    5 Discussion The concept of sustainable development, which is the modern world's response to growing threats, mainly climate-related, is a major challenge for individual countries and regions. This is because, on the one hand, they must ensure competitiveness and economic development, and on the other hand, they must take care of social and climate aspects, so that development does not cause too much burden on the environment and ensures harmonious social development. One extremely important area of this development is issues related to innovation, industrialization and infrastructure development, as reflected in Goal 9 of Agenda 2030. Taking into account the roles and importance of regions in achieving the goals of sustainable development, a study was conducted to assess the level of sustainable development in terms of building stable infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and supporting innovation between 2015 and 2021 regions (provinces) in Poland. The research conducted and the results obtained confirm the great diversity of the studied regions located in Poland in terms of development related to innovation, industrialization, and infrastructure. The results showed that in Poland as much as 62 % of provinces (regions) are characterized by low medium and low levels of achievement of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030. This result translates into an overall poor rating for Poland compared to other EU countries in achieving this Goal (Europe Sustainable Development Report 2022 , n.d. ). An analysis of the rankings of individual provinces and their level of development of industrialization innovation and infrastructure shows that there is both temporal and spatial wide variation in Poland in this regard. Large economic, business and educational centers, backed by the presence of foreign capital, build their innovation potential through effective cooperation allowing to achieve synergies and more effective implementation of innovations into the circulation of the economy, affecting its industrialization. Such centers include the provinces of Masovia, Lower Silesia, Pomerania, Lesser Poland, Silesia, and Greater Poland. These are the largest industrial centers and academic centers in Poland. Thus, in these regions there is the greatest human potential appropriate for the implementation of innovation and industrial processes, research activity and the construction of adequate infrastructure, which also improves the social attractiveness of these regions (Węziak-Białowolska, 2016 ). In turn, the low position of the other regions related to their relatively low level of innovation and underdeveloped educational infrastructure, such as in the form of academic centers, results in low scientific and research activity (low R&D expenditures, number of patents, etc.). This, in turn, leads to less industrialization, a high unemployment rate, low labor productivity and a low rate of value-added generated by local businesses, resulting in lower provincial revenues and investment funds (Table 6 ). This closed process is becoming a very big problem for some regions, from which it is not easy to find a way out. One opportunity is the EU's regional policy to help such regions. The research results presented also show that the more economically active regions in Poland appreciate the need to build competitiveness and market advantage. Achieving these goals, however, requires thoughtful and judicious investment in innovation and innovation activities. This, in turn, provides access to qualified personnel, further improving their competitiveness and innovation. To achieve this, however, regions must offer access to attractive and well-paid jobs, adequate infrastructure and housing facilities (Davidescu et al., 2020 ; Bibri et al., 2020 ). This is the situation in Poland's provinces, which are characterized by high and medium-high levels of development related to the implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030. Local factors are also important in this regard – these regions have a far better geographic location than those that fell into the medium-low and low development levels. This includes accessibility to highways and international routes. Innovation, industrialization and access to infrastructure therefore translate into improved attractiveness of these regions and chances of attracting further investments. Such activities are extremely important and very often convince entrepreneurs to invest in such areas (Kobrin, 2011 ). This condition makes it necessary for regional authorities to be proactive in improving infrastructure and industrialization and developing innovation. In these processes, it is also worth considering local conditions and their specificities, as well as available resources. Well-targeted regional development strategies, based on the National Strategy for Regional Development 2030 (NSS 2030) (Krajowa Strategia Rozwoju Regionalnego 2030, Warszawa 2019 , n.d. ), provide ample opportunities for the development of these key and necessary areas for building a sustainable economy (included in Goal 9 of Agenda 2030). The results also indicate that in the current reality and with the dynamic changes taking place, regions with a medium and low level of innovation, of which there are as much as 62 % in Poland (10 out of 16 provinces), must take immediate action to increase their attractiveness. For many years now, there has been a visible outflow of population toward regions that are attractive to live in, i.e., those characterized by high and medium levels of development, so that regions with lower levels of development are depopulating, making development processes even more difficult. This is because human resources are the basis for building an innovative industry and appropriate infrastructure. Such a state of affairs could lead to a situation in which the regions, instead of developing, will worsen their indicators. This problem is now becoming common in many regions of the world (Yu et al., 2022 ; Liu and Li, 2017 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Walters, 2016 ). It seems that one way to support the regions may be to put more emphasis on the development of so-called Smart Specializations. The European Commission's initiative is designed to galvanize the regional scientific and research communities, local governments, entrepreneurs and others to build innovation in these regions. Many regions (provinces) have developed Regional Innovation Development Strategies, where smart specializations adequate to the region's capabilities and potential are identified (Krajowa Strategia Rozwoju Regionalnego 2030, Warszawa 2019 , n.d. ; Regionalna Strategia Innowacji Województwa Małopolskiego 2030 (RSI WM 2030) , n.d. ; Inteligentne Śląskie, n.d. ; Regionalna Strategia Innowacji Województwa Świętokrzyskiego 2030+ , n.d. ; Regionalna strategia innowacji województwa Lubelskiego do roku 2030+ , n.d. ). However, as some research (Asheim, 2019 ; Ghinoi et al., 2021 ; Barbero et al., 2022 ) indicates, the region's innovation development in terms of Smart Specializations must be based on the cooperation of industry and higher education, as well as on a developed network of sectoral or industry clusters. In such regions, it is necessary, as (Deng et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ; Aschenbrand, 2022 ; Yang et al., 2022 ) points out, to also undertake extensive measures including the promotion of local physical and social infrastructure, which can lead to an increase in the region's potential. This is why without a methodical approach to this issue, achieving success can be difficult. The process of improving regional innovation must involve all stakeholders in the process, including economic self-government in the form of Regional Chambers of Industry, as is the case in other countries. Is there temporal and spatial variation in the implementation of Goal 9 of Agenda 2030 in Poland by region (province)? This is also confirmed by the European rankings of regions, in which a large regional differentiation of most EU countries is evident (European innovation scoreboard 2022 , n.d. ), and Polish regions are not at the top of these rankings. So, is it worthwhile to strive for even development of all regions, which is a priority of EU regional policy? Is it even possible to achieve this goal? It is difficult to answer this question unequivocally, but it seems that not all regions have the capacity and resources to achieve these goals. Obviously, this mainly concerns human or economic resources, but in implementing such a process, it is also worth taking into account local traditions and climatic or geographical advantages.  6 Conclusions The concept of sustainable development is an increasingly appreciated direction of world development providing an opportunity to link this development with environmental and social aspects. Its position is also due to the fact that there are no other ideas that are so comprehensive and create favorable conditions for the development of ideas. The undoubted leader in the implementation of this concept is the European Union, which sees it as a huge opportunity for the development of an innovative knowledge-based and environmentally neutral economy. The sustainable development goals of Agenda 2030 fit perfectly into this approach. Particularly important, for laying the groundwork for the implementation of this idea, is the Goal 9 of the Agenda. The development of an innovative economy based on stable infrastructure and sustainable industrialization provides a very good foundation for achieving the other goals of the Agenda. However, in order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to transfer global ideas to local or regional operations. It is the regional communities and entrepreneurs who should be the main drivers of the changes being made and become the biggest beneficiaries of the resulting benefits. Spatial and temporal variation in the level of regional development in achieving UN Agenda 2030 Goal 9 in innovation, industrialization, and infrastructure. The basis of this methodology were the analytical tools used and the method for determining an index for assessing regions in terms of their innovation, industrialization and infrastructure, taking into account a selected set of indicators (19). The methodology was used to create a ranking of Polish regions in terms of achieving Goal 9 of the UN Agenda 2030 and divide them into similar groups. Relationships between the values of the identified index and selected economic and social parameters of these regions were also determined. The results obtained from the study provide ample opportunities for inference and interpretation. This should broaden and enrich the knowledge of activities related to innovation processes, industrialization and construction of modern infrastructure for the development of a sustainable economy. Based on the research conducted and the results obtained, the main conclusions are as follows:– The main objective of the study was to make a comparative assessment of Polish regions (provinces) in terms of achieving Goal 9 of the UN's Agenda 2030, related to the development of innovation, industrialization, and infrastructure. In individual years (2015–2021), only the Masovia Province was characterized in each case by a high level of development related to the achievement of this Goal. Between 2015–2018 and 2020–2021, the high level also occurred in the Pomerania Province, and in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021 in the Lower Silesia Province. In addition, in 2020 the highest level of development was also found in the Lesser Poland Province. The low level was reported for the Holy Cross Province. This level also occurred in the Provinces of Warmia-Masuria (2015–2018), Podlasie (2016, 2017), and Lublin (2015, 2017, 2019).  – The determined averaged level of development shows that only 38 % of Polish regions are characterized by high and medium-high levels, and as much as 62 % by medium-low and low levels. In this regard, the survey results show that the worst situation is in regions located in the east of Poland, which are less industrialized and have less academic potential.  – There is a strong positive correlation between the value of the designated index and GDP per capita, provincial budget revenues, gross value added per capita and investment expenditures per capita. By contrast, there is a strong negative correlation between the assessment index value and the unemployment rate, while there is a moderate correlation between the assessment index and the poverty risk index. Thus, the results obtained confirm that economic and social processes in the regions are closely linked to the degree of achievement of Goal 9 of the UN Agenda 2030.    The presented, most relevant conclusions of the work provide clear answers to the research questions posed. It should also be emphasized that the material presented in the paper allows for much greater possibilities of inference than presented in this section. The breadth and multifaceted nature of the subject matter presented makes it possible to address many aspects related to the process of implementing a sustainable economy. It is also important to highlight some limitations of the work, which at the same time can be considered as future research directions. This includes the number of methods used to evaluate the weights of the indicators adopted and to determine the composite evaluation index. The study adopted two such methods, while there is nothing to prevent the use of more. Also, the criterion for determining the final value of the evaluation index may be different. In this case, several criteria can be used, and the results can be compared. It would also be extremely interesting to compare the regions of Poland with those of other EU or non-EU countries. The prerequisite for such an analysis is, of course, the availability of sufficiently reliable data. In summary, it can be said that the methodology developed and applied in the research made it possible to achieve the stated goal with the formulation of answers to the research questions posed. It also provides opportunities for further analysis. It is also important that these results enrich the knowledge of regional implementation of the sustainable development economy and should be used to optimize related activities and build regional development strategies.
