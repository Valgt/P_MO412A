                  The Andean Altiplano holds the largest lithium brine reserves in the world, which are being extracted in service of the global low-carbon economy and the desire to meet the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as clean energy and climate action. To date, little is known about the effects that lithium brine mining has on the environment or which trade-offs to SDGs are associated with the extraction. This systematic literature review brings together the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity and their influence on SDGs. The effects on geodiversity are found to be spread across all essential geodiversity variables and influence all SDGs, except SDG 14. The changes in geodiversity have consequences for the unique biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Andean Altiplano and consequently affect the lives of indigenous communities. Independent and quantitative research is lacking and therefore monitoring and measuring are key to understanding how the natural environment in the Andean Altiplano has been changing due to lithium brine mining practices. Unsustainable management by the mining industry can potentially cause ecosystem collapse, irreversible environmental degradation, increased inequality, conflict, and the displacement of populations when resources are misused or managed poorly. However, sustainable management has the potential to mobilise human, physical, financial, and technological resources to advance the SDGs. The results emphasise how intricately connected the extraction of lithium brine, geodiversity and the SDGs are, and can be used as a guideline for global agenda making on sustainable lithium brine extraction in the Andean Altiplano.

Map created in ArcGIS Pro, map data from: Esri, USGS, CGIAR, Garmin International, Inc.   Fig. 2 Schematic and simplified representation of the hydrology of an intermontane salar basin. Freshwater infiltrates in the mountains as well as alluvial fans and flows towards the lower-lying wetlands and salt flat nucleus. Blue and red arrows depict fresh and saline groundwater movement. Below the salt flat, a brine aquifer is formed in halite, gypsum and carbonates through evaporation of water and accumulation of minerals. In the mixing zone, the brine and freshwater come together and form brackish wetlands at the surface.  Illustration adapted from Marazuela et al. [14]  and Munk et al. [15] .   Fig. 3 Schematic representation of lithium extraction and processing steps. Lithium-rich brine is pumped up from subsurface aquifers and mixed with fresh water from the mountains to aid the precipitation process. The mixture is left in large ponds to increase the concentration through wind and solar-powered evaporation. Once the mixture is concentrated enough, it is transported to a facility where lithium carbonate is extracted.  Illustration adapted from Flexer et al. [26]  and Liu et al. [36] .   Fig. 4 Snapshot of an oblique aerial photo composition of a lithium brine mining site in the Salar the Atacama in Northern Chile. The squared fields are evaporation ponds and their colour reflects the mineral concentration of the water. The mixing zones are depicted in white at the transition towards the Andean mountain range. The squared pattern in the front is caused by roads and the white dots are pumping stations and monitoring wells.

Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen Thormøhlens gate 53 A/B Bergen 5006 Norway       The Andean Altiplano holds the largest lithium brine reserves in the world, which are being extracted in service of the global low-carbon economy and the desire to meet the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as clean energy and climate action. To date, little is known about the effects that lithium brine mining has on the environment or which trade-offs to SDGs are associated with the extraction. This systematic literature review brings together the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity and their influence on SDGs. The effects on geodiversity are found to be spread across all essential geodiversity variables and influence all SDGs, except SDG 14. The changes in geodiversity have consequences for the unique biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Andean Altiplano and consequently affect the lives of indigenous communities. Independent and quantitative research is lacking and therefore monitoring and measuring are key to understanding how the natural environment in the Andean Altiplano has been changing due to lithium brine mining practices. Unsustainable management by the mining industry can potentially cause ecosystem collapse, irreversible environmental degradation, increased inequality, conflict, and the displacement of populations when resources are misused or managed poorly. However, sustainable management has the potential to mobilise human, physical, financial, and technological resources to advance the SDGs. The results emphasise how intricately connected the extraction of lithium brine, geodiversity and the SDGs are, and can be used as a guideline for global agenda making on sustainable lithium brine extraction in the Andean Altiplano.

This aim is in line with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [2,3] . The SDGs consist of seventeen interlinked global goals with 169 accompanying targets. These targets have been assigned indicators, which are meant to measure progress towards reaching the SDGs. The SDGs are designed to guide a transformative pathway leading to a more equitable society by providing a framework for countries to follow in order to achieve a more environmentally sustainable and equitable society by 2030 [4] . To meet SDG 13 on sustainable development: “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”  and SDG 7 on energy security: “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” , an energy transition is taking place [3] . This transition is also referred to as the ’green energy revolution’ as energy sources such as oil, coal and gas are replaced by cleaner and renewable sources such as wind, solar and hydro energy. The supply chains supporting green technologies require the extraction of critical minerals. A key element is lithium, which is the lightest-weight alkali metal and can provide almost three times the energy density of conventional lead–acid batteries. Because of these properties, lithium is in high demand for the production of rechargeable electric devices, such as phones or electric cars. The demand for lithium is growing with 25% annually and is for this reason also referred to as “the white gold” [5,6] . The extraction of critical minerals needed for this transition, however, can also negatively impact other SDGs. In order to effectively implement sustainable policies, research is needed on how the energy transition can meet the SDGs with as few trade-offs as possible. However, research is limited on how the extraction of critical minerals, such as lithium, affects the environment, and how this in turn affects the SDGs. In this review, the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity in South America are identified and associated with SDGs. Bringing together the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity and how all SDGs are affected provides a novel insight to support global agenda making on sustainable lithium brine extraction. After a brief theoretical background and method description the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity are discussed and linked to the relevant SDGs. The results are synthesised in sections 6 and 7, where the need to monitor changes in Essential Geodiversity Variables (EGVs) is emphasised as the way forward towards reaching most SDGs.  2 The Lithium Triangle 2.1 The Andean Altiplano The focus area of this review is the Central Andes in South America, which holds the largest known lithium resources in the world [5] . The so-called ’Lithium Triangle’ covers an area of 400.000 km  2     and is estimated to possess around 65% of the world’s known lithium resources and 80% of the world’s lithium brine [7–9] . The Lithium Triangle is located on the Altiplano-Puna Plateau of the Central Andes, hereafter referred to as Andean Altiplano, and stretches from Southern Bolivia to Northwest Argentina and the Western slopes in Northern Chile [9] . Fig. 1  shows the location of the Lithium Triangle and the most important salt flats. The Andean Altiplano is formed and sustained by active tectonism and volcanism, resulting in a rugged topography with elevations ranging between 3500 and 5500 metres above sea level [10] . Coinciding with the uplift, at around 6–10 million years ago, sediments began accumulating in descending tectonic basins in the Altiplano. The majority of sedimentary successions host thick evaporite deposits, dominated by halite and travertine [11] . The tectonic uplift created a sharp topographic and climatic gradient from wet, higher-elevated areas in the east to arid, lower-elevated zones in the centre of the Altiplano. The area is now characterised by an arid to hyper-arid climate, with most of the region receiving on average 400 mm of precipitation a year in a gradient from 60–150 mm/yr in the east to 300–600 mm/yr in the west [10] . Daily temperature variations can reach up to 25 degrees Celsius and wind gusts can exceed 100 km/h, resulting in high evaporation rates. Wet periods with rainfall seasons in La Niña years alternate with periods of extremely low precipitation and warmer air temperature during El Niño years [12] .  The arid climate in combination with local hydrogeological conditions have resulted in numerous endorheic basins with a diversity of wetlands [10] . Because of the presence of a salt pan or salt lake, these basins are locally called salares . The only natural mechanism of surface water loss in these salares is through evaporation. Input is only possible through rainfall or supply through groundwater. Long-term evaporation caused a thick accumulation of evaporite rocks in lower basins between the mountain tops [13] . The pores of evaporites contain brines, rich in lithium, potassium, boron and other minerals, formed through chemical weathering and the formation of secondary minerals [9] . Fig. 2  shows a schematic representation of the environmental conditions of a salar basin.  The environmental conditions that prevail are characterised by such low precipitation that groundwater recharge and runoff from the mountains are essential sources of water that supply these salar systems [16] . In the salares, the groundwater table is situated several centimetres to decimetres below the surface and water evaporates, leaving minerals behind [13] . Between the alluvial fans, on the lower slopes of the surrounding mountains and the salares, a mixing zone exists in which wetlands are formed. Wetlands on salares are, broadly defined, areas that are covered with fresh or saline water that is either standing or flowing, and permanent or temporary [10] . The crusts on the salares are defined as a rough halite crust, whereas the crust in the wetlands is defined as moderately rough ranging between soft and hard by Kampf and Tyler [17] . The formation of the salares took millions of years and the mineral deposits, including brines, are considered fossil resources [13] . Due to the scarcity of water, wetlands are key providers in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services in these arid environments. The salares host a unique biodiversity, including several rare (endemic) plant species, such as Nitrophila atacamensis, Sarcocornia fruticosa  and Lycium humile [18]  and animal species, such as three of the world’s six flamingo species: the Andean flamingo Phoenicoparrus andinus , Chilean flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis  and James’ flamingo Phoenicoparrus jamesi [4,19] . The livelihood of local communities depends on the ecosystem services provided by the salares and bordering wetlands, such as water availability, geotourism and salt production [20] . The extreme environments of the salares are also used for space-related research, for example in the Salar de Atacama, where the conditions are considered to be a valid analogue for the extreme dryness on Mars and therefore used in astrobiological studies on the formation of nitrate deposits. In this unique environment, the plant species are especially sensitive to hydrological changes and even a slight change in the water budget can greatly affect plant diversity and vegetation cover [4] . The biodiversity and ecosystem services are supported by the geodiversity (geology, geomorphology, soils and hydrology) and disturbances to the geodiversity will consequently also affect the biodiversity and ecosystem services.  2.2 White gold Lithium is the third element in the periodic system and part of the chemical group of alkali metals. These metals are so reactive that they only exist in nature as compounds, never in their pure form [21,22] . Lithium is present in more than 150 minerals, clays, pegmatites, brines, geothermal waters and seawater [23] . The total lithium reserves on land, both in ores and in brines, are estimated at around 98 million tons, of which the majority is found in South America in the Lithium Triangle [8] . This seems trivial compared to the estimated 230 billion tons of total reserves in the ocean [23] . Still, all commercial lithium is currently mined from sources on land, as the concentration of lithium in sea water is very low (between 0.01 and 0.02 ppm) and efficient methodologies for extraction are still at an early stage of development [23,24] . Lithium was already being used for applications such as glass and ceramics, lubricating grease, pharmaceuticals and polymer production, but the unprecedented growth of electric vehicles has driven the total demand to rise from 292,000 metric tons in 2020 to 797,000 metric tons in 2022 and is expected to rise to 2500,000 metric tons by 2030 [6,25] . Despite the global availability of lithium, only a few reserves are large enough to be exploited [26] . In addition, technologies to recycle lithium from lithium-ion batteries are still in development and not yet economically attractive when compared to the mining of the raw materials [27,28] . Although there have been large increases in lithium supply, the increases in demand are much faster and bigger and shortages in lithium are expected for the next 10 to 15 years [29] . Even if 100% of all lithium batteries were recycled today, this would not be enough to prevent shortages of this resource. While technology advances fast, we are still heavily depending on the supply from ores and brines and exerting pressure on the areas from which lithium is mined.  2.3 Brine mining In South America, most of the lithium production is derived from lithium-rich brines. Brines are highly saline solutions in which mineral salts, such as lithium chloride, are dissolved. These brines can be accessed directly from the salt flat nucleus or its subsurface. The lithium concentration in brines ranges from 0.01% to 0.2% [30] . Fig. 3  shows a schematic representation of the steps taken to extract lithium from brines. Brine extraction starts with drilling through the salt crust to the brine and pumping the hypersaline liquid into a series of shallow open-air evaporation pools. The lithium brine is then left to evaporate for 12–14 months after which a salty mixture is left. This mixture can contain different components, depending on the hydrogeological source, but common are manganese (Mn  ), potassium (K  ), calcium (Ca  ), sulphate (S  ), borax (Na  2   [ B  4   O  5   ( OH )   4   ]  ⋅ 8 H  2   O   ) and lithium (Li  ). After several successive evaporation steps, the resulting mixture has a lithium concentration of approximately 6000 ppm which can be distilled to extract lithium carbonate (Li  2   CO  3     ). This is the raw material used for lithium-ion batteries [26] . Components that do not spontaneously precipitate in the ponds are removed by chemical treatment. Magnesium, for example, is removed by precipitation with lime (CaCO  3    ) [26] . Because evaporation is achieved through the available solar and wind energy, the described method has relatively low financial costs, which makes it economically attractive [31] . A disadvantage of this method is that it takes many months to go from natural brine to concentrated brine, which makes it difficult to adapt to changes in demand [32] . In addition, the 6% enriched brine needs to be transported to another industrial plant for further processing and these are not always nearby. Although all countries in the Lithium Triangle face different physical challenges related to lithium extraction, the extraction process is similar in the entire area [33] . Lithium brine extraction is substantially different from conventional mining practices such as for copper and gold: no explosives or toxic chemicals are used, nor are there wide and deep excavation works visible at the surface [33,34] . For this reason, lithium brine mining has the reputation of being a comparatively “soft” mining practice [33] . Nonetheless, any form of mining demands the literal extraction of materials from the subsurface and is therefore likely to impact the environment [35] . Considering the vulnerability of the salares and its surroundings, and the increasing pressure from the world’s demand, there is reason for concern [33] .    2.4 Geodiversity In this review, the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity in the Andean Altiplano are examined. Geodiversity is defined by Gray [37]  as “the natural range (diversity) of geological (rocks, minerals, fossils), geomorphological (landform, processes), soil and hydrological features. It includes their assemblages, structures, systems and contributions to landscapes” . Geodiversity underpins biodiversity and many essential ecosystem services. Documenting geodiversity is essential for preserving natural capital, biodiversity and geo-ecosystem dynamics and to support sustainable decision-making to limit the environmental impact of lithium brine mining [38] . To help characterise and monitor changes in geodiversity, Essential Geodiversity Variables can be used [39] . The four EGV classes (geology, geomorphology, soils and hydrology) as proposed by Schrodt et al. [39]  will be used to identify and classify the effects of lithium brine mining. The classes and variables are listed in columns 1 and 2 of Table 1  respectively.   3 Methods A systematic meta-synthesis was conducted to answer two research questions: (a) “What are the environmental effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity in South America?”  and (b) “How are the environmental effects of lithium brine mining associated with Sustainable Development Goals?” . Four databases were used; Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO (Spanish only) and Google Scholar which are known to have a high coverage of citations in the geosciences [40] . Searches in Web of Science and SciELO included all fields, searches in Scopus included the title, keywords and abstract and searches in Google scholar included the title and keywords. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined beforehand and based upon guidance by Siddaway et al. [41] . To be included, literature was required to be relevant to the research question and topic, written in the English or Spanish language and available via open access or subscriptions of the University of Amsterdam library. All authors, journals, affiliations and publication years were included. A critical perspective vis-à-vis the older papers was maintained to ensure their present-day relevance. The following search terms were used to find literature for the first research question: (“lithium” OR “brine” OR “salt lake”) AND (“mining” OR “extract*”) AND (“South America” OR “South-America” OR “Bolivia” OR “Chile” OR “Argentina” OR “Peru” OR “geodiv*”). For the second research question search terms (“SDG” OR “sustainable development goal”) were added and term (“geodiv*”) was removed. In our search for Spanish language studies, the following search terms were used:(“litio” OR “salmuera” OR “salar*”) AND (“minería” OR “extracción”) AND (“Suramérica” OR “South-America” OR “Bolivia” OR “Chile” OR “Argentina” OR “Peru” OR “geodiv*”), and (“ODS” OR “objetivo de desarrollo sostenible”) for the second research question. Harzing’s Publish or Perish software [42]  was used to search through the results of Google Scholar, due to the limited online advanced search options. The search with this software, however, could not be limited to open access papers and the English or Spanish language. 32 articles were also identified through forward and backward searches of the literature. These, and articles from other sources, were added to the collection. The initial search through the four databases was based on the search terms and inclusion criteria and resulted in 647 articles, of which 58 were duplicates. The remaining 590 original articles were screened for relevance on title, then abstract, and finally a full-text assessment for eligibility was conducted. The search for the second research question resulted in only 21 documents, of which 5 were already analysed during the process for the first question. Due to the limited number of papers, all were full-text assessed. A total of 12 papers were found useful and included in this review.  4 Effects on geodiversity The environmental effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity are listed in Table 1 , accompanied by the relevant literature. The effects and underlying mechanisms are reviewed in the context of the four geodiversity classes.   4.1 Geology A direct effect of lithium brine mining is the loss of lithium as a natural resource. Even though there is some evidence suggesting continuous recharge of lithium [52] , the estimated recharge rates are several orders of magnitude lower than what is used by full-scale mining facilities [26] . Lithium can therefore be considered a non-renewable resource in the Andean Altiplano which is depleting through active exploitation over several decades [26] . Coupled with the extraction of lithium is the extraction of other, currently less valuable, minerals from the subsurface. The lithium concentration in brines is relatively low and many other minerals, such as sodium, sulphate, chloride, magnesium and boron, that are extracted as a by-product eventually end up as waste [16,35,43] . The salt deposits that have accumulated over time in the salares form a white “blanket” over the area which functions as a popular tourist attraction. From all over the world, people come to visit the salares to see the surreal image of a white salt desert themselves. For most communities surrounding the salares, tourism has become a major economic activity maintained by hundreds of thousands of visitors a year [44] . The endemic flora and fauna that are linked to this environment form an important reason for tourists and scientists to visit this specific region. The tourism industry is dependent on several characteristics that are specific to this region, such as the visual attractiveness of the landscape, which is affected by excavation works for evaporation pools and the built of facilities, pumping stations and other infrastructure [45] . The tourism industry is heavily dependent on water availability, which is also under pressure from lithium brine mining (see also section 4.4 Hydrology). A last effect is land subsidence. Although evidence that supports subsidence effects in the focus area is weak [10] , it has been included here because there are documented examples of land subsidence due to lithium brine mining across the world, for example in England and Northern Ireland [53] . The rapid growth of the lithium brine mining industry in the Andean Altiplano is a relatively recent development and land subsidence is therefore believed to be a potential effect which should be further monitored, for example with remote sensing techniques.  4.2 Geomorphology The transformation of a salt flat into a production area for lithium brine mining with evaporation pools inevitably alters the geomorphology of the area. The largest changes to landforms are caused by excavation works to create evaporation ponds on the salt flat nucleus. Although the surface excavation is relatively shallow, it still needs to be refilled or restored afterwards [46] . Fig. 4  is a composition of oblique aerial photos taken from Google Earth Pro and shows evaporation ponds, pumping stations and infrastructure of a mining site in the Salar the Atacama in Northern Chile. The occupation of surface also decreases the land’s surface’s function as a habitat, because it is either fragmented or completely used by the mining facilities. If mining activities eventually stop, the habitat’s size and quality will have been changed and, if still possible, will need recovery [46] . Other changes that are made to the landscape are due to built infrastructure to support the mining industry, e.g. buildings and punctual drillings for pumping systems, and infrastructure to provide access to the mining area, e.g. roads [46] . Along roads, artificial dikes interrupt sediment transport from the Andean mountains, via alluvial fans, towards the salt flat nucleus.    4.3 Soil The soil chemistry is mainly affected by contamination and changes in soil moisture. Soil contamination due to lithium brine mining is documented to occur through leachates, such as oils, greases, acids and heavy metals, solid wastes, and through water pollution, which precipitate in the soil [47,54] . When lithium leaches to the soil it becomes one of the most mobile cations which can leach to surface and groundwater. Lithium is also readily taken up by plants, where it has a relatively high accumulation coefficient and is therewith likely to be transferred to the food chain [54] . Salinisation as a form of soil degradation is also reported in the literature as an effect of lithium brine mining [10] . Salts accumulate on the bottom of evaporation ponds and are then compiled in salt piles, which can reach heights of 15 metres. In the Cauchari and Olaroz Salares in Northwest Argentina, it is estimated that around 740 ha of salt piles will be produced over the next 40 years near the evaporation pond areas [46] . The effect of such piles on the surrounding soil (and geomorphology and hydrology) has not been quantified. The salts are classified as inert waste and as the salares already contain large amounts of salt, the salts generated from brines are not considered to be foreign compounds. The residues are sometimes used to consolidate the precarious roads within the mining area [26] . Potential legacy effects or residues of other minerals in these salt piles are not (yet) studied. Changes in soil moisture were studied by Liu et al. [36] , who conducted research on the Atacama salt flat to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of lithium brine mining and environmental degradation. They found that there was a significantly decreasing trend of soil moisture over the past 20 years. They also concluded that there was a strong negative correlation between increasing mining area and decreasing soil moisture. In addition, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index analysis was performed to detect changes in vegetation cover and also here, a strong negative correlation between mining activities and decreasing vegetation cover was found. Although vegetation cover on itself is not an EGV, it is a common indicator of vulnerability to erosion in arid systems, which affects the physical state of the soil [55] . Adverse erosion processes have been reported in the Cauchari and Olaroz Salares, in north-western Argentina and part of the Lithium Triangle, after soil and vegetation cover were removed for mining practices [46] .  4.4 Hydrology By far the most effects reported in literature concern the hydrology. The effects are classified into effects regarding either surface water, ground water, or both, as the hydrological systems are connected (see Fig. 2 ). It is important to distinguish between brine water, which has a high ionic strength of total dissolved solids and values averaging around 300 g/L, and freshwater, which is low in salinity and has an average total dissolved solids value of 10 g/L [26] . The brine water is located below the salt flat nucleus, whereas the freshwater comes from aquifers near the border of the salares’ wetlands and distal alluvial fan areas (Fig. 2 ). Freshwater is pumped up by mining companies to be used in extraction and purification processes. The amount of freshwater used to produce a ton of final battery-grade lithium-carbonate (Li  2   CO  3     ) is between 5 to 50 m  3    , except it is extracted from aquifers below arid land [26] . Current reports declare that more freshwater is extracted than can naturally be replenished [48,56] . There is increasing concern about the possible interaction between brine and freshwater aquifers and especially what will happen once the brine reservoir gets depleted by lithium brine mining. When depletion will happen is unknown, as this depends on many factors that are subject to change, such as the extraction rate and the climate. Lithium brine mining is closer to water extraction than to lithium mining, as up to 95% of the original brine water needs to be evaporated to retrieve the lithium [26] . Approximately 100–800 m  3     water per tonne lithium carbonate is lost through evaporation [57] . It should be noted that the brine has a nine times higher salt concentration than seawater and is therefore far from suitable for human or animal consumption or use for irrigation. Before lithium mining companies started extracting the brine, no one was making use of the brine reservoirs [26] . That being said, the brine reservoirs are, even before exploitation, in a dynamic equilibrium with their surroundings and maintain a slow turnover that is controlled by evaporation and recharge from rains [11] . The exact amount of brine water extracted is unclear, which is partly because mining companies do not openly share this kind of information, and partly due to failure by the government to regulate. In Chile, for example, brine water is not regarded as “water” and mining companies are therefore not required to have any water rights to extract brine. Quantitative studies on water extraction are scarce and often limited to Salar de Atacama [57] . The studies that were found showed a decrease of total water storage in Salar de Atacama of −1.16 mm annually between 2010 and 2017 [45] . Since brine is considered to be a non-renewable resource, it is estimated that extraction far exceeds recharge and is therefore depleting the reservoir [48,56,57] . Quantitative data on the total extracted amount is crucial to assess the impact of brine extraction on the hydrology, but remains unknown without independent, large-scale monitoring of water extraction [48] . Research on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the aquifers is sparse, but there is consensus that there is an interconnection between fresh and brine water [7,51] . From the mountains, infiltrated water ascends as a vertical flux through the saline interface, i.e. mixing zone, which is formed by contrasting densities between freshwater and brine of the salt flat nucleus (see Fig. 2 ) [13] . The salares are fed by this groundwater which is a slow process over a long timescale, meaning they cannot rapidly recharge via short-term precipitation or runoff [58] . The freshwater input from the mountains and salinisation on the flat through evaporation, cause a low hydraulic gradient of the water table [13] . Brine pumping from the salt flat causes a lowering of the water table and directly impacts the water balance of the basin as the phreatic evaporation rate depends on the depth of the water table [14] . Measurements taken from the Atacama salt flat between 1986 and 2015 indicated a drawdown of the water table below the extinction depth, which is the depth to which the roots of plants extend below the land surface, after brine pumping. This resulted in a 96% reduction of the natural evaporation flow regime from the mountains to the flat [14] . Due to the mixing in the boundaries of brine- and freshwater reservoirs, salinisation occurs. As the mining operations expand, the demand for groundwater increases as well and this results in higher salinisation, a deeper water table, a shifting mixing zone and overall exhaustion of the reservoirs [5] . Lowered water levels also affect the (endemic) plant and animal species that are dependent on the wetlands and unique mixing zone characteristics. Fig. 5  shows the Andean flamingos Phoenicoparrus andinus  in a wetland, and Sarcocornia fruticosa  and Nitrophila atacamensis  in the mixing zone. These species depend strongly on the presence of wetlands and their salt gradient, which are both threatened by the infrastructure and changing hydrodynamics. The Andean flamingo population in Salar de Atacama have had a 12% reduction in their population size [58] . Tourism heavily depends on freshwater availability of both surface- and groundwater. There exists a strong interdependency between local communities, tourism activities and mining activities and the availability of water [45] . This dependency, however, is a vicious circle, as part of the local livelihood also depends on income through mining activities, which is putting hydrological constraints on the water availability, which limits tourism activities [45] . Also here, quantitative data on the water use and demand of the tourism industry and local communities is lacking. Apart from water exhaustion, there have also been reports of physiochemical changes. Cubillos et al. [50]  studied the effects of different concentrations of lithium in brines on microbial communities. They compared brines from the initial and final evaporation pool, which respectively represent natural brine and concentrated brine that will be residual after the lithium has been extracted. They discovered the following physiochemical changes: the concentrated brine had higher viscosity and turbidity, a four times lower conductivity than natural brine and the main ions in natural brine were sodium and chloride compared to lithium and chloride in the concentrated brine. The changes in saline composition (from high sodium and low lithium to low sodium and high lithium) are caused by the continuous evaporation and subsequent harvesting of salts in the pools. The observed changes form a threat to the “extremophiles” (organisms living in extreme environments) living in these unusual systems [50] . Cubillos et al. [50]  stress that natural brines from the Atacama salt flat are unique in the world and of importance for research beyond Earth because the brines help understand potential environmental conditions, and therewith life, on Mars. Lastly, the water-intensive brine mining industry generates large volumes of waste (water). Wastewater has a high risk of contaminating the environment, but is technically very difficult and expensive to treat when saline [49] . The evaporation pools are often lined with a polymer-based material to assure insulation and avoid infiltration to the subsurface [46] . The subsequent evaporation processes produce a lot of solid waste, which is often accumulated on the verge of the salares. The waste from the ponds primarily consists of a mixture of Mg ( OH )   2      and CaSO  4    , which is difficult to separate. Though this waste is non-toxic, the large volume certainly calls for waste management actions in the upcoming years [26] . When it comes to municipal waste, surface waters are polluted by pipes and discarded garbage in adjacent wetlands. A secondary threat of pollution comes from leaching of pollutants into ground water [46] .     5 Sustainable development goals Now that the effects on geodiversity have been identified (Table 1 ), their association to the SDGs will be assessed. In the United Nations framework, each SDG is accompanied by targets to provide specific, measurable objectives to guide and track progress towards achieving the goals [3] . Here, these targets are used to pinpoint which SDGs were affected through geodiversity. In the literature on lithium brine mining, a direct link from environmental effects to specific SDGs is rarely formulated and it is important to note that this field is still under-researched. This, however, also underlines the importance of this research. The synthesis in this section is carefully constructed to provide a nuanced understanding of the broader implications of lithium brine mining on the SDGs through geodiversity, while remaining a critical perspective with regard to the limitations of the available literature. 5.1 Trade-offs and synergies When identifying the effects related to lithium brine mining in the Andean Altiplano, it is important to be wary of any possible synergies and trade-offs associated with meeting a SDG, and mining in general. The mining industry operates on a global scale in often remote and sensitive geo-ecosystems. The mining areas in South America are often remote, less developed and home to indigenous people. By linking the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity to the SDGs, any undesirable side-effects can be precluded and potential co-benefits can be stimulated [59] . The SDGs are often classified according to the “five P’s”, i.e. people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. This, however, simplifies a highly complex system which has already been summarised. Each SDG represents a multidimensional problem and goal which is strongly intertwined with the other goals. SDG 6 for example, clean water and sanitation, is for 38% related to people and for 67% to planet [60] . Hence, the SDGs are reviewed individually and in chronological order. The effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity, linked to SDGs are presented in Table 2  and visualised in Fig. 6 . Statistics on these findings are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . In Fig. 6 , the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity are listed as nodes on the left side and the SDGs are listed as nodes on the right side. The links between an effect and a SDG is represented by an arc connecting the two nodes. The colour of the nodes on the left represent the EGV classes and correspond to the colours in Figs. 7 and 8 . The last row in Table 2  reflects the effects of the lithium brine mining industry in its entirety, and is shown in Fig. 6  at the bottom to improve readability. The connection between the lithium brine industry and the SDGs incorporates both the links of the identified effects the potential it holds as an entity in the Andean altiplano. The effects on hydrology, and in particular depletion of both surface and groundwater resources and the changing hydrodynamics, affects the most SDGs. Fig. 8  presents the number of effects of lithium brine mining for each SDG. SDG 15, “life on land”, is affected most, followed by SDG 12 “responsible consumption and production” and SDG 10 “reduced inequalities”. Sections 5.1.1 to 5.1.17  chronologically elaborate on how each SDG is affected.      5.1.1 No poverty The first target of SDG 1 is: “Eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere (...)” [3] . Bold claims have been made by governing bodies and mining companies regarding poverty in the Lithium Triangle. The sentiment that is shared through mining companies and governments is that the mining industry creates jobs in a region with prevailing poverty. The vice president of Bolivia, for example, proclaimed that the mining business would relieve the 40% of inhabitants who are living in extreme poverty [61] . These ideals are supported by the decision to make the lithium brine mining business of Bolivia fully controlled by the state. However, the prospects of autonomously operating mining projects, which require large technological and financial investments, are uncertain [61] . In Argentina, mining companies have been operating for years, such as the Chilean-Canadian venture Minera Exar, and promises have been made to return profits to communities from which the lithium is extracted through annual payments [61] . So far, however, the local population is not reaping the benefits as local residents claim that nothing has been given back yet [61] . While foreign companies make millions by selling minerals extracted from their land, the indigenous communities struggle to pay for adequate resources as their traditional forms of income, for example those based on geotourism, are being compromised [62,63] . Although the benefits of lithium brine mining are currently not fairly shared with indigenous communities, it must be stressed that the lithium brine mining industry does have the potential to alleviate poverty in the region. In Argentina, for example, a mining company called Sales de Jujuy set the goal to foster partnerships with localities and has already hired 65% of its employees from indigenous communities. In addition, the workers are paid a fair salary which is above average for the region. Furthermore, the people are provided medical care and given micro-loans to support innovation and health among local communities [61,64] . In Salar de Atacama, Chile, Albemarle has hired around 20% of their employees from local communities and returns 3.5% of their revenue to Consejo del Pueblo Atacameños, an organisation representing 18 Atacameño communities [64] . These are examples of how lithium brine mining can uplift local communities. Unfortunately, these examples are rare and the exception rather than the rule. Furthermore, an injection of money does not equal reduced poverty. Long-term financial strategies need to be implemented as well. It is also unknown what the effects will be on the region when the mining comes to an end, due to either exhaustion of the reserves, reduced demand or increased competition, and all the created jobs will be lost.  5.1.2 Zero hunger Already before the mining industry moved to the Andean Altiplano, the salares themselves were unusable as farmland or for livestock, and the brine had no agricultural purpose due to its high salinity. So, in terms of occupation of fertile land surface, there is no loss of fertile land in the direct surroundings of the brine mining locations. However, the increased salinisation of the surroundings and depletion of freshwater reserves are a threat to the food security in the area. Target 2.4 has the indicator “Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agricultural practices”  and this target is negatively affected by the effects on the soil and hydrology. The indigenous people live from agriculture and livestock and these are dependent on freshwater supply. By uncontrolled extraction of fresh water, the area becomes less resilient, less productive, and less prepared for adaptation to climate change and extreme droughts, which threatens food security. In Bolivia, for example, local quinoa farmers experienced severe loss of crop yield after two consecutive years of very little rainfall and exacerbated water shortages due to lithium brine mining [65] . In Chile, mining companies have been alleged to contaminate the streams which are used by local communities for agricultural, livestock and household purposes [61] .  5.1.3 Good health and well-being Pollution of the soils and (surface) waters pose a direct threat to the health of indigenous people, which is against target 3.9: “By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination” [3] . Compared to other types of mining, such as open pit or underground mining, lithium brine mining is relatively safe. All workers are above-ground and no explosives are used. Nevertheless, potential negative health effects still exist. The primary concern is that the evaporation ponds are out in the open and subject to winds and storms. Lithium is a highly mobile element and the risk exists that it will be released into the nearby environment [4] . Similar risks are involved when the PVC-lining of the ponds fails and leaks chemical substances [66] . Lithium can enter human and animal bodies through the consumption of plants and water, which have taken up lithium. Reported symptoms from high lithium levels in humans range from nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting to muscle seizures, psychosis and coma [54] .  5.1.4 Quality education The mining industry has the possibility to train its workers in technical and/or management skills. This could benefit target 4.4: “Substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship” [3] . The opportunity to acquire new skills and undergo training is valuable and the acquired skills are often transferable to other jobs. Quality education and training can also lead to better (paid) jobs. Mining company Albemarle, for example, states in their sustainability report that they started with training and education programmes for their employees as well as mentoring support models in 2021 [64] . Possible cooperation with (international) universities could increase the knowledge base and help with the creation and implementation of more sustainable practices. Prerequisite to all this is that the industry hires people from the area, trains them, and actively supports them.  5.1.5 Gender equality Depending on the companies’ and government’s approaches, existing gender inequalities can be either improved or worsened. Gender equality could be positively influenced if mining companies recruit and train (more) women. This would contribute to targets 5.5 and 5.b: “Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life” [3] . The (financial) independence and ownership, as well as their training, contributes to more equal communities. Mining companies claim to pay attention to this SDG and stimulate a diverse and gender equal environment [64,67] . Unfortunately, even in a regular work environment, the numbers show that it is not as easy for women to be hired or rewarded equally for doing the same job as men. In addition, research shows that extreme events, such as droughts, increase inequalities through, for example, increased gender-based violence [68] .  5.1.6 Clean water and sanitation The most substantial impact of lithium brine mining on geodiversity is the access to clean (drinking) water. The depletion and pollution of both surface and groundwater sources are a severe threat to the environment and all living beings in it. Target 6.4 has the indicator: “Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources” , which is negatively affected by the effects on hydrology (i.e. depletion) [3] . Mining companies report to be working on more efficient water usage technologies, such as water recycling and the use of desalinated seawater, but these are not (yet) in operation [64] . Target 6.3 focuses on: “Improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimising release of hazardous chemicals and materials (...)” [3] . This target is negatively affected by the effects of surface and groundwater pollution. To minimise effects, waste should be managed, wastewater should be filtered, and water usage should be monitored and regulated by an independent third-party ensuring objectivity and impartiality. Another target that is affected within this SDG is 6.6: “Protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes” [3] . The changing hydrodynamics and salinisation negatively affect the wetlands bordering the salares. These wetlands are vulnerable ecosystems in the mixing zone (see Fig. 2 ) and are dependent on the hydrological balance between fresh and brine water input, which is being altered. A potential positive effect of lithium brine mining on SDG 6 is that the arrival of mining companies area could improve sanitation infrastructure in the area. This could contribute to targets 6.1 and 6.2 on access to safe drinking water and equitable sanitation. However, no sound evidence for this has been found.  5.1.7 Affordable and clean energy On a global scale, the extraction of lithium enables a green energy revolution, which ultimately benefits target 7.1 on: “access to modern energy services”  and 7.2 on “increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix” [3] . On a local scale, however, these benefits are rarely visible. The machinery runs on petrol, as do the factories, and the transport chain is also largely unsustainable. When evaluating the process of lithium brine mining, it is sustainable that solar and wind power is used to naturally evaporate the water from the brine pools. This method, however, cannot cope with sudden changes in demand and as the demand and value increase, companies might resort to heating the brine up to accelerate the evaporation process which is unsustainable [65] . Mining companies in the Lithium Triangle, such as Albemarle and SQM, report that they work on increasing the use of renewable energy in their operation, but this transition takes time [64,67] .  5.1.8 Decent work and economic growth The jobs created by the mining industry can help achieve higher economic productivity in the area. Also, building visitor centra, for example, could bring economic growth to the area through increased (geo)tourism. This contributes to target 8.1: “(...) gross domestic growth (...) in the least developed countries” [3] . The addition of technological upgrading and innovation in the mining sector adds value to the labour [3] . This benefits target 8.2: “Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation (...)” [3] . Prerequisite for any benefits is that the companies hire people from the area and that the profits do not disappear to overseas companies. This SDG is closely intertwined with SDG 1 ’no poverty’ and as discussed in that section, fair salaries and partnerships with localities are still the exception rather than the rule. Similar to SDG 1, this SDG has a high potential to positively contribute to the goal, but requires implementation of strategies to enforce cooperation. It is also important to focus on target 8.4: “Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation (...)” [3] . Decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation can be a real challenge when it comes to making profits from mined resources.  5.1.9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure Building infrastructures, as discussed in section 3.2, negatively affects the environment. However, certain types, such as access roads, could benefit target 9.1: “Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being” [3] . Any other benefits would most likely come from the technological advancements made in the industry that spills over to communities through employment and potential collaboration with localities. Joint ventures and targeted infrastructure development could be realised with the help of mining companies and governing bodies. Local research and development projects could be supported with data and knowledge and eventually lead to innovation and capacity building [69] . In addition, the lithium brine mining industry is still developing and in need of better and more efficient technologies as the current practices are time-inefficient. A synergy between technological advancements and sustainable practices, for example, higher water efficiency or the use of desalinated sea water could be found and would certainly aid in minimising the overall impact of the industry in the area.  5.1.10 Reduced inequalities Coupled to SDGs 1 and 8 is the reduction of inequalities. Target 10.1 aims to: “establish and sustain a baseline welfare in an area that is in the bottom 40% of the population in terms of welfare and economic growth”  and target 10.2 focuses on: “promoting inclusion of all people, irrespective of age, sex, gender, race or economic other status” [3] . By employing marginalised communities of different ethnicity and gender, in combination with the measurements described in sections 1 and 8, inequalities could be reduced through the mining industry [70] . Mining companies report that they pay special attention to this goal and put in extra effort to hire marginalised communities [64,67] . However, in their reports there is no segregation of data for age, race and economic status and independent fact checks of their claims are nonexistent. Failing to minimise the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity could increase inequalities even further.  5.1.11 Sustainable cities and communities Target 11.4 of this goal constitutes: “strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage” [3] . The mining industry negatively affects this target by occupying land surface, destroying geological heritage and conflicting with indigenous communities and their cultural and natural heritage in the Andean Altiplano [71] . All mining industries impact the landscape and lithium brine mining is no exception. It is impossible to conduct mining activities without altering the landscape, but it is possible to minimise the effects, for example by planning land use with the life span of the mine in mind and thinking ahead of what the area will and could become after mining stops [70] .  5.1.12 Responsible consumption and production Nearly all targets of this goal are impacted through the effects on geodiversity, such as 12.2 and 12.4 on environmentally sound management and 12.5 on reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction and recycling, but they can also be minimised through sustainable management [3] . The use of brine water and natural evaporation methods is a form of responsible consumption to produce lithium. The brine was not used for any other purposes and the evaporation occurs without additional energy consumption. The use of fossil freshwater reserves, however, is not sustainable, nor is the extraction of a non-renewable resource (lithium). It is debatable whether the extraction of a mineral that is otherwise not used and will be used to replace worse energy carriers is the better of two evils, but it is likely that the extraction of freshwater is harming the environment and therefore not sustainable. Also, the generated waste should be minimised and treated to prevent contamination. Overall, the lithium brine mining practice has the potential to be relatively sustainable, but this requires strict implementation of measurements that minimise water use, chemicals, waste and emissions (transport) and make the production process as efficient as possible with the smallest possible impact on the environment [3] . Albemarle and SQM state in their sustainability reports that they are working on meeting the targets for this goal through, among others, implementation of wastewater treatment protocols, recycling freshwater and reducing carbon emissions in the final stage of lithium processing [64,67] .  5.1.13 Climate action The first target of SDG 13 is: “strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and disasters in all countries” [3] . The area from which freshwater is extracted is very arid and will face more extreme weather events, like droughts, due to climate change [72] . In addition, depletion of freshwater resources and (permanent) changes made to the hydrological dynamics severely affect the climate resilience of the area. From a broad perspective, the extraction of lithium aids the green energy revolution and therewith positively impacts climate action. But, if you focus on the Andean Altiplano, not much is changing in terms of “taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”. The benefits of the extraction appear to be centralised in the more developed countries, in the “global North”, whereas the environmental impacts are left in the country of origin, in the “global South”.  5.1.14 Life below water This SDG only applies to oceans, seas and marine resources. There were no effects found of lithium brine mining on geodiversity that impact these environments and therefore no connections to any targets or indicators for this goal were identified. However, Albemarle announced plans to build a pipeline and desalinisation plant in Northern Chile to bring desalinated water to the mining area [73] . Although this is something of the future, it could potentially impact the marine life at the desalinisation plant.  5.1.15 Life on land The targets that are affected most are 15.3 on land degradation, 15.4 on conservation of mountain ecosystems and 15.5 on destruction of natural habitat and extinction of threatened species [3] . The effects responsible are fragmentation and destruction of habitats, water and soil degradation and water shortages. The endemic species that depend on the wetlands and unique characteristics of the mixing zone are threatened by shifts in the hydrological dynamics. Terrestrial ecosystems are pushed to extreme states by the practice of mining and significant action is required to reduce the degradation of the environment.  5.1.16 Peace, justice and strong institutions Social conflict has been associated with indigenous communities and lithium exploitation because the exploitation areas often coincide with territories of indigenous people [71,74] . This is against target 16.1: “Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere” [3] . In Argentina, for example, lithium production is not that different from other mining operations in the sense that foreign companies settle in the area (effect: occupation of land), placing indigenous populations in a fragile and unequal position [74] . Correa and Javiera [75]  refer to this as “colonialist extractivism” and report a rise of socio-environmental conflicts in the area of Salar de Atacama. Pragier et al. [71]  stresses that if indigenous communities are not fairly represented in territorial legislation development, they can resort to violent action strategies to defend their right to autonomy. This strongly relates to target 16.6: “Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels” [3] . Governing bodies have the responsibility to represent all stakeholders evenly. SDG 16 is connected to nearly all other SDGs and highly dependent on environmental management policies from governing bodies and mining companies. Chile, for example, is the only country in the world where water sources are privatised. This was enforced during the reign of Pinochet (1973-’90) and enshrined in the constitution. As a result, water was seen as an economic good and extractive industries were prioritised over the rights of communities to water. After a long period of protests, a new constitution was presented on July 4th 2022 in which the privatisation of water was dismantled to ensure fair access and distribution of their water sources [76] . Although this was rejected on September 4th, 2022 [77] , the initial proposition is now being revised [78] . One step further would be to recognise water bodies as legal entities with rights, so they can be defended in court and therewith protected from pollution and depletion. This has happened with several rivers around the world, such as the Vilcabamba in Ecuador and the Atrato in Colombia [79] . These examples illustrate how crucial strong governments and institutions are for sustainable management. In the previous sections, it has been addressed that mining companies have the potential to create a positive impact. If this is ensured, it can result in peaceful and inclusive societies that work together with effective institutions to promote sustainable development. This would contribute to target 16.7: “ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making” [3] . However, there is a long list of conditions before this is functional. For example, mining companies currently do not allow public access to their data about water use and local governing bodies do not have the resources to enforce this information [20] . This is against target 16.10: “Ensure public access to information (...)” [3] . Without openness in data sharing and collaboration between mining companies, governing bodies and communities, the mining companies are free to operate in secret at the cost of the environment and local communities [65] .  5.1.17 Partnerships for the goals The lithium brine mining industry has the potential to positively contribute to 13 targets associated with this goal. Through partnerships on a local, national and global level, policy coherence for sustainable development can be enhanced. Benefits of these partnerships include sharing knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources and a significant increase in the availability of high-quality data and information on the environmental impact of lithium brine mining. The restraining factors for this goal are partly embedded in SDG 16 and comprise a deficit of legislation, lack of ownership and responsibility of mining companies and lack of partnerships on all levels [20,80] . Therefore, governing principles should be aimed at policy, legal framework, risk-sharing, the environment and putting people first [69] . Within these focus areas, governments should integrate and maintain standards for transparency, fairness, participation, accountability, efficiency and sustainable development [81] . Rather than allowing demand and regulatory environment to frame the research agenda, the agenda should be based upon values and norms of sustainable development. This means that meeting one SDG does not ratify trade-offs for other SDGs. Partnerships between companies, governing bodies and communities on all levels are essential in reaching the SDGs [80] . Additionally, universities and learning institutions can aid professional and technological advancements in the industry, leading to more sustainable practices. Ideally, a multi-stakeholder dialogue from local to national and international levels can form the foundation for a discussion about integrating all SDGs in the mining industry [70] . An important missing factor in management practices is the incorporation of geodiversity. If the environment has been accounted for, the focus generally only lies on biodiversity and perhaps on ecosystem services. Geodiversity and its variables are largely overlooked in conservation practices, impact assessments and management strategies. Including geodiversity into legislative frameworks and monitoring programmes should be a priority to meet target 17.19: “build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries” [3] .    6 Monitoring is key This review started with an overview of the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity in the Andean Altiplano in Section 4 . As Table 1  shows, there is a wide range of effects and all EGV classes are impacted. The most stress is on the hydrology, especially on freshwater. The quantity and quality of water are under threat as a result of hydrodynamical changes following the extraction of brine water, and the pollution of freshwater by waste. If the effects on geodiversity are minimised, the unique and vulnerable geo- and biodiversity of the Andean Altiplano can be protected and the services provided to indigenous communities (e.g. freshwater provision, geotourism and salt production) can be sustained. To understand how geodiversity in the Andean Altiplano has changed and is still changing as a result of brine mining practices, monitoring trends in geodiversity change is key. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative studies concerning the environmental impact of brine mining and no baseline studies exist in the Andean Altiplano to measure and monitor the effects on geodiversity [82] . This makes it difficult to distinguish how much water stress is caused by lithium brine mining or other factors, such as climate change or the tourism industry. One approach is to conduct a timeline analysis on, for example, mining activities, water use and changes in hydrodynamics. Remote sensing has already been applied for land use and land cover change analyses in the area [83] . Given the intensive use of water for lithium brine mining, data on water consumption is especially important. Another approach is to continue to look for unknown or unexpected effects, as brine mining is a relatively new practice and long-term impacts might not be visible yet. In addition, the circumstances, e.g. the extraction rates and the climate, are changing as well, which might lead to additional effects. However, for monitoring to be successful, it should be incorporated into sustainable management strategies by mining companies and governments. Indicators, based on the EGVs’s are needed to guide monitoring targets and analyse trends. This is where another large gap exists. Geodiversity is not (explicitly) incorporated in local, national or global sustainable management policies, whereas the links between the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity and its connection to the SDGs in the Andean Altiplano are essential. The second part of this review, Section 5 , focused on how the effects on geodiversity influence the SDGs and their targets. As Fig. 6  shows, apart from SDG 14, all SDGs are influenced by the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity in one or more ways. Research shows that a systematic approach to reach the SDGs is not enough and could even trigger trade-offs due to the linkages and interdependencies between goals and targets [84] . Focusing on one goal at a time can result in undermining and counteracting other goals, as shown in this review: the depletion of water sources as a result of focus on the extraction of lithium for batteries.  7 The way forward The environmental effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity in the Andean Altiplano influence all EGVs. It is demonstrated that the effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity influence all SDGs, except 14. The extraction of lithium brine, geodiversity and the SDGs are shown to be intricately connected. The identified links between the impact on geodiversity and the SDGs form an important foundation for the development of sustainable brine mining in the Andean Altiplano. This review emphasises the urgent need for monitoring and quantitative measurement of geodiversity change as a result of brine mining practices. Furthermore, it concludes that a monitoring framework is needed, consisting of in-situ and remote sensing analysis, that include indicators and targets. This, however, requires partnerships between mining companies, governing bodies and communities as well as guidelines that are effective and targeted to independent monitoring and research. Recognising the importance of geodiversity is therein essential. This will advance the development of integrative sustainable management, minimise the environmental effects of lithium brine mining on geodiversity, and optimise synergies between SDGs. The driving force behind the lithium mining practices is of a global scale and in service of the green energy revolution. The mining of resources such as lithium is deeply embedded in our consumption economy. The lithium mining industry is so powerful that it has the potential to cause ecosystem collapse, irreversible environmental degradation, inequality, conflict and displaced populations when its resources are misused or managed poorly. When managed sustainably, however, it also has the potential to mobilise significant human, physical, financial and technological resources to advance the SDGs. Deeper involvement of governing bodies and inclusion of indigenous communities can support the mining companies into a sustainable future by setting up guidelines and production directives to protect the geodiversity of the area from which lithium is mined. In such future, geodiversity is valued and the SDGs are realised through partnerships and integrative management.  CRediT authorship contribution statement E.S.
