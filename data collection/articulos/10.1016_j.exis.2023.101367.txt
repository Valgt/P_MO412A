                  This literature review aimed at analyzing the link between urban mining and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It seeks to answer the questions: "Does published evidence indicate a relationship between the SDGs and urban mining?", and, if so, "Does the relationship represent a synergy or a trade-off?". The results of this enquiry demonstrate the connection between urban mining and e-waste in the context of the SDG targets for sustainable cities, highlighting convergence between arrangements stemming from different technologies. This suggests that certain SDGs can guide management in a broader and systemic approach, whereby policy-makers can benefit in their daily decision-making. The article stresses the need for social engagement in recycling and reusing processes, as well as the need for an interdisciplinary approach to reach the SDGs' targets for a better future and cleaner cities. The study found a strong connection with some of the targets (6.3, 8.4, 9.4, 9.5, 12.4, and 12.5) and very little connection with others (SDGs 1–5, 10, 14, and 15).

This literature review aimed at analyzing the link between urban mining and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It seeks to answer the questions: "Does published evidence indicate a relationship between the SDGs and urban mining?", and, if so, "Does the relationship represent a synergy or a trade-off?". The results of this enquiry demonstrate the connection between urban mining and e-waste in the context of the SDG targets for sustainable cities, highlighting convergence between arrangements stemming from different technologies. This suggests that certain SDGs can guide management in a broader and systemic approach, whereby policy-makers can benefit in their daily decision-making. The article stresses the need for social engagement in recycling and reusing processes, as well as the need for an interdisciplinary approach to reach the SDGs' targets for a better future and cleaner cities. The study found a strong connection with some of the targets (6.3, 8.4, 9.4, 9.5, 12.4, and 12.5) and very little connection with others (SDGs 1–5, 10, 14, and 15).

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets goals and targets to promote poverty eradication, economic growth, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and peace for all by 2030 (Nhamo et al., 2021 ). The resulting SDGs thus represent a global agenda for sustainable development that affects multiple areas of human activity. The interdisciplinarity of the SDGs, and the relations between them, have been the focus of numerous studies in different fields which seek to describe the complex phenomenon of sustainability. A number of these studies address urban mining and its links with different aspects of the SDGs (Monteiro et al., 2019 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2021a ,b ; Alves et al., 2022 ). One of the prominent topics within sustainable development is the condition of cities, including the recycling of waste, and how to balance the economic progress of specific industries, such as civil construction, with the preservation of natural resources. In urban areas, the 2030 Agenda targets waste management, including landfill sites (Ferdous et al., 2021 ), food waste, plastic, and packaging materials (Silva et al., 2017 ; Ghimire et al., 2020 ; Diep et al., 2021 ; Ferdous et al., 2021 ). However, the literature highlights electronic waste (e-waste) and construction and demolition waste (CDW) as the main causes of concern in urban areas (Funari et al., 2015 ; Kanhai et al., 2021 ). The generation rate of e-waste worldwide is three times higher than all other types of waste (Kumar et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). As Martins et al. (2021a)  observe, the problem of the management and recycling of spent Li-ion batteries from vehicles is directly relevant to SDGs 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13, and is one form of climate action urgently needed in regions such as China, Europe, and the USA — regions which represent 50 % of global CO2  emission (Martins et al., 2021a ). There is currently a dearth of literature which looks at urban solid waste and urban mining in the context of the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda. In the context of this manuscript, urban solid waste  refers to all types of waste materials generated by human activities in urban areas (or nearby); it includes waste from households, urban cleaning, commercial establishments and service providers, basic sanitation, industry, health services, civil construction, agroforestry, transport services, and mining. The term urban mining  refers to the recovery of valuable materials and the coordination of material, information, and services which enable value recovery from industrial and urban activities. Since they are the result of human activity, these waste materials may be considered as man-made ores  (also known as anthropogenic sources) (Botelho Junior et al., 2021d ). This definition of urban mining follows the usage adopted by Kirchherr et al. (2017)  and Xavier et al. (2023)  and includes e-waste and CDW. Urban mining is closely linked to the concept of the circular economy: both seek to promote sustainable resource use and reduce waste. The aim of the circular economy is to close the loop of materials production by reusing, reducing, and recycling waste, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. It aims to minimize waste and pollution by promoting the use of renewable resources, reducing the use of non-renewable resources, and increasing resource-use efficiency. Overall, the combination of circular economy and urban mining can help to reduce the environmental impact of resource extraction, conserve natural resources, and promote sustainable economic growth (Burneoet al., 2020 ; Singh et al., 2020 ; Kirchherr, 2022 ). This article takes the form of a literature review to examine the connection between the SDGs and urban mining. As described above, urban mining is seen to reduce or minimize the use of minerals by recycling and reusing all non-renewable materials from cities, providing a better quality of life for their inhabitants, while the SDGs are seen as practical guidelines that can help change processes and policies towards a cleaner and more sustainable society, not least by building public pressure in favor of sustainable actions. The SDGs cover a wide diversity of themes; they call for interdisciplinary research, seeking a broader comprehension of the wicked problems involved in promoting sustainability. Interdisciplinarity also plays an important role when the research objective is to scrutinize the potential, formats, and consequences of urban mining. Urban mining can be a silver bullet which responds to multiple environmental problems in urban settings. Effective waste management (collecting, transporting, processing, and disposing of waste) and urban mining are crucial for creating a sustainable and circular economy. By recirculating resources from waste streams, we can reduce our dependence on finite resources, minimize the environmental impact of resource extraction, and create new economic opportunities for businesses and communities.  2 National policies for urban mining Different countries have different waste policies based on the specific characteristics of the countries, culture, economy, education, and types of waste generated. Nevertheless, the majority of strategies and actions adopted worldwide focus on circularity and sustainability using a closed loop model (Calvo-Porral and Lévy-Mangin, 2020 ; Testa et al., 2020 ). National policies and international agreements are crucial to improving collection, treatment, and recycling rates with the aim of achieving a circular economy. In general, such policies and agreements are relatively well established in developed regions such as Europe, Oceania, and North America, while many developing regions (such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa) lack suitable policies and infrastructure, impacting on the potential to achieve sustainable cities. Among the many forms of urban solid waste, e-waste and construction waste have been the focus of particular attention and concern (Kumar et al., 2017 ; Huang et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). The construction sector is responsible for the heaviest and most voluminous waste generated in the world. CDW has been the subject of policies and international agreements to reduce the amount of such waste deposited in landfills (Zhang et al., 2020 ), with recycling and reuse rates of up to 70–95 % in developed countries (Huang et al., 2018 ). Meanwhile, the rate at which e-waste is being generated is three times higher than other types of waste (Kumar et al., 2017 ), with an increase of 37 % of e-waste generation per capita from 2010 to 2019, and further growth of up to 5 % per year. About 53.6 Mt of e-waste was generated globally (2019), where 22.4 % was generated in Europe (Borthakur 2015 ; Balde et al., 2017 ; (Forti et al., 2020 ). The European Union (EU) issued its first e-waste directive in 2002 (Directive 2002/96/EC) to implement take-back systems. This directive was replaced by Directive 2012/19/EU in 2012, to meet the EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) principle aimed at the reuse and recycling of materials, and the reduction of e-waste disposal in landfill sites (European Parliament, 2012 ). The average amount of e-waste collected per capita increased from 7 kg (2011) to 9.3 kg (2018), with some countries achieving up to 80–90 % of recovery and recycling/reuse rates of electronic devices (European Parliament, 2012 ; Eurostat, 2021 ). However, rates vary considerably among the countries of the EU. For instance, the directive target of 45 % for the collection of e-waste was achieved by the U.K. from 2016 to 2018 (i.e. prior to Brexit), but not by Italy (Eurostat 2021 ). According to Forti et al. (2020) , only three countries achieved the targets of the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive. Turning to the example of the USA, Baldé et al. (2019)  state that it is responsible for 30 % of global construction waste, with a recycling rate of up to 70 %. Legislation is enacted at the state level, leading to some variation across the country. In the 1960s and 1970s, for instance, eight US states established a Solid Waste Disposal policy. Currently, most states follow the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, the main legislation covering the generation and disposal of construction waste (Aslam et al., 2020 ). The USA is the richest country on the American continent and also the main generator of e-waste. Such waste is considered non-hazardous, and the states and municipalities are responsible for its management (Borthakur and Govind, 2017 ). The first state to implement an e-waste policy was California, in 2003; in 2004, Maine enacted a law based on EPR which shared responsibility among all stakeholders. The District of Columbia and 25 other states implemented laws focused on e-waste in 2015 (Ilankoon et al., 2018 ; Shittu et al., 2021 ). The situation is similar in Oceania. In Australia, 27 million tons of construction waste was generated in 2019–2020, some 61 % higher than in 2006–2007. Although the recycling rate has risen to 47 %, CDW remains the largest source of waste in the country (Shooshtarian et al., 2022 ). Policies to tackle waste began in the 1990s with the National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Strategy. In 2009, the Australian National Waste Policy was implemented, providing continuous support to all stakeholders with the aim of achieving an 80 % recycling rate (Dias, 2019 ). Two states — South Australia and Victoria — banned e-waste being deposited in landfill (Pickin et al., 2018 ). Nationally, the collection of e-waste has reached 90% in Australia as a result of the national policy (Australia Department of Agriculture, 2021 ). In New Zealand, there are two piece of relevant legislation: the Building Act (2004), which calls for “the efficient and sustainable use of materials” and “the reduction of waste during the construction process”; and the Waste Management Act (2008), which encourages a reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill (Purchase et al., 2021 ). In China, about 30–40 % of waste generated is from the construction sector, and its management has not improved substantially since the 1990s. The absence of national policies has led to poor management and low levels of reuse of construction waste (Huang et al., 2018 ) — a situation which reflects the general trend across Asia (Hoang et al., 2020 ). In India, the implementation of CDW Waste Management Rules in 2016 has resulted in slight improvements, but interest in recycling remains low (Jain, 2021 ). Asia is the main generator of e-waste, being responsible for 46.5 % of the global total (Forti et al., 2020 ). China is the leading producer, with e-waste increasing at a rate of 20 % per year (Cao et al., 2018 ): it is expected to generate 28.4 million tons of e-waste in 2030 (Borthakur, 2020 ). In addition, China has received vast amounts of e-waste from other countries for recycling under payment, taking in 350 million tons of e-waste over the course of 40 years (Wong, 2018 ). In 2000, the government implemented the “Ban on WEEE for managing waste import", becoming the first country in Asia to set a national policy focused on a circular economy (Patil and Ramakrishna, 2020 ). The national policies implemented in the subsequent years resulted in an increase in collection and recycling rates, with formal recycling rates rising from 38.6 % (2013) to 62.2 % (2017) (Song et al., 2019 ). Borthakur (2020)  argues that Chinese policies have focused on the economic importance of recycling, as e-waste can be used as a secondary source of materials. This clearly demonstrates the difference between e-waste and construction waste policies. Just over a third of countries in Latin America have national legislation, policies, or regulations for e-waste (Forti et al., 2020 ; The World Bank, 2020 ). Brazil is the largest generator of e-waste in Latin America. With a GDP 50 % higher than that of Mexico, it produces twice as much e-waste as Mexico and is responsible for almost 40% of e-waste generated in Latin America, demonstrating the country's importance in the global scenario (Castro et al., 2023 ). The National Policy of Solid Wastes, also known as the Brazilian Policy on Solid Waste (Law 12.305, 2010), classifies waste from households and urban cleaning as urban solid waste (LEI No 12.305, DE 2 DE AGOSTO DE 2010, 2010). All stakeholders, including federal, state, and municipal governments as well as the private sector, must guarantee the environmentally sound and integrated management of the solid waste generated (directly or indirectly). Generators of waste must elaborate a management plan for that waste (Law 12.305, Cap. 2, Seção V, Art. 20) by sharing responsibility for the product life cycle (Law 12.305, Cap. 3, Seção II) (LEI No 12.305, DE 2 DE AGOSTO DE 2010, 2010), with a mandatory reverse logistics system focused on electronic household products and their components (DECRETO No 10.240, DE 12 DE FEVEREIRO DE 2020, 2020).  3 Objectives and methodology The main objective of this work is to analyze the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets within the context of urban mining, to answer two questions: "Does published evidence indicate a relationship between the SDGs and urban mining?", and, if so, "Does the relationship represent a synergy or a trade-off?". A systematic literature review was carried out, based on a search in Scopus for the keywords "urban mining" and "man-made ores" (a previously used expression related to waste's anthropogenic origins) with the combinations of words associated with each goal/target. The list of keywords used in the Scopus search is depicted in Table S1. The expression “man-made ore” is generic, and older than the term “anthropogenic”; it relates to all potential sources of materials from human activity. Papers which used the term anthropogenic were also considered. The methodology was based on review articles mapping the links between sustainable development and recycling, waste management, mining, energy, and sanitation (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ; Monteiro et al., 2019 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2021b ; Diep et al., 2021 ; Martins et al., 2021a ,b; Parikh et al., 2021 ). As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time that urban mining has been systematically classified according to the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs. For the purposes of this paper, urban mining is defined as the recovery of valuable materials from industrial and urban activities, referred to here as man-made ores (Kirchherr et al., 2017 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2021d ; Xavier et al., 2023 ). This includes e-waste (electronic waste) and construction waste (CDW), which involve processes related to the production of secondary materials from urban solid waste (Botelho Junior et al., 2021c ). The structure of the literature review undertaken is depicted in Fig. 1  . The search was performed using the “advanced search” tool of Scopus for publications between 2015 and 2020, which covers the period from the launch of the SDGs to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and before COP26. The manuscripts were classified by language (English only), type of article (original or review), and theme (defined in the title and/or abstract before complete analysis). First, the published papers were categorized by SDGs according to the specific keyword string used for each of the goals. A bibliometric analysis of the overall academic output over time was performed. In the second stage, the papers were thoroughly evaluated, double checking the classification and re-assigning the papers to the SDGs, according to the evidence of linkage. The categorization was conducted by the authors of the present paper using a similar method to that employed by Fuso Nerini et al. (2018) . The data obtained was evaluated as to whether there was a call for action, synergies, or trade-offs to SDGs, goals, and targets. An interaction matrix was constructed, with the selected manuscripts in the rows and the SDGs in the columns (Diep et al., 2021 ; Nhamo et al., 2021 ). The results were then reviewed and discussed for each SDG. The current practices for e-waste recycling and new technologies beyond the state of the art are presented later in this paper; future approaches linking recycling technologies and sustainable development are also discussed. The present study is thus delineated by the currently available data on e-waste technologies, discussions about sustainable development in urban mining, and new trends published in scientific journals.  4 Results and discussion 4.1 Overview of results and identification of the main SDGs for urban mining The bibliometric analysis was carried out by searching the Scopus database, and the keywords combination for each SDG is presented in Table S1. Fig. 2   shows the number of publications from 2015 to 2020, as identified by the keyword search of the Scopus database. In total, 464 manuscripts were identified, of which 26 % (119) were linked to SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation ), 19 % (86) were linked to SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth ), and 16 % (74) were linked to SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure ). There is thus a strong relationship between these goals and urban mining, with most of the works related to technologies for recycling or management, which will be discussed further. There were also some linkages with SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production ), SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals ), SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions ), SDG 13 (Climate action ), and SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy ). All the other SDGs have at best a weak connection to urban mining in the literature review. In the case of SDG 4 (Quality education ) and SDG 14 (Life below water ), there was no evidence of any link with urban solid waste. It could be argued that schools have a role to play, by educating the population from the earliest years about the problem of waste and how to tackle it. For example, Wang and Ge (2020)  suggest that governmental policies should include the population in the recycling process as a form of belonging, while Ottoni et al. (2020)  argue that educational campaigns are essential for waste management and to achieve a circular economy. Similarly in the case of SDG 14, there was no evidence in the literature review of a direct connection with the potential impact of urban waste on the oceans, seas, and marine resources. However, the impact of the collapse of a Brazilian mining dam in 2015, for instance, had several negative impacts on the Doce River, and thus on the ocean. The mining waste stored in dams has increased due to the raise of electronic equipment production, which become a waste in the end-of-life. Such a disaster is an example of the threat of contamination and dangers to marine resources which mining activities can pose (Milanez et al., 2021 ). Since the launch of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, interest in the topic of urban mining has grown. In the study, an increasing association was observed between urban mining and the SDGs after 2017, especially for SDGs 6, 8, 9, and 12 (Fig. 3  ). The recent interest is also associated with the efforts to use urban waste as a secondary source of materials, to reduce the dependency on natural resources; in other words, to get wealth from waste  (Kumar et al., 2017 ). There has been a rising demand for metals to supply the electronics industry, including for batteries, printed circuit boards, LED lamps and screens, photovoltaic panels, and neodymium magnets, which puts pressure on production from primary sources. It is anticipated that urban mining will reduce that pressure on natural sources (Ali et al., 2017 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2021b ). In the case of waste from the construction sector, more waste is generated because the quality of materials has declined; waste management is a well-known concept, but the recycling rate in the industry is low, and it takes a long time to become a residue (10–50 years depending on the material) (Kakkos et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ; Purchase et al., 2021 ). There are also examples of recycling waste from mining activities as a source of raw materials to supply the market (Ali et al., 2017 ; Fernandes and Ribeiro, 2017 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2018 ; Monteiro et al., 2019 ; Tayebi-Khorami et al., 2019 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2021b ). Among the manuscripts identified by the literature review, 25.6 % are related to SDG 6, 18.5 % to SDG 8, and 15.9 % and 11 % are related to SDG 9 and 12, respectively. Concerns about water consumption and supply, wastewater, and groundwater treatment (SDG 6) are directly related to the impacts of urban solid wastes (Ong et al., 2018 ; Heisel and Rau-Oberhuber, 2020 ). In the case of SDGs 8 and 9, urban mining has the potential to create new jobs and wealth through recycling (Thakur and Kumar, 2020 ). For SDG 12, on the other hand, studies identified are related to the reduced use of raw materials for construction and other urban activities and the recycling of waste to provide new products (Ottoni et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). The analysis of the SDGs demonstrated that the targets 6.3, 8.4, 9.4, 9.5, 12.4, and 12.5 are linked to all works found in the present literature review. The selected papers were further categorized for each SDG target using a specialist consensus panel. Of the 169 targets, 37 (21%) had connections with published literature. The major connections refer to SDGs 8, 9, 11 and 12 (Fig. 4  ). The links identified between SDG targets and the papers were loaded into Gephi software, which produced a network graph portrayed in Fig. 5  . It excluded two targets which are closely connected to sustainable patterns on the supply chain, 12.4 and 12.5, because they already display a link with every work related to urban mining. At the second level of intensity, six main clusters were highlighted using the modularity class algorithm available in Gephi presets. Each cluster has a focal point in one of the following targets: 9.4, 9.5, 11.3, 11.6, 12.2, and 8.2. This shows the targets that are most connected with the reviewed papers in terms of the number of papers linked to each target. At the third level of intensity, we find papers that are connected to several other targets in an indirect or more subtle manner. Thus, three tiers of linkages were identified between the SDGs and the urban mining theme, as represented in Table 1  . As depicted in Table 1 , the Tier 2 targets appear to be concentrated in two areas:1) SDG 9 (innovation and retrofit industries-related works), where we observed published papers on new methods and calls for research on technologies to optimize the recovery of rare earth metals from end-of-use products;  2) SDG 11 (sustainable cities targets), where we observed several works addressing the recovery of materials from the construction industry, including new techniques and policies for optimizing the recovery of CDW materials and mapping technologies and frameworks for estimating and quantifying the number of construction resources that are available inside buildings.    In a further step, some articles were chosen to highlight the impact of urban mining on each SDG. We observed a significant difference between the initial search for the SDGs through predefined keywords and the categorization of the targets. For instance, 119 papers were identified using the SDG 6 (sanitation) thematic keywords; nevertheless, the actual connection of the papers to sanitation issues was weak, as can be seen in Fig. 5 . In a later section, it was discussed gaps in the literature in order to propose actions for each of the SDGs. The sustainable goals and their respective targets contribute to mitigating the negative social and environmental impacts caused by urban solid waste and promoting the entire recycling chain. Furthermore, social inclusion and economic development may be improved by correctly treating urban solid waste, through job creation and income generation (Fig. 6  ).  4.2 SDGs 1 to 5: no poverty, zero hunger, good health, quality education, and gender equality Especially in cities from the emerging economies of the global south, mainly in Africa and Latin America, urban mining activity already provides thousands of work opportunities (Oteng-Ababio et al., 2014 ; Reddy, 2016 ). However, these activities are disparaged: they are the preserve of people in vulnerable situations of extreme poverty, and the recovery of material from waste is a prime example of “non-decent” work. Waste pickers are usually informal workers operating in difficult conditions, exposed to hazardous materials without health and safety equipment (Ogwueleka and Naveen, 2021 ). In cities outside of the emerging economies context, such as Rome, there is a more up-to-date perception of urban miners as part of a social ecosystem that is responsible for renewing the urban space; nevertheless, there is still a stigma surrounding waste picking, and a call for better working conditions to avoid the marginalization of these workers (Rosa and Cirelli, 2018 ). This is one of the main trade-offs related to urban mining: the informality of scavenging and the lack of access to protection and essential services can have a negative impact on workers, turning urban mining into a poverty-promoting activity rather than a poverty-alleviating opportunity. Traditional public policies can repress workers’ rights and hinder their access to the resources inherent in urban mining (Navarrete-Hernandez and Navarrete-Hernandez, 2018 ). There is thus a call for action towards promoting the ethical and participatory integration of informal workers into waste-recovering activities so that workers receive a living wage and are protected from issues such as exposure to hazardous materials (Reddy, 2016 ). Relatively small public investments can increase efficiency in waste-picking and acknowledge scavengers as essential agents of sustainable development (Navarrete-Hernandez and Navarrete-Hernandez, 2018 ). The link between education and urban mining is manifested in the literature across two main dimensions: (1) literacy for capacity building, and (2) universities as living labs for urban mining. Regarding literacy, there are calls for contextualized education for e-waste recycling, especially in emerging economies (see Gunarathne et al., 2020  for Sri Lanka; Paes et al., 2017  for Brazil). Environmental education directed to a broader public, including informal scavengers, is suggested as one possible measure to build capacity (Gutberlet, 2015 ). Kazançoglu et al. (2020)  argue that shortage of skills and lack of education among workers in the circular economy represent the main barriers to effective urban mining. The call for education and training is not restricted to workers, but also extends to households and students. Ravindra and Mor (2019)  highlight that household e-waste is poorly managed by an unorganized industry, leading to a lack of efficiency and environmental and health risks (Ravindra and Mor 2019 ). Educational initiatives for the community, including awareness of local recycling hotspots, are indicators of successful circular economy integration (Ottoni et al., 2020 ). From a school-level perspective, a public policy aimed at promoting awareness among students of the urgency of recycling should be accompanied by practical application: students can and should collaborate with the recovering of materials (Wang and Ge, 2020 ). From a higher-education perspective, evidence highlights the potential of universities to act as test beds for urban mining. Bonoli et al. (2018)  offer a case study of Bologna University, which developed a living lab for circular economy practices linked to e-waste recovery and restoration. This potential is grounded in the assumption that university faculties can harness and mobilize dispersed knowledge from researchers and students; trials can be run using simulations of cities, and once results are validated, schemes can be replicated at scale, such as in municipalities (Bonoli et al., 2018 ). Zhang et al. (2019)  also highlight university campuses and even students’ households as potential sites for urban mining, with large quantities of unused electronic equipment that can be mapped and recycled. Gender equality (SDG 5) is also relevant in urban mining. The literature reviewed included several studies which address this issue in the context of African countries such as Nigeria (Nzeadibe and Adama, 2015 ).  4.3 SDGs 6 and 7: clean water and sanitation and affordable and clean energy The close connection between sanitation goals and urban mining manifests itself in relation to environmental contamination and health hazards. E-waste that is deposited in landfill sites can release toxic compounds that contaminate water bodies and groundwater reservoirs, which presents a serious environmental and health challenge (Luhar and Luhar, 2019 ; Arya and Kumar, 2020a ). Water treatment plants cannot always remove these pollutant metal residuals. Improving technologies and policies can have a two-fold impact, both enhancing water quality and creating economic opportunities for the recovery of valuable materials. For instance, samples from the Na Grobli water treatment plant in Wrocław (Poland) contained large amounts of iron and manganese that could be recovered through techniques of acid leaching and hydroxide precipitation (Ong et al., 2018 ). In another example of effluent recovery, Sinha et al. (2020)  explored a new galvanization waste treatment process that can be performed to recover zinc waste with zero effluent generation. At the household level, recovery can take different forms; for instance, waste cooking oil can be recovered and used to produce biofuels while helping reduce pollution and GHG emissions (Tsai, 2019 ). The connection between waste recovery and energy is present in other contexts and brings with it new possibilities (Cesaro and Belgiorno, 2020 ). While urban mining is often referred to mainly in terms of e-waste, it is possible to take a broader perspective and consider, for example, residues from organic sources, forging a synergistic link between the waste-recovery principles of urban mining and the production of biofuels as a substitute to fossil fuel energy generation. Some countries have already begun replacing fossil fuels with fuel from solid waste (up to as much as 40 %), while others could use this method to halve the amount of waste sent to landfill (Yang et al., 2021 ). Different materials present different possibilities; not only food waste but also other non-metallic waste has the potential to play a relevant role. In a Belgian landfill, materials such as wood, cardboard, and textiles were found to be better suited to energy conversion than to recycling of high-quality materials, due to contamination levels (Quaghebeur et al., 2013 ). Different materials, levels of moisture, degrees of contamination, and sources of waste are relevant when it comes to the economic viability of material-to-energy urban mining (Yang et al., 2021 ). Circular economy principles and assessment tools such as life-cycle assessment, alongside new technologies such as hydrothermal carbonization and supercritical water gasification, can contribute to realizing the potential of refuse-derived energy (Sridhar et al., 2021 ), both in standalone and hybrid systems (Esfilar et al., 2021 ), and can greatly improve the scalability of solutions and foster the achievement of (for example) SDG 7 targets (Esfilar et al., 2021 ).  4.4 SDGs 8 and 9: decent work and economic growth and industry, innovation and infrastructure There are two fundamental aspects of SDGs 8 and 9 which are relevant to our study: the impacts of urban solid waste on workers; and innovations in recycling and recovery of wealth from urban solid waste. As mentioned in Section 4.2  above, hazardous materials in urban solid wastes cause damage to workers' health, from picking to management and recycling. This is a problem particularly in emerging economies, where the presence of hazardous metals in e-waste represents a risk both to individuals handling the waste and to the environment (Gutberlet, 2015 ; Kumar et al., 2017 ; Xavier et al., 2019 ; Ottoni et al., 2020 ). Kanhai et al. (2021)  point out that assessments of the impact of urban waste on human health are rarely prioritized. They make a calculation for the city of Accra, Ghana, which suggests that a change to a more sustainable waste management model would substantially reduce premature deaths caused by air pollution or by occupational hazards, especially in the informal sector (Kanhai et al., 2021 ). Besides the risks from hazardous materials, working conditions can be considered precarious in many emerging economies. In Ecuador, Burneoet al. (2020)  observed that waste pickers lacked any kind of effective organization. They also found that the salary of a formal worker may reach only 31 % of the minimum wage and cover only 17.3 % of the cost of the family shopping basket. For this reason, work in the informal sector is common (Burneoet al., 2020 ). In India, poor working conditions resulted in respiratory diseases and other physical ailments for 76 % of workers (Arya and Kumar, 2020a ). Ravindra and Mor (2019)  reported that poor conditions in informal work have a negative impact on health in Chandigarh, India (Ravindra and Mor 2019 ). The same issue is highlighted in the literature on many emerging countries, including Brazil, China, and African countries (Dai et al., 2019 ; Ottoni et al., 2020 ; Nhamo et al., 2021 ). As depicted in Fig. 5 , the keyword search for SDG 8 highlighted links with the targets 8.3 and 8.8, related to "decent job creation" and "protect labor rights and promote safe and secure working environments", respectively. As presented in Fig. 5 , the outline targets are: "economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading, and innovation" (8.2); "global resource efficiency in consumption and production" (8.4); "upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable" (9.4); and "enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors" (9.5). Thakur and Kumar (2020)  refer to e-waste as "sleeping mines" since these residues may contain up to 50 % iron steel and 13 % non-ferrous metals (Thakur and Kumar, 2020 ), with copper, nickel, gold, and silver content, for instance, being much higher than in natural sources. For this reason, several studies and substantial efforts have been made in developing technologies for recycling and recovering valuable elements (Kumar et al., 2017 ) Ambaye et al., 2020 ; Mählitz et al., 2020 ; Zamprogno Rebello et al., 2020 ; de Oliveira et al., 2021 ; Van Yken et al., 2021 ). Different approaches can be applied to the reuse or recycling of urban solid waste. Assi et al. (2020)  evaluated the reuse of fly ash from municipal solid waste for the treatment of residues contaminated with hazardous materials. This method aimed at zero waste generation, as a residue was used as raw material for another application (Assi et al., 2020 ). In the context of new technological developments, several studies have focused on innovative industrial processes for e-waste recycling to recover valuable metals present in the residue (Gusukuma and Kahhat, 2018 ). For instance, Akcil et al. (2019)  discussed the current technologies for recycling LCD panels, which contain concentrated indium and tin, both considered critical materials by the EU. According to the authors, LCD panels can be considered a secondary source of both elements, with industrial routes to recovery involving thermal, aqueous, and biological processing (pyro-, hydro- and biohydrometallurgical processing) (Akcil et al., 2019 ). E-waste such as LED panels (Cenci et al., 2020 ), fluorescent lamps (Botelho Junior et al., 2021a ), hard disk drives (Talens Peiró et al., 2020 ), Li-ion batteries (Takahashi et al., 2020 ), printed circuit boards (Arya and Kumar, 2020b ), and discarded mobile phones (He et al., 2020 ) all feature in the literature. Several challenges have to be overcome to achieve a sustainable recycling process, such as the use of low-hazard reagents, reduced energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions, decent work conditions, and meeting circular economy principles, as well as national and international policies focused on urban solid waste (Gunarathne et al., 2020 ; Kazançoglu et al., 2020 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2021c ; de Oliveira et al., 2021 ; Martins et al., 2021a ). On the other hand, the literature review demonstrated a high degree of interest in the development of technologies and approaches to solve these problems.  4.5 SDGs 10 to 12: reduced inequalities, sustainable cities, and responsible consumption and production In the literature review undertaken for this study, SDG 10 ("reduce inequality within and among countries ") had almost no links to keywords "urban mining" and "man-made ores". Only the work of Rodrigues (2017)  was found in the search, representing just 0.2 % of the literature review. This suggests a gap in the literature which needs to be filled by the relevant stakeholders — academics/researchers, government agencies, and the private sector, for instance. In the one work identified, the author compared the social issues associated with 20th century diamond mining in Angola with the current scenario in urban areas, arguing that Angolan cities have developed new consumption patterns and structures, which reduce inequalities inside Angola and between Angola and other countries (Rodrigues, 2017 ). The literature review identified links to targets 10.3 and 10.5 in the works of Kazançoglu et al. (2020)  and Ravindra and Mor (2019) . As depicted by these authors, regulations and national policies have the potential to ensure equal opportunities and reduce inequalities. This includes eliminating discriminatory laws and practices to achieve target 10.3 (Kazançoglu et al., 2020 ). In the context of target 10.5, Ravindra and Mor (2019)  argued that implementing environmental rules and regulations improves livable environmental quality. They also stated that granting tax benefits and subsidies to companies will improve the rate of e-waste collection and management (Ravindra and Mor, 2019 ). Regarding SDG 11, the literature review identified links with targets 11.3 (“by 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries”) and 11.6 (“by 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management”), as shown in Fig. 5 . In general, the topic of urban mining addresses the goal of SDG 11, to reuse, recycle, and manage urban solid waste to make cities sustainable (Gutberlet, 2015 ; Powell et al., 2016 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). The literature also reflects concerns about landfill management, given the amount and distinct characteristics of residues stored there. As Powell et al. (2016)  argue, landfill mining has the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reclaim space for human settlements, as well as recovering materials which can be returned to the productive sector. The “urban mining” and “man-made ores” keywords are strongly related to recycling of urban waste to obtain valuable metals. For instance, Akcil et al. (2019)  stated the importance of LCD recycling to obtain critical materials. As noted above, supplies of indium and tin are under threat, and using waste LCD panels as a secondary source of these materials will help meet the demand for sustainable energy production (Akcil et al., 2019 ). According to Srivastava et al. (2020) , bioprocesses are more eco-friendly than chemical recycling processes, making industries inside or closer to big cities more sustainable and improving integration among the stakeholders. Additionally, the reduction of the environmental impact of cities — which is the aim of target 11.6 — goes straight to the heart of urban mining, which increases the effectiveness of municipal waste management and reduces the waste per capita impact (Funari et al., 2020 ; Ottoni et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, it may link with target 11.1 (“by 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums”) and target 11.a (“support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri‑urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning”). Within SDG 12, the keyword search threw up strong links with target 12.2 ("by 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources"), and target 12.5 ("by 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse"). As previously observed for SDG 9, most of the works identified were related to recycling approaches for urban solid waste. Links were observed to targets 12.3, 12.4, 12.7, 12.8, and 12.a. The literature also reports on approaches which see waste management as a secondary source for valuable materials (Ortlepp et al., 2018 ; Cheng et al., 2019 ; Deetman et al., 2020 ; Ottoni et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ; Mollaei et al., 2021 ). According to Thakur and Kumar (2020) , the recycling of e-waste conserves natural resources. Circular economy practices in the construction sector also reduce the environmental footprint of this industry (Kakkos et al., 2020 ), in which the majority of greenhouse gas emissions come from stone, sand, and clay processing (50.8 Gt against the total of 92.0 Gt of global resource footprint) (Circle Economy, 2022 ). In the context of target 12.2, Hu and Poustie (2018)  look at petroleum and steel production, which increased in China more than twofold and almost tenfold (respectively) between 2000 and 2015. In China, where industrial development and economic growth have increased at unprecedented rates (Zeng et al., 2018b ), this resulted in the accelerated depletion of natural resources. Also, the recycling of all parts of Li-ion batteries as part of a closed-loop circular economy improves the sustainable management of natural resources, benefiting the environment and per capita energy consumption (Zeng et al., 2018b ). Targets 12.4 and 12.5 share the top spot in the literature review, forming our Tier 1 (see Table 1 ), with the "urban mining" and "man-made ores" keywords dovetailing with the goal of achieving sustainable consumption and production. Regarding the reduction of waste generation, the literature highlights the importance of the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) for urban solid waste, reducing or eliminating the need for landfill sites (Oteng-Ababio et al., 2014 ; Ghisellini and Ulgiati, 2020 ; Thakur and Kumar, 2020 ). In addition, improvements in technology in the construction and demolition sectors are reflected in waste recycling, reuse, and management (Rašković et al., 2020 ). There is a call for action on recycling e-waste, such as NdFeB permanent magnets and TVs, due to a supply shortage and increased demand (Yang et al., 2017 ; Zeng et al., 2018a ). Given the advance of electric vehicles, recycling will be the key to supplying the chain and meeting the market for green technologies (Botelho Junior et al., 2021c ; Li et al., 2020 ; Martins et al., 2021a ). Another example of the 3Rs in urban mining is the recovery of valuable materials from sewage sludge and municipal solid waste incineration fly ash, which may be a secondary source of materials and at the same time reduce waste generation and the use of landfill (Funari et al., 2015 , 2016 ; Kalmykova et al., 2015 ; Folgueras et al., 2017 ; Assi et al., 2020 ).  4.6 SDGs 13 to 17: climate action, life below water and on land, peace, justice and strong institutions, and partnerships for the goals The systemic approach of the SDGs manifests itself most strongly in the call for climate action: reducing GHG is both the expressed and underlying goal of the whole agenda. This is also relevant to urban waste, since landfills are significant emitters of GHGs around the world (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2019 ). Landfills are usually poorly managed, negatively impact water and land ecosystems, and are places where informal and non-decent work prosper; this connects urban mining with SDGs 14 and 15. The precise linkage with land ecosystems (SDG 15) is that urban mining can reduce or halt environmental degradation in many contexts. Construction and demolition waste, which represents 50 % of all waste produced in cities, hinders ecosystem services, such as water retention and recreation. On the other hand, the same waste can be used to regenerate soils degraded by the clay extraction process, with the addition of waste-recovered phosphorus (Quaghebeur et al., 2013 ). When it comes to mitigating the damage of landfill by converting waste to energy, urban mining can make an excellent contribution to SDG 13′s call for climate action (Margallo et al., 2019 ). Diverting waste away from landfills can improve the negative externalities of a system (landfill) that is hard to make truly sustainable. When there is no other alternative, it might still be possible to improve technologies to mitigate impacts from other sectors by generating energy from biowaste. For instance, a study in Cuenca, Ecuador, identified that waste pickers were responsible for ensuring that 4.61ton CO2 -eq per ton of paper and cardboard does not end up in landfill sites (Burneoet al., 2020 ). At national and international levels, waste recovery connects with SDG 16, which is related to public policies, and with SDG 17, regarding international cooperation. Wheatcroft et al. (2020)  explored the challenges and pathways linked to public policies for using waste for heating and cooling in Europe and found that this is a focal point for reaching the net zero carbon goals of the continent. Pelda et al. (2020)  explore similar impacts by evaluating the benefits of industrial waste heat combined with solar energy generation and examining how this meets district heating demands in German cities. All this information connects climate change to public policy. The role of government as policy fosterer and regulator can greatly improve urban mining by coordinating action more closely with industry and consumers. The new, so-called anthropogenic mining has become a strategic resource, especially for emerging industries, and it should be addressed as a national policy that includes a catalog of mining sites, dynamic evaluation systems, and the development of breakthrough technologies (Zuo et al., 2019 ). Simoni et al. (2015)  evaluated a sustainable livelihoods framework linked to public policy planning in public–private partnerships in the Canton of Zurich. For them, the proximity between different actors is essential to close knowledge gaps, such as state of art e-waste recycling (Simoni et al., 2015 ). In the case of a specific product, such as Li-ion batteries, stakeholders developed product stewardship in Australia that involves the whole chain, from consumer awareness, passing through regulations banning the sending of batteries to landfills, to protocols for handling, processing, and recovery (Boxall et al., 2018 ). From waste management in local and national policies to the international dimension, there is a call for cooperation, for the sharing of technologies and for transnational policies (for instance at the EU level) to both improve urban mining efficiency and mitigate resource shortage risks linked to the concentration of e-waste primary sources in specific countries (Xavier et al., 2019 ; European Commission, 2020 ; Santillán-Saldivar et al., 2021 ). Waste flows connect north and south in a particular perspective of globally displaced externalities: the issue of overseas waste has become noticeable in the past few decades. Oteng-Ababio et al. (2014)  suggested that the higher profile of e-waste and its framing as a valuable urban mining resource would lead to a trend of high-value components being extracted in the global north, and the lower value and toxic items being shipped to countries in the south (Oteng-Ababio et al., 2014 ). This is one of the main trade-offs we find in the SDGs’ mapping of urban mining: its growing relevance can reduce waste streams but simultaneously foster inequality at a global level. Another face of this inequality is that primary sourcing of rare earth metals is a non-sustainable operation, especially if the metals come from emerging economies with loose environmental and decent work legislation (Simoni et al., 2015 ).  4.7 Current technologies for urban mining: “Getting wealth from waste " The literature reports on different strategies and technologies for urban mining. As discussed in Section 2  above, each country has its own policy for urban solid waste, which may include recycling or only management. For illustration, 16–60 % of waste in landfill is composed of construction waste; recycling is a strategy to reduce it, and the management of construction waste is the first step to separating the recyclable materials (Omer et al., 2022 ). The direct recycling of construction waste is still in its infancy in many parts of the world. According to Huang et al. (2018) , recycling, which includes the separation of concrete and cement and the recycling of concrete and aggregate, is more advanced in Japan, Germany, and Singapore than in China (Huang et al., 2018 ). It is possible to incorporate waste aggregates into concrete manufacture (Abera 2022 ). Glass from the construction sector may be used as a replacement for aggregate, improving the properties of concrete, while mixing glass with cement creates a pozzolanic reaction which reduces the emission of greenhouse gases and increases thermal conductivity. Plastics in concrete increase ductility, reduce shrinkage cracks, and result in lighter weight concrete. Tires, rubber, marble, and ceramic wastes from construction are commonly used in concrete production (Purchase et al., 2021 ). Reusing materials is also a strategy applied in the construction sector (Huang et al., 2018 ). Different approaches to e-waste have been evaluated, including metallurgical techniques by thermal (pyrometallurgy) or aqueous (hydrometallurgical) routes. For instance, the Belgian company Umicore has treated up to 250,000 tons per year of e-waste (including laptops, TVs, and mobile phones) by pyrometallurgy. Although the focus is the recovery of copper (as a metallic alloy) and precious metals, a total of 17 metals are obtained in the process, such as indium, tellurium, metals from the platinum group, and tin. The process occurs at 1200 °C by injection of air and fuel (coke as a carbon source may also be used as a reduction agent). Aluminum, iron, silicon, and lead are separated as slag, while the precious metals are dissolved in a liquid metallic phase. In furnaces, the slag is reduced to produce lead metallic. Further thermal treatments occur to produce other co-products. Companies such as Noranda (Canada) and Ronnskar (Sweden) have also treated e-waste by pyrometallurgy (Veit and Bernardes, 2014 ; Awasthi and Li, 2017 ; Ma, 2019 ). Hydrometallurgical processes have advantages compared to pyrometallurgies, such as low energy consumption, production of purer products, lower GHG emissions, lower inputs to the process overall, and the potential to design greener processes. On the other hand, these processes require mechanical operations to release the valuable metals contained in e-waste, and also a large amount of reagents which demand strict process control (Georgi-Maschler et al., 2012 ; Velázquez-Martínez et al., 2019 ; Botelho Junior et al., 2021c ). Moreover, pyrometallurgy techniques may be used as pre-treatment before hydrometallurgy to improve recovery rates (Georgi-Maschler et al., 2012 ). After the Umicore process, for instance, the copper metallic alloy may be purified by acid leaching and further processed as sulfate (Veit and Bernardes, 2014 ). The hydrometallurgy route comprises leaching (solid-liquid reaction where a leaching agent dissolves the metals in the e-waste), and separation and purification techniques (to purify and obtain final products). Acid leaching may be carried out to obtain copper from printed circuit boards (Martins et al., 2021b ), cobalt and lithium from Li-ion batteries (Takahashi et al., 2020 ), and rare earth elements from magnets and lamps (fluorescent and LED) (de Oliveira et al., 2021 ). Alkaline leaching may be carried out for selective leaching of metals or removal of aluminum in batteries (Lv et al., 2018 ). Cyanide and aqua regia also have potential for gold and silver leaching, but cause damage to the health and environment, and have technical feasibility issues. Thiourea, thiosulfate, and halides are other possible leaching agents for e-waste (Veit and Bernardes, 2014 ), while separation and purification may be carried out by ion exchange resins (Botelho Junior et al., 2021c ), solvent extraction (de Amorim et al., 2022 ), or precipitation (Cai et al., 2014 ). The literature reports the use of hydrometallurgy processes to produce a high-value product from the recycling of e-waste, such as new cathode material for the battery market (Choi et al., 2021 ) and nanoparticles (Caldas et al., 2021 ). Other recycling routes and techniques for e-waste have been evaluated, such as biohydrometallurgy (the use of micro-organisms for leaching or separation) (Dolker and Pant, 2019 ), nanotechnology (He et al., 2021 ; Park et al., 2021 ), organic acids (Chen et al., 2021 ), deep-eutectic solvents (Chen et al., 2021 ), ionic liquids (Chen et al., 2021 ), supercritical fluids (Bertuol et al., 2020 ), and electrolysis (Cerrillo-Gonzalez et al., 2020 ).   5 Discussion and future perspectives The problem of urban solid waste has been discussed and studied worldwide. Countries and economic blocs have evaluated and implemented different waste management and recovery policies. Developed countries have well-structured policies and agreements, but developing countries need more suitable regulations and infrastructure, as discussed in Section 2 . However, there is also a need for more literature investigating the links between the SDGs and urban solid waste. It is important to shed light on the main goals and targets related to governmental plans, regulations, and management, which include the social and environmental issues of waste generation and handling, and technological developments for management and recycling. The present literature review has shown a strong link between "urban mining" and "man-made ores" and SDGs 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, and 17, particularly in relation to targets 8.2, 9.4, 9.5, 11.3, 11.6, and 12.4 and 12.5. Of the total 169 targets, 37 have links with urban mining (Fig. 4 ). Most of the works identified are related to recycling efforts to obtain valuable compounds from urban solid waste. The study highlighted a lack of connection with SDGs 1–5, 10, 14, and 15. Only a few works discuss the social impacts of urban solid waste, such as poverty, hunger, education, and gender equality. Urban mining provides many work opportunities, mainly in developing countries, and in this way, it is linked to extreme poverty and non-decent work standards. Informal waste pickers usually lack access to essential services, resulting in the promotion of poverty instead of its alleviation. There is a call for action for informal workers' integrative participation. Regarding education, two main dimensions were identified in the literature review: (1) literacy for capacity building, and (2) universities as living labs for urban mining, in connection with the call for e-waste recycling and environmental education (Gutberlet, 2015 ; Paes et al., 2017 ; Gunarathne et al., 2020 ). Gender roles and inequality also play a role in urban mining (Nzeadibe and Adama, 2015 ), although they did not feature strongly in the literature reviewed. However, some studies claimed that new consumption patterns and structures — following the implementation of policies eliminating discriminatory laws and practices — would guarantee equal opportunities for all and reduce inequalities (Ravindra and Mor, 2019 ; Kazançoglu et al., 2020 ). Despite the dearth of papers in the literature review that related to SDG 11, further evaluations demonstrated a link to urban mining, highlighted by targets 11.3 and 11.6 regarding the reuse, management, and recycling of urban solid waste to make cities sustainable (Liu et al., 2019 ). The literature analysis demonstrated the need for more discussion on the impacts of urban solid waste on land and water, and more detailed analysis of environmental degradations (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2019 ). Often poorly managed, landfills can have several negative impacts on ecosystems. Reusing urban solid waste would reduce the impact on water and land, and contribute to reducing climate change (Boxall et al., 2018 ). There are calls for action related to SDGs 1–5, 10, 14, and 15 regarding "urban mining" and "man-made ores", which need to be explored in future studies if the goals and targets are to be achieved by 2030. Analyses of social impacts of waste generation and handling, impacts on water and land, and the effects of education must be carried out and impacts quantified in order to develop future policies towards sustainable development in the context of urban solid wastes. Dealing with e-waste through recycling as part of urban mining is a way of operationalizing the circular economy focused on sustainable cities and their waste problems. This is part of a new, more systemic and integrated approach, taking a broader perspective with the aim of exploring a range of solutions in order to resolve several problems simultaneously. The proposal is that after the 2030 Agenda and the application of the SDGs, there will be no separation of the environmental, economic, and social universes. Each plan or method for achieving sustainable development should be examined critically as to its breadth and ability to unite different sciences in an interdisciplinary way. In the meantime, the end goal has been identified, and the literature studied here demonstrates that urban mining and the recovery and reuse of e-waste are two important elements in achieving that goal, especially in urban contexts, further improving the health of our cities. The literature review shows that some of the SDG arrangements identified in the articles apply to different areas and sustainable technologies. In this sense, the study has contributed to detailing the epistemological format that these solutions have been building for management, economics, sociology, and engineering, mainly in the description of the application of different technologies. The SDG agenda is claimed to be broad, interdisciplinary, unique, and systemic. However, scientific articles, public and private technologies, and management initiatives related to the SDGs tend to focus on one or two goals. The achievement of true interdisciplinarity takes time, and the process of education and adaptation is necessarily gradual since it requires a change of mindset. The present study will help national policy-makers to build effective public tools to minimize urban solid waste and promote a circular economy. In addition, the results presented here will open research paths and prove that urban mining can be one of the (interdisciplinary) solutions put into practice for sustainable development. The literature review has focused on recycling technologies for urban mining, mainly e-waste, owing to its economic importance as a secondary source of critical metals. Of the different forms of urban solid waste reported in the literature, CDW from the construction sector and e-waste are the most prominent, with the highest generation rate and volume. The lack of attention in the literature to social issues related to urban mining might be rectified in this period following the COVID-19 pandemic (Botelho Junior et al., 2023 ). The relationship between CO2  emissions and e-waste recycling processes is already the subject of study (Berežni et al., 2021 ; Duarte et al., 2022 ; Castro et al., 2023 ; Vasconcelos et al., 2023 ) and this is likely to continue in the future.  6 Conclusions This literature review explored the links between the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets to urban mining, with the aim of answering the questions: "Does published evidence indicate a relationship between the SDGs and urban mining?", and, if so, "Does the relationship represent a synergy or a trade-off?". The literature review has demonstrated that urban mining and the handling of e-waste are key elements for achieving the goal of sustainable cities; they form a nexus between SDG arrangements and applications emanating from different sciences and different ecotechnologies. The results show a strong connection between “urban mining”/“man-made ores" and the SDG targets 6.3, 8.4, 9.4, 9.5, 12.4, and 12.5, and weaker links with SDGs 1–5, 10, 14, and 15, as highlighted by the goals and targets concerning social impacts of urban solid waste and recycling. The results suggest that some clusters of SDGs can be used to guide management in a broader and systemic approach which would benefit policy-makers in their daily decision-making. The need for social engagement in the processes of recycling and reusing is highlighted, as well as the need for interdisciplinarity if the SDGs' aspirations for a better future and cleaner cities are to be met.
