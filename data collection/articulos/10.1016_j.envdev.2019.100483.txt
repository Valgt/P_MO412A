                  In 2015, the United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development presented seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs). As the largest developing country, China faces large regional imbalances in its economy and social welfare. A nationwide synthetic indicator cannot reflect the sustainable development profile. As SDGs have not been evaluated at the national level of China and related studies worldwide at national or sub-national levels are rare, this paper aims to present a quantitative assessment of sustainable development goals at the sub-national level in China. We constructed a sustainable development index and dashboard evaluation framework under the SDGs and evaluated sustainable development indicators at the provincial scale to explore the sub-national heterogeneity. Results showed that the state of sustainable development in China is characterized by its pronounced geographic zones. Eastern provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have the highest scores of the China SDG Index. By contrast, western provinces, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi, have the lowest scores. We observe that both the Green Development Index and per capita GDP have very significant positive correlations with the China SDG Index and many single SDGs. Prioritizing economic development is beneficial to the implementation of the sustainable development goals for the western provinces, while trade-offs between economic development and environmental protection must be considered for eastern provinces.

The four provinces with the highest values of the China SDG Index, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, are located in the east. The red-rated provinces, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi, with the lowest values of the China SDG Index are mostly located in the western and northern regions. .

Note: This map shows the comparative evaluation of the performance across different provinces and identifying those provinces that are lagging the rest of the country. A red-rated goal means that this province performs relatively bad compared to a set of provinces in a specific goal. Only 9 out of 31 provinces, which are mostly distributed in the central region, have no red-rated SDGs. Nevertheless, there are 5 provinces with 5 or more red-rated SDGs. It is observed that the regions with the most red-rated SDGs are mostly located in the west. .

As the largest developing country, China faces large regional imbalances in its economy and social welfare. A nationwide synthetic indicator cannot reflect the sustainable development profile. As SDGs have not been evaluated at the national level of China and related studies worldwide at national or sub-national levels are rare, this paper aims to present a quantitative assessment of sustainable development goals at the sub-national level in China. We constructed a sustainable development index and dashboard evaluation framework under the SDGs and evaluated sustainable development indicators at the provincial scale to explore the sub-national heterogeneity. Results showed that the state of sustainable development in China is characterized by its pronounced geographic zones. Eastern provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have the highest scores of the China SDG Index. By contrast, western provinces, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi, have the lowest scores. We observe that both the Green Development Index and per capita GDP have very significant positive correlations with the China SDG Index and many single SDGs. Prioritizing economic development is beneficial to the implementation of the sustainable development goals for the western provinces, while trade-offs between economic development and environmental protection must be considered for eastern provinces.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Social welfare  Green development index  Spatial variability  China    1 Introduction Since the concept of sustainable development was put forward, theoretical research and case studies on sustainability have been abundant. In 2001, the scientific concepts of sustainability proposed by 23 scholars systematically covered the important roles of the four major capitals, which marked the evolution of sustainable development from concepts, thoughts or actions to science (Clark and Dickson, 2003 ; Kates et al., 2001 ). Subsequently, the economic base of sustainable development has been argued. Daly believes that in contrast to the traditional economic process, sustainable development aims for steady development and prosperity within the earth's biophysical capacity, and key natural capital needs to be included in the production function (Daly, 1997 ). As humans are constantly interacting with natural systems, human-nature coupled system was proposed to view the Earth from an integrated perspective (Liu et al., 2007 ). Research on sustainable development has explored all aspects of the economy, energy, environment and ecology, resulting in several well-accepted quantitative assessment methods, such as the pressure-state-response framework (PSR), ecological footprint (EF) and green GDP (e.g., Munasinghe, 2009 ; UN, 2007 ). Governments around the world have long recognized the importance of sustainable development. Based on a series of agreements reached by the international community on sustainable development in the 1980s and 1990s, the world leaders unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration at the United Nations Headquarters in 2000 and pledged to jointly implement the 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to deal with poverty and hunger, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, combat disease, environment, and global partnership. By 2015, the 15-year deadline for the MDGs (2000–2015), the MDG program has played an important role in promoting development worldwide, especially in less developed countries in terms of poverty reduction, education, health, and improved drinking water sources (UNDP, 2015 ). However, achieving sustainability worldwide remains a distant goal; with unbalanced socioeconomic development, new problems have continued to emerge in various regions. For instance, in developing regions, due to scarce medical resources, the maternal mortality rate is 14 times that of developed regions. There are still almost 103 million young people worldwide who lack basic literacy skills, and about 60% of whom are women. In addition, there are about 663 million people around the world living without improved drinking water (UN, 2017 ). Given the challenges being faced, in 2015, the United Nations presented sustainable development goals (SDGs) for all the countries around the world during the period of 2016–2030, which included a total of 17 goals and 169 sub-targets, to make sustainable development the core concept guiding future global development. The proposed SDGs not only aim to deal with some issues such as sustainable consumption and ecosystem health but also offer better coverage of the three dimensions of sustainable development–social, economic and environmental aspects which offer major improvements in the MDGs (ICSU and ISSC, 2015 ). Nilsson studied the correlations between various goals and proposed that the relationships between goals could be divided into seven types of relationships, namely, cancellation, counteracting, constraining, consistent, enabling, reinforcing and indivisible, from the most negative to the most positive interactions (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). The SDGs represent an extremely complex policy that would be a challenge for any government to meet (Lu et al., 2015 ). It is very difficult to achieve economic development and social inclusion or sustainability of the environment. When three goals are considered at the same time within the 15 years of implementation, the difficulties being faced could be unprecedented (Sachs, 2012 ). After the SDGs were proposed, several studies that focused on the evaluation of sustainable development were published. Cole et al. (2017)  established the evaluation framework of SDGs for South African from a provincial level to explore the spatial heterogeneity. Allen et al. (2017)  evaluated the progress and trends over two decades using index system for the Arab region. While Rasul (2016)  discussed the relationship among food, water and energy for achieving the SDGs in the area of South Asia. Then Omiscore (2018)  evaluated the challenge of environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals in sub-Saharan Africa. Allen et al. (2018)  reviewed the recent academic literature and the national experiences of implementing the sustainable development goals in a total of 26 countries and observed that key gaps remained in the evaluation of interrelationships, trade-offs and synergies between targets. In recent years, the most important event for the sustainable development of China has been the incorporation of the principles of an ecological civilization into governmental policies. In 2016, The Development and Reform Commission of China released the “Green Development Index System” as the basis for assessing the implementation of ecological civilization (DRCC, 2018 ). The Green Development Index has become an important official tool for assessment of ecological civilization. In 2017, the first annual evaluation report, “Communique on the Annual Evaluation of Ecological Civilization Construction in 2016”, was published (NBSC, 2018 ). That report presented an evaluation of the Green Development Index at the provincial scale. Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) started to evaluated the state of sustainable development of UN members in 2016. In 2017, they published the “SDG Index and Dashboards Report 2017”, which involved 157 UN member states. According to the report, China's overall SDG index score was 67.1 and its global ranking was 71st out of 157. The study indicated that there were four red-rated SDGs in China, including SDG 3, 10, 13 and 14, and most of the SDGs had brown ratings, meaning that China still faced significant challenges in the delivery of many SDGs (Sachs et al., 2017 ). However, as the largest developing country, China faces regional large imbalances of its economy and social welfare. A nationwide synthetic indicator cannot exactly reflect the state of sustainable development. Therefore, for a more comprehensive understanding of the state of sustainable development in China, we construct the sustainable development evaluation framework under the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) for 2016–2030 and evaluate sustainable development indicators at the provincial scale to explore sub-national heterogeneity. The remainder of the article is structured as follows: The next section described the materials and methodology. Then, Section 3  is devoted to the analysis of results. Section 4  provides a discussion of the results in relation to the key objectives of this study. Finally, we draw to some conclusion.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Indicators and data sources Priority was given to delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and China's National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for selection of indicators. Considering data availability and inter-provincial comparability, a total of 52 relevant indicators were selected in this paper, including the poverty headcount ratio, grain yield, mean years of schooling, among others (the full list of indicators is shown in Table 1  ). Data for most indices were obtained from publicly available national, provincial and municipal statistical databases, including China Statistical Yearbook 2017, China Population and Employment Statistics Yearbook 2017 and several other specified statistical yearbooks (the data sources and meanings of the indicators are provided in Table S1 ). Some of the indicators were obtained from relevant research reports, e.g., government efficiency indicators were sourced from research on the evaluation of management effectiveness of local governments in China (Tang et al., 2017 ). Most of the indicators were based on data in 2016. All indicators were evaluated for 31 provinces, excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan due to data unavailability; additionally, the rural water supply penetration rate was unavailable for Tibet. In addition, the ocean-related goal SDG14 was evaluated only for 11 coastal provinces. To construct suitable index system for SDG evaluation, we selected technically sound quantitative indices for each goal (Booysen, 2002 ; OECD and JRC, 2016 ; Sachs et al., 2017 ).  2.2 China SDG index construction To construct the China SDG Index mainly comprised two steps: (i) data normalization for each indicator and (ii) aggregate the indices within and across sustainable development goals. The value of each indicator was rescaled from 0 to 100, while the value of 0 denoting the worst and that 100 denoting the optimal performance. And we used the following rescaling formula to normalize the data:x  '   = x − min ( x )   max ( x  )  − min ( x )        where x represents the raw data value for each indicator; and then max/min  denote the bounds of each indicator for the best and worst performance of all the provinces, respectively; while that x’ represents the normalized value after rescaling. For the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development did not give target values or optimal threshold values for each target, and some of the targets are only qualitatively stated, in this study, we chose the best or worst performance among all the provinces to represent the max/min  value. Consequently, aggregation of the China SDG Index of each province proceeded in two steps. Firstly, the rescaled indices were combined for each goal. Secondly, all 17 goals were aggregated for the China SDG Index with the same weights. The method of the arithmetic mean was chosen to combine variables for each SDG and to aggregate goals for the China SDG Index of each province:I  i   = ∑  j = 1  N  i j     1  N  i j     I  i j       I = ∑  i = 1  N  i     1  N  i     I  i       where I i   represents the score of SDG i , N i   represents the number of goals for which a province has data, N ij   represents the number of indices for SDG i  of each province, and I ij   represents the score of indicator j  within SDG i . The score I ij   of SDG i  is determined by the province's rescaled score of indicators j . Next, we aggregate goal indices I ij   across SDGs i . The score I i   of SDG i  is determined by the province's arithmetic mean of scores I ij  . The score I  of each province is determined by the arithmetic mean of scores I i  .  2.3 SDG dashboards construction To evaluate a province's progress on a particular goal and overall SDGs, we constructed SDG Dashboards and group provinces in a “traffic light” table with four color bands (Fig. 1  ). And that the green band represents the optimum interval, where the score is higher than the sum of the average value and the standard deviation of all provinces for a particular indicator or goal. The yellow band represents the suboptimal interval, where the score is lower than the sum of the mean value and the standard deviation, but higher than the mean value of all provinces for a particular indicator or goal. Next, the brown band represents the below average interval, where the score is lower than the mean value but higher than the mean value minus the standard deviation. Finally, the red band represents the worst interval, where the score is lower than the mean value minus standard deviation. The purpose for the construction of the SDG Dashboards is to identify goals that face major challenge and require more attention for every province. The dashboard is used for comparative evaluation of the performance across different provinces and identifying those provinces that are lagging the rest of the country. A ‘green’ category means that a province performs relatively well compared to a set of provinces. Conversely, a ‘red’ category means that a province performs relatively bad compared to a set of provinces.  2.4 Correlation analysis There are interactions between different sustainable development goals, and some interactions may be reinforcing, but others may be counteracting (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, although the 17 SDGs cover economic, social and environmental issues, the evaluation results of SDGs have a significant positive relationship with the level of economic development, which leads to the result that developed countries tend to receive higher scores (Sachs et al., 2017 ). Therefore, in this paper, we use SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc.) to evaluate the Pearson correlation of different SDGs and between SDGs and the level of economic development. The correlation analysis was based on the Index values calculated for each goal and province. The goals can be divided into 3 groups based on their coefficient values, when a SDG is significantly positively correlated with 5 or more other SDGs, we call it strong positive correlation; when a SDG has significantly negative correlations with 5 or more other SDGs, we call it strong negative correlation; otherwise, we call it no significant correlation. In addition, as the Green Development Index is an important official assessment index of the ecological civilization in China, we also analyze the correlation between the China SDG Index and the Green Development Index. Then, we compare the differences between the ecological civilization in China and sustainable development goals from a single perspective. Provincial Green Development Indexes are obtained from the “Communique on the Annual Evaluation of Ecological Civilization Construction in 2016” (NBSC, 2018 ). Data for the Green Development Index is listed in Table S2 . Otherwise, we use cluster analysis to evaluate the spatial correlation of different provinces. The cluster analysis was based on the Index values calculated for each goal and province.   3 Analytical results 3.1 China SDG index analysis Table 1  shows the descriptive statistics of the 52 selected indicators, including the mean value, extreme values, standard deviation, sample size and coefficient of variation (CV). The descriptive statistics show that many of the indicators exhibit large interprovincial gaps. Taking the Extreme Value Difference as an example, there are 18 indicators, including the incidence of poverty, prevalence of AIDS, water resource stress, among others, with the maximum value of at least 10 times the minimum. In addition, there are 6 indicators that correspond to SDGs 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 15 with coefficient of variation values greater than 1. For instance, the indicator of “Illiterate Population in Population Aged 15 and Over (%)” in SDG 4 has a high CV of 1.08, meaning that there are large variations in the illiterate populations among various provinces. The illiterate population in Tibet accounts for more than 41%; on the contrary, it is only 1.56% in Beijing. Fig. 2  , Fig. S1 , and Table 2   show the scores, rankings and spatial distribution of the comprehensive China SDG Index for each province. The four provinces with the highest values of the China SDG Index, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, are located in the east. Furthermore, three provinces (Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu) score “red” on at least one SDG (Fig. 3  ). The red-rated provinces, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi, with the lowest values of the China SDG Index are mostly located in the western and northern regions. The central hinterland and southeastern coastal regions are mostly rated “yellow”, indicating that they have middle and upper levels of sustainable development capability. The northern and southwest regions mostly rank in the “brown” band with relatively lower levels of sustainable development capability. Less developed provinces tend to perform worse than developed regions among most of the goals. Moreover, in the absence of adequate infrastructure and mechanisms, it is hard for poorer regions to address important environmental issues that are the focus of some other goals (Sachs et al., 2017 ).  3.2 Dashboard analysis According to the SDG dashboard of each province, it is possible to visually compare the statuses of different provinces according to different goals (Table 3  ). The red-rated provinces for SDG 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 and 16 are mostly located in the west and southwest of China. Additionally, the red-rated provinces for SDGs 8, 12 and 13 are mostly located in the west and north of China and those for SDG17 are mostly located in the northeast of China. Other SDGs show no significant spatial distribution patterns. Only 9 out of 31 provinces, such as Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi, which are mostly distributed in the central region, have no red-rated SDGs. This result shows that, when compared to other provinces in China, the provinces in the central regions perform better than other regions. There are 13 out of 31 provinces with 1 or 2 red-rated SDGs. Nevertheless, there are 5 provinces with 5 or more red-rated SDGs. It is observed that the regions with the most red-rated SDGs are mostly located in the west. For instance, Tibet has 8 red-rated SDGs and Xinjiang has 6. In the eastern provinces, such as Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, the primary red-rated SDGs are SDGs 14 and 15, meaning that environmental issues are the greatest challenges for eastern provinces (Fig. 3  and Table 3 ). The dashboard shows that the western region (Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia) has the worst performance and faces major SDG challenges in reducing extreme poverty (SDG 1) and improving nutrition and sustainable agriculture (SDG2), health (SDG3), education (SDG4), sustainable water management and sanitary infrastructure (SDG6), urban-rural gap of income and health (SDG10), sustainable urban development (SDG11), sustainable consumption and production (SDG12), climate change (SDG13) and peace and government efficiency (SDG16). Provinces in the northern region (Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jilin and Heilongjiang) face several pressing challenges in gender inequality (SDG5), low growth and high unemployment (SDG 8), sustainable consumption and production (SDG12), climate change (SDG13) and low financial self-sufficiency and health and education spending (SDG17). In the southwestern region (Sichuan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Yunnan and Guangxi), extreme poverty (SDG 1), nutrition and sustainable agriculture (SDG2), health (SDG3), education (SDG4), low per capita GDP and high unemployment (SDG 8), urban-rural gap of income and health (SDG10) and government efficiency in SDG16 are high-priority challenges. The central region (Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi) does not have red-rated SDGs except Henan, which still faces challenges in sustainable urban development (SDG11) and terrestrial ecosystem conservation (SDG15). The eastern coastal region (Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, etc.) is the most developed area in China. This region does not face a wide range of challenges in most SDGs. Nevertheless, several challenges remain for certain provinces. For instance, Hainan receives red ratings in nutrition and sustainable agriculture (SDG2) and government efficiency (SDG16). Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu and Shanghai face significant challenges in terrestrial ecosystem conservation (SDG15). Zhejiang and Shanghai face major challenges in marine conservation (SDG14). Liaoning faces a major challenge of low economic growth and relatively high unemployment (SDG 8). While Fujian faces great challenge of achieving gender equality (SDG5). Cluster analysis showed a strongly geographic zonal distribution (Fig. 4  ). Thirty-one provinces were categorized into 7 groups. Group 1 is located in the central and northeast regions; its provinces have mostly brown-rated goals. Group 2 is mostly located in the northern region and is characterized by many red-rated goals in SDGs 12, 13 and 15. Groups 3, 4 and 7 are located in the western region and have the worst performance in many goals, especially in SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 10. Groups 5 and 6 are located in the eastern region and perform best in many SDGs except SDG 15. Maps of each SDG show the performance of various provinces in delivering SDG (Fig. S2 ). At the national scale, the greatest challenges exist in the self-sufficiency rate of affordable and clean energy (SDG7), innovation (SDG 9) and health and education spending (SDG17) (average score < 40). Additionally, SDG1, SDG2, SDG5, SDG8, SDG10, SDG14 and SDG15 all have average scores of less than 60 (Table S3 ). As a result, China still faces significant challenges in meeting many goals.  3.3 Correlation among different SDGs Correlation analysis can be used to derive the relationship between different SDGs. Certain SDGs are positively correlated with 5 or more other SDGs, including poverty (SDG1), nutrition and sustainable agriculture (SDG2), health (SDG3), education (SDG4), sustainable water management and sanitary infrastructure (SDG6), innovation (SDG9), urban-rural gap of income and health (SDG10), sustainable consumption and production (SDG12) and peace and government efficiency (SDG16). Several SDGs have positive correlations with a few other SDGs, including SDG8, SDG11, SDG13 and SDG17. On the contrary, several SDGs have negative correlations with most other goals, such as SDGs 7, and 14, which correspond to affordable and clean energy, and marine ecosystem indicators, respectively. Based on the correlations, we can approximately divide the 17 goals into 3 groups, namely, strong positive correlation, weak positive correlation and negative correlation. The Green Development Index is a comprehensive indicator that is used to evaluate the achievement of ecological civilization construction in China in recent years (DRCC, 2018 ). According to Table 4  , there is a very significant positive correlation between the Green Development Index and China SDG Index. Specifically, most of the SDGs have a significant positive correlation with the Green Development Index, and only the correlations of SDGs 5, 7, 14, 15 and 17 are not significant. The Green Development Index includes six aspects, namely resource utilization, environmental governance, environmental quality, ecological protection, quality of economic growth and green living. Sustainable development goals cover a relatively wide range of aspects, while the Green Development Index is comparatively lacking in certain social indicators (DRCC, 2018 ). We argue that after properly incorporating several social indicators, the Green Development Index can be used as an indicator to evaluate sustainable development. Nonetheless, although the social development indices are not included in the Green Development Index, the Green Development Index still shows a significant positive correlation with several social goals in the SDGs (e.g., SDGs 3, 4 and 10), indicating that social indicators are usually closely related to economic indicators. To assess the relationship between the China SDG Index and the level of economic development, we performed a correlation analysis of 17 SDGs and per capita GDP. Results show that there is a significant positive correlation between GDP per capita and the China SDG Index. GDP per capita shows a significant positive correlation with income (SDG 1), nutrition and sustainable agriculture (SDG2), health (SDG3), education (SDG4), sustainable water management and sanitary infrastructure (SDG6), economic growth and employment (SDG 8), innovation (SDG 9), low urban-rural gap of income and health (SDG10) and financial self-sufficiency and health and education spending (SDG17). Negative correlations are observed between GDP per capita and clean energy self-sufficiency ratio (SDG 7), and marine ecosystem conservation (SDGs 14).   4 Discussion In recent years, the most important event for the sustainable development of China has been the incorporation of ecological civilization into national strategy. In 2016, the Development and Reform Commission of China released the “Green Development Index System” as the basis for assessing the implementation of ecological civilization (DRCC, 2018 ). Green Development Index System is regarded as an official instrument of key national indicators to monitor the implementation of ecological civilization in China. We found that the China SDG Index, Green Development Index and GDP/Capita are all positively correlated with one another. It implies that SDGs are useful in guiding national and provincial development pathways. The eastern provinces are facing challenge with SDGs 14 and 15, while western ones having difficulties with a wide range of SDGs. It implies that although eastern provinces are still facing severe environment issues such as air pollution and water eutrophication, eastern provinces perform better than western ones in most of the SDGs. We argue that prioritizing economic development is beneficial to the implementation of the sustainable development goals for the western provinces. Meanwhile, it is important to balance economic development and environmental protection for eastern provinces. In this study, we observe that SDGs 7 and 14 have negative correlations with the China SDG Index, Green Development Index, per capita GDP and many other goals. Additionally, this observation implies that as the economic progress continues, the challenges of clean energy supply capacity, and marine ecosystem conservation may remain major challenges that deserve more attention. Furthermore, as certain goals are characterized by negative correlations with other goals, it may be difficult for China to fully optimize all goals at the same time so that the government needs to consider trade-offs between different goals. In addition, the SDGs have not been evaluated by the government at the national and sub-national level of China, and related studies at the national level are still rare worldwide (Cole et al., 2017 ; Allen et al., 2017 ).Among all G20 countries, most other OECD countries, and other countries with population greater than 100 million, only 27 of them (a total of 42) have identified officially key national indicators to monitor the implementation of the SDGs by the National Statistical Institute or any mandated central/federal institutions (Sachs et al., 2019 ). Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) have published annual report of “SDG index and dashboards report” since 2016. However, every new version has added new indicators and deleted some previous indicators. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a reference model to quantitatively assess sustainable development goals in China. Additionally, many indices selected in the “SDG Index and dashboard 2017” were not found in China's public statistics, certain indicators, such as the PISA Social Justice Index, slavery score, PISA score, among others, do not apply in China (Sachs et al., 2017 ). China also faces certain unique problems, such as the urban-rural duality. Accordingly, we introduce indicators such as the “urban-rural income gap” into our indicator system. Due to limited data availability and lack of indices for certain SDGs or targets, this study does not present a complete picture of the SDG baselines. Because of the differences of the meaning and statistical power of certain indicators, the China SDG Index that we evaluated may have limited comparability to indices of related studies. We used the most recent available data for each indicator, mostly in the year of 2016, but not all data were obtained for the same year for all provinces because of data unavailability. By now, there are many countries that have set up national monitoring indicators for SDGs. However, some of them are much less than official 169 SDG targets and 232 indicators. For example, there are 34 national monitoring indicators for Belgium, and 67 for Germany, etc. (Sachs et al., 2019 ). As a sub-national level evaluation, we face a great challenge to find available data for some indicators. As a result, in this study we chose only 52 indicators. When we chose indicators, we gave priority to those in the official 169 SDG targets. We grade the data and construct dashboards according to the mean value and standard deviation. Additionally, we assume that the maximum value of each indicator is the optimal value, so that the score of each SDG signifies a province's position between the worst (0) and best (100) outcomes, which is how we were able to identify the under performers of each SDG among provinces. In fact, the optimal value of each indicator should be based on the content of the United Nations’ 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Nevertheless, exactly matching indicators for certain SDGs are unavailable from the official provincial statistics; thus, the most relevant indicators were selected as replacements. The research framework and metrics need to be improved. For example, SDG 17 is about international partnership and implementation measures for the goals. Target 17.3 proposed to mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources. As a sub-national evaluation, it seems that there is no need for an evaluation of SDG17 for international partnership. Since China has more than 30 provinces, it would be necessary to evaluate sub-national partnership and practical measures for implementation of the goals in terms of “Financial self-sufficiency rate” in SDG17. As a province, the fiscal revenue comes from two channels, one is internal fiscal revenue, and the other is external financial support from the central government. This indicator could reflect the external financial support for specific provinces. Besides, target 17.18 proposed to enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data in national contexts. China also faces challenges to achieve this target.  5 Conclusions Based on the analytical results above, we draw several conclusions: The eastern provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have the highest values of the China SDG Index. The western provinces have the worst scores. The red-rated provinces, including Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi, are mostly located in the western and northern regions. Western provinces have relatively more red-rated SDGs, and there are 5 provinces, namely, Tibet, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Shanxi, that have 5 or more red-rated SDGs. Only 9 provinces have no red-rated SDGs. Using correlation analysis, 17 SDGs can be approximately divided into 3 groups. One group of SDGs is positively correlated with 5 or more other SDGs, including SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 16. One group of SDGs is negatively correlated with 5 or more other goals, such as SDGs 7 and 14. Another group of SDGs includes SDGs 5, 8, 11, 13, 15 and 17 with no significant correlations with others. Both the Green Development Index and per capita GDP have very significant positive correlations with the China SDG Index and many single SDGs. Implementing SDGs would be useful in guiding national and provincial development pathways. Prioritizing economic development is beneficial to the implementation of the sustainable development goals for the western provinces, while trade-offs between economic development and environmental protection must be considered for eastern provinces.
