                  In the current global landscape where sustainability is increasingly critical, this study offers a significant contribution by redefining supply chain models through the lens of circular economy principles. It introduces a novel two-stage stochastic model tailored to designing sustainable closed-loop supply chains, adept at navigating uncertainties in location, allocation, and routing decisions. A notable feature of the model is its integration of a speed-variant fuel-efficient green vehicle routing system, which enables simultaneous pick-up and delivery, underscoring a commitment to environmental sustainability and circular economy principles. This model is distinct in its holistic approach, balancing total cost considerations with the creation of job opportunities to boost social benefits, while also addressing the pressing issue of fossil fuel consumption's environmental impact. The innovative use of the heuristic backward scenario reduction method to generate stochastic uncertainty scenarios enhances the model's applicability in real-world conditions. The study employs an upgraded ε-constraint method for smaller instances and a range of advanced metaheuristic algorithms, including Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm version 2, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition, and Pareto Envelope based Selection Algorithm II. This research provides critical insights and tools for managers and policymakers, particularly in scenarios where adherence to sustainability and circular economy principles is vital. This study not only advances academic discourse but also offers pragmatic solutions for real-world supply chain challenges, emphasizing the importance of integrating environmental and social considerations into economic decision-making.

It introduces a novel two-stage stochastic model tailored to designing sustainable closed-loop supply chains, adept at navigating uncertainties in location, allocation, and routing decisions. A notable feature of the model is its integration of a speed-variant fuel-efficient green vehicle routing system, which enables simultaneous pick-up and delivery, underscoring a commitment to environmental sustainability and circular economy principles.

This shift, gaining significant momentum over the past decade, is driven by growing concerns over global warming, climate change, and legislative pressures, leading to an amplified focus on sustainable practices (Sogandi and Shiri, 2023 ; Turki and Rezg, 2019 ). Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC)  management is characterized by holistic oversight of supply chain networks, encompassing the three pillars of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental (Hamid et al., 2023 ). This approach represents a departure from traditional economic considerations, emphasizing the integration of environmental and social factors within supply chains. Prominent global corporations, including BMW, Audi, Cisco Systems, Walmart, and Samsung Electronics, are actively pursuing sustainability goals (Campos and Rebs, 2018 ; Giri et al., 2018 ; van Hoek and Johnson, 2010 ; Youn et al., 2012 ), reflecting a global sentiment that sustainability is a necessary path toward securing a better future for our planet. While initial sustainability efforts may incur additional costs, they often lead to increased efficiency, reduced resource utilization, and improved quality of life (Kuhlman and Farrington, 2010 ). Over time, these initiatives can also significantly enhance long-term profitability. Dey and Giri (2021)  underscore the crucial role of social factors in strengthening the economic landscape and boosting profits. Alberti and Varon Garrido (2017)  argue that sustainability objectives can harmoniously align with economic and profitability goals. Thus, transitioning towards SSCs is not only strategically sound but also proves to be highly advantageous (Mamoudan et al., 2023 ). Additionally, the circular economy concept plays a critical role in contemporary sustainability endeavors (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ). It prioritizes the continuous utilization of resources and waste reduction through reuse and recycling, minimizing environmental impacts (Srivastav et al., 2023 ). Closed-Loop Supply Chains (CLSCs)  are instrumental in actualizing the principles of the circular economy (Suhandi and Chen, 2023 ). These supply chains integrate the reverse flow of returned products with the direct flow of products, creating a more sustainable and efficient system (Souza, 2013 ). This model, which considers the reuse and recycling of durables (Kogan, 2011 ), has been adopted across various industries by reputable companies, including Toyota, Honda, Pepsi Cola, Canon, and Motorola (Jayaraman et al., 2007 ; Kumar and Yamaoka, 2006 ; Yu et al., 2018 ). In our resource-constrained world, adopting circular supply chains and implementing CLSC networks significantly reduce environmental impacts while cutting long-term costs (Kabirifar et al., 2023 ). Reverse logistics and CLSCs offer significant economic benefits and contribute notably to environmental sustainability (Guide Jr and Van Wassenhove, 2009 ). In a CLSC framework, returned products can be recycled, repaired, refurbished, or appropriately disposed. This process reduces costs and saves the environment, aiding in resource conservation and waste reduction (Jack et al., 2010 ; Lo and Yu, 2013 ). Once repaired or refurbished, these products can re-enter the market, often at more affordable prices in secondary markets, providing consumers with a wider range of purchasing options (Shapiro and Drayer, 2014 ). Secondary markets extend the lifespan of products and significantly reduce the overall environmental footprint (Persson and Hinton, 2023 ). Recycling gives used materials a new purpose, curtailing waste and lessening environmental impacts (Cudjoe et al., 2021 ). Therefore, developing an efficient circular and CLSC network enhances cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction while reducing negative environmental impacts (Shaharudin et al., 2019 ). A Sustainable CLSC (SCLSC)  integrates both direct and reverse logistics, addressing all three sustainability dimensions (Nayeri et al., 2020 ). The inclusion of reverse logistics in SSCs provides considerable advantages, such as environmental conservation, enhanced service levels, and reduced operational costs. These supply chains represent a significant advancement in contemporary business practices. By integrating sustainability practices, adhering to circular economy principles, and implementing closed-loop network designs in supply chain management, businesses not only reduce their environmental footprint but also adopt a future-oriented business approach. In the modern industrial landscape, transportation is also a critical factor in the economic development of countries, facilitating access to products from geographically distant production locations (Hirbod et al., 2023 ; Moghaddasi et al., 2023 ). The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)  is of paramount importance in logistics and transportation research, attracting extensive attention due to its significant implications and broad applications (Braekers et al., 2016 ). Green VRP (GVRP) , which specifically addresses environmental considerations, is a particular focus within this field (Poonthalir & Nadarajan, 2018 ). A crucial aspect of GVRP is the optimization of fleet fuel consumption, leading to the emergence of Fuel-efficient GVRP (FGVRP)  (Erdoğan and Miller-Hooks, 2012 ). Integrating fuel consumption considerations into routing problems tangibly reduces the environmental impact of transportation systems. In transportation logistics, a key challenge involves the coordination of vehicles collecting products from various locations and delivering them to specified destinations. This complexity is addressed in the VRP with Pick-up and Delivery (VRPPD) , where optimizing both pick-up and delivery schedules is crucial (Lyu and Yu, 2023 ). A more sophisticated variant of this problem is the VRP with Simultaneous Pick-up and Delivery (VRPSPD) , which involves coordinating pick-up and delivery tasks concurrently. This simultaneous operation allows for collection and dispatch activities to be conducted in tandem, without a predefined sequence (Bianchessi and Righini, 2007 ). This approach significantly affects commuting time, the number of vehicles deployed, and fuel consumption. Such strategies are applicable in various industries, including automotive parts, bottled beverages, grocery retail, airlines, and school transportation services (Min, 1989 ; Sherif et al., 2021 ). The design and planning of integrated supply chain networks are intricate processes where even minor decision-making errors can lead to inefficiencies, increased costs, and negative environmental impacts. It is essential to develop a comprehensive network that addresses all aspects of the supply chain, considering strategic, tactical, and operational decisions to boost supply chain performance. This paper introduces a significant advancement in this field by proposing a model that effectively incorporates the three pillars of sustainability. This approach is a departure from traditional models that focus mainly on cost-effectiveness and profitability, as it also includes considerations for labor practices, community impact, and environmental stewardship. A major contribution of this model is its ability to improve profitability while adhering to sustainability principles. This is achieved through the optimization of location, allocation, and routing strategies, leading to lower operational costs in areas such as transportation and logistics, and simultaneously improving service levels and overall supply chain efficiency. Socially, the paper is significant for integrating corporate social responsibility into supply chain decisions, emphasizing ethical labor practices and positive community engagement. This alignment with broader societal values promotes long-term sustainability and public acceptance. From an environmental perspective, the paper contributes notably by focusing on reducing waste, emissions, and the overall environmental footprint. This is accomplished through strategic location choices, efficient resource use, and integrating green logistics and circular economy principles, thus advocating for environmentally sustainable practices throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, the study adeptly handles the complexities in supply chain management, especially in systems with multiple depots, vehicles, and products. The use of stochastic methods to manage uncertainty and variability underscores the model's suitability for modern, dynamic supply chains, enhancing its resilience and adaptability in the face of evolving market conditions and unforeseen challenges (Zandbiglari et al., 2023 ). Additionally, considering the complexity and time-consuming nature of solving large-scale supply chain problems, the research evaluates the effectiveness of five metaheuristic algorithms: Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm version 2 (SPEA2), Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), and Pareto Envelope based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II). These algorithms are explored for their potential in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed supply chain model. This paper aims to address several key problems in the realm of supply chain management, focusing on the following critical questions.1. What are the optimal locations for establishing distribution and collection centers?  2. What characteristics define appropriate suppliers for an efficient supply chain?  3. What constitutes effective supply plans within the network?  4. What strategies should be employed for optimal distribution and collection?  5. How does uncertainty impact the overall supply chain system?    To address these critical questions, we introduce a two-stage stochastic optimization model designed for SCLSC network design and planning. This model aims to effectively determine the optimal locations for centers, allocate resources, and plan routing decisions. It focuses on optimizing the total cost, reducing fuel consumption, and maximizing job opportunities created across the network. The model includes a sophisticated routing problem that accommodates varying speeds and facilitates simultaneous pick-up and delivery, thereby supporting fuel efficiency. It operates under the assumption that both demand and the rate of product returns are stochastic in nature. Additionally, the model provides for the returned products to be either repaired and redirected to secondary markets or recycled for reuse in the production cycle. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2  reviews related literature, providing context and background. In Section 3 , we define the specific problem addressed by this study and present the formulation of the mathematical model. Section 4  details the methodology and the various solution approaches employed. Numerical examples, along with the presentation of results and sensitivity analyses, are covered in Section 5 . Section 6  offers a discussion on the findings, emphasizing their managerial implications. Finally, Section 7  concludes the research, summarizing key insights and contributions.  2 Literature review Supply chain management and logistics encompass various complex challenges related to location, allocation, and routing. These challenges involve optimizing the placement of facilities such as factories, warehouses, and distribution centers, allocating resources like inventory and supplies among these facilities, and planning efficient transportation routes to minimize costs, time, or distance while meeting service level requirements. Addressing these issues typically requires mathematical modeling and optimization techniques (Rabbani et al., 2014 ; Khalili et al., 2017 ). In recent years, notable contributions have been made in the field. For instance, Al Theeb et al. (2020)  introduced a optimization model for cold supply chain management, which integrates inventory allocation and VRP with a focus on cost minimization. Giallanza and Puma (2020)  explored a three-echelon fuzzy GVRP in agri-food supply chains, employing a multi-objective fuzzy chance-constrained programming model and a NSGA-II. Rout et al.

(2024)  expanded on the VRP with cross-docking, incorporating network disruption and developing mixed-integer linear programs for modeling under normal and disrupted conditions. Jiang et al. (2024)  addressed a flexible-docking VRP using a truck and drone fleet in rural areas, utilizing a tailored adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic. Zhang et al. (2024)  focused on routing and scheduling multi-carriage transit trains for airport baggage transit, developing an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm for handling interdependencies across vehicle routes. Fernando et al. (2024)  optimized the distribution of fresh agricultural products within retail chains, integrating resource allocation, order scheduling, and route planning to achieve cost savings and efficiency improvements. On the other hand, the concepts of circular and CLSCs are crucial in promoting sustainability. They achieve this by extending the lifespans of products and reducing waste. Circular supply chains focus on methods like reusing resources, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling, creating a cyclical process that moves away from the conventional linear approach of “take-make-dispose”. CLSC take this idea a step further by reincorporating returned products back into the supply chain, typically using reverse logistics. This approach highlights the importance of recovering materials and products, aiming to lessen environmental harm and improve the efficiency of resource use. Recently, Konstantaras et al. (2021)  delved into green supply chain management with a focus on closed-loop manufacturing and carbon footprint reduction, proposing a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model under a carbon tax regulatory framework.

Arabi and Gholamian (2023)  addressed the mining industry with a multi-period, multi-product mixed-integer quadratic programming model for a closed-loop stone supply chain network, considering resilience, quality, and two-stage stochastic programming. Rajabi-Kafshgar et al. (2023)  developed a mixed linear mathematical model for an agricultural supply chain network, focusing on reverse logistics and employing meta-heuristic algorithms. Hosseini Dehshiri and Amiri (2024)  integrated circular economy principles into supply chain network design, addressing hybrid uncertainties using a robust scenario-based possibilistic-stochastic programming approach. Moreover, green and SSC strive to minimize the environmental footprint of supply chain activities while sustaining economic performance. They adopt environmentally friendly practices and technologies to cut down on emissions, waste, and energy consumption. These supply chains also take into account social factors, such as labor rights, fair trade, and community effects, with the goal of establishing operations that are ecologically responsible, socially equitable, and economically feasible. This approach aligns with the objectives of sustainable development. As a result, such supply chains have gained increasing attention, demonstrating a growing recognition of the importance of integrating sustainability into supply chain management. Jouzdani and Govindan (2021)  developed a multi-objective mathematical programming model for sustainable perishable food supply chains, accounting for economic, social, and environmental impacts and product lifetime uncertainty.

(2022)  optimized food supply networks during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on Food Hubs and reducing costs and environmental impacts. Prajapati et al. (2022)  presented a sustainable framework for a multi-echelon electronics products' CLSC in the e-commerce industry, emphasizing 3R strategies and offering insights for policymakers and e-commerce companies. Gholian-Jouybari et al. (2024)  developed a mixed-integer linear programming model for the coconut industry's agri-food supply chain under sustainable conditions, considering costs, environmental pollution, and job creation through metaheuristics. While existing literature has explored the integration of location-allocation-routing decisions in supply chains, a noticeable gap persists in extending these integrations to multi-echelon networks. Moreover, the application of circular economy and sustainability principles remains sporadic. This study represents a significant stride in addressing these gaps, presenting a holistic approach that synthesizes strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. Such an integration dramatically elevates the efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of supply chain networks. In today's environmentally conscious global landscape, the importance of circular and CLSCs cannot be overstated. These systems are instrumental in significantly reducing environmental impacts, curtailing waste, and promoting resource efficiency. Simultaneously, SSCs are not just a preference but a necessity for ensuring long-term resilience and alignment with evolving societal and environmental norms. This alignment fosters competitive advantage and ensures the longevity of business operations. Furthermore, in the interconnected realm of global trade, transportation, and routing emerge as critical components. Efficient routing is a key factor, not only in reducing operational costs but also in diminishing carbon footprints and bolstering environmental sustainability. To delineate the unique contributions of this study and contrast it with existing research, Table 1   has been meticulously prepared. The primary contributions of this study are.• Problem Statement:  This paper contributes a groundbreaking model to the field of supply chain management, departing from conventional cost-centric approaches by seamlessly integrating the economic, social, and environmental sustainability pillars.

Beyond meeting the rising demand for sustainability, this commitment reflects responsible corporate citizenship and contributes to a sustainable future for society and the environment, extending well beyond financial gains.    In summary, this study proposes a multi-objective two-stage stochastic mathematical model tailored for SCLSC network complexities. The model adeptly balances facility location strategies, resource allocation, and operational routing, providing a comprehensive solution to SCLSC management. It addresses uncertainty head-on, enabling adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. The model incorporates a Speed Variant Fuel-efficient Green Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-up and Delivery (SVFGVRPSPD) to prioritizing fuel efficiency and sustainable practices in transportation. This approach allows businesses to achieve cost-effectiveness, fuel economy, reduced emissions, and enhanced logistical efficiency, contributing to sustainable and environmentally responsible operations. Additionally, the model's unique capability to allocate a specific number of vehicles to each depot presents a strategic advantage in planning and cost reduction, a feature that is scarcely addressed in current literature.  3 Problem explanation and model development 3.1 Problem definition In this paper, we design a multi-objective two-stage stochastic scenario-based mathematical model to optimize strategic, tactical, and operational decisions of an SCLSC network. In the first stage, the model seeks to find the optimal locations to establish repair and recycling centers based on predetermined potential locations. In the second stage, the model seeks to determine the allocation and routing decisions within the network. In Fig. 1  , the schematic diagram of the proposed network is illustrated. The developed network includes Production Centers (PCs), Distribution Centers/Collection Centers (DC/CCs), Demand Points (DPs), recycling centers, repair centers, and secondary markets, which will be completely explained in the following. In the direct flow, PCs function as suppliers providing a range of various products. Proper PCs will be selected, and the order quantity will be allocated to them to fulfill the required product demand. This selection is based on cost parameters, including fixed cost of supplier selection, purchase price of products, and transportation cost from PCs to DC/CCs, and potential job creation. DC/CCs serve the dual purpose of distribution and at the same time collection. Suitable DC/CCs will be chosen based on capacity, potential job creation, and operational costs for opening or closure. DPs, constituting the customer layer, shaping the supply chain to fulfill their demand. The demand at each DP is uncertain, and we have assumed a uniform probability distribution for each uncertain parameter. The supplied products from PCs are directly transferred to DC/CCs for further distribution to DPs. In the reverse flow, DC/CCs are responsible for collection of returned products. The product rate of return at each DP is uncertain, and we have made a similar assumption of a uniform probability distribution for them. Meanwhile, some potential locations are considered to establish repair and recycling centers to manage returned products. The returned products are either repaired or recycled. A percentage of returned products can be repaired, while the remaining will be recycled. After collecting returned products, a sorting process will be undergone to separate repairable products. The sorting process is done by experts (Schlüter et al., 2021 ) in DC/CCs and it's very important to protect the environment (Meade and Sarkis, 2002 ). In the repair centers, returned products will be repaired and transferred to the secondary markets to reuse by customers. In the recycling centers, returned products will be recycled to be turned into raw materials and then transferred to PCs to reproduce new products. Supplied products from PCs to DC/CCs are transported by direct transferring vehicles. Multiple transportation modes are considered for these direct transferring vehicles. Then, products are distributed to DPs (in the direct flow), and returned products are collected from DPs (in the reverse flow). The distribution and collection process are executed using routing vehicles. This routing procedure involves the use of capacitated heterogeneous vehicles that handle simultaneous product delivery and collection of returned products. The returned products from DC/CCs to repair and recycling centers are further transported by direct transferring vehicles. DC/CCs are depots and DPs are customer nodes. Fuel consumption is factored in across nodes, and the refueling process occurs at the depots. A multi-product multi-vehicle multi-depot SVFGVRPSPD is developed. The routing vehicles deliver products to DPs and at the same time, pick-up returned products. The routing vehicle tours start from DC/CCs and end at the same DC/CC. In each DC/CC, loading needed products, unloading returned products, and refueling process is performed. After serving DPs and fulfilling their demands, returned products is collected to return them to DC/CCs. The loaded quantity on each vehicle is limited and also, each route must be traveled in a defined allowed time. Split delivery is not allowed; hence, all the demanded products must be delivered in a single visit. In the context of the model addressing a fuel-efficient routing problem, fuel consumption is influenced by the traveling distance and the speed of the vehicles between nodes. For instance, consider a vehicle, denoted as v   , moving from node i    to node j   . In this scenario, several key parameters are defined to quantify aspects of the journey. These include S i j  i j     , representing the average traveling speed between nodes i    and j   , measured in miles per hour, and d i j  i j      , which is the distance traveled between these nodes, expressed in miles. Additionally, T i j  i j      refers to the travel time between nodes i    and j   , calculated in hours. The model also considers F u C R   , the total miles a vehicle can travel per gallon of fuel, an efficiency metric noted in miles per gallon (mpg). Furthermore, F C H  i j      denotes the fuel consumption rate between nodes i    and j   , in gallons per hour, and F C i j    represents the total fuel consumption for the journey between these two nodes, measured in gallons. These parameters collectively help in assessing and optimizing the fuel efficiency of routes in the network. So, the traveling time between node i    and j    is calculated as below:(1) T i j  i j   = d i j  i j    S i j  i j     [ hour ]       And fuel consumption per hour and total fuel consumption between node i    and j    respectively is presented as bellow:(2) F C H  i j   = S i j  i j   F u C R    [ gallon / hour  ]      (3) F C i j = F C H  i j   × T i j  i j    [ gallon ]       The distance that a vehicle travels with a certain amount of fuel (i.e., F u C R   ) depends on factors such as a vehicle, traffic, and traveling speed. In the proposed model, we use the average expected speed among nodes, therefore, the expected amount of fuel consumption is calculated. The calculation of the fuel consumption is based on Kuo (2010) . Poonthalir and Nadarajan (2018)  developed a similar FGVR using a triangular distribution. Besides, there are some similar studies in different ways (Hooshmand and MirHassani, 2019 ; Koç and Karaoglan, 2016 ; Xiao et al., 2012 ). The aim of the model is to achieve optimization across multiple dimensions, including total cost, fuel consumption, and job opportunities. This optimization process involves two stages within the SCLSC network: the first stage focuses on identifying suitable locations for establishing repair and recycling centers, while the second stage addresses allocation and routing. Fig. 2   offers a concise overview of the objective functions involved in this process.  3.2 Assumptions This study is based on the following key assumptions.• Both demand and rate of return are subject to uncertainty.  • Uncertain parameters are modeled using statistical probability distributions.  • Multiple scenarios are analyzed to address this uncertainty.  • PCs are selected for supplying products.  • Decisions are made regarding the opening or closing of DCs or CCs.  • Among potential sites, some are chosen for setting up repair and recycling centers.  • The study considers the logistics of routing between DCs/CCs and DPs.  • Vehicles are allocated to specific DCs/CCs, but each center may have multiple vehicles.  • Fuel consumption by distribution vehicles is taken into account.  • Refueling of vehicles occurs at the DCs/CCs.  • Each DP receives its demand in a single visit, without split deliveries.  • Distribution and collection operations are conducted at the same facilities, referred to as DC/CCs.  • Routing starts and ends at the same DC/CC, covering several DPs.  • The delivery of new products and collection of returns are conducted simultaneously.  • Delivery and pick-up operations are time-bound.  • Returned products are either repaired or recycled.  • Recycled items are sent back to PCs for the production of new goods.  • Repaired goods are directed to secondary markets for resale.  • There are capacity limitations for all centers and vehicles.  • Fuel consumption for distribution vehicles and their refueling processes at DC/CCs are key considerations.     3.3 Problem formulation Notations    Indices  p    Index of PCs p ∈ P     P    Set of all PCs P = { 1 , 2 , … , | P |   }      r    Index of recovery centers r ∈ R     R    Set of

AUGMECON2, an advanced version of the ε-constraint method, is employed to effectively manage the complexities of multi-objective models. Additionally, the backward scenario reduction, a heuristic approach, is applied to efficiently generate appropriate stochastic scenarios. The problem is also addressed using a range of metaheuristic algorithms, including NSGA-II, MOPSO, SPEA2, MOEA/D, and PESA-II. These methods will be thoroughly elucidated in the following subsection. 4.1 Improved augmented ε-constraint method To derive the optimal solutions for the proposed multi-objective model, an improved variant of the ε-constraint method, originally introduced by Haimes (1971) , is utilized. This enhanced method, known as AUGMECON2, was developed by Mavrotas and Florios (2013) . The effectiveness of AUGMECON2 in dealing with multi-objective optimization problems has been demonstrated. A critical objective in such problems is to ascertain Pareto-optimal solutions, thereby enabling the selection of a suitable solution and understanding the trade-offs between various objectives. In the AUGMECON2 approach, one of the objectives is prioritized and optimized as the primary goal, while the remaining objectives are transformed into constraints. By adjusting the ε value, a range of Pareto-optimal solutions can be obtained. Consider a multi-objective optimization problem as below:(51) max { f 1  ( x )  , f 2  ( x )  , … , f n  ( x )   }  , s . t .  x ∈ S     where f n  ( x )     is the nth objective function, x    is the vector of decision variables, and S    is the feasible solution space of problem. Using AUGMECON2 methodology leads to a transformation of this framework as:(52) max  f 1  ( x )  + e p s ( S 2  r 2   + S 3  r 3   × ( 10 − 1   )  + … + S n  r n   × ( 10 − ( n − 2  )    )   )     s . t .     f 2  ( x )  = ε 2  + S 2      f 3  ( x )  = ε 3  + S 2     ⋯    f  n  ( x )  = ε n  + S n        x ∈ S , S i  ∈ R                  where ε n     is right-hand side values of the particular iteration drawn from the grid points of the objective functions, S n     is the slack variable associated to objectives, r n     is the variation range of the respective objectives, and e p s    is a very small number (generally e p s ∈ [ 10 − 3   , 10 − 6    ]    ).  4.2 Scenario reduction method In this study, multi-stage stochastic programming method is employed. Solving multi-stage stochastic problems is notably challenging due to the exponential increase in problem scale with the addition of more scenarios, as highlighted by Mulvey and Ruszczyński (1995) . Additionally, the complexity of these problems extends the time required for solving, as noted by Heitsch and Römisch (2007) . In the model presented, uncertain parameters are addressed using a uniform probability distribution, which For demand, it is denoted as d d  ˜  c h s      and follows a uniform distribution U ( d d l , d d u  )    , where d d l    and d d u    represent the lower and upper bounds of demand, respectively. For rate of return, it is represented as r R  ˜  h s      and is also modeled using a uniform distribution U ( r R l , r r u  )    , with r R l    and r r u    indicating the lower and upper limits of the return rate. To effectively tackle these problems, it is first necessary to transform the continuous probability distributions into discrete ones. This involves creating a set of distinct scenarios, each accompanied by its respective probability of occurrence. To manage the number of generated scenarios, two primary approaches can be adopted: either selecting the most relevant scenarios through a forward scenario reduction process or eliminating less pertinent ones via backward scenario reduction (Dupačová et al., 2003 ; Gröwe-Kuska et al., 2003 ). In this study, the backward scenario reduction method has been chosen. This heuristic approach is instrumental in narrowing down the problem space by systematically filtering out scenarios, thereby facilitating the generation of a more manageable and relevant set of scenarios for analysis. First, assume that we approximated a continuous probability distribution to Ω    discrete scenarios. We want ω    scenarios to be remained (it means Ω − ω    scenarios must be deleted). Consider F    and G    as the distribution of n-dimensional stochastic process with s i     and s k     scenarios and the probability of occurrence f i     and g k    . Consider c T  ( s i  − s j   )     as distance between scenarios and j    is the index of deleted scenarios. Algorithm 1 represents the steps of this algorithm.Algorithm 1 Backward scenario reduction algorithmImage 1        4.3 Metaheuristic algorithms Metaheuristic algorithms are frequently employed to address complex problems encountered in the real world (Aghsami et al., 2023 ; Salari et al., 2022 ). Given that many of these problems are NP-hard and cannot be resolved within a feasible timeframe using traditional methods, metaheuristic algorithms offer a practical approach for finding near-optimal solutions efficiently (Bakhshi et al., 2023 ; Mirabnejad et al., 2022 ). Although a wide variety of algorithms have been developed, each tailored to specific types of problems, not every algorithm is universally applicable (Wolpert and Macready, 1997 ). For the purposes of this study, algorithms such as NSGA-II, MOPSO, SPEA2, MOEA/D, and PESA-II were utilized to attain near-optimal solutions within a reasonable timeframe. These algorithms are well-documented in the literature for their robust performance in solving complex problems (Aghabegloo et al., 2023 ; Hajipour et al., 2021 ; Yazdani and Haghani, 2023 ). The subsequent sections will provide detailed explanations of each of these algorithms. 4.3.1 Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) was introduced by Deb et al. (2002)  as a method for solving complex multi-objective optimization problems. This algorithm begins by generating a random population of potential solutions. At the core of NSGA-II are three key operators: non-dominated sorting, crowded comparison, and density estimation. In non-dominated sorting, solutions are ranked into layers or fronts based on dominance criteria. A solution is deemed dominant if it is equal or superior in all objectives and superior in at least one objective compared to another solution. This process hierarchically organizes solutions from the most to the least optimal. Subsequently, the algorithm applies the crowded comparison operator. This step involves calculating the crowding distance, a measure indicating how closely packed the solutions are in the objective space. This metric is essential for maintaining diversity within the solutions and preventing premature convergence to a sub-optimal area of the solution space. In addition to these specific operations, NSGA-II utilizes standard genetic algorithm operators, such crossover, and mutation, to produce new solutions. NSGA-II merges the current and newly generated solutions, then reapplies non-dominated sorting and crowding distance calculation to choose the optimal candidates. This method ensures the preservation and transmission of the best features in the solutions. The algorithm iterates this process, continuously improving the solutions with each generation. It incorporates elitism, ensuring the retention of the top solutions for the subsequent generation. This strategy achieves a balance between exploring the solution space, which promotes diversity, and exploiting the best solutions, thereby improving result quality. NSGA-II concludes its operation upon meeting a predefined termination criterion, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or achieving a satisfactory solution quality level. The final outcome is a set of solutions representing the optimal trade-offs among the objectives, known as the Pareto front. This front is crucial in multi-objective optimization, as it provides decision-makers with a spectrum of optimal solutions, allowing them to select based on their specific preferences and constraints. Algorithm 2  presents the pseudocode for NSGA-II.Algorithm 2 NSGA-IIImage 2        4.3.2 Multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) is an optimization technique that adapts the principles of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address problems involving multiple objectives (Coello Coello and Lechuga, 2002 ). In MOPSO, each particle in the swarm represents a potential solution, and these particles move through the solution space, drawing inspiration from their own best positions and those of their neighbors. This movement is guided by the principle of non-dominated sorting, where a solution is considered non-dominated if no other solution is better in all objectives. This approach leads to the formation of a Pareto front, a set of diverse solutions where each represents a unique balance of the objectives. A key feature of MOPSO is the maintenance of an archive or repository that stores the best non-dominated solutions found during the search process. This evolving Pareto front guides the swarm's movements. Ensuring diversity among the solutions is crucial in MOPSO, as it encourages exploration of various regions of the solution space, preventing the swarm from converging prematurely on a narrow set of solutions. The algorithm iterates, with particles updating their positions in a quest to improve the non-dominance and diversity of the solutions in the repository. As the iterations progress, the repository gradually converges towards a stable Pareto front. The algorithm typically concludes either after a predetermined number of iterations or once the improvements taper off. The end result is a collection of non-dominated solutions, offering a spectrum of trade-offs among the objectives, from which decision-makers can select based on their specific needs and constraints. MOPSO, with its roots in swarm intelligence and its adept handling of multiple objectives, stands out as a powerful tool in the realm of optimization. Algorithm 3  presents the pseudocode for MOPSO.Algorithm 3 MOPSOImage 3        4.3.3 Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm version 2 (SPEA2) The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm version 2 (SPEA2) is an evolutionary algorithm specifically designed for solving multi-objective optimization problems (Zitzler et al., 2001 ). It's an iteration-based process that evolves a population of solutions towards an optimal set, known as the Pareto front, where no single objective can be improved without degrading at least one other objective. The core structure of SPEA2 involves two main components: a population and an external archive. The population holds potential solutions, while the external archive stores the non-dominated solutions found during the process. Each solution is evaluated based on two criteria: dominance and density. Dominance refers to how many solutions a given solution dominates or is dominated by, while density is estimated based on the distance to the kth nearest neighbor, providing a measure of solution clustering. SPEA2 begins with a random population and an empty archive. In each iteration, the algorithm performs selection, crossover, and mutation to generate new solutions. The fitness values are then assigned based on dominance and density measures. The archive is updated by including non-dominated solutions, and if it exceeds its size limit, the least crowded solutions are retained. The unique aspect of SPEA2 is its fitness assignment strategy, which combines both raw fitness (based on dominance) and density information, ensuring a diverse set of solutions. The algorithm iteratively refines the solutions until a termination condition is met, typically after a predefined number of iterations, resulting in a Pareto-efficient set of solutions that represent the best trade-offs among the objectives. Algorithm 4  presents the pseudocode for SPEA2.Algorithm 4 SPEA2Image 4        4.3.4 Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) The Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) is an approach to solving multi-objective optimization problems (Zhang and Li, 2007 ). It stands out for its unique methodology of decomposing a multi-objective optimization problem into a set of single-objective subproblems, each solved simultaneously in a collaborative manner. MOEA/D's structure is grounded in the concept of decomposition. The algorithm initially breaks down the multi-objective problem into several simpler subproblems using techniques like Tchebycheff, weighted sum, or penalty-based boundary intersection. Each of these subproblems focuses on a specific region of the objective space and is typically associated with a unique weight vector. The algorithm maintains a population of solutions where each individual solution is primarily responsible for solving one of the subproblems. During the evolutionary process, MOEA/D iteratively improves these solutions by employing standard evolutionary operations like crossover, and mutation. A key feature of MOEA/D is the emphasis on neighborhood relations; solutions mainly undergo crossover and mutation with others that are solving neighboring subproblems. This encourages diversity and helps in effectively exploring the objective space. MOEA/D's approach ensures that the final solution set provides a well-distributed representation of the Pareto front. It efficiently handles complex multi-objective problems by converting them into more manageable single-objective tasks, making it particularly effective in scenarios with high-dimensional and complex objective spaces. Algorithm 5  presents the pseudocode for MOEA/D.Algorithm 5 MOEA/D Image 5        4.3.5 Pareto Envelope based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II) Pareto Envelope based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II) is an evolutionary algorithm designed for tackling multi-objective optimization problems (Corne et al., 2001 ). It is an enhanced version of the original PESA, offering improved efficiency and effectiveness in identifying a diverse set of optimal solutions. PESA-II operates by maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation in the search space. This balance is achieved through a unique archiving and selection mechanism. The algorithm divides the population into two distinct groups: an internal population and an external archive. The internal population is used for generating new candidate solutions, while the external archive stores the non-dominated solutions found during the evolutionary process. One of the key features of PESA-II is its grid-based approach for maintaining diversity among the solutions. The objective space is divided into hyper-boxes, and the algorithm aims to evenly distribute solutions across these boxes. This helps in avoiding overcrowding in certain regions of the objective space and ensures a well-distributed representation of the Pareto front. During the evolutionary process, PESA-II selects parents from the external archive, employing crossover and mutation to create offspring that are placed in the internal population. The algorithm then evaluates these offspring and updates the external archive with any non-dominated solutions, ensuring the best solutions are retained. Solutions in more crowded hyper-boxes are less likely to be chosen, promoting diversity in the solution set. PESA-II's grid-based archiving and selection approach effectively addresses the issue of maintaining diversity in multi-objective optimization, making it a robust choice for problems where a wide exploration of the objective space is crucial. Algorithm 6  presents the pseudocode for PESA –II.Algorithm 6 PESA –IIImage 6        4.3.6 Representation of solutions and applied operators The current study utilizes metaheuristics with a real coding technique for solution representation, which is particularly effective in addressing complex challenges. In this method, solutions are represented as vectors of real numbers, providing a detailed and nuanced portrayal of potential solutions. The primary advantage of this approach is its capacity to convert problem parameters into a numerical framework, enhancing precision and operational efficiency in processes such as crossover and mutation. These enhancements are vital for robust exploration and optimization in the solution space, especially with complex issues. Our proposed solution representation comprises a multi-dimensional matrix structure, tailored to effectively manage and optimize various components of a logistics and supply chain network. This representation is designed to handle complex interactions between vehicles, demand points, distribution and collection centers, recovery centers, repair facilities, and production centers, across a diverse range of products. The foundational layer of our solution consists of four primary matrices: the Position Matrix, the Recycling Matrix, the Repair Matrix, and the Factory Matrix. Each of these matrices is aligned with key operational areas of the supply chain. The Position Matrix, defined by the dimensions of the number of vehicles and demand points, facilitates the optimal allocation of vehicles to meet demand. The Recycling Matrix, encompassing potential distribution and collection centers, recovery centers, and an index of products, orchestrates the flow of products through the recycling process. The Repair Matrix, linking distribution or collection centers with repair centers and categorized by product types, manages the repair lifecycle of products. Lastly, the Factory Matrix connects production centers with distribution centers, segmented by product types, thus optimizing the production and distribution process. Crucially, each of these matrices is paired with a corresponding Priority Matrix of identical dimensions. These Priority Matrices play an essential role in operational decision-making by assigning priority levels to various elements within each primary matrix. For instance, the Position-Priority Matrix guides the prioritization of vehicle deployment across demand points, while the Recycling-Priority Matrix determines the precedence of product types and routes in the recycling process. In scenarios where multiple, ' S   ' number of scenarios are considered, our solution representation further extends to include separate sets of these matrices for each scenario. This approach allows for tailored strategic planning under diverse operational conditions. The scenario-specific matrices enable the supply chain system to be agile and responsive, adapting to different situational demands while maintaining efficiency and sustainability. Fig. 3   presents a sample of the Recycling matrix, showing its structure and replication across ' S   ' scenarios. A key element of these algorithms is the crossover process, which combines features from two distinct solutions to create a new one. This process involves setting a parameter, “gamma", which controls the level of stochasticity in the crossover operation. This is critical in continuous code representation, where variables typically range between 0 and 1. During crossover, random scalar values named α    are generated for each element of the parent solutions. Drawn from a uniform distribution between -gamma and 1+gamma, these values dictate the extent of each parent's influence on the offspring. An α    value near 0 favors the second solution, whereas a value close to 1 leans towards the first solution's traits. This balance enables the merging of information from both parents, potentially leading to a diverse and more effective new solution. Subsequently, a boundary constraint operation ensures that each component of the new solution remains within predefined limits, maintaining its feasibility. The mutation operation in metaheuristic algorithms begins with an input solution, accompanied by a mutation rate and standard deviation, which dictate the perturbation magnitude. This process involves determining the number of variables and the fraction of these to mutate, based on the mutation rate. A random selection of indices from the variable space is made, ensuring that ′ n M u ′     variables undergo mutation. The algorithm duplicates the current solution, creating a variant labeled β   , and introduces random perturbations to the selected variables in β   , based on a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and the specified standard deviation. This introduces controlled randomness, potentially altering the candidate solution. To ensure the solution's validity within the problem's constraints, a boundary check is applied. Each variable in β    is confined within the 0 to 1 range, preventing deviations beyond feasible limits. This safeguard is essential for maintaining the integrity and applicability of the mutated solution in the context of the problem.    5 Numerical results The proposed model undergoes validation through testing on a set of test problems to assess its effectiveness. Diverse test problems are randomly generated and subsequently solved. Notably, the solutions to these test problems are obtained using the commercial GAMS 23.1 by Baron solver. Additionally, the implementation of the backward scenario reduction and metaheuristic algorithms is carried out using MATLAB R2015b. These computational processes are executed on a laptop equipped with a Core i7 7500U CPU and 8 GB of RAM, leading to the attainment of optimal solutions. 5.1 Computational experiments In this subsection, the generation of test problems is discussed. Specifically, a set of test problems consisting of four small-sized and three large-sized scenarios is presented. The variations in their sizes are detailed in Table 2  . The input parameters for Problem #01 can be found in Appendix A . Problems #05, #06, and #07 are specifically utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the metaheuristic algorithms since exact methods become impractical for large-sized problems. While the primary focus of the metaheuristic algorithms is on addressing large instances, it's worth noting that Problem #04, which represents a smalle-sized scenario, is also solved using these metaheuristic algorithms for comparative analysis.  5.2 Model validation In our comprehensive approach to model validation, we rigorously assessed the model's accuracy by conducting a detailed comparison of its outputs with established datasets, ensuring a precise representation of the target real-world system. This process involved an in-depth examination of the alignment between the model's results and well-recognized principles within the relevant domain, significantly enhancing the credibility and reliability of the model. A critical aspect of our validation process involved evaluating the model's response to variations in key parameters. This scrutiny was essential to ascertain that the model consistently produces logical and expected outcomes, a fundamental requirement for its practical application. Moreover, the robustness of the model was meticulously tested against a spectrum of input variations. This testing demonstrated the model's ability to maintain logical consistency and stability under a variety of scenarios, thereby underlining its practical applicability and resilience. To achieve a thorough understanding of the model's behavior, we systematically modified several parameters that influence the objective functions and other relevant variables as hypothesized. For example, we examined the impact of altering the distance between nodes i    and j    (denoted as d i j  i j     ) on fuel consumption and transportation costs, which consequently affects both the first and second objective functions (denoted as Z 1     and Z 2    ), respectively. An increase in d i j  i j      resulted in a rise in Z 1     due to an increased total travel distance, while Z 2     decreased as longer distances entail higher fuel consumption (as depicted in Fig. 4  ). Another pertinent example is the influence of the maximum allowed time per route (denoted as T m a x   ). By extending T m a x   , we observed a reduction in Z 1    , Z 2    , and Z 3    . This reduction can be attributed to the need for fewer vehicles, which not only results in cost savings but also allows vehicles to cover more nodes (thus reducing leftover fuel) and reduces employment needs. These outcomes align perfectly with our initial expectations (refer to Fig. 5  ). The results of these output analyses were subsequently discussed with domain experts. Through these discussions and validations, the performance of the model received expert approval, further solidifying its practical utility and accuracy in the intended application domain.  5.3 Results In this subsection, the results for Problem #01 are presented. The Pareto-optimal solutions, obtained using AUGMECON2, are detailed in Table 3  . To enhance the visualization of the trade-offs between the objectives and their pay-off relationships, Fig. 6   is included for clarity. In light of the significant emphasis on environmental and social factors, a Pareto-optimal solution was selected that balances fuel conservation and job creation effectively. The details of this chosen solution are presented in Table 4  . Furthermore, to aid in a better understanding and to provide a more comprehensive view of this solution, we have included a visual representation in Fig. 7  . As the problem size increases, the time required to solve it also escalates. This correlation between the size of the problem and the time taken to solve it is depicted in Fig. 8  . Notably, with an increase in problem size, the solution time tends to rise exponentially. Consequently, to address large-sized problems within a reasonable timeframe, the application of metaheuristic algorithms becomes essential. To tackle this issue, we have implemented five distinct metaheuristic algorithms, enabling us to efficiently find solutions for problems of substantial size.  5.4 Evaluation of metaheuristics using computational methods 5.4.1 Evaluating metrics and tuning parameters of algorithms To assess the effectiveness of various Pareto fronts, it's essential to quantitatively compare multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms using specific performance metrics. Given the conflicting and non-comparable characteristics of the approximated Pareto sets, it is advisable to employ a range of metrics for a comprehensive quality evaluation. In this context, this study employs three widely recognized performance indicators: Maximum Diversity (MD), Spacing Metric (SP), and the Rate of Pareto Solutions (NOS), as detailed by Gharaei and Jolai (2018) . These metrics are concisely summarized in Table 5  . Metaheuristic algorithms' performance is highly dependent on their parameters, so they should be tuned. The Taguchi method and the RSM are both widely used for tuning. Taguchi's method (Taguchi, 1986 ) uses discrete levels to tune algorithms, whereas the RSM (Box and Wilson, 1992 ) uses continuous levels. The input parameters for metaheuristics are defined as factors, with each factor (x i    ) measured at two levels, coded from − 1    to 1   , depending on what the range is (i.e., an interval range of each factor). Therefore, the independent variables (z i    ) regarding the factors are:(53) z i  = x i  − ( x h  + x l   )  / 2  ( x h  − x l   )  / 2   , i = { 1 , 2 , . . . , K  }      where K    corresponds to the number of variables. The following polynomial response surface function (y   ) is used to compute the response of the set of independent variables:(54) y = β 0  + ∑ j = 1  k  β j  z j  + ∑ j = 1  k  ∑ i < j  k  β i j   z i  z j  + ∑ j = 1  k  β j j   z j j  2  + ε     where β 0    , β j    , β i j      and β j j      are the constant of the linear coefficient, the interaction coefficient (β i j     ), and the quadratic coefficient (β j j     ), respectively. For each factor, the span of parameters must be specified, so initial ranges of parameters are obtained from literature, for instance from (Gharib et al., 2022 ; Seydanlou et al., 2022 ). The algorithms should be fine-tuned using all of the test problems, and the average is used to determine the recommended parameters for algorithms.  5.4.2 Computation results In this section, we begin our analysis by assessing the capability of metaheuristic algorithms to find solutions that are closely aligned with the optimal ones for Problem #4. This evaluation involves a comparison against benchmarks set by the results of a commercial solver. Subsequently, we leverage the predefined performance metrics to conduct an in-depth comparative analysis, comparing the metaheuristic algorithms against one another across a series of increasingly complex problem instances. The Hypervolume (HV) metric (Fig. 9  ) is utilized for this comparison, including against the commercial solver, and its results are illustrated in Fig. 10  . To ensure a thorough comparison, we undertake multiple iterations—60, to be precise—to compile a comprehensive set of solution sets. In each iteration, we calculate the Hypervolume for the solutions produced by both the commercial solver and the metaheuristic algorithm. These calculations enable us to track the percent of the absolute differences in Hypervolume between the two methodologies throughout the 60 iterations. The aggregated data from these iterations is then presented in a box plot, providing a succinct and clear visual representation of the performance discrepancies between the methods, as shown in Fig. 10 . The outcomes indicate that across 60 repetitions, a significant majority of the cases yielded an absolute gap of zero between the implemented algorithm and the commercial solver. In instances where a gap was present, it was found to be minimal, underscoring the robust performance of the algorithms, particularly MOPSO and MOEA/D. This is especially noteworthy in the context of this test problem, where the discrepancy between optimal solutions was relatively minimal. Upon a thorough examination of the performance metrics outlined in Table 5 , we can determine the metaheuristic algorithm that exhibits the most exceptional performance. The values for each metric are presented in Table 6  . Notably, when compared to other metaheuristic algorithms, MOPSO demonstrates substantial performance advantages. In all instances, MOPSO consistently maintains its high-level performance. Detailed discussions of the results for each metric are provided in Figs. 11–13    . In terms of the average number of Pareto solutions, MOPSO consistently exhibited superior performance compared to other methods across all replications. The exception was Problem #04, where MOEA/D outperformed MOPSO. However, MOEA/D faced challenges in delivering desirable results for Problems #05, #06, and #07. Remarkably, on average, MOEA/D was able to identify 34 solutions for Problem #04 that remained non-dominated by other algorithms. Following MOEA/D, MOPSO came closest with 26 solutions. In Problem #05, MOPSO's performance stood out with an average of 48 non-dominated solutions, which was at least double the count achieved by the second-best performing algorithm, NSGA-II. For Problems #06 and #07, the algorithms demonstrated relatively similar performance. SPEA2 consistently had the lowest performance, identifying an average of 14.129 solutions. It's worth noting that PESA-II closely mirrored this performance with 14.592 solutions. In contrast, MOPSO consistently excelled, with over 80% of its solutions—averaging 41.813—being non-dominated solutions. Fig. 11  provides a comprehensive overview of the algorithms' performance based on the average number of non-dominated solutions. Utilizing the boundary solutions acquired, Fig. 12  visually depicts the distances between these solutions. Interestingly, no discernible specific pattern emerges across the various algorithms. Notably, PESA-II consistently exhibited the weakest performance across all instances, while MOPSO consistently showcased the most favorable performance. The performance of MOPSO and NSGA-II closely paralleled each other, with instances where NSGA-II even outperformed MOPSO, notably in Problems #05 and #06. Fig. 13  provides an illustration of the distribution of non-dominant solutions along the Pareto front. Notably, MOPSO consistently outperformed other metaheuristic algorithms in every instance, achieving an average superiority of 0.057. In Problems #05, #06, and #07, NSGA-II demonstrated the best performance following MOPSO, with corresponding metrics of 0.028, 0.039, and 0.032. It's worth highlighting that, apart from MOPSO and NSGA-II, the remaining algorithms consistently delivered satisfactory performance based on this metric, showcasing their competence in various problem scenarios.   5.5 Sensitivity analyses This subsection presents sensitivity analyses to illustrate the model's efficiency. It is important to note that the entire sensitivity analysis process is conducted on a particular Pareto-optimal solution. The analysis begins by examining the critical parameter of distance between nodes, an essential factor in routing problems. Fig. 14   demonstrates the impact of the distance between node i    and j    (denoted as d i j  i j     ) on various variables. An increase in d i j  i j      leads to a rise in the first objective function (Z 1    ) due to the increased variable costs associated with longer distances between nodes. On the other hand, the second objective function (Z 2    ) tends to decrease, as greater distances typically result in higher fuel consumption, thereby reducing the total remaining fuel in routing vehicles. The third objective function (Z 3    ) remains relatively unaffected. Furthermore, a longer distance is likely to result in a longer average route time (R T   ). The analysis then shifts to the impact of the product return rate. Fig. 15   explores how the product return rate (r R  h s     ) affects the model. An increase in r R  h s      typically requires setting up more repair and recycling centers (represented as S R    and S E   ), leading to a significant increase in the number of returned products processed by these facilities. As a result, the first objective function (Z 1    ) is likely to increase due to higher costs associated with establishing and transferring to these new centers. The second objective function (Z 2    ) remains unaffected by this change. However, the third objective function (Z 3    ) sees an increase, as the establishment of more centers correlates with the creation of additional job opportunities. The subsequent phase of the analysis examines the impact of the maximum route time, a factor of significant importance in the model, especially in terms of the operational decision-making timeframe. Fig. 16   illustrates the consequences of adjusting the maximum allowable time for routes (T m a x   ) on decision-making. A reduction in T m a x    leads to a noticeable decrease in the average route time (R T   ). This, in turn, necessitates an increase in the number of routing vehicles (Y   ) used to fulfill the demands. This decrease in route time is likely to cause an increase in the first objective function (Z 1    ). In a similar vein, the second objective function (Z 2    ) is expected to rise due to the shorter travel times and the reduced number of stops per routing vehicle. Moreover, employing more vehicles correlates with more job creation, thereby enhancing the third objective function (Z 3    ). The evaluation now focuses on assessing the impact of the maximum allowed vehicles of depots. This parameter stands as a sensitive parameter, exerting influence on various variables. Fig. 17   demonstrates the effect of maximum allowed number of allowed vehicles of each DC/CC (A V   ) on some variables. An increase in A V    leads to a rise in the number of employed routing vehicles (i.e., Y). Interestingly, an inverse relationship is noticeable; as each DC/CC is capable of hiring more routing vehicles, the number of opened DC/CCs (i.e., SD) decreases. Consequently, the first objective function (i.e., Z 1    ) experiences a downward trajectory. Meanwhile, the second objective function (i.e., Z 2    ) shows marginal alterations. The reduction in the necessity for opened DC/CCs contributes to a decrease in the third objective function (i.e., Z 3    ) and created career opportunities. Next, the effect of created job opportunities by the establishment of a repair centers (J o e  e h     ) are analyzed and illustrated in Fig. 18  . As can be seen, by increasing J o e  e h     , total created job opportunities will rise and the third objective function (i.e., Z 3    ) will be enhanced, new repair centers will establish which are even more than the needs. Number of repairs centers (i.e., S E   ) has increased while the number of recycling centers (i.e., S R   ) is constant. The establishment of new repair centers has caused an increase in total costs and the first objective function (i.e., Z 1    ). The second objective function (i.e., Z 2    ) remains unchanged. Finally, the relation between scenarios and objective functions, as sustainability goals, are analyzed. The scenarios, generated as outputs of the backward scenario reduction method, are essential components in our model as they approximate continuous probability distributions with discrete scenarios. In this analysis, we systematically varied the generated scenarios to understand their influence on the model outcomes. The results of this sensitivity analysis are presented in Fig. 19  , providing valuable insights into how changes in scenarios impact the performance of our proposed model. As can be seen in Fig. 19 , two scenarios are generated using the backward scenario reduction method. In the first scenario, the total demand remains relatively stable. However, in the second scenario, the product rate of return is slightly higher than in the first scenario. Alongside alterations in distribution and collection planning, there are more items to collect in the second scenario. This increase in the number of returned products, coupled with changes in routing, leads to higher costs, fuel consumption, and an increased demand for recycling and repair centers. It is noteworthy that changes in distribution and collection planning, influenced by variations in demand and product rate of return, lead to more rapid alterations in the environmental objective function (i.e., Z 2    ). Subsequently, the social objective function (i.e., Z 3    ) experiences more pronounced changes compared to the economic objective function (i.e., Z 1  )   . Table 7   examines the relationship between the percentage of recyclable products (r R C  h    ) and the percentage of repairable products (r R P  h    ). In the problem's input parameters, equal emphasis is placed on both repairing and recycling returned products. This implies that the costs and job creation associated with establishing either a repair or a recycling center are roughly equivalent. A balance between recyclable and repairable products leads to a reduction in overall system costs. However, if either recyclables or repairables dominate, it results in an increase in the total cost of the system. The planning for distribution is influenced by factors such as demand (denoted as d d  c h s     ) and distance (d i j  i j     ). This analysis focuses on understanding how demand impacts the distribution model. In Table 8  , adjustments in d d  c h s      result in variations in the distribution planning. As the overall demand escalates, there is an increase in the network's total costs and the necessity for more jobs. The growth in demand leads to the utilization of vehicles with greater capacity, which, in turn, have higher fuel consumption. Consequently, this escalates costs and reduces the remaining fuel in vehicles. While other parameters remain constant, the routing itself remains unchanged, but there are alterations in the loaded quantity within the vehicle and the remaining fuel at different nodes. A significant shift in demand can lead to changes in the routing plan and an increase in costs. When demand varies widely, it leads to increased fuel consumption and the need for more vehicles, even if the total demand is lower. Conversely, if demand variations are minimal, even with high overall demand, the management and routing of the network become more manageable. The fuel consumption of routing vehicles is influenced by the type of vehicle, the distance traveled, and the traveling speed. The traveling speed is indicative of road congestion. During periods of high congestion, meeting the maximum time requirements for serving nodes becomes challenging. Additionally, traffic congestion leads to increased fuel consumption, necessitating the use of vehicles with better fuel efficiency. However, this shift towards more fuel-efficient vehicles can result in higher operational costs. Table 9   explores the relationship between the average speed of vehicles between nodes (denoted as S i j  i j     ) and other related variables. It is evident that when roads are congested and average speeds are low, the use of more expensive, fuel-efficient vehicles becomes necessary. This leads to increased costs and the creation of more jobs in the network.   6 Discussion & managerial insight In this study, we developed a three-echelon SCLSC network, integrating crucial decisions about location, allocation, and routing. This versatile model is adaptable to various industries and product types, encompassing both the distribution of products and the concurrent collection of returns. To maintain the model's universal applicability, we categorized returned products into two groups: recyclable and repairable. Recyclable products are processed into new items, while repairable ones are refurbished for resale in secondary markets. Our model addresses all key strategic, tactical, and operational decisions within the network, including site selection, resource allocation, supplier evaluation, transportation, fleet sizing, and routing, through a dual-stage framework focused on three core objectives of sustainable networks. Incorporating simultaneous pick-up and delivery with green VRP in these networks not only reduces costs but also significantly contributes to environmental preservation. Our goal now is to offer insights and guidance to managers and decision-makers. By adopting these recommendations, they can not only make more efficient and cohesive decisions but also significantly advance toward sustainability objectives and fully embrace the principles of the circular economy.• Understanding the impact of distances between nodes is crucial for cost-effective and environmentally friendly operations. Managers should prioritize the deployment of fuel-efficient and eco-friendly vehicles for longer routes. Although this may initially increase expenses, the long-term benefits in fuel savings and reduced environmental footprint are substantial. To offset the longer travel times, logistics strategies such as extended route times and adjusted work schedules can be implemented to maintain efficiency without incurring significant additional costs. Incorporating a GPS-based route optimization system that dynamically adapts to traffic conditions and distances ensures the most efficient routes are always utilized.  • In SSC, the rate of product return is a pivotal factor. Managers can view increased return rates as an opportunity to enhance the circular economy, even though it may raise system costs. Increased product returns offer the potential for job creation and promote consumer participation in sustainability. Balancing the establishment costs of recovery centers against social and environmental benefits requires careful financial planning. Initiatives like consumer incentive programs for product returns, coupled with investment in automated systems at recycling and repair centers, can efficiently handle increased volumes.  • Vehicle allocation decisions are crucial, with more vehicles at each depot potentially reducing costs but also impacting job opportunities. Managers must judiciously balance cost efficiency with social responsibilities like job creation. Diversifying the vehicle fleet and forming local job creation partnerships can offset potential job reductions, harmonizing cost savings with employment opportunities.  • The variability in demand significantly affects supply chain dynamics. In high-demand scenarios, having adequate center and vehicle capacity, and scalable workforce is essential. In situations of pronounced demand fluctuations, adopting flexible and eco-conscious routing strategies is crucial. Utilizing advanced demand forecasting tools powered by AI and machine learning can help predict demand changes and optimize resource allocation.  • Traffic congestion directly influences fuel consumption and routing efficiency. Scheduling deliveries during less congested times and exploring alternative, less congested routes, even if longer, can result in fuel and time savings. Employing traffic prediction technologies and alternative route planning software can optimize routing decisions in real-time and circumvent peak traffic hours.  • Managing uncertainties, like fluctuating demand and product return rates, necessitates a flexible and dynamic management approach. Focusing on adaptable strategies that effectively harmonize economic, environmental, and social objectives is essential. Establishing a team dedicated to monitoring market trends and customer behaviors enables swift adaptation of supply chain strategies to emerging conditions.     7 Conclusion This study introduced an integrated location-allocation-routing problem within a three-echelon SCLSC network, encompassing PCs, DC/CCs, DPs, recycling centers, repair centers, and secondary markets. Two types of transportation were considered: the first involved direct transfer of vehicles between PCs and DC/CCs in the direct flow and between DC/CCs and repair or recycling centers in the reverse flow. The second involved routing distribution vehicles between DC/CCs and DPs to simultaneously deliver products and collect returned items. Green routing was implemented, taking into account vehicle speed and fuel consumption between nodes. The first objective function sought to minimize total costs, the second aimed to maximize the remaining fuel in each vehicle to reduce CO2 emissions, and the third sought to augment job opportunities locally throughout the network. The model promoted circular economy goals in the supply chain by incorporating product returns. It was designed to integrate strategic, tactical, and operational decisions within the supply chain network. Considering real-world conditions, demand and product return rate uncertainties were modeled using stochastic programming. To generate suitable scenarios, a heuristic backward scenario reduction method was employed. The model's performance was validated by solving four small-sized instances in GAMS software using an improved ε-constraint method, AUGMECON2. Additionally, five metaheuristic algorithms—NSGA-II, MOPSO, SPEA2, MOEA/D, and PESA-II—were applied to larger problems. To confirm the model's performance and validity, sensitivity analyses and managerial insights for decision-makers were provided. In conclusion, the outcomes of the proposed model are summarized as follows.• The MOPSO demonstrated superior performance across various metrics when compared to alternative algorithms. Notably, it excelled in terms of the rate of Pareto solutions, maximum diversity metric, and spacing metrics.  • Increased investment holds the potential for substantial enhancements in environmental and social standards. Allocating additional funds and establishing more centers not only facilitates job creation but also fosters long-term individual development and employment. Furthermore, heightened investment enables the adoption of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient vehicles, contributing to a significant reduction in environmental impacts.  • The products rate of return emerges as a crucial parameter, playing a pivotal role in advancing the principles of circular economy and sustainability. Additionally, it serves as a catalyst for job creation.    This study acknowledges certain limitations and suggests areas for improvement to be addressed in future research.• The current model did not include disruption and resilience strategies. Future research could explore integrating these strategies to enhance the model's ability to handle unexpected events. This investigation is crucial for understanding the robustness and adaptability of the proposed network, contributing valuable knowledge for effective risk mitigation.  • The proposed model excluded split delivery considerations. Future studies should examine the impact of split delivery on the network's performance, particularly in terms of social and environmental metrics. This exploration will offer deeper insights into the effectiveness and sustainability implications of split deliveries in supply chain networks.  • In the developed model, separate refuel stations were not included, despite being a common feature in related literature. For enhanced realism, future iterations of the model should consider incorporating the option for vehicles to refuel during trips at these stations. This addition could provide a more practical and applicable framework for supply chain management.  • Incorporating inventory decisions into the current model represents a significant avenue for future research. This involves developing more comprehensive models that seamlessly integrate inventory management with other key aspects of supply chain decisions. Such integration would include a detailed focus on varying inventory levels, effective replenishment strategies, and accurate demand forecasting mechanisms. Further investigation is needed to understand how different inventory policies influence the overall performance and resilience of the supply chain, particularly in response to fluctuating market demands and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, exploring advanced inventory strategies, such as Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) and Just-In-Time (JIT) delivery, within the context of the proposed model is crucial.    Addressing these limitations will not only strengthen the model but also extend its applicability and relevance to real-world supply chain challenges.
