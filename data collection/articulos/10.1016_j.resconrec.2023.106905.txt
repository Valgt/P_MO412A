                  The five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to livelihood, energy, ecosystem, and water (LEEW) are highly interlinked, and their progress is a strong stepping stone to achieve other SDGs. However, research about the effective actions for promoting them in the Asian Water Tower (AWT) region (16 countries) is limited. Here, we measured the interactions (synergies and trade-offs) among and the performances of 24 SDG targets related to LEEW based on calculating correlation coefficients, network analysis, and index-based and benchmarking analysis. By aggregating the results, we eventually prioritized the 24 targets to provide evidence-based support for identifying holistic and synergistic actions across scales. Targets 2.3 (agricultural productivity), 7.1 (modern energy services), 7.2 (renewable energy), 15.2 (sustainable forests), 15.5 (habitat and biodiversity conservation), 15.6 (sharing benefits from genetic resources), and 1.a and 15.a (resources mobilization) were top-prioritized. Mainstreaming them along with numerical target values into strategies across scales can be a useful starting action. Additionally, we highlighted several obstacles for these SDGs’ progress (e.g., trade-offs among basin water and energy resource management in the future energy-oriented LEEW actions) and some keys to support their achievements (e.g., interdisciplinary research, sectoral transformation, and transnational and cross-basin collaboration).

The five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to livelihood, energy, ecosystem, and water (LEEW) are highly interlinked, and their progress is a strong stepping stone to achieve other SDGs. However, research about the effective actions for promoting them in the Asian Water Tower (AWT) region (16 countries) is limited. Here, we measured the interactions (synergies and trade-offs) among and the performances of 24 SDG targets related to LEEW based on calculating correlation coefficients, network analysis, and index-based and benchmarking analysis. By aggregating the results, we eventually prioritized the 24 targets to provide evidence-based support for identifying holistic and synergistic actions across scales. Targets 2.3 (agricultural productivity), 7.1 (modern energy services), 7.2 (renewable energy), 15.2 (sustainable forests), 15.5 (habitat and biodiversity conservation), 15.6 (sharing benefits from genetic resources), and 1.a and 15.a (resources mobilization) were top-prioritized. Mainstreaming them along with numerical target values into strategies across scales can be a useful starting action. Additionally, we highlighted several obstacles for these SDGs’ progress (e.g., trade-offs among basin water and energy resource management in the future energy-oriented LEEW actions) and some keys to support their achievements (e.g., interdisciplinary research, sectoral transformation, and transnational and cross-basin collaboration).

More importantly, they are the basis of moving the progress toward all SDGs closer to the values set for 2030 (Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Zaman et al., 2017 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ), given the highly interactive core of the SDGs (United Nations, 2015 ). These SDGs can be classified as livelihood (SDGs 1 and 2), energy (SDG 7), ecosystem (SDG 15), and water (SDG 6), that is, the LEEW. From 2000 to 2021, although Asia has made progress on several SDGs, it is still not on track to achieving these five SDGs by 2030 (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Particularly, the Asian Water Tower (AWT) region, composed of 16 countries centered on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, represents a major priority and challenge for Asia to make progress toward the five SDGs. The Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau is the world's highest plateau and a storehouse of multiple ecosystem services and substantial biological species (Lin et al., 2021 ). Often referred to as the “AWT”, this plateau is the source of multiple rivers (e.g., Yangtze, Yellow, and Lancang Rivers), contains many glaciers (e.g., Himalayan and Nyenchen Tanglha Glaciers), and involves many critical transboundary river basins (e.g., Mekong, Amu Darya, and Brahmaputra) (Yao, 2018 ). The ecosystem services that are provided by the AWT in terms of agricultural diversity, water, and nutrients to vast arable lands in river basins, are critical for livelihoods and energy security and economic development at the regional scale (Kandel et al., 2021 ). For example, at least 1.9 billion people reside in the major river basins that are involved in this vast plateau, and around 3.4 billion people depend on the food produced in these river basins (World Bank, 2021 ). Overall, the 16 countries centered on it have close and complex interactions, such as the supply and demand of multiple ecosystem services (Carpenter et al., 2006 ), the management of basin water and energy resources (Wang et al., 2021 ), and ecosystem conservation and economic development (Lin et al., 2021 ). Thus, by using the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau as the center, this study recognized the region consisting of 16 countries1  1 The 16 countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.   covered by the major river basins this plateau involves as the AWT region (Fig. S1), where progress toward LEEW-related SDGs can significantly affect the Asian and even global progress. Previous studies have indicated that due to rapid population growth and long-term intensive use of natural assets for rapid expansion of urbanization (Tian et al., 2016 ), most of Asian countries have confronted serious LEEW-related crises, including unprecedented species loss, ecosystem degradation, and considerable loss of water and primary energy, all of which are adversely affecting the livelihoods and wellbeing of people (Tian et al., 2016 ; Hughes, 2017 ; Yao, 2018 ; Gray et al., 2020 ; Jin et al., 2021 ); and the climate change has been intensified, resulting in the melting of glaciers and multiple boomerang effects (problems), such as famine, displacement, and economic loss (World Meteorological Organization, 2022 ). However, research about the spatiotemporal variations of the performances of the five LEEW-related SDGs in the AWT region is limited, and how these SDGs interact as a whole remains elusive. More importantly, effective actions for promoting them in the region are deeply lacking. Substantial studies have noted that assessing a manageable sequence of steps toward SDGs can be useful to provide evidence-based support for setting such actions (Allen et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, these studies have mostly been global- and national-scale analyses, reflecting an important knowledge gap of SDG prioritizations on a regional scale (e.g., the AWT region or Asia). They have prioritized SDGs based on multiple approaches, such as the expert elicitation (Leitner, 2017 ), systematic mapping of policy gap (Fourie, 2018 ; Forestier and Kim, 2020 ; Allen et al., 2021 ), correlational network analysis (Le Blanc, 2015 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ; Breu et al., 2021 ), and indicator-based benchmarking analysis (Sachs et al., 2019 ; Huan et al., 2021a ). However, the SDG prioritizations acquired by adopting those different approaches (assessment perspectives) can be inconsistent (Huan et al., 2022 ). Adopting an integrated assessment framework (e.g., considering the interactions among and performances of SDGs) instead of a siloed method is necessary to create co-knowledge for identifying SDG prioritizations and promoting action coherence (Rasul and Sharma, 2016 ; Allen et al., 2019 ). To fill the above highlighted research gaps, this study addressed three major questions. First, how do the targets of five LEEW-related SDGs interact in the AWT region? Second, what are the spatiotemporal variations of the progress toward these SDG targets in the AWT region? Third, what are the prioritizations of these SDG targets in the AWT region? To answer these questions, we constructed a composite assessment framework based on the correlation coefficient calculation, network analysis, and index-based and benchmarking analysis (Section 2 ). According to our results (Section 3 ), we discussed the holistic actions in the region and some obstacles and keys for achieving the progress toward LEEW-related SDGs (Section 4 ). Overall, this study provides new insights into the interactions, performances, and prioritizations of LEEW-related SDGs in the AWT region and ensures a promising avenue to identify entry points for action coherence, regional cooperation, and national transformation.  2 Methods We constructed an integrated assessment framework (Fig. 1  ), including two assessment perspectives, to eventually prioritize the targets of the five LEEW-related SDGs in the AWT region. For the first perspective, we aimed to assess the interactions (synergies and trade-offs) among targets, and the impact of each target in that interaction network (Section 2.1 ). To do so, we selected 38 indicators for the 24 targets of the five LEEW-related SDGs, collected indicators’ data from 16 countries between 2000 and 2019, assessed the interactions among targets by calculating the Spearman's correlation coefficients between those indicators, built a network of the target interactions, and scored the network impact of each target based on the degree centrality metric. For the second perspective, we aimed to assess the progress toward targets and LEEW dimensions in the AWT region over time, and the gap between the current and ideal (target is achieved) performance of each target (Section 2.2 ). To do so, we adopted the same 38 indicators and national data from 2000 to 2019 mentioned above, interpolated the missing data, normalized the data, aggregated them into the target scores by arithmetic mean method, measured the “composite performance” of each LEEW dimension based on two indices of “general performance” and “coupling coordinated performance”, and scored the gap between the current and ideal performance of each target by using a gap scoring tool. Finally, we conducted the integrated assessment (i.e., aggregating two scores for each target acquired from the above two perspective assessments), and used the final score for each target to prioritize the 24 LEEW-related SDG targets in the AWT region (Section 2.3 ). 2.1 Mapping the impacts of targets in the interaction network According to data availability, the 24 targets of the five LEEW-related SDGs were measured using 38 indicators applicable to the regional scale (i.e., 9–10 indicators for each LEEW dimension and its targets; Table S1). Indicators were chosen from several global and Asian influential indicator lists; and we collected related data from the 16 countries between 2000 and 2019. See the sources of indicators and data in the Supplementary Information. Following Pardhan et al. (2017)  and Warchold et al. (2020) , we adopted Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ  ) to assess quantitatively the interactions between two indicators (i.e., indicator pairs) of all possible combinations, in which 0.5 ≤ ρ ≤ 1    and − 1 ≤ ρ ≤ − 0.5    indicate synergy and trade-off, respectively; and − 0.5 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.5    represents an uncertain interrelationship. If the P-value of an interrelationship's ρ is greater than 5% (i.e., not statistically significant), then the interrelationship is classified as uncertain. Given the different attributes of indicators, to avoid wrong results, we assigned a positive sign to a positive indicator (the higher data value of the indicator, the better the performance of sustainable development), and a negative sign to a negative indicator (the lower data value of the indicator, the better the performance of sustainable development) (Pardhan et al., 2017 ). The interrelationship between two targets (synergy, uncertain, or trade-off) was determined by the percentage of the three interrelationships between the indicators belonging to them. For example, two targets, each containing three indicators, produce a total of nine interrelationships between the two targets. With five synergies (55.56%), three trade-offs (33.33%), and one uncertain interrelationship (11.11%), the main the interrelationship between thes two targets is synergy. If both synergy and trade-off show the same occurrences, then the interrelationship is defined as uncertain. The percentage was used to avoid possible bias that may be caused by different data availability for the indicators. By adopting network analysis methods (Weitz et al., 2018 ; Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ), we created a network of the synergies and trade-offs to assess the centrality (i.e., network impact) of each target. This network consisted of interactions (links/ties/edges) among 24 targets (nodes/vertices). A link can represent a positive or negative interaction between nodes. Specifically, we considered synergistic target pairs as positive edges, and target pairs showing trade-offs as negative edges. The degree centrality of a node is a direct measure of a node's centrality, defined as the sum of the number of ties belonging to that node (Eq. (1) ) (Freeman, 1978 ).(1) C D  ( i )  = ∑ j N  x i j        In Eq.1 , i   is the given target; C D  ( i )     is the degree centrality of the target i  ; j   is all other targets; N   is the total number of targets; x   is the adjacency matrix, in which cell x i j     is defined as 1 if target i   is directly linked to target j  , and 0 otherwise. We used the value of C D  ( i )     to represent the score of the network impact of each target (S I m p a c t    ). The larger the value of the degree centrality is, the higher the network impact, and the higher its priority will be.  2.2 Identifying the gaps between current and ideal progress toward targets We assessed the progress toward the 24 SDG targets and LEEW dimensions from 2000 to 2019 in the AWT region in four steps according to Huan et al. (2022) .Step 1. Indicators and data preparation.  Here, we adopted the same indicator framework (Table S1) and national database from 2000 to 2019, as constructed in Section 2.1 . Given that the complete time-series data are crucial for monitoring the progress (Sachs et al., 2018 ), according to Huan et al. (2021a ; 2021b ), we further used a combination of several approaches (e.g., Akima spline interpolation and linear interpolation) to interpolate the missing data (see examples in Table S2). By using the linear extreme values (a min-max approach; Huan et al., 2021a ), we then normalized the indicators’ data to a score range of 0–1 (see details in the Supplementary Information).  Step 2. Measuring the performance of each target.  For simplicity, each indicator included in a target was given equal weight. The arithmetic mean was adopted to score the performance of each target (G T a r g e t    ) every year (20 years in total) for each country (16 countries in total). Each score is from 0 to 1. Then, we adopted the arithmetic mean to measure the average performance (A G T a r g e t     ) of each target for each country.  Step 3. Measuring the general performance and coupling coordinated performance of each LEEW dimension.  Each target included in a dimension was given equal weight. The arithmetic mean was adopted to aggregate the G T a r g e t     of each dimension to score the general performance of each dimension (G D i m e n s i o n    ) every year (20 years in total) for each country (16 countries in total). Given that the SDG targets of LEEW are highly interlinked (Zaman et al., 2017 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ; Momblanch et al., 2019 ), on the basis of Eqs. (2)  and 3  (Warchold et al., 2020 ; Huan et al., 2021a ), the coupling coordinated performance of each dimension every year (20 years in total) for each country (16 countries in total) was assessed (the score is from 0 to 1).(2) C D i m e n s i o   = ( G T a r g e t  1   × G T a r g e t  2   × ⋯ × G T a r g e t  n    ( G T a r g e t  1   + G T a r g e t  2   + ⋯ + G T a r g e t  n    n  )   n   )  1 n       (3) C C D i m e n s i o n   = C d i m e n s i o n   × G D i m e n s i o n           In Eqs. (2)  and 3 , C D i m e n s i o n     is the coupling degree of a dimension; n   is the number of targets contained in that dimension; and C C D i m e n s i o n      is the coupling coordinated performance of that dimension.  Step 4. Measuring the composite performance of each LEEW dimension.  By adopting Eq. (4)  (Li et al., 2012 ; Yang et al., 2014 ; Huan et al., 2021a ), we aggregated the general performance (G D i m e n s i o n    ) and coupling coordinated performance (C C D i m e n s i o n     ) of each LEEW dimension to assess the composite performance of each LEEW dimension every year (20 years in total) for each country (16 countries in total). Each score is from 0 to 1. Then, we adopted the arithmetic mean to measure the average composite performance (A C o m p o s i t e D i m e n s i o n     ) of each LEEW dimension for each country.(4) C o m p o s i t e D i m e n s i o n   = G D i m e n s i o n   × C C D i m e n s i o n             In Eq. (4) , C o m p o s i t e D i m e n s i o n      is the composite performance of a dimension. A dashboard tool (Fig. 2  ) was further adopted to measure/score the gap between each target's current and ideal (target is achieved) performance. This tool was reformed from Allen et al. (2019)  and Huan et al. (2022) .(1) Average performance level of each LEEW dimension.  The values of each LEEW dimension's average composite performance in the interval ([0, 1]) can be divided into three equally spaced regions, where each value in the interval represents a stage of the average composite performance (unfavorable, transitional, or favorable). On the basis of this standard, the C o m p o s i t e D i m e n s i o n      we acquired from Step 4 can be categorized into one of these three stages.  (2) Average performance level of each target.  The values of each target's average performance in the interval ([0, 1]) can be divided into three equally spaced regions, where each value in the interval represents a stage of the average performance (bad, medium, or good). On the basis of this standard, the A G T a r g e t      we obtained from Step 2 can be categorized into one of these three stages.  (3) Trend of each target's performance over time.  On the basis of the performance scores of each target in 2000 and 2019 (i.e., the G T a r g e t     assessed in Step 2), the trend of the performance of each target can be categorized as one of three types (downward, fluctuating or upward).  (4) Gap score.  On the basis of the three aforementioned assessments, each target in each country can acquire a score representing the gap between each target's current and ideal performance (the score is from 0 to 26). For example, the average performance of the water dimension was at the unfavorable stage in Afghanistan; its average performance of target 6.1 (safe and affordable drinking water) was at the bad level; and the trend of the performance of target 6.1 over time in the country was upward (Fig. 4 ); hence, according to the dashboard tool (Fig. 2 ), the "gap" score of target 6.1 in Afghanistan was 24. The final gap score for each target (S G a p    ) in the AWT region was obtained by calculating the sum of the gap score of each target in each country. The higher the final score of a target is, the more urgent it is, and the higher its priority will be.     2.3 Integrated assessment: prioritizing targets After obtaining each target's scores for network impact (S I m p a c t    ) and performance gap (S G a p    ), we separately normalized the two scores (Eq. (5) ; Allen et al., 2019 ).(5) S N = S E  − S m i n    S m a x   − S m i n          In Eq. (5) , S N    is the normalized score; S E    is the score of a target (i.e., S I m p a c t     or S G a p    ); S m a x     and S m i n     are the minimum and maximum scores of all targets' scores for S I m p a c t     or S G a p    , respectively. Finally, the weighted arithmetic mean (Huan et al., 2022 ) was adopted to combine the two scores for each target (Eq. (6) ).(6) S F  = ( ( S N I m p a c t   × W I m p a c t    )  + ( S N G a p   × W G a p    )   )  × 100      In Eq. (6) , S F    is the final score for each target (out of 100). The higher the target score is, the higher its priority (ranking) will be. S N I m p a c t      and S N G a p      are each target's two normalized scores. W I m p a c t     and W G a p     are the weights for two normalized scores. Given that no unified standard is available to set these weights, we set them equally. To test the sensitivity of the targets’ rankings to different weighting schemes, we used Monte Carlo simulations (Resce and Schiltz, 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ) using 1000 sets of randomly generated simulated weights from a uniform distribution (between 0 and 1) to calculate the possible final scores (S F   ) and rankings of each target under different weighting schemes. The sum of two simulated weights for each set is 1.   3 Results 3.1 Network impacts of targets Our results presented a larger share of synergies (16.67%) than trade-offs (8.33%) among the LEEW dimensions for the AWT region (Fig. 3a  ), indicating underlying opportunities to achieve the sustainable LEEW. Nevertheless, substantial challenges were posed by existing trade-offs, such as those between target 7.2 (increase the share of renewable energy) and livelihood and water dimensions (Fig. 3a ). See detailed results of interactions in the Supplementary Information. We further calculated the degree centrality score of each target to reflect the impact of each target in the interaction network (Fig. 3b ). The larger the value of the degree centrality of a target is, the greater its network impact and the higher its priority will be. Among the 24 targets assessed, target 2.1 (end hunger) had the greatest network impacts, followed by targets 7.1 (ensure access to modern energy services) and 7.2, and then targets 1.2 (reduce by half the proportion of people living in poverty), 1.4 (ensure equal rights to economic resources and access to basic services), and 6.2 (adequate sanitation and hygiene). By contrast, targets 2.4 (sustainable food production and resilient agricultural practices) and 7.a (enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology) had the least network impacts (no links belonging to them were observed) (Fig. 3b ). Overall, the targets of the livelihood dimension and ecosystem dimension had the largest and smallest impacts in the network of LEEW interactions for the AWT region, respectively.  3.2 Gaps between current and ideal progress toward targets We assessed quantitatively the performance of each LEEW dimension and its targets in the AWT region from 2000 to 2019. The performances of the livelihood and energy dimensions showed a striking spatial difference, and the ecosystem and water dimensions’ progress presented a relatively better consistency across countries. Overall, those variations can be minimized mainly by promoting a balanced progress toward SDG targets 2.2 (end malnutrition), 6.3 (adequate sanitation and hygiene), 6.6 (protect water-related ecosystems), 7.2 (increase the share of renewable energy), 15.1 (ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of ecosystems and their services), 15.2 (sustainable management of forests), and 15.5 (reduce the degradation of natural habitats and halt the loss of biodiversity) across countries (Fig. 4   and Table S3). Temporally, the regional performances of 20 targets showed a gradual increase, whereas the regional performances of targets 1.a (ensure mobilization of resources to provide means for developing and least developed countries to end poverty), 7.2, 15.2, and 15.5 indicated a decreasing trend over time (Fig. 4  and Table S4). We adopted a dashboard tool (Fig. 2 ) to score the gap between each target's current and ideal performance (Fig. 4 ). The larger the gap is, the more urgent the target, and the higher its score and priority will be. Overall, targets 15.a (increase financial resources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems), 7.a (enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology), 7.b (expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services), 15.6 (promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources), and 7.2 (increase the share of renewable energy) had the largest gap, indicating that the urgency to improve their performances in the AWT region is the highest. Targets 2.1 (end hunger), 6.1 (safe and affordable drinking water), 1.4 (ensure equal rights to economic resources and access to basic services), 1.2 (reduce by half the proportion of people living in poverty), and 6.2 (adequate sanitation and hygiene) had the smallest gap (Fig. 4 ).  3.3 Prioritizations of targets We integrated two scores (i.e., scores for network impact [ S I m p a c t     ] and performance gap [ S G a p     ]) for each target into one score to provide an integrated assessment of the final priority of each target. The higher the final score is (out of 100), the higher the comparative priority of the target will be. The results showed that the highest prioritized targets (score > 60) included targets 7.2 (increase the share of renewable energy), 7.1 (ensure access to modern energy services), 2.3 (double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers), 15.2 (sustainable management of forests), and 1.a (ensure mobilization of resources to provide means for developing and least developed countries to end poverty). The lowest scores (score < 30) were of targets 2.4 (sustainable food production and resilient agricultural practices) and 7.3 (double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency) (Fig. 5  ). No matter what weighting scheme was used, the average rankings of 17 targets in the AWT region fluctuated by less than three places, whereas the others changed between three and four places. Interestingly, except for target 7.2 (increase the share of renewable energy), none of the targets ranked as high priority (i.e., performed in the top third of targets) across two perspective assessments (i.e., assessments of network impacts and gap between the current and ideal performance) (Fig. 5 ). The top and bottom prioritizations of targets obtained through the two assessments were different, especially the rankings of targets 1.2 (reduce by half the proportion of people living in poverty), 2.1 (end hunger), 7.a (enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology), 7.b (expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services), and 15.a (increase financial resources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems) (Fig. 5 ). This result confirms that prioritizations obtained from different approaches or perspectives may not be consistent, which can hinder decision making.   4 Discussion 4.1 Holistic actions and potential obstacles The old concept of food, energy, and water nexus has become globally popular after the Bonn2011 Nexus Conference (Liu et al., 2016 ). Plenty of studies have emerged (Jalilov et al., 2013 ; Smajgl et al., 2016 ; Kurian, 2017 ; Weitz et al., 2017 ; Yuan et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ), and included more concepts into the nexus, such as the ecosystem (Karabulut et al., 2019 ; Yuan and Lo, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2021 ), poverty (Van Noordwijk et al., 2018 ; Reyers and Selig, 2020 ), and environment (World Economic Forum, 2011 ; Liu, 2016 ; Rasul and Sharma, 2016 ; Zaman et al., 2017 ; Momblanch et al., 2019 ). However, the research about how the livelihood (poverty reduction and food), energy, ecosystem, and water interact as a whole is limited, and their sustainability progress and prioritizations in Asia remain elusive. By using five SDGs as proxies, this study deepens the understanding of the LEEW nexus. Our results highlighted that the LEEW-related action priorities can be energy-oriented in the region (Fig. 5 ), yet the high trade-offs among energy and water dimensions need to be considered (Fig. 3a ). Access to clean energy (e.g., hydropower and biofuels) can consume large amounts of water (Yuan et al., 2018 ), competing with water needed for agricultural activities, especially in arid and semi-arid areas (Alcamo, 2019 ). Previous research using financial figures has also indicated that the renewable energy can compete heavily with water sector (e.g., desalination and wastewater treatment) for financial resources (Daher and Mohtar, 2021 ). For countries with high portion of the budget for energy imports and subsides, although investing in renewable energy carries high capital and running costs in the short time, over the longer term, the investment releases strain from the national budget, resulting in overall savings (Daher and Mohtar, 2021 ). Notably, due to the increasing demand for energy, more dams will be constructed in the developed transnational rivers in the AWT region (Wang et al., 2021 ). Proper coordination of the dam sites and water allocations is critical to avoid conflicts between locals from up- and down-streams (de Grenade et al., 2016 ). Our study provides new insights into LEEW-related SDG prioritizations at the regional level. Considering the level of network impacts and the current gap of systemic contributions, our prioritization results (Fig. 5 ) can serve to set synergistic actions for accelerating the overall progress toward the five SDGs in the AWT region. We highlighted the importance of increasing agricultural productivity (SDG target 2.3), modern energy services (SDG target 7.1), renewable energy (SDG target 7.2), sustainable forests (SDG target 15.2), habitat and biodiversity conservation (SDG target 15.5), sharing benefits from genetic resources (SDG target 15.6), and resources mobilization (SDG targets 1.a and 15.a), that is, the top-eight prioritized targets (Fig. 5 ). Mainstreaming them along with specific numerical target values into strategies across scales can be a useful starting action. Several potential obstacles for the five SDGs’ progress in the AWT region require attention. First, the impacts of the evolving COVID-19 variants (e.g., lengthy lockdowns, disruptions in supply chains, and the transfer of financial resources for affordable food and fuel prices) have slowed down the global LEEW progress (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ). Second, the war in Ukraine in 2022 has complicated the SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); for example, it has raised the uncertainty in global oil and gas markets and aggravated the energy prices spiking since 2021 (International Energy Agency, et al., 2022 ). Additionally, climate change is a significant direct driver of change in nature and its contribution to humanity in the AWT region in the coming decades. Multiple key climate change indicators (e.g., greenhouse gasses concentrations) reached new record highs in 2021, and climate-related hazards have caused huge economic losses, hunger, population displacement, degraded ecosystems (e.g., glaciers melting), and biodiversity losses.  4.2 Keys to success Some keys to support the achievement of the LEEW-related SDGs can be considered. First, governments, local stakeholders, and society need to advance the collection and sharing of data and knowledge. In our study, around 14.13% of the target interrelationships cannot be measured due to the data availability (Fig. 3a ). Sharing data is basic for organizing information, developing a series of indicators, and improving the accuracy of indicator-based assessment (Maes et al., 2019 ). Second, the interdisciplinary collaboration is critical for research communities. The 17 SDGs cover a range of visions related to human wellbeing (i.e., broad context and scale) and were designed to be highly interlinked (United Nations, 2015 ). By focusing on the five LEEW-related SDGs, this study provides a starting point to address the main sustainability issues facing the AWT region. Other SDGs can be further included in future research, so the synergies can be maximized. Different departments of the public (and private) sectors can break down the barriers (Le Blanc, 2015 ). Our results (Fig. 5 ) showed that for the AWT region, the top-six prioritized SDG targets attributed equally to three dimensions of livelihood, energy, and ecosystem. However, they are often managed by different sectors, indicating that greater cross-sectoral integration (or cooperation) is urgently required (Katila et al., 2019 ). To do so, the specific logic steps can include characterizing the type of nexus to which the action belongs (Zhang et al., 2019 ), assessing the nexus status to identify whether the present nexus among sectors is tension or de-escalation (Wang et al., 2021 ), and conducting risk assessments (Weitz et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, having a leading institution responsible for SDGs can be useful (Nerini et al., 2019 ). Regional and national policy-makers and local stakeholders need to promote transnational and cross-basin collaboration. The cross-basin water resource management (related to SDG 6) in the AWT region (Lawford et al., 2013 ; Kurian, 2017 ) can address the issues of trade-offs in countries, such as the negative externalities of upstream changes in water use for downstream countries (Smajgl et al., 2016 ). There exists a potential to simultaneously develop renewable energy (related to SDG 7) in the north-western area of the AWT region (i.e., Central Asia) and increase agricultural income (related to SDG 2) in coastal countries, which needs to overcome obstacles from various policy authorities (i.e., requiring political and economic negotiations among countries) (Jalilov et al., 2013 ). The performance of SDG 1 (no poverty) can present spatial correlation and spillover effects in most countries of the AWT region (Huan et al., 2021b ). Most ecosystem services focused by the first five targets of SDG 15 (life on land) were provided at the local or national scale, but their supply was affected by regional or global-scaled progresses (Lin et al., 2021 ), especially in a diverse region covered by multiple river basins (e.g., the AWT region). However, most current SDG actions have been set from a national or subnational perspective, which have rarely considered lager scales (Bhatt et al., 2020 ). Such actions for different countries are only summed in a simple way for regional (or global) action-making and may miss key SDG targets, thereby hampering the regional (and global) SDG progress (Zhu et al., 2021 ). We therefore recommend governments and stakeholders in the AWT region to undertake joint commitments, continuously set synergized goals, and accelerate collaborative across-scale actions.  4.3 Limitations and uncertainties Several limitations and uncertainties in the assessment are noteworthy. First, different indicator selection can affect the assessment results (Huan et al., 2022 ), and data availability is often a critical challenge for indicator-based methods including ours. Second, data interpolation may cause uncertainties of scores of the targets’ achievement performance. Different interpolation approaches have different focuses and potential errors (Huan et al., 2019 ), and the most appropriate combination should be considered for each application (Huan et al., 2022 ). Third, we chose and integrated two assessment perspectives (i.e., network impacts and performance gaps) to prioritize the SDG targets, but such personal choice may unavoidably cause biased results. More assessment perspectives (e.g., policy gaps) can be included in future research, and we suggest that minimizing the effects of personal decisions through extensive experts’ judgement and structural literature review. Fourth, the Spearman's correlation coefficients were adopted to map the SDG interactions, but they do not indicate causality (Le Blanc, 2015 ). Nevertheless, the causal relations of some targets were explained in this study based on existing studies that used experts’ elicitation, literature review, or causal analysis. Daher and Mohtar (2015)  presented a conceptual scenario-based framework and a dynamic modeling tool to assess the water–energy–food nexus. Developing more analytical frameworks and tools is indispensable, which can enable us to build directed and weighted networks to assess dynamic variations of SDG interactions (Breu et al., 2021 ), investigate the mechanisms behind the interactions (Wu et al., 2022 ), and find ways to address conflicts among SDGs (Nilsson et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, the higher-order network influences of targets (Toth et al., 2021 ) were not considered in this study, leading to less accurate centralities of the targets. Even so, the first-order interactions among targets are usually informative and have considerably greater effects on the results (Allen et al., 2019 ).   5 Conclusion The five LEEW-related SDGs are the main components or foundations of the transformative changes required to move toward sustainable and equitable futures. Various ways can be adopted for setting priorities for SDGs. Regardless of the approach used, ensuring the prioritizations can construct the evidence base for actions is critical. Considering that many LEEW crises are interactive and transboundary in the AWT region, holistic actions can be identified in the context of maximizing the synergies among LEEW across scales, and minimizing the gaps between current and ideal progress. According to this study, there exists an opportunity to create coherent systems of Asian or even global LEEW actions. In the future, other SDGs that are highly interlinked with LEEW can be involved in the assessment to identify more evidence-based actions for promoting SDG progress in the AWT region.
