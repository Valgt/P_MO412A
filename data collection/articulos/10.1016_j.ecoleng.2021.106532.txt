                  Ecological programs (EPs) can reverse the degradation of ecosystems and promote the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The public understanding of the role of EPs in the context of SDGs can influence people's participation and decision-making. However, there is a lack of insights into the systematic patterns of cognitive associations between the programs and SDGs. Here we identify the public perception of EPs using mental maps that illustrate how people relate nine EPs to SDGs linked to nature, human well-being, and economic productivity. Based on information collected from stakeholders, it was found that “Soil and Water Loss Control”, “Sand Prevention and Control”, “Shelterbelt Construction”, and “Wetland Conservation” were indicated as the key programs for the achievement of SDGs in Linzhi. The mental map of the majority of the people identified trade-offs between the environmental/social and economic sustainability elements supported by EPs. Some people related multiple EPs to social and economic sustainability elements, while others primarily saw multiple EPs as targeting the environmental and economic sustainability elements. The dominant mental map here identified could serve as a model for engaging in, and communicating, ecological programs. We suggest a direction for addressing SDG trade-offs through ecological program-based management, which is based on three aspects: priority adjustment, integrated portfolio, and stakeholder engagement.

Fig. 3   Fig. 4 Synergies and trade-offs between SDGs under the support of ecological programs. The lower left corner represents synergies (green), trade-offs (orange), or non-classified data(yellow) observed among the SDGs, and the rectangular areas in each square cell indicate the degree of synergies or trade-offs for the SDG pairs. The upper right corner represents the number of EPs supporting SDG pairs (gray); SDGs are identified by the numbers in the diagonal. The mental map with positive scores indicates an above-average contribution rating of the programs toward the goals, while that with negative scores indicates a below-average contribution rating of the programs. The synergy between SDG 1 and SDG 2 in mental map 1 (with positive scores) illustrates that EPs contributed more strongly to achieving these two goals; the trade-off between SDG 8 and SDG 15 in mental map 1 (with positive/negative scores) indicates that EPs contributed more strongly to SDG 15 and more weakly to SDG 8; finally, the synergy between SDG 9 and SDG 10 in mental map 1 (with negative scores) shows that EPs contributed more weakly to achieving these two goals.

The public understanding of the role of EPs in the context of SDGs can influence people's participation and decision-making. However, there is a lack of insights into the systematic patterns of cognitive associations between the programs and SDGs. Here we identify the public perception of EPs using mental maps that illustrate how people relate nine EPs to SDGs linked to nature, human well-being, and economic productivity. Based on information collected from stakeholders, it was found that “Soil and Water Loss Control”, “Sand Prevention and Control”, “Shelterbelt Construction”, and “Wetland Conservation” were indicated as the key programs for the achievement of SDGs in Linzhi. The mental map of the majority of the people identified trade-offs between the environmental/social and economic sustainability elements supported by EPs. Some people related multiple EPs to social and economic sustainability elements, while others primarily saw multiple EPs as targeting the environmental and economic sustainability elements. The dominant mental map here identified could serve as a model for engaging in, and communicating, ecological programs. We suggest a direction for addressing SDG trade-offs through ecological program-based management, which is based on three aspects: priority adjustment, integrated portfolio, and stakeholder engagement.   Keywords Ecological programs  Sustainable development goals  Questionnaire survey  Mental map  Tibetan Plateau    1 Introduction Ecological programs (EPs) can restore and rebuild the structure and function of ecosystems to produce a range of valuable ecosystem services that benefit both human and nature (Costanza, 2012 ; Blicharska et al., 2019 ; Fu, 2020 ). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) concludes that protecting and restoring degraded lands makes sense from the ecological, economic and social points of view, and it is essential to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations (UN) (UN, 2015 ; IPBES, 2018 ). Recognizing the key role of restoration, in 2019 the UN declared the “Decade on Ecosystem Restoration” to accelerate the recovery process, and put the world on track for a sustainable future (UN, 2019a ). The UN Decade is from 2021 to 2030, which is also the deadline for the SDGs. Therefore, focusing on the contribution of ecological protection and restoration to these sustainability goals has both an important scientific and practical significance. Sustainable development goals provide a broad framework for government departments, ecological protection personnel, local residents, and other stakeholders to engage in, and communicate, ecological restoration to promote sustainability (UN, 2019b ). Increasing stakeholder participation and support, so that these actors can undertake their own activities, is important to contribute to the overall vision of the UN SDGs and UN Decade (Aronson et al., 2020 ). Understanding the views of stakeholders on the role of EPs can inform sustainable development communication, providing the information that is more likely to be supported and shared, thereby allowing practitioners to promote land-system sustainability policies in a way that is consistent with people's views. Using the responses of stakeholders, extensive efforts have been devoted to how policy makers should understand and use the information related to EPs in the context of sustainable development, to coordinate and shape government policies. A number of studies have comprehensively evaluated the contributions of single ecological program to multiple SDGs, or those of multiple programs to individual goals (Bandyopadhyay and Tembo, 2010 ; Petursdottir et al., 2013 ; Sheng et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2021 ). In particular, the “Grain for Green Program”, “Natural Grassland Protection Program”, “Natural Forest Conservation Program”, and “Wildlife Conservation Program” have attracted considerable attention (Viña et al., 2016 ; Mavah et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, studies have focused more on the impacts of ecological restoration on vegetation growth and biodiversity, resident income, food, and livelihoods (Zhang et al., 2021a ; Cao et al., 2021 ). Yet, little is known about the contributions of multiple EPs toward multiple SDGs. A systematic assessment of their role is essential for portfolio-wide planning, because each program will probably contribute to achieving several SDGs, and each SDG will be addressed by several programs (Bryan et al., 2018 ). While some information is available about the synergies and co-benefits of land management programs for SDGs on average (Bryan et al., 2018 ; Smith et al., 2019 ), a deeper understanding of people's ‘mental maps’ of the role of EPs is still lacking. A mental map denotes a visual representation of cognitive associations between constructs (Bain et al., 2019 ), in our case how people relate each ecological program to the achievement of each SDG, and these relationships can be different across people. For example, the “Soil and Water Loss Control” program might be considered as primarily contributing to SDGs linked to the health of the ecological environment and human well-being or economic growth; or all three sustainability elements can be equally evaluated. People's mental maps of the role of EPs can show which SDGs are considered as trade-offs or synergies. For example, if people believe that the implementation of an ecological program creates a tension between promoting ecosystem restoration (SDG 15) and increasing resident income (SDG 8), this may discourage them from accepting and upscaling such restoration program (Liu et al., 2008 ) (and vice versa). Knowing the relationships between SDGs under the support of EPs can emphasize the rediscovery of the positive impacts of programs on these goals to highlight synergies and mitigate trade-offs. The Tibetan Plateau—known as “the roof of the world”, “the third pole on Earth” and “the water tower of Asia”—is an important ecological security barrier for China and the entire Asian continent (Teng et al., 2018 ). However, various issues related to the ecological environment, such as grassland degradation, biodiversity loss, and water and soil loss, have emerged on the Tibetan Plateau due to climate change and human disturbance (Sun et al., 2012 ; Ye et al., 2013 ; Yang et al., 2020 ; Hua et al., 2021 ). To ensure ecosystem health, the Chinese government has implemented a number of ecological protection and restoration plans (Liu et al., 2018 ; Sun et al., 2020 ). EPs have played a key role in SDGs, and have influenced how people perceive environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Due to the high vulnerability of the ecological environment of the Tibetan Plateau, and the high dependency of regional development on ecological resources (Liu, 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ), it is urgent to conduct more studies on the benefits of EPs in this region. This study aims to identify the understanding of the potential role of EPs in contributing to SDGs, and thereby provide baseline information for the EPs' communication model, and better planning of sustainability interventions to achieve multiple SDGs efficiently and effectively. We consulted personnel in relevant government departments through a survey on their perceptions of the contributions of nine EPs to SDG targets. The collected information was used to address the following questions: (1) what are the participants' perceptions of the contributions of EPs to the SDG targets?; (2) what are the participants' views on the synergies or trade-offs between SDGs supported by EPs, and how they vary among people?; and (3) how do participant demographics affect these perceptions?  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The Linzhi region (92°09′-98°47′ E, 26°52′-30°40′ N) is located southeast of the Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 1  ). It includes one district and six counties, covering an area of 116,175 km2 , and has an average altitude of 3100 m. The region is characterized by the coexistence of complex and diverse climate types (which comprise the tropical, subtropical, temperate, and cold climates); the annual average temperature is 8.7 °C, with a frost-free period of 180 days, and the annual average precipitation is approximately 650 mm, mainly falling in the growing season. The dominant vegetation in Linzhi is forest, which covers over 46% of the area. The protection of the ecological environment is a priority here, as this region represents China's ecological security barrier. In Linzhi, the protection and construction planning of ecological security barrier has been implemented to mitigate land degradation, strengthen the construction of natural reserves, and increase the socio-economic benefits. However, as protected areas account for about 36% of Linzhi's land area, this region faces the challenge of balancing ecological protection and economic development (Zhao et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it was selected as a case study to evaluate the contributions of EPs to SDGs, and identify a way to optimize the programs' management in order to promote regional sustainable development.  2.2 Questionnaire design and data collection An anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted to evaluate the contributions of nine specific EPs toward the SDGs. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: 1) participants' demographics (gender, age, income level, department, and participation to ecological programs), and 2) assessment of the contribution of EPs to SDG targets using a six-point scale (0, not at all; 1, very low; 2, low; 3, moderate; 4, high; 5, very high). The most relevant SDG targets were chosen in the survey, while policy-oriented targets and those that had no clear connection with ecological restoration were excluded (e.g., reducing the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, or ensuring all girls and boys complete primary and secondary education; for the list of selected and excluded targets, see S1). Overall, 26 targets across 12 SDGs were considered (Table 1  ). EPs may contribute to the excluded SDG targets, but they were not evaluated here. The nine EPs were sourced from the protection and construction planning of ecological security barrier in Tibet (2008–2030) (Wang et al., 2017 ), all of which are ecological protection and ecological construction projects (Table 2  ). The survey was carried out in one district and six counties in Linzhi. The questionnaire was distributed to relevant government departments from July 24th to August 20th, 2019. Overall, 237 individuals participated, and 62 of them showed no variability in value ratings for the contributions of EPs to SDG targets, indicating that these participants may have rejected the identification of the role. Therefore, only the responses provided by the remaining 175 participants were considered valid. The questionnaire is included in the Supplementary Material (S2).  2.3 Relationships between EPs and SDGs 2.3.1 Descriptive analysis To evaluate the importance of EPs for the achievement of SDG targets, the average value of the contribution ratings of each ecological program to each target, given by all participants, was first calculated. Subsequently, the average values were normalized to a 0–1 range, and the results were divided into five levels (0–0.2, very low; 0.2–0.4, low; 0.4–0.6, moderate; 0.6–0.8, high; 0.8–1, very high). “Very low” and “low” were considered as “weak” contributions, “moderate” was considered as “moderate” contribution, and “very high” and “high” were considered as “strong” contributions.  2.3.2 Statistical analysis To offer insights into the public perceptions, mental maps of the role of EPs in contributing to SDGs were identified, and it was also evaluated how they varied among people. The identification of these mental maps required the simultaneous analysis of three dimensions: participants, ecological programs, and SDGs (the rating of SDGs was obtained by averaging the rating of targets under each SDG given by each participant). For this analysis the three-mode principal component analysis (3MPCA) (Kroonenberg, 2008 ; Bain et al., 2019 ) was performed, using the N-way toolbox in MATLAB (Kiers, 2000 ) (for technical description see S3 and S4). This method shows systematic patterns of the relationships between EPs and SDGs, and takes into account the different views of people. More specifically, we focused on the patterns of the relations between SDGs supported by programs. To understand who held different views within the mental maps, Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to find correlations between demographics and participant component scores (the basic outcomes of 3MPCA, which indicate to what degree the mental maps are relevant for the participants). Statistically significant correlations were considered at a p  < 0.05.    3 Results 3.1 Perceived importance of ecological program-SDG target contributions Survey participants did not evaluate all ecological program-SDG target (EP-T) contributions as equally important (Fig. 2  ), implying that there are differences in the potential role of EPs in achieving SDG targets. From a total of 234 EP-T combinations, 15 were perceived to have a “very high” importance and 71 to have a “high” importance for target attainment. Among these 86 EP-T combinations with strong contributions, “Soil and Water Loss Control”, “Sand Prevention and Control”, “Shelterbelt Construction”, and “Wetland Conservation” were perceived as contributing to the largest number of distinct SDG targets (17, 13, 13, and 12 targets, respectively), closely followed by “Wildlife Conservation and Nature Protection” (11), and “Forest Fire Prevention and Pest Control” (9). Overall, many programs simultaneously aligned with multiple SDGs, and, in particular, forestry EPs were considered to contribute more to the SDG targets. For 20 of the 26 SDG targets evaluated, at least one ecological program was considered to contribute strongly to the achievement of the targets (Fig. 3 a ). Of the selected 12 SDGs in the survey, SDG 1 (Poverty), SDG 3 (Health), SDG 6 (Water) and SDG 15 (Land) were believed to receive the greatest contributions from different ecological programs, with 6, 8, 6 and 9 programs contributing to targets under each SDG, respectively (Fig. 3 b). In addition, SDG 13 (Climate) and SDG 2 (Hunger) were also thought to receive relatively large contributions from the programs. These SDGs, which are linked to the health of the natural world and human well-being, were perceived to benefit the most from multiple ecological programs.  3.2 Perceptions of the relationships among SDGs supported by ecological programs Three mental maps describing the relationships between EPs and SDGs were identified (Supplementary Fig. S3), and they indicated that there was no single point of view on EPs. However, the first mental map was dominant, accounting for 86% of the total explained variation. While each mental map provided a considerable amount of information, the focus was on the relationships among SDGs supported by EPs (Fig. 4  ) (for the method used to identify relationships among SDGs see S4). The dominant mental map (Fig. S3a and b) showed that most EPs were seen as contributing more to the achievement of SDG 1 (Poverty), SDG 2 (Hunger), SDG 3 (Health), SDG 6 (Water), SDG 13 (Climate), and SDG 15 (land); and were less relevant for SDG 8 (Growth), SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Equality), SDG 11 (Cities) and SDG 12 (Consumption). That is, participants saw a primary trade-off between environmental/social and economic elements — more focus on the natural world and quality of life means less focus on sustained economic productivity (Fig. 4 a and b). Furthermore, SDG synergy or trade-off pairs under the support of EPs were observed. Among them, SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, and SDG 15 were ranked four times in the top-10 synergy pairs list, respectively (Fig. 5  , left panel), and SDG 9–12 were ranked twice in the top-10 trade-off pairs list, respectively (Fig. 5 , right panel). These results suggest that the contribution of EPs to most SDGs was considered to come at some cost to economic sustainability. In the second mental map (Fig. S3c and d), participants thought that at least one ecological program was more focused on achieving all SDGs. Therefore, here synergies were mainly captured among environmental, social, and economic elements (Fig. 4 c and d). Particularly, most EPs were conducive to the synergies of social and economic elements (e.g., synergies among SDG 1–12). In addition, trade-offs were detected between SDG 13/SDG15 and economic elements, but they represented only a minor component (Fig. 4 d). The third mental map (Fig. S3e and f) showed that some programs were seen as focusing more on achieving SDG 9–15, illustrating that participants saw a primary synergy between environmental and economic elements (Fig. 4 e). These results show that most EPs were perceived as targeting either both social and economic elements, or both environmental and economic elements.  3.3 Correlations between participant component scores and demographics In order to understand who specifically held different views within the mental maps illustrating the relationships among SDGs, Spearman rank correlation coefficients were obtained between each of three participant components and demographic variables (Fig. 6  ). Results showed that the dominant mental map (conflict between environmental/social and economic elements) was held more strongly by older and higher-income people, and those who participated considerably in ecological programs. The second (social and economic elements coordination) and third (environmental and economic elements coordination) mental maps were strongly held by people who were not very involved with the programs and women, respectively.   4 Discussion 4.1 Perceptions of ecological program-SDG target contributions Understanding the contributions of EPs to SDGs is essential in order to effectively adjust priorities and improve land management (Bryan et al., 2018 ). In this study, the survey results identified which EPs were perceived to strongly contribute to the attainment of 20 SDG targets. In particular, “Soil and Water Loss Control”, “Sand Prevention and Control”, “Shelterbelt Construction”, and “Wetland Conservation” were identified as key programs, each strongly contributing to more than 12 targets (Fig. 2 ). Based on local conditions, the EPs in the Linzhi region were more focused on forestry, and directly contributed to the restoration of forest lands and water bodies. Compared with other programs, these key programs produced relatively high ecosystem service values in food and water supply, soil retention, wind prevention and sand fixation, carbon storage, water conservation, and habitat quality (Vymazal, 2011 ; Xie et al., 2017 ; Lu et al., 2018 ; Jiang et al., 2020 ). As a result, they made more important contributions to multiple SDGs (Wood et al., 2018 ). However, the EPs that were ranked lower should not be discounted, and more research is needed to determine their contribution to the multiple aspects covered by the SDGs. Among the goals, SDG 1, SDG 3, SDG 6, and SDG 15 were believed to receive the greatest support from EPs (Figs. 2 and 3 ); and SDG 2 and SDG 13 were also thought to receive relatively strong contributions. EPs increase biodiversity and improve the ecological environment in the Tibetan Plateau (SDG 15) (Rey Benayas et al., 2009 ; Cai et al., 2015 ; Hou et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2021b ). In addition, they ensure the performance of ecosystem functions related to climate (SDG 13) and water (SDG 6), such as carbon storage, water quality control, and water storage (Xiang et al., 2016 ; Griscom et al., 2017 ; Lu et al., 2018 ; Lian et al., 2020 ). At the same time, local residents can use ecological resources to increase their income (SDG 1 and SDG 2) (Abdullah et al., 2016 ; Huang et al., 2018 ). EPs can also improve people's health (SDG 3), as in the case of restoration and afforestation for sand fixation, which cause a reduction in harmful dust storms (Kang et al., 2016 ). Bryan et al. (2018)  mapped the investment of China's 16 major land programs toward SDGs, and showed that most investment contributed to SDG 15, SDG 2, and SDG 1. In addition, the study also suggested that SDG 13, SDG 11, SDG 10, SDG6, and SDG 8 also benefited more from the programs. Compared with the results of program assessments in the entire China, the design of EPs in Linzhi was perceived as focusing more on environmental health and life quality. This shows that the current ecological planning does not yet adequately support the achievement of SDGs.  4.2 Mental maps of the relationships among SDGs supported by ecological programs The relationships among SDGs were represented by three mental maps. This indicated that managers should have a broader and deeper understanding of those EPs that aim to implement multifaceted strategies (Costanza, 2012 ; Mitsch, 2012 ; Wortley et al., 2013 ). In the present study, for a high proportion of participants, there was a primary trade-off between environmental/social and economic elements. The trade-offs observed here are in line with some expert models that contrast economic and environmental of sustainability (Waas et al., 2011 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). EPs may result in lock-in effects, where promoting one SDG may limit the achievement of others. To mitigate such effects, complementary programs or multiple policies are required. For example, the “Natural Grassland Protection” program for returning grazing to grassland might lead to unintended consequences, such as unemployment and increased production costs. However, these tensions could be skillfully managed via complementary programs, or policies aimed at increasing income and creating jobs. Policies that minimize trade-offs with SDG 8–SDG12 have been suggested to be the most effective. The synergies observed can be clearly connected to ecological programs. For example, SDG 15 and SDG 13 presented a highly synergistic state, illustrating that these land practices safeguard habitat and biological diversity, and enhance climate resilience (Griscom et al., 2017 ; Smith et al., 2020 ; Yao et al., 2021 ). Pradhan et al. (2017)  indicated that SDG 15 has trade-offs with other goals. However, synergies between SDG 15 and the other SDGs linked to human well-being were found in this study, and results indicate that bringing the role of EPs into the framework of SDGs provides an opportunity for pursuing synergies between SDGs. The present study also found that a small number of participants believed that some EPs have provided opportunities for synergistic social and economic elements, or environmental and economic elements. Zhen et al. (2018)  showed that different approaches adopted by local residents to manage the same ecological program will produce different benefits in the Tibetan Plateau, and that an environmental and economic “win-win” situation is possible when appropriate management practices are adopted. People's perception of sustainability reflects the implementation of ecological programs, the communication among people holding different mental maps may contribute to the understanding of how EPs further promote multiple SDGs and break the lock-in effects. For example, sharing and communicating the role of EPs could highlight how they address land degradation, help to develop ecology-related industries, and improve human well-being. This study also provided supplementary evidence for the economic and social benefits of EPs, showing that focusing on ecological environment outcomes can be as effective as focusing on the social or economic impacts of these programs (Nielsen-Pincus and Moseley, 2013 ; Sheng et al., 2019 ; McElwee et al., 2020 ). The dominant mental map was held more strongly by older and higher-income people, and those who participated considerably in ecological programs. These people may have been engaged in such programs for a long time, and their assessments of the contributions toward the goals may be more experienced (Sapp et al., 2013 ). The second and third mental maps were held more strongly by people with low participation in programs and women, respectively. Their evaluations of the contributions may be more consistent with their own beliefs (Sapp et al., 2013 ). As people with different experiences and beliefs hold different perceptions of the role of EPs, understanding their mental maps and identifying which information is widely accepted, provides the possibility to achieve resonance among different people. Therefore, it is recommended to use the dominant mental map as a policy guide and communication model for ecological programs, as it can contribute to improving people's engagement with ecological sustainability management, and to gaining the widest support to promote ecological restoration and sustainable development.  4.3 Ecological program-based management for SDG synergies A key aim of China's EPs is to jointly solve systemic socio-economic and environmental issues (Liu et al., 2007 ). An ecological program-based approach provides opportunities to capture synergies between SDGs. The present study considered ecological program-based management based on three aspects: priority adjustment, integrated portfolio, and stakeholder engagement. Priority adjustment puts an emphasis on giving priority to cost-effective ecological programs, and priorities are constantly adapted over time. In the Linzhi region, “Soil and Water Loss Control”, “Sand Prevention and Control”, “Shelterbelt Construction”, and “Wetland Conservation” should be given priority. Programs should also consider local suitability, selecting appropriate project sites, species, and ecosystems to adapt to climate change and other disturbances (Ghestem et al., 2014 ). The integrated portfolio aspect refers to the fact that EPs contribute to multiple SDGs through a multi-pronged policy instrument. In this study, it was recognized that the program-based management alone was insufficient to achieve all SDGs in Linzhi, and that EPs will need to be complemented by laws and socio-economic initiatives on minimizing trade-offs with SDG8–SDG12. The third aspect, stakeholder engagement, highlights the fact that people with different experiences and beliefs engage in, and communicate, EPs to share management approaches and identify potential solutions for SDGs synergies.   5 Conclusion The survey results reflected the broad supporting role of EPs in meeting SDGs. Although we were unable to evaluate the contributions of EPs to all SDG targets, a number of programs, including “Soil and Water Loss Control”, “Sand Prevention and Control”, “Shelterbelt Construction”, and “Wetland Conservation”, were identified as important for the achievement of more than 12 SDG targets in Linzhi. Furthermore, three mental maps of how EPs and SDGs are related were identified. The dominant map illustrated the trade-offs between environmental/social and economic sustainability supported by EPs, while the other two maps identified primary synergies between economic and social/environmental sustainability. It is here recommended to use the dominant mental map as a guide for communicating the role of EPs in Linzhi. By clarifying the role of EPs, we help chart a direction for the consideration of ecological program-based management into local sustainable development plans. This study provides a regional empirical analysis of the role of EPs under the framework of UN SDGs. However, we are aware that there are limitations in terms of survey sampling, and this research would benefit from responses of other typical areas and different stakeholder groups over the Tibetan Plateau. Future research will combine participant perception with biophysical and socioeconomic indicators, and will integrate them into the evaluation model for quantitative research to track and predict the effects of ecological protection and restoration.
