                  Traditional triple bottom line approach used in existing neighbourhood sustainability assessment (NSA) tools provide an unbalanced focus on sustainability dimensions and are non-spatial. As a consequence, these tools may not aid decision-making process of different stakeholders. For this purpose, we propose an urban sustainability spatial hotspot analysis that integrates the Five Capitals Model (FCM) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The FCM based NSA framework redefines sustainability in existing NSA tools as it considers the maintenance of five major stocks – natural, social, human, financial, and manufactured – in a neighbourhood. The evaluation of the flow of these stocks is conducted at the level of each residential estate based on indicators that are mapped to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). GIS is integrated to facilitate bottom-up model of indicator development with high-resolution data and discover spatial inequalities through heat maps. The developed method is applied to Sha Tin neighbourhood in Hong Kong. Heat maps generated identify priority intervention areas in Sha Tin that need much attention. The developed tool aims to democratize the use of NSAs by addressing different decision-making challenges for a diverse set of stakeholders across various levels.

Advancing neighbourhood sustainability assessment by accounting for sustainable development goals: A case study of Sha Tin neighbourhood in Hong Kong Karpagam Subramanian  Shauhrat S. Chopra *  Ezgi Cakin  Jiarun Liu  Zizhen Xu  School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, China School of Energy and Environment City University of Hong Kong Kowloon Tong Hong Kong, China  School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, China  ⁎ Corresponding author.      Traditional triple bottom line approach used in existing neighbourhood sustainability assessment (NSA) tools provide an unbalanced focus on sustainability dimensions and are non-spatial. As a consequence, these tools may not aid decision-making process of different stakeholders. For this purpose, we propose an urban sustainability spatial hotspot analysis that integrates the Five Capitals Model (FCM) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The FCM based NSA framework redefines sustainability in existing NSA tools as it considers the maintenance of five major stocks – natural, social, human, financial, and manufactured – in a neighbourhood. The evaluation of the flow of these stocks is conducted at the level of each residential estate based on indicators that are mapped to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). GIS is integrated to facilitate bottom-up model of indicator development with high-resolution data and discover spatial inequalities through heat maps. The developed method is applied to Sha Tin neighbourhood in Hong Kong. Heat maps generated identify priority intervention areas in Sha Tin that need much attention. The developed tool aims to democratize the use of NSAs by addressing different decision-making challenges for a diverse set of stakeholders across various levels.   Keywords Sustainability assessment  Geographic information system  Spatial dimension  Sustainable development  Stocks and capitals    1 Introduction Unprecedented urban growth has and continues to drive a range of environmental, social and economic challenges that tend to be interrelated (Huang, Mcdonald, & Seto, 2018 ; Nagendra, Bai, Brondizio, & Lwasa, 2018 ; Yigitcanlar & Teriman, 2015 ). To tackle these “wicked problems”, there is a critical need for urban stakeholders to incorporate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in decision-making (Plessis & Arch, 2009 ; Weymouth & Hartz-karp, 2018 ). Evolution of SDGs and its role in achieving sustainable development has been dealt-with in a number of studies in literature (Filho et al., 2018 ; Stafford-smith, Griggs, Gaffney, & Ullah, 2017 ). Though SDGs offer an interesting possibility to measure urban sustainability, it is important to develop methods that localize the broad scoped-SDGs to specific urban contexts (Zinkernagel, Evans, & Neij, 2018 ), monitor their progress and inform decision-making for urban transformations (Nations, 2016 ). Efforts to transition towards urban sustainability and resilience are confronted with strong inequalities. According to Sampson (2018) most contemporary cities and their neighbourhoods are not only plagued with varying social conditions, characterized by the fragmented distribution of poverty and violence, but also varying access to physical infrastructures, such as public transport, and disproportionate exposure to environmental injustice, such as pollution. Sampson (2018) in their work also stated that these spatial inequalities arise due to social, environmental and economic outcomes that are intertwined in nature, hence to address such spatial inequalities it is essential to develop fresh theoretical ideas and analytical tools that can integrate such intertwined sustainability dimensions (Sampson, 2016 ). Achieving sustainable neighbourhoods at local levels is the key to achieving urban sustainability (Sharifi, 2013 ). Existing NSA certification efforts have limitations. Komeily and Srinivasan, 2015  have emphasized that NSA tools assigned a greater percentage of points to environmental aspects. They also attributed this unbalanced focus to lack of equal knowledge on how to measure social, economic, and institutional sustainability (compared to environmental sustainability), as well as limited knowledge on conceptualization of both sustainability and sustainable assessment. Results obtained from such evaluations may not be sufficient enough for policy making and planning as they are do not provide a complete picture, and decision-making based on these studies can result in unintended consequences on other urban sustainability parameters (Arslan, Durak, & Aytac, 2016 ). Tools take a top-down approach (Brelsford, Lobo, Hand, & Bettencourt, 2017 ; Dur, Yigitcanlar, & Bunker, 2014 ; Fawzi, Ameen, & Mourshed, 2019 ; Mahmoud, Zayed, & Fahmy, 2019 ; Plum & Kaljee, 2016 ; Santos, Goncalves, & Mezzomo, 2017 ; Yurnita, Trisutomo, & Ali, 2017 ) focusing on urban design features rather than a bottom-up approach, which draws on local networks and public and help identify local deficiencies better (Lützkendorf & Balouktsi, 2017 ). Ramaswami A in her work highlighted that indicators that assessed equity were mostly in terms of determinants (income and infrastructures access) and not in terms of outcomes (health and wellbeing) (Ramaswami, 2020 ). Literature has always emphasized that NSA has to focus on making the built environment sustainable for its citizens by assessing aspects like liveability, quality of life, safety, affordability, sense of belonging to the community (Boyle, Michell, & Viruly, 2018 ). Hence, in this work, we propose to use a well-balanced set of internationally accepted indicators that are used to achieve SDGs, to evaluate urban sustainability. Proposed indicators offer possibilities to assess equity in terms of determinants and outcomes as well as capture the sustainability performance of community from the resident/citizen’s perspective. The SDGs, relevant targets and indicators can be adapted or altered according to the analysed neighbourhood’s context. Both the commercial NSA tools and frameworks are non-spatial, meaning they cannot be used to identify priority intervention areas or the most/least sustainable locations in a city (Pedro, Silva, & Duarte, 2019 ). Literature also lacks geo-spatial neighbourhood assessments at residential building-level. Usage of GIS for collecting and presenting spatial data with higher resolution (residential building-level) provides an interesting possibility to advance the NSA methods. Assessing sustainability by considering environmental, economic and social aspects, that can be generalised as the triple bottom line (TBL) approach is the most widely used concept/approach in commercial NSA tools. Sustainable Development (SD) popularized as a concept by the Brundtland Report (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ), suggests that sustainability is all about evaluating the effect of a product/process/system on the poverty levels of the current generation as well as evaluating the maintenance of human, social, natural and other capital levels for the future generations to survive. Hence, in this work, we propose to use the concept of capitals to further enhance the TBL concept in existing NSA tools and be more consistent with the actual interpretation of sustainable development. The five capital model (FCM) chosen in this work considers that any system has stocks to maintain in the form of five capitals: natural, social, human, financial and manufactured and flow of each stock has to be evaluated to attain a strong sustainable development (Forum of Future, 2011). Hence, FCM-based NSA is considered to be a dynamic tool that allows decision makers to better understand the capital stocks currently available in a neighbourhood, and plan actions to maintain or increase those stocks without depleting them further to maintain a safe operating space for humanity. Inherently, capitals can be related to SDGs (Adams, 2020 ). Hence, the flow of these stocks within a neighbourhood was evaluated using a well-balanced set of globally applicable indicators, covering all dimensions of sustainability that are used to achieve the SDGs. By using SDG target related indicators to evaluate the maintenance of capitals in a neighbourhood, monitoring the progress of SDGs in a neighbourhood can also be simultaneously achieved. SDG related indicators are themselves integrated that they display relationships between the three sustainability dimensions and two or more capitals. Hence, the proposed FCM can overcome some weaknesses of the existing TBL concept, like the temptation to consider environment, social and economic aspects as equal and sometimes in isolation as the indicators themselves are integrated. Additionally, GIS spatial dimension is integrated into the proposed FCM based NSA tool for: (1) collecting high resolution data at residential building-level for the selected SDG related target indicators and (2) express those indicator results and overall sustainability results on maps. Data integrated from a capital’s perspective, allows easy interpretation with disaggregated data at SDG level and provides an unwavering focus to all sustainability dimensions. This approach assists neighbourhoods to understand the relationships and dependencies between capitals, and the interdependencies and potential conflicts between SDGs in achieving sustainability. Previously, the concept of ‘capitals’ was explored at theoretical level to assess sustainability performance of industrial symbiosis networks (can also be called mutually beneficial manufacturing facilities) by 'Mulrow, J et al., 2017. Aligning SDGs with capitals for NSA could not be found in literature. The objective of this work is to develop a novel systematic, geospatial neighbourhood assessment methodology based on SDGs to benchmark maintenance of social, natural, manufactured, human and financial capitals for each residential estate within the neighbourhood that allows evidence-based decision making. The results will allow local governments to identify hotspots to prioritise infrastructure improvements, aid potential homeowners and construction companies make investment decisions. The developed method is applied to assess the Sha Tin neighbourhood in Hong Kong, as a pilot study, to identify priority intervention areas and enable involved stakeholders to further optimize resource allocation for reduction of existing spatial inequalities.  2 Literature review 2.1 Commercial Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment (NSA) tools and frameworks Over the last few decades, Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment (NSA) tools like Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighbourhood Development (LEED-ND), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method Communities (BREEAM Communities), Earth Craft Communities (EEC), Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency-Urban Development (CASBEE-UD), Ecocity and Sustainable Community Rating (SCR), have been developed and applied by many developed countries for evaluating the sustainability performance of urban areas. Few studies have also developed and used their own NSA tools for analysis (Dur et al., 2014 ; Science, 2017 ). While valuable, these tools still traditionally approach sustainable development by evaluating four main dimensions/pillars: environment, society, institution and economics and use varying set of indicators within each aspect to inform decisions (Cappai, Forgues, & Glaus, 2018 ; Komeily & Srinivasan, 2015 ; Ramiller & Ramiller, 2019 ; Shari & Murayama, 2014 ). Within residential building-level neighbourhood assessments, Dur Y et al. focused on transport and land use (Dur et al., 2014 ). Yurnita A. et al. analysed impacts of coastal reclamation focusing on coastal resources (open space coverage rate, availability space for water conservation, per capita coverage of land), building (distance from natural reserves and building density) and infrastructure (availability of public transport, distance from main transportation routes) (Yurnita et al., 2017 ). Santos et al. compared two neighbourhoods focusing on land use, infrastructure and building performance (Santos et al., 2017 ). It can be concluded that most studies address only one or two aspects of sustainability. Each commercial NSA tool uses a distinct set of indicators to assess different pillars of sustainability. There is still no globally accepted characterization of urban sustainability in a holistic and systematic way based on case – specific indicators (Feleki, Vlachokostas, & Moussiopoulos, 2018 ; Tanguay, Rajaonson, & Lanoie, 2010 ). Four SDG related targets and indicators were proposed to evaluate health aspects for the Detroit city (Plum & Kaljee, 2016 ). High resolution analysis was carried out by characterizing the indices related to income and access to services in a neighbourhood, census data was used for constructing the indicators, a simple and intuitive index was derived (Brelsford et al., 2017 ). Weights of the indicators were determined using fuzzy logic or analytical hierarchy process in a few building-level sustainability assessments (Fawzi et al., 2019 ; Mahmoud et al., 2019 ). Variation in the characteristics of NSA tools (indicators, units for measurement of indicators and weighting of indicators) pinpoints the need for a standard set of indicators for international standardization of NSA. Need for flexible, context- specific indicators that are understandable, reliable, easily available, and are characterized using distance-target approach is also emphasized (Lützkendorf & Balouktsi, 2017 ). The previous indicator sets focus more on environmental sustainability, health and economic growth than on human/resident-centric dimensions like gender equality and reduced inequalities, for instance quality of schools and health care available (Zinkernagel et al., 2018 ).  2.2 Geographic Information System (GIS) GIS can be used to collect, store, and visualize spatial data based on geographic coordinates, allowing urban planners to realize the deficiencies in a neighbourhood or city and prioritize those areas, corresponding SDGs and indicators to enhance sustainability. Visualisation of data with GIS is an important feature to be integrated into NSA tools because it simplifies the overall picture of sustainability, which is often a challenge due to the conflicting objectives of sustainable urban planning (Pedro et al., 2019 ). To solve this spatial decision problem and identify most suitable location or areas to implement sustainability measures, two previous studies have used GIS, for collecting and representing spatial data (Pedro, Silva, & Duarte, 2018 , 2019 ). Nonetheless, these geo-spatial assessments were not conducted at residential building level with high resolution data characterised based on proximity and quality.  2.3 Capitals concept The concept of capitals is derived from economics, by which capital stocks  or assets in any system provide flow  of these assets in the form of goods and services and contribute to the well-being of humans in that system (Environment, 2016 ). The capitals concept is also critical to the idea of planetary boundaries and principles of urban sustainability (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, & M, 2020 ). This implies that the planet has biophysical limits (boundaries) and finite resources (capital stocks). Cities and urban areas generally utilize these existing resources, but their flow (activities within them) contributes to high levels of energy use, green house gas emissions, land use, depletion of resources and loss of biodiversity. Over an extended period of indiscriminate consumption, future generations will be constrained by these finite capital stocks. The goal of urban sustainability should be to enable the long term well-being of the present and future generations by efficient use of the finite resources available (natural and man-made) and manage their flows through improved livability, social amenities, economic opportunities, and health. The capitals model helps achieve this goal by assessing the stock and flow of finite resources and maintaining a safe planetary boundary for innovation, growth, and development of mankind without affecting the ecosystem services.   3 Methods and data The ultimate goal of the framework is to assess sustainability of neighborhoods from a multi-dimensional, spatial perspective and enable involved stakeholders to make informed decisions. For this purpose, the five capitals are linked to the SDG target related indicators. Maintenance of the five capitals is evaluated by monitoring the progress of SDGs in that neighbourhood. GIS is integrated to collect and represent indicator results with higher resolution at residential building-level. The developed NSA tool includes four key stages: (1) Framework design (Section 3.1 )—present an approach based on SDGs and FCM, (2) Indicator selection (Section 3.2 )—develop a customized indicator set for NSA and create a matrix for each indicator for all the residential buildings in a neighbourhood (3) Data analysis (Section 3.3 )—develop a geo-spatial information model (heat map) with a unique value for each residence building, (4) Results interpretation (Section 4 )—interpret the results in terms of spatial difference. Each stage is described below in detail. 3.1 Framework design – linking SDGs with FCM 3.1.1 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) SDGs and infrastructures are interrelated. Infrastructures influence all the 17 SDGs including 72 % of their targets (Thacker et al., 2020 ). Infrastructures like energy, water, sanitation among other services is fundamental to achieve SDGs. Also, badly planned infrastructures can affect sustainable development of the neighbourhoods and society in large. Hence, aligning to the SDGs, can add value creation and improve the knowledge of the impact of neighbourhoods on sustainable development. Indicators used to monitor the progress of SDGs are at a global level; however, for the local governments to understand their current conditions (sustainability level) and take efforts to progress towards achieving sustainability, SDGs have to be monitored and assessed at local levels (Kawakubo, Murakami, Ikaga, & Asami, 2018 ). A few core challenges encountered while implementing SDG indicators at the local level include the availability of reliable data in cities, relevance of the policy recommendations from the United Nations (UN) to achieve the SDGs in the local context, and covering the complexity of urban structure due to interconnected and interdependent socio-ecological-technological systems (Markolf, Chester, Eisenberg, & Iwaniec, 2018 ; Towards the Localisation of the SDGs, 2020 ; Zinkernagel et al., 2018 ). The Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments, UN-Habitat and UNDP, 2016 published the roadmap for localizing SDGs, understanding the local government’s role in promoting sustainable development (Nations, 2016 ). It is noteworthy that attempts are being made to explore the adoption of SDGs at local levels, but monitoring their progress at neighbourhood communities is still challenging (Kawakubo et al., 2018 ; Valencia et al., 2019 ). The 2030 agenda has established several targets corresponding to each SDG and several indicators corresponding to each target. Targets are global and can be adopted by different nationalities (United Nations, 2015 ). The biggest challenge within the existing NSA tools, is the need for a well-balanced, common set of indicators. Globally applicable SDG based indicators that are quite well-established by the UN for SD can help to bridge this gap and yield new opportunities for further exploration. Targets and the indicator set for the targets are customized according to the assessed neighbourhood and details of it are given in the next section. We use the Five Capital Model (FCM) to integrate the SDG based indicators.  3.1.2 Five Capital Model (FCM) Ekins P et al., 1992 described capital as a financial asset construed from industrial labour and resource and is used for wealth creation. Two fundamental characteristics of capital are duration, which is a feature of the stock, and service provision (flow) over time. Benefits gained from capitals may or may not be in the form of money, but they must be beneficial to humans (Environment, 2016 ). Capital and sustainability were first linked in sustainable economics. Studies that involve isolated capitals as well as multi-capital models to address all the aspects of sustainability can be found in literature (Gorzelak, Olejniczak, & Sme, 2008 ; Tinch et al., 2015 ). Sustainability increases with stock addition or transportation of some capitals. Correspondingly, unsustainable development is caused by loss/reduction of one or more types of capital stocks. Therefore, to achieve strong sustainability, capitals must have non-substitutable characteristics to avoid being used as a strategy to increase the stock of another by decreasing theirs. As neighbourhood sustainability assessment is the focus of this study, five-capital model is applied to represent the five essential stocks and evaluate their flows in an urban ecosystem. The proposed method includes natural, human, social, manufactured, and financial capitals. The indicators used to achieve SDGs are used to quantify the flows of these five capitals within a neighbourhood. By accomplishing SDGs, associated capitals/stocks in the neighbourhood can be maintained or increased, leading towards SD of the neighbourhood. This approach can maximize the value of each capital in the neighborhood, considering the impacts of various activities that deplete these stocks, monitor the progress of SDGs, evaluate trade-offs between the SDGs,r and achieve a balance between capitals. The characteristics of the five capitals based on neighbourhood sustainability are described in the supplementary file (Table S2). Linking the FCM with SDGs is a dynamic process. Currently, studies related to modelling of SDGs are available in literature (Allen, Metternicht, & Wiedmann, 2016 ; Reyers, Stafford-smith, Erb, Scholes, & Selomane, 2017 ), however, studies linking SDGs to FCM based NSA are rarely found. Hence, the characteristics of indicators, SDG targets and five capitals were carefully assessed and then linked. The FCM-NSA framework developed is illustrated in Fig. 1  . It displays the link between five capitals, SDGs, indicators and the usage of GIS for data collection and results representation with high resolution. Further details of indicator selection, data analysis, results presentation and interpretation stages of the methodology are presented in subsequent sections.   3.2 Indicator selection and Data Management There are over 200 indicators under 17 SDG targets, however, few are found to overlap or repeat and could not be directly applied in NSA, hence, were not included in the assessment. For instance, “Climate Action” has a scope broader than a neighbourhood; “Reducing inequalities” discusses inequalities among countries, though can be applied at neighborhood level, related topics are already covered fully in other goals. Targets and indicators related to individual SDGs were checked and modified without losing the original theme of the SDGs, to come up with one or more customized indicators for NSA. Existing indicators in the commercial NSA tools, previously published literature, and the original targets of the SDGs were used as references while customizing the indicator set from the original 2030 agenda. However, indicators were finally shortlisted based on the following key principles: reasonable meaning suitable for the studied region, data availability (online portals/census statistics), measurability (usage of GIS to collect data and whether the raw spatial data available can be used to calculate the indicator values and make a spatial comparison). In particular, data availability and measurability were strongly considered, as theoretical basis or rationale behind the choices become useless in case of data unavailability. The 17 SDGs were initially reviewed and linked to the corresponding capitals. The indicators that were affiliated to those 17 goals were reviewed based on the key principles and shortlisted. As data availability and measurability is the key, especially for an assessment with high resolution at residential building-level, a customized indicator set based on proximity is applied. Proximity is a theme in the mainstream NSA tools (Shari & Murayama, 2013 ) and closer proximity is a sign of “good amenity” (Tse, 2002 ). Sustainability level measured based on daily life of ordinary people, is the focus of this study, therefore, proximity to various public facilities (health care, education, ATMs) from each building are taken into consideration during characterization. These also represent the basic need of residents in a neighbourhood. A few indicators related to education and healthcare facilities are characterised based on proximity, quantity and quality. For measuring quality, rating of these facilities available in government databases in the form of scores are used. The process starts with mapping SDGs to the current developments in the selected neighbourhood. The overall objective behind selection and customization of indicators is to determine the spatial difference that will indicate sustainability variances in a neighbourhood. All original indicators within each SDGs are customized according to the needs of the developed FCM-NSA; detailed description can be found in the supplementary file. Fig. 2   displays the five capitals considered and the way the SDGs and related indicators are linked to one or more capitals. Note: Indicators should be revised according to the need of individual studies, the indicator set provided above is just an example of how SDG target related indicators can be customised to evaluate sustainability of neighbourhoods. The sankey diagram demonstrates equal importance to every aspect of sustainability, expressed by the SDGs. Each SDG carries equal importance, hence has equal thickness. The thickness of each SDG is distributed equally according to the number of corresponding indicators. The number of corresponding SDGs determines the thickness of the capitals. Each indicator's influence on the capital score is reflected by its thickness as well. 3.2.1 Collection, sorting of data Generally, census data, monitoring data, and spatial data are the three main data types needed. Census data includes all important information of the population such as rates and income, monitoring data is usually reported from monitoring points such as air quality, and spatial data determines the location of different infrastructures and enables proximity calculation. The collected data is processed with the support of ArcGIS®, a software for spatial analysis developed by Esri. Necessary calculations and measurements are performed on the map of the geo-referenced elements.   3.3 Data analysis 3.3.1 Rating a neighbourhood’s geospatial sustainability performance at residential building-level To calculate the lowest performance and highest performance buildings in a neighbourhood the indicators are first characterised to quantify their contribution to the sustainability of the neighbourhood, then normalized based on feature scaling to eliminate units and enable easy comparison of results, and finally equally weighed to derive the five capital scores. To represent the most and least sustainable buildings and clusters in a neighbourhood, GIS is used. The formulas used to characterize the core set of indicators used in the FCM-NSA tool is described below in Table 1  . Min-Max normalization method, a widely used approach in sustainability research (Diaz-Balteiro et al., 2018 ; Kilkiş, 2016 ; Lai et al., 2018 ; Lior, Radovanović, & Filipović, 2018 ) is used. Indicators are first classified as positive and negative based on their characteristics and contribution to sustainability. Indicators are normalized as described in the equations below:(1) x '  =   x - x m i n    x m a x   - x m i n       P o s i t i v e   I n d i c a t o r s      (2) x '  = x m a x   - x  x m a x   - x m i n       ( N e g a t i v e   I n d i c a t o r s )    where x’ is the normalized score; x is the characterized result, xmin  and xmax  represent minimum and maximum values of the characterized results. Normalisation rescales the data to have values between 0 and 1. Results closer to 1 means better sustainability. Along-the-road distance is considered for indicators that require physical presence. According to Duncan DT et al. (Duncan, Aldstadt, Whalen, & Melly, 2011 ), a twenty-minute walking distance is the farthest satisfying distance, and every five-minute walking distance is equal to 400 m in open streets. Therefore in this study, a threshold of five-minute, ten-minute, fifteen-minute, twenty-minute, and over-twenty-minute walking distance were given scores of 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0, except for indicators where remoteness is intended, such as proximity to crime scene. In such cases, the scoring is reversed. For indicators with sub-indicators, like the indicator of public transportation that includes proximity to subway stations, bus and minibus stations, each sub-indicator is first normalized, given an equal weight of 1/n where n is the number of sub-indicators, all weighted sub-indicators are summed and normalized again to derive the final score. For indicators characterised both by proximity and quality, normalisation is conducted using a slightly different calculation procedure. Rating of the facility in the form of scores is first collected from the available databases. Those scores are multiplied with proximity based normalized scores of the facility. Facilities that go through this special calculation procedure include education and health care units. Each building has a unique score for each indicator. The normalised score of each indicator is mapped in GIS to generate heat maps in the form of coloured raster data, meaning every pixel in the map is given a value according to the final normalized score of the indicator. Areas with very low sustainability performance is represented by red colour and very high performance by green colour continually. Heat maps consists of thousands of small coloured pixels used to identify buildings of significantly high values and low values (hot spots) by distributing the data. There are many different techniques available to identify such urban patterns. This paper uses the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation tool in GIS to generate heat maps. Colours of each pixel in the map is based on the z-value i.e. the normalised score of the indicator (input parameter for the given point) or automatic interpolation based on the distance to given points in the vicinity. For instance, if a point is in the middle of two buildings with scores 1 and 0.5, this point (or pixel) is automatically scored 0.75. All the input parameters are converted to a five-level scale {0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0}, ranking the buildings in a neighbourhood from very low performance (0) to very high performance (1). Finally, a weighed score is calculated for all the five capitals and an overall sustainability score is derived using Excel. These overall values are also mapped using GIS to identify benchmarks and priority intervention areas that need attention. The final stage is interpretation of the derived results in terms of spatial difference.    4 Case study application – Sha Tin, Hong Kong This section presents the detailed description of the methodology used to evaluate the sustainability level of Sha Tin, a district in Hong Kong as a case study. 4.1 Site description Sustainable housing is one of the guiding principles within SD in Hong Kong (Hong Kong Housing Authority, 2013 ). The main challenge is the lack of systematic assessment to evaluate the sustainability of existing neighbourhood communities. Currently no sustainability assessment framework is implemented in Hong Kong. Innovation, research and development are used in some previous studies (Valencia et al., 2019 ;Yang and Li (2018) ), but at neighbourhood level, these may not be so relevant. Quantifying sustainability for cities with relatively smaller spatial scale embedded with large engineered infrastructures is quite challenging but needed (Ramaswami et al., 2012 ). Hong Kong is one such international city with high population, large infrastructures, and small spatial scale. To tackle these problems, government developed new towns, such as Sha Tin, on reclaimed lands to decentralize population from overcrowded areas. Currently Sha Tin has 293 residential buildings and is one of the major neighbourhoods. Sha Tin, is a suitable case for this study in order to bring new insights into the sustainability dimensions of such government initiated developments, identify priority intervention areas and enable involved stakeholders to further optimize the sustainability of the neighbourhood for its residents and achieve the overall SD agenda.  4.2 Indicator selection and data collection The indicator set is further customized for Sha Tin (Table 1 ). For instance, according to the original indicator for Goal 1: No poverty, the international poverty line for families is US$1.90 in 2015, but this number may not be applicable to Hong Kong. According to the most up-to-date statistical yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2017, 0% of the population fall in to this category (United Nations ESCAP, 2018 ). Another perspective is poverty line is based on income, but in Hong Kong the poverty line is decided based on family size as well (Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 2018 ). However, no detailed data is available in any government database regarding the family size within each building in an estate or garden. Hong Kong Government, OECD and EU, measure poverty line based on the median income of a family (Saunders, 2014 ). Data for average individual and family median income is available for each building in Sha Tin. Hence, average individual/family median income of residents in each building is set as the first indicator. In total, 26 indicators are developed and linked to the 12 SDGs and the 5 capitals based on their characteristics. In general, indicators were selected only when data was available at residential building-level or could be collected in the form of spatial data using proximity approach. The remaining indicators and corresponding SDGs were excluded mainly because finding high quality and high-resolution statistical data at residential building-level was not possible. A detailed description of the customized indicator set, obtained based on the kind of data available for Sha Tin can be found in the supplementary information. A flow model of inputs and outputs was created to depict the framework (Fig. 2 ). The outputs were given by the five capitals, the intermediate flows were measured based on the selected 12 SDGs, and the inputs were defined based on the statistical data available for Sha Tin at residential building-level (26 indicators). Three simple criteria for data collection include: reliable (collected data must be official), latest, and with highest resolution. Data were collected for all the 293 buildings in Sha Tin for each of the 26 indicators. The four data sources include: Centamap, the 2011 Population Census Website, government reports, and online maps. The advantage of Centamap is that it combines spatial distribution of buildings with complete census data from the government. Proximity data is obtained using online maps like Google map (Anonymous, 2020a ), OpenStreetMap (Anonymous, 2020b ) and ESRI Online (Anonymous, 2020c ). More details on the calculations and data sources can be found in Table S1 of the supplementary file.  4.3 Data analysis Data analysis was carried out based on the characterisation, normalisation and weighting procedures explained in Table 1 . Analysis of one building named Carado Garden is given in Table S3 of the supplementary file for reference. Similar procedure was used to obtain scores for all buildings. The final weighed score at residential building-level are mapped using GIS, illustrating the spatial differences of indicators, capitals and overall sustainability (Fig. 3  ).   5 Sha tin case - results interpretation The proposed method applied to Sha Tin case study provides a sustainability performance analysis of different buildings in the neighbourhood based on five capitals and an estimation of an overall sustainability score. It identifies areas with lowest and highest performance buildings summarized in Fig. 4 . The results of different capitals is detailed in the following sub-sections. 5.1 Natural capital Regarding natural capital, buildings in the south bank are closer to the natural parks, enjoy a living environment with better biodiversity (Fig. 3 b). Fo Tan and Sui Wo Councils show very low performance due to industrial centres in adjacent areas and the buildings in those councils are far from the available natural green area. In south west, the buildings in Chui Ka Council are far from the nearest country park and show low performance. The proximity to the coastline is closer from southwest to northeast, yet, buildings in south west are closer to the Rambler Channel connecting New Territories and Tsing Yi Island, and water resource for those buildings is blocked by Kam Shan Country Park entirely, so no significant advantage could be provided by this water body and hence shows low performance. Air quality is very low in buildings located in two concentrated areas:City One and Tai Wai councils. Buildings near mountain valley have acceptable air quality. Many buildings suffer from noise pollution (Fig. 3 ). Complex junctions and crossroads contribute to noise pollution and therefore, buildings near the mountains with larger spatial distribution experience less noise pollution. Buildings in Ma On Shan new town, southwest part near the Lion Rock, Kwong Yuen Council and the south Lek Yuen areas show high performance. Proximity to solid waste recycling points is close for almost all buildings; few buildings in the north show poor performance. Buildings built before year 2000 are not a part of the Fresh Water Plumbing Quality Maintenance Recognition Scheme, and most of the buildings in the scheme are private estates, hence public estates and old buildings show poor performance. Water in only three buildings in Yan On Estate were detected to exceed the lead standard, marked red (Fig. 3 .) Other private and public estates show high performance. Fig. 3 b shows that the lowest-performance buildings related to green area ratio were found in the councils in Fo Tan, Lek Yuen, and On Tai. Performance is affected more by spatial distribution than dwelling type. Water monitoring points in Sui Wo, Fo Tan and greater Tai Wai area recorded very poor performance compared to other areas. Industrial and domestic waste should be under tighter supervision in these areas.  5.2 Human capital Post-secondary education performance is affected by the dwelling type. Percentage of people with post-secondary education in private estates is twice as much in public estates. Building with a very poor performance is located in Sha Kok Council in the middle south, with a score of 0.11, and the one with very good performance is in On Tai Council near the estuary, with a score of 0.68. Highly rated kindergartens and kindergarten-cum-child care centres are at close proximity for buildings in Ma On Shan area in the south side. Buildings in Fo Tan area show poor performance. Number of free primary schools shows a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest areas. Buildings near the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Ma On Shan area show high performance, while southeast Tai Wai area shows very poor performance Fig. 3c Lowest performance related to secondary schools were found in the northwest area, and highest performance in the southeast area. Buildings in Kwong Yuen and Bik Woo area have a reasonable distribution of free as well as paid secondary schools. Regarding health care, central area of Sha Tin shows very high performance, however, the number of facilities is still very less for the population with only two hospitals, four clinics and eleven health care centres. A large area in Tai Wai shows very poor performance, and Ma On Shan area shows high performance only in terms of private clinics and health care centres. Aging problem is severe in central parts of Sha Tin, specifically more in public estates, near New Town Plaza and Tai Wai. Youngest population live mostly in Ma On Shan area. No explicit spatial trend is found in terms of occupational diversity. Ma On Shan shows a slightly poor performance. Overall, more people work in public education and health sector compared to manufacturing and construction sector.  5.3 Manufactured capital Proximity to financial services likes ATMs and bank branches is not much affected by the dwelling types. Buildings closer to shopping centres show high performance, central area shows low performance with insufficient financial services. Proximity to wet markets and supermarkets from most buildings is quite less, which does not take more than 15 min by walk. Buildings in Sha Tin New Town area like Sui Wo and Kwong Yuen Council are far from MTR stations. Buildings in Ma On Shan area show high performance in terms of closer proximity to all kinds of public transportation. Overall, residents in nearly one-third of the buildings in Sha Tin can’t reach an MTR station in ten-minutes walk. Bus stations are at uniform distance from all buildings.  5.4 Financial capital Buildings in Fo Tan and Ma On Shan are home to high income individuals. Buildings in southern part show very poor performance. Individual and family median income are affected mainly by dwelling types. The upper limit of individual median income in private estates (33750 HKD) was found to be greater than the highest family income in public houses (26000 HKD). Regarding energy consumption, buildings in public estates show relatively better performance compared to private estates. Low performance (high consumption) was found in Fo Tan and Ma On Shan areas, while high performance was found in buildings in Tai Wai. Regarding house ownership rates, high performance is found in northern parts, while low performance in middle and southern areas. Average number of rooms per individual is affected by the dwelling type. Public estates provide lesser living space, a large percentage of people in public houses have less than one room. To this end, buildings in the north showed high peformance, while builidngs in the south showed low performance. House expenditure rates of private houses in all areas is high compared to public estates except racecourse areas.  5.5 Social capital Regarding population mobility that determines immigration status of people, almost all areas in Sha Tin show low performance. Considering the diversity in population, overall male/female employment rates in Sha Tin shows high performance. There is also an apparent distinction between the dwelling types. Private estates showed high performance than public estates for most indicators. Regarding unemployment, low performance is found among buildings in north and south, while high performance is found in central areas. Buildings in most southwest and northeast parts show very low performance. Regarding proximity to the nearest council members office, buildings in Chun Ma Council show low performance, while buildings in most other sections show good performance. The distance to these offices is less than 15 min by walk from most buildings. The boundaries of small administration councils are shown as black lines in the heat map (Fig. 3 d) Overall results indicate that no building was found to show high performance in all capitals except within manufactured capital. It may be because related indicators were not characterised based on proximity but on actual walking distances, residents in 25 buildings could reach every facility in five minutes and were assigned a score of 1 during normalisation. Additionally, there is an apparent distinction between private and public housing especially for indicators related to social and financial capitals. Most of the high-performance buildings in Fig. 3 d and Fig. 3 f belong to the private housing. All high-performance buildings located in Sha Tin centre scored high in all capitals except natural capital. Low performance buildings were found in Mei Tin, located near the Lower Shing Mun Reservoir, scoring very less in all capitals. Box plot (Fig.4  ) illustrates the variability in the normalised scores of each capital. Manufactured capital varies much less compared to other capitals. It may be because, all infrastructures in Hong Kong are quite close to each other due to space constraints. Outside manufactured capital, scores are more consistent in human capital at both levels, while financial capital is the most variable especially at upper levels. This might be due to the income disparity in Hong Kong economy. The indicators that lead to these variations, corresponding stakeholders and councils are listed in the priority table below (Table 2  ).  5.6 Overall sustainability results Spatially, buildings in the central part, near Sha Tin Police station, Southern end of Shing Mun river, near Heung Fan Liu village, and Riverpark Tower show low performance. In general, the northern area has higher sustainability then southern areas. Public infrastructures both in terms of number and proximity are very few in these areas, affecting the associated capitals. Top five buildings with highest and lowest overall sustainability scores and corresponding capital scores are presented in Fig. 5  . The complete results for all the 293 buildings in 36 councils in Sha Tin can be found in the supplementary file (Table S4). These scores are just for reference, the main aim of this paper is to integrate FCM and SDGs into NSA and develop indicators that can be quantified using high resolution spatial data. The 26 indicators developed and quantified in this work, are not fully representative of all the sustainability issues in a neighbourhood but can definitely identify benchmarks and priority intervention areas that need attention.   6 Limitations and scope for further improvements This article proposes assessing neighbourhood sustainability based on five capital model using SDGs and GIS. Finding high-quality and high-resolution data for all indicators under each SDG was the biggest challenge. Combination of census data and multiple datasets was required; still only 26 indicators could be quantified. Additionally, old census data of 2011 was used, new census data in 2021 might yield different results when used. Data for some indicators had to be aggregated and normalised to a single unique value (as explained in Section 4.2 ), but such values when mapped in GIS provide less distinction between areas. Such challenges have also been previously reported in studies especially for data at a residential building-level in a neighbourhood (Pedro et al., 2019 ). Creation of public libraries, integration of spatial data management systems in the relevant departments, and collaborations between involved stakeholders might solve this issue related to data limitations. In this work, the indicators are quantified based on a prescriptive approach, a much flexible descriptive approach could not be employed as the data were collected from statistical datasets, which does not provide such detailed information to conduct the analysis. Generally, in sustainability assessment studies, equal weighting or expert based panel weighting is used. Equal weighting is used when all the dimensions meaning indicators/SDGs/capitals study are “worth” the same (Lior et al., 2018 ; Rajaonson & Tanguay, 2017 ). Otherwise, a poll of experts’ opinion or public preference can be used to rate the importance of these dimensions and use the results as weighting factors (Lior et al., 2018 ). Currently, equal weights are applied in this work, in future, weights can be applied to the normalized results easily if needed. Integration of GIS enables collection of data, analysis and visualization of results. It provided information on which building is performing good or poor in comparison to other buildings in the neighbourhood. Spatial differences in the indicator results were explicit in the heat maps generated, the figures were also easily interpretable by both government and ordinary people for decision-making and knowledge exchange. Nevertheless, inputting parameters especially for large datasets, like this work with 26 indicators for 293 buildings, is very time consuming. Recent studies have emphasized development of automated GIS that allows updating indicators, data and weights, enabling involved stakeholders to easily make changes in the variables and obtain results for other cities or neighbourhoods (Pedro et al., 2018 ).  7 Conclusions This research emphasizes the need to redefine the concept of sustainability embedded in existing NSA tools. For this purpose, we propose an urban sustainability spatial hotspot analysis by integrating Five Capitals Model (FCM) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Local planning authorities can use this as a guideline to identify buildings and locations within the neighbourhood that are performing poor and need much attention. The fundamental idea of this approach is that sustainable development is all about maintenance of capitals in a neighbourhood and it can be realised by monitoring the progress of SDGs and eventually accomplishing them. The indicators used to achieve the SDGs measure multidimensional inequalities within a neighbourhood. Bottom-up model of indicator development using GIS is deployed. Results derived from the developed methodology can help local governments’ decision-making related to equitable urban planning and sustainable development of cities. Health, education, environment protection departments, citizens, housing authorities and other stakeholders, can understand the current conditions of the assessed neighbourhood and make progress towards achieving sustainable development. GIS based spatial analysis is conducted with high-resolution data for all the indicators, enabling dynamic representation of results, clearly demonstrating inequalities with spatial segregation. Though the existing NSA tools evaluate social conditions like poverty; environmental toxicities, and economic deprivations, they don’t assess urban inequalities related to differences in access to infrastructure, transportation, for citizens living in the same neighbourhood, especially at a residential building-level. Also, the TBL approach used within existing NSA, consider society, economics and environment in isolation, when they are actually interrelated. The unbalanced focus of NSAs on sustainability dimensions can be attributed to limited knowledge on the theory of sustainability (Ramaswami, 2020 ). The developed FCM based NSA approach is a dynamic tool that best aligns with the actual definition of sustainability by using a capitals perspective; rooted in GIS technology for high resolution data; and uses internationally accepted indicators that are themselves integrated and can display multidimensional relationships to measure neighbourhood sustainability. The present work constitutes a first step in developing an NSA tool based on five capitals and SDGs in the context of equitable urban planning, effective sustainable development and decision making. Sha Tin neighbourhood in Hong Kong was assessed to demonstrate the application of the FCM-NSA model. Case study results revealed that most buildings in private housing estates tend to have higher scores than those of public estates. Buildings in north east part of Sha Tin obtained higher scores compared to central and southern parts. Table 2  provides a reference point for the responsible stakeholders, regarding the priority indicators and the corresponding capitals that are depleted. The government and related stakeholders need to focus on those capitals, maintain or regenerate those to improve the overall sustainability performance of the related councils and district at large. For example, residents can identify residential building estates or neighbourhood communities that interact and share services and are well connected to main facilities and services like schools, hospitals, transportation infrastructure and make investments; urban planners can design land use by considering proximity to facilities as the key factor to promote sustainable urban transformation; and real estate companies can track energy, water usage across their properties, can identify highly sustainable areas and collaborate with urban planners for future investments. Future research should focus on expanding the indicator sets, apply to many neighbourhoods and cities after calibrating the indicators, compare with the existing commercial NSA tools, and automate the GIS models, to make the developed approach more robust.
