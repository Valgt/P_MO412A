                  This paper aims to highlight the potential of smart university solutions in contributing to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We surveyed solutions tailored to address each of the seventeen SDGs with an emphasis on identifying those adaptable within university settings. Our research reveals a diverse array of solutions within the university environment that align with the SDGs. Remarkably, we have identified initiatives relevant even to goals seemingly peripheral to the university’s primary mission, such as those addressing poverty eradication. On a further step, we have established a correlation between the smart university concept and the SDGs, effectively showcasing the practicality of utilizing existing solutions to enhance and accomplish all goals. We also propose definitions and a well-structured taxonomy for smart university and smart campus to support our study and guide future research.

This paper aims to highlight the potential of smart university solutions in contributing to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We surveyed solutions tailored to address each of the seventeen SDGs with an emphasis on identifying those adaptable within university settings. Our research reveals a diverse array of solutions within the university environment that align with the SDGs. Remarkably, we have identified initiatives relevant even to goals seemingly peripheral to the university’s primary mission, such as those addressing poverty eradication. On a further step, we have established a correlation between the smart university concept and the SDGs, effectively showcasing the practicality of utilizing existing solutions to enhance and accomplish all goals. We also propose definitions and a well-structured taxonomy for smart university and smart campus to support our study and guide future research.   Keywords Sustainability  Sustainable Development Goals  SDG  Smart University  Smart campus   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction Sustainability is important in all aspects of our lives; in recent years more individuals are becoming concerned about both the environment and the well-being of human kind. As a result, the world leaders of the United Nations (UN) met in 2015 and proposed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1] . These 17 goals comprise 169 targets that must be achieved by 2030. The goals are intended to be a set of rules and subjects that can be used to guide countries through sustainable solutions. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) holds immense potential in facilitating the achievement of the SDGs. Azadnia and Zahedi [2]  made an important correlation between SDGs and ICTs concepts and evaluated how ICTs impact the SDGs achievement. For instance, the World Economic Forum’s IoT for Sustainable Development  project [3]  encourages the utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) to accelerate progress on the 17 SDGs. A systematic literature review on the role of ICT in achieving the SDGs [4]  revealed that ICTs have the potential for making positive contributions to the attainment of the SDGs. Vyas-Doorgapersad [5]  provided examples of how ICTs can contribute to specific SDGs categorized by dimensions, including social, economic, technological, and environmental. Nonetheless, a systematic review of the literature spanning from 2000 to 2022 [6]  showed that most of the papers in this field focus on a limited number of SDGs and lack comprehensiveness in terms of countries. They also highlighted the urgency to increase research in this area. In addition to contributing to research and education on the subject of sustainability, universities are an ideal setting for implementing actions that promote the SDGs. The university fosters critical thinking and is a source of potential change agents, thus playing an important role in raising people’s awareness of the topic’s importance to society [7,8] . Sustainability-orientated solutions developed within its campuses can improve the quality of life of the internal community and its surroundings, and can also be replicated in other scenarios that share similar characteristics. For instance, many university campuses face challenges similar to those encountered in urban areas, including issues related to transportation, monitoring energy and water infrastructure, and preserving green spaces. ICTs, specially IoT, have been applied in the university setting, leading to two intertwined concepts, namely Smart University and Smart Campus. These concepts have been explored and blended by various authors [9,10]  and in this paper we argue that universities can significantly contribute to achieving the SDGs by implementing Smart University and Smart Campus solutions.  In this context, the main contributions of the following sections are: • definition of the terms Smart University (Section 3 ) and Smart Campus (Section 3.4 ): we have noticed that there is no consensus in the literature about the meaning of both terms and the goals of a smart university and of a smart campus are often interchanged. Clear definitions and a well-structured taxonomy will serve as a foundation for researchers and administrators to establish consistency in communication, to share and compare findings as well as identifying all the subdomains that can benefit from smart solutions;  • literature review evidencing that smart university solutions can significantly contribute to the achievement of all SDGs (Section 4.1 ): we show that there is a variety of solutions being proposed in the context of smart university and smart campus and that they cover all the 17 SDGs;  • correlation among smart university and the SDGs (Section 4.2 ) and a case study (Section 4.2.1 ) exemplifying how a smart university can effectively help in the achievement of SDGs: our literature review revealed that although various smart university solutions aim to address the SDGs, they often exist in isolation. Thus using our definition of smart university, we identified its components that can contribute to each specific SDG. To offer a more tangible understanding we mapped these smart solutions within a university campus to their associated SDG targets;  • finally, we identify gaps and areas for further exploration (Section 5 ).     2 Sustainability In today’s global context, there is a growing collective concern for sustainability, prompting individuals and organizations worldwide to seek innovative ways to conserve water and energy and minimize their carbon footprint. Universities are no exception to this trend and have a unique role to play in advancing sustainability, not only within their own confines but also with their policies and practices extending their influence beyond its borders. Godemann et al. [11]  emphasizes the significance of higher education institutions (HEIs) embracing sustainable development, whereas Barth et al. [12]  offers guidance on acquiring critical competencies for sustainable development within HEIs. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the definition of sustainability is “the quality of being able to continue over a period of time; the quality of causing little or no damage to the environment and therefore able to continue for a long time”.  Due to the importance of this subject, in 2015, the UN met with representatives from several countries around the world [13] , and together they defined the 17 SDGs [1] . The 17 SDGs must be achieved by 2030. Each goal has a set of targets, with a total of 169 targets with 231 indicators. The SDGs are [13] : 1. No poverty:  eliminate poverty everywhere and in all its manners.  2. Zero Hunger:  provide food security and improved nutrition to end hunger. Moreover, contributes to sustainable agriculture.  3. Good Health and Well-Being:  ensure healthy lives and enhance the well-being of all people regardless of their age.  4. Quality Education:  ensure that everyone can have inclusive and equitable quality education. Additionally, make sure to promote educational opportunities for all and lifelong learning.  5. Gender Equality:  empowers all girls and women to achieve gender equality.  6. Clean water and sanitation:  provide clean water and sanitation for everyone worldwide.  7. Affordable and clean energy:  ensure access to reliable, affordable, modern, and sustainable energy for all. Furthermore, encourages energy-saving and generating clean energy.  8. Decent work and economic growth:  promote inclusive, sustainable, and sustained economic growth for people and countries. Additionally, provides productive employment and work for everyone.  9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure:  construct resilient infrastructure, encourage inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and stimulate innovation.  10. Reduced Inequalities:  minimize inequality among and within countries and people.  11. Sustainable Cities and Communities:  make cities and communities safe, sustainable, inclusive, and resilient.  12. Responsible Consumption and Production:  guarantee the sustainable consumption and production patterns.  13. Climate Action:  take action to tackle climate changes and their impacts.  14. Life Bellow Water:  conserve oceans and seas, using them and other marine resources sustainably to advance development.  15. Life on Land:  protect all kinds of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests and deserts. Promote their sustainable use by blocking desertification, stopping and reversing land degradation, and stopping biodiversity loss.  16. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institution:  make institutions at all levels peaceful, effective, accountable, and inclusive for sustainable development. Also, provide access to justice for all.  17. Partnership for the Goals:  get a partnership to implement the project.    Sustainability is based on three big pillars: social, economic, and environmental [14] . The 17 goals are very comprehensive and in-depth in human and environmental needs. Wu et al. [14]  categorized them into six small groups inside the three pillars, as shown in Fig. 1 .  Sustainability is a global imperative and requires actions from governments to public and private organizations within their reach. From the perspective of countries, there are proposals for legislation aimed at advancing toward specific goals. For instance, the European Union has announced a “zero tolerance” policy for child labor and proposes to use trade in export transactions [15] . In Latin America, Brazil, for example, has public policies that encourage the production of biofuels [16]  and investment in photovoltaic energy [17] . Cities are harnessing technologies such as IoT, big data, and machine learning to deploy solutions for mobility, security, and health, thereby enhancing both sustainability and citizens’ quality of life [18] . Additionally, these technologies are utilized to collect and analyze data, enabling better decision-making [19] . The private sector is also facing increasing demands from stakeholders to prioritize sustainable development in all three dimensions. In order to make their sustainability initiatives more transparent, many of them are producing sustainability reports based on the framework provided by the Global Reporting Initiative [20] . Universities should also be held accountable for achieving the 2030 Agenda. Moreover, adopting innovative and intelligent strategies is crucial for seamlessly integrating sustainability into the university framework. In this context, we will explore the transition toward a smart university as a means to achieve this goal.  3 Smart University and the Internet of Things In this section, we aim to clarify the concept of a Smart University, which is still in its early stages of research and lacks a universally accepted definition. We conducted a survey of the terms “Smart University” and “Smart Campus” in the literature, encountering a mixed concept in their definitions [9,21] . Additionally, several references explicitly mention the term Smart University [22–26] , yet the authors do not share a common consensus on its meaning. Given the lack of consensus in existing literature, we have chosen to establish clear definitions for these terms. To begin, we will provide a review of the existing definitions of Smart University. On the one hand, Sauer et al. [23]  and Abdelnour-Nocera et al. [24]  see the smart university as a platform. Sauer et al. [23]  assumes that the platform should acquire data within the university and deliver relevant information to improve teaching and learning environments. Abdelnour-Nocera et al. [24]  consider that the smart university platform integrates data collected by cyber–physical devices to provide an integrated view of the environment inside the university. On the other hand, Pornphol and Tongkeo [25]  see the smart university as a university that uses technologies in the administration system to reach its mission. Coccoli et al. [27]  use the term “smarter university” to define a university community that shares knowledge seamlessly. In December 2019, the topic of the smart university brought together a group of participants from over 100 countries and 200 partners, including universities and companies. This collaborative organization, referred to as Smart University Foundation (SUF)  , was established with the primary objective of exploring and developing guidelines for the implementation of smart university concepts. The SUF envisioned six Smart Core Strategies  for a smart university [28] : (1) smart campus, (2) smart education, (3) smart research, (4) smart people, (5) smart governance, and (6) Smart Influence.1  1 It appears that SUF has lost momentum lately.   Another definition was proposed by Pornphol and Tongkeo [25] , according to them, smart university  comprises three main dimensions: technology, human, and institution, the last one including all educational environments. While Owoc and Marciniak [22]  expand these three aspects of smart university  as follows: (1) smart people, (2) smart buildings, (3) knowledge grid, (4) smart governance, and (5) smart environment. Chagnon-Lessard et al. [21]  did a study on smart campus  and separated the subjects into seven categories: (1) smart building, (2) smart environment, (3) smart mobility, (4) smart living, (5) smart people, (6) smart governance and (7) smart data. N’obrega et al. [10]  also conducted a study about smart campus and divided it into eight dimensions: (1) smart economy, (2) smart education, (3) smart environment, (4) smart living, (5) smart management, (6) smart mobility, (7) smart security, and (8) smart technology. Here it is clear the confusion between the smart university and smart campus terms: when we compare the definitions of Owoc and Marciniak [22]  and SUF [28]  for smart university, with Chagnon-Lessard et al. [21]  and N’obrega et al. [10]  definition for smart campus, we notice that some concepts are repeated in both definitions, namely: smart people, smart buildings, smart governance, and smart environment. Due to the lack of a standardized definition and the prevalent confusion between the terms ‘smart university’ and ‘smart campus,’ we have formulated our own definitions for both: ‘Smart University’ (defined in Section 3.1 ) and ‘Smart Campus’ (defined in Section 3.4.1 ). As a result, one of the contributions of this paper is to propose these definitions and establish clear boundaries for these two terms. This delineation is crucial, particularly when designing ICT systems to support smart environments. Similarly to how a digital city cannot be considered a smart city [18] , a university that digitizes some of its services cannot be deemed a smart university. The term “smart” implies a holistic vision of the environment in question, where there is no room for data silos, but rather the integration and analysis of data from various sources to detect previously unnoticed patterns. 3.1 Definition of Smart University The university focuses on the governance and administration of the university while the campus is part of the university that focuses on the infrastructure and solutions to stakeholders, that is, the physical place where people do their activities. In this way, we define smart university as:     It is essential to emphasize that our definition of a “smart university” is based on three key components, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . For a university to be classified as smart, all three components – namely campus, data, and governance – must exhibit smart attributes. If any component fails to meet these criteria, the university cannot be considered smart under our definition. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the implementation to foster smartness in each component should be flexible, thereby enabling each university to customize these solutions according to its unique characteristics and needs.  From Fig. 2 , we can observe that smart data plays a central role in both receiving and transmitting information within a smart university environment. Additionally, it primarily transmits data to facilitate smart governance. This distinction arises because the collected data serves as a source of input for various smart campus systems, enabling them to take actions within the campus environment. In contrast, smart governance primarily receives data and utilizes it as a basis for making informed decisions. In addition to traditional universities, there is the emergence of virtual universities, exemplified by institutions like Univesp [29] . These virtual universities leverage Learning Management Systems (LMS) to provide students with a comprehensive online infrastructure, delivering everything from classes and course materials to teacher support and evaluations, all in alignment with the course syllabus. As a result, all academic information pertaining to the students is centralized within the LMS, generating valuable smart data that contributes to the concept of a smart university.  3.2 Smart data In today’s world, an enormous amount of data is continuously generated across various sources, including Internet browsing, industrial production lines, sensors and security cameras in public spaces, and more. This vast collection of data is called Big Data. However, the actual value of this data lies not in its sheer volume but in the insights and meaning derived from it. Indeed, raw data itself lacks inherent significance or understanding. We can extract meaningful insights and actionable information through data analysis, interpretation, and contextualization. For example, on the road cameras, we can see how many red cars travel there per hour, but this information is meaningless. With the same raw data, we can extract information about how many vehicles travel on the road per day to schedule maintenance, another meaning data is the place where most accidents happen to improve security or install a speed reducer.  Big Data and smart data are not the same thing. The first one refers to raw data and is characterized by five Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value [31] . The second one is the raw data transformed into information. When we include smartness in data, it starts to make sense in a specific context, and it is used to extract specific content that when exploited generates relevant information [32] . Baldassarre et al. [30]  illustrated how raw data become smart (Fig. 3 ). From the raw data, data is extracted, enhanced, and separated to serve different purposes. This process generates the smart data that can be used to support decisions on a governance level. The authors argue that the quality of data has an influence on the smart data generated. Universities possess vast quantities of heterogeneous data, ranging from information stored in human resources systems to academic records of students, data from geographic information systems, research repositories, and beyond. Furthermore, with the advent of smart campus applications, there is an influx of additional data generated from IoT sensors monitoring assets, the environment, and infrastructure [33,34] . However, much of this data remains fragmented in separate repositories. Effective smart data management requires advanced solutions for storage and integration, enabling data from various sources to be integrated and analyzed using data fusion and machine learning algorithms to yield valuable insights. In the scope of a virtual campus, smart data can be derived from the Learning Management System (LMS) [35] . The LMS contains data on students’ attendance in each class, their engagement with course materials, performance in exercises and evaluations, among other relevant metrics. This rich dataset serves as the foundation for generating smart data [36,37]  and give directions to the smart university.  3.3 Smart governance According to Tomor et al. [38] , in the context of smart cities, smart governance consists of three main parts: governmental organization, citizen participation, and the use of technology. The first part consists of all the responsibilities and actions that the government must have to do. Tomor et al. [38]  consider that citizen participation holds a crucial role in the realm of smart governance, contributing proportionally to its effectiveness as engagement increases. The authors highlight the utilization of technology for citizen interaction and the monitoring of local spaces.  Technology can be used to improve the efficiency of smart governance, assisting in the formulation of more precise and informed decisions. Guenduez et al. [39]  propose a system in which citizens can actively and passively engage in smart governance. This system gathers data through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which monitor the city’s environment, and it also provides a real-time channel for citizens to send information to the government. All this information is processed, and a decision-making algorithm enables the government to efficiently control city devices, taking necessary actions as depicted in Fig. 4 . The university, in many respects, functions as a microcosm of the city in which it resides. It has its own governance structure (composed of boards, administrative officers, and committees), infrastructure, population, culture, and dynamics, much like a city. Given these parallels, it is logical to extend city-related definitions and frameworks to the university context. Just as we envision smart cities that leverage technology and innovation for enhanced sustainability and efficiency, we can similarly conceptualize universities that adopt these principles. By leveraging knowledge derived from smart data, university governance stakeholders can be more strategic in their decisions and better measure performance and track progress. Through real-time monitoring, they can be more responsive, either by addressing changing needs with agility or by incorporating solutions based on artificial intelligence and IoT to automatically take appropriate actions. There is a lack of research on the impact of smart governance in universities. Based on the rationale that providing a better experience for students and staff should be one of the main motives for universities going smart, Jadri’c et al. [40]  studied the impact of smart governance on students’ perception of the university. Results showed that smart governance has a positive impact on students’ perception of the university and also has an indirect impact on students’ commitment to the university.  3.4 Smart campus The term smart campus is much more common in the literature than the term Smart University. We found some definitions of the term smart campus [41,42] . Nevertheless, it also does not have a consolidated definition. 3.4.1 Definition In this paper, we propose the following definition of Smart Campus [43] :     Moreover, we have identified crucial characteristics of a smart campus, including its goals, utilized technologies, and application examples. These aspects serve to elucidate the concept of a smart campus and define its boundaries.  3.4.2 The goals of a smart campus According to our study, each author considers a different set of goals for the smart campus. Some of them consider that the focus of a smart campus must be in education, others assume that the goal must be on life around campus. In this paper, we compile a set of goals for a smart campus which includes aspects proposed in previous studies as follows. Education. • Develop smart teaching and learning [45]  to improve the educational performance [9]  by offering effective support to quality education [46]  and a better experience in learning [44] , using intelligent technologies [47] .  • Improve teaching, researching, and learning by sharing educational resources and information around campus in real-time and smartly [47] .     Life around campus. • Improve the quality of people’s life who frequent the campus [9,44]  by using intelligent technologies [47] .  • Improve daily activities and interactions between people [48] .  • Promote a creative, interactive, and adaptive environment for stakeholders by providing solution services like smart learning, social, management, governance, and green and health services [49] .  • Provide smart building management using automated security supervision and surveillance of campus incidents with real-time alerts [50] .  • Use of social networking and communication tools for work cooperation, protective and preventative healthcare, as well as visible campus governance and reporting [51] .     Resource saving. • Offer high-quality services with low operational cost by using the resources efficiently [50] .  • Provide quick, more flexible, more cost-effective campus services [52] .     Integration. • Integrate all variety of application service systems, intelligent learning, teaching, and living environment, forming an integrated system with self-adjustment capability and cooperation [53] .    Based on our definition and goals of Smart Campus, we comprehend that Smart Campus is composed of five well-delimited parts (Fig. 5 ): Smart Building (Section 3.4.3 ), Smart Education (Section 3.4.4 ), Smart Research (Section 3.4.5 ), Smart Mobility (Section 3.4.6 ), and Smart Environment (Section 3.4.7 ).     3.4.3 Smart building The concept of a smart building is well-established among researchers as a technologically integrated space designed to provide its occupants with a comfortable environment, minimizing the need for human intervention. To do that, most smart building systems use IoT [54]  to monitor the environment [55] , acquire data, and send it to a computer as input for the system. The system uses a set of initial configurations and input data, combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools [56]  to automatically learn the preferences of the building occupants. Afterward, the system may act via IoT devices to provide the individual with comfort in terms of temperature [57] , lighting, security, entertainment (TV and music), and safety (e.g.  fire alarms) [58,59] . The majority of authors agree that smart buildings should be environmentally friendly and capable of promoting water and energy conservation [59] . Additionally, some authors argue that buildings should strive for a Zero Energy Building target for sustainability [55] .  3.4.4 Smart education We live in a connected world where the conventional education system, characterized by teacher lecturing while students passively listen, no longer aligns with student expectations. The persistent requirement for technological advancement has given rise to the concept of smart education, aimed at fulfilling this demand. To provide a clearer understanding of smart education, it is essential to begin with an exploration of the conventional educational approach. Conventional education consists of three main components: teachers, students, and programmatic content (the content to be taught in that course) which instructors deliver to the students. To transform this scenario into a smart education, we have to add a fourth component: technology. According to Zhu et al. [60] , one paradigm that supports smart education is Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) which has mobile learning as the major focus. Mobile learning consists of the use of mobile devices and taking advantage of the mobility of the learner [60]  to promote to students personalized learning. Moreover, the Smart Education subject has been studied from different perspectives, such as industry 4.0 [61] , augmented reality [62] , Educational Big Data (EBD) [63] , social network [64] , IoT [65] , Smart Learning [66–68] , and Smart Teaching [69,70] . In this paper we define smart education based on five components: (1) teachers, (2) students, (3) curricula, (4) technology, and (5) intelligence. Fig. 6  represents our definition of smart education. In this context, the teacher and the student have well-defined roles as in conventional education. The curricula are the academic content of the university course. The EBD is one of the innovations in the smart education context. The EBD assists the students by recommending study material and providing sharing experiences. It allows teachers to receive feedback on the learning process and enhance their teaching. Additionally, the EBD can assist course developers in evaluating the course structure’s effectiveness in achieving the intended goals. This, in turn, aids administrators in refining educational programs [63] . The technology connects all parts and allows them to exchange relevant information.  Besides technology, we also add intelligence into the smart education definition; it permeates all the parts involved in the context and is embedded in all of them. As highlighted by Singh and Miah [71] , online interactions among students and teachers (and employers, when considering students’ career development initiatives) can contribute valuable data to enhance smart education systems. Intelligence plays a pivotal role in bringing the educational system to life. The intelligent component involves the creation of a comprehensive cross-data database, which is built upon the course information from all content sources. The primary objective of this intelligence is to analyze all relevant components and proactively notify stakeholders of any materials pertinent to the subject of study. One practical scenario is when a teacher is either preparing a lesson or actively conducting a class, and the EBD already possesses relevant information. In such instances, the intelligence system can promptly alert the teacher. Furthermore, a specialized tool may be employed to seamlessly integrate this teaching concept into the teacher’s real-time instruction. For instance, if a professor is delivering a lecture on sorting algorithms, the intelligence system can observe the ongoing class and suggest, via email or other forms of notification, a suitable application featuring real-time sorting algorithm animations. In the scope of a virtual campus, smart education can be done using LMS. To add intelligence into the LMS, AI is been used [72–74] . In this sense, Intelligent Learning Management Systems (ILMS) have emerged [75] . ILMS introduces the intelligence to the LMS that must be able to monitor the LMS, especially the learners, adapting the teaching method to suit the student. Examples of the use of technology for educational purposes are showcased by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In Shanghai (China), a primary public school has implemented a system that collects data regarding campus conditions, including air and water quality, security, lighting, and area density. Furthermore, this program incorporates wearable devices to gather physiological data from students, enabling teachers to better cater to individual student needs. As of June 2021, more than 250 schools in China have adopted this innovative model [76, p24] . Another noteworthy project highlighted in the OECD report focuses on monitoring students’ head movements as an indicator of their classroom attention level [76, p110] . Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, an approach involving the use of social robots to teach second languages to children is underway [76, p145] .  3.4.5 Smart research Given the absence of a well-delimitated definition of smart research, we have developed our own definition. Smart Research  is composed of five parts: (1) researcher, (2) environment, (3) database, (4) technology, and (5) intelligence. Fig. 7  shows the interconnections among parts. The researcher  is the person who is doing the research. The environment  refers to the setting in which the research is conducted. This setting may vary, encompassing environments such as laboratories or outdoor locations, depending on the specific research area. For instance, in medical research, the environment may involve the examination of deceased bodies. A database  is a place where the work and results are published and can be accessed by other researchers. There are some digital libraries like ACM [77] , Scopus [78] , IEEE Explorer [79] , and also many universities offer their own repositories dedicated to consolidating their research like Unicamp [80] , USP [80] , Cambridge [81] , MIT [82] , and Harvard [83] .  Technology is the artifact that can be used to automatically collect data in the field and also can help the scientist analyze collected data for better results. In the field of medicine, researchers need to gather data from patients for their studies. This data collection process can be carried out manually or with the aid of technology. An example of this technology is the use of wearable technology to support data collection [84,85] . Wearables can also be used to enhance healthcare [86,87]  combined with IoT devices in the realm of sports [88,89] . After researchers have constructed the dataset, the next crucial step is to analyze the data for generating new insights. Machine learning tools have found extensive applications in supporting data analysis across various domains. For those seeking to harness the power of machine learning without a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms or the technical expertise to fine-tune models, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools and techniques offer a valuable solution [90,91] . AutoML automates the process of designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models [90] . Research in fields such as healthcare [92] , sustainability in Industry 4.0 [93] , and Biodiesel Research [94]  have used AutoML. In smart research, like smart education, there must be an intelligence associated. This consists of the use of technology to improve the research. Intelligence offers numerous benefits, one of which is facilitating the connection among researchers with similar subjects, for instance, identified by the terms they use when conducting searches in digital libraries. Research synthesis tools can also be used in smart research. Marshall and Wallace [95]  present the use of machine learning to make the research synthesis [95] . Nakagawa et al. [96]  implement a framework that not only does a systematic review but also does a systematic mapping of research. Also, AI is being used in diverse research areas [97] . Xu et al. [98]  shows the potential of the diverse use of artificial intelligence in scientific research [98] .  3.4.6 Smart mobility Smart Mobility  aims to make the transportation of people a task that offers the person comfort, security, efficiency, and accessibility with as little environmental pollution as possible [99] . According to Faria et al. [99] , smart mobility includes Driving Safety, smart lighting systems, Sharing and Urban Mobility, Electric Mobility, Green Mobility, and Smart Payment Systems [99] . Antunes [100]  proposed a Virtual UJI tool that consists of modeling the entire university in 3D, using ArcGIS, to map in real-time indoors and outdoors places. Benedito-Bordonau et al. [101]  implemented the proposed tool with a web interface. Based on this project Torres-Sospedra et al. [102]  built two systems: SmartUJI App and SmartUJI AR. SmartUJI App has an intuitive interface to offer stakeholders information about all campuses grouped into specific categories and transportation is one of them. For example, SmartUJI can guide a person to a specific professor’s office. SmartUJI AR is an interactive tool that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to allow the stakeholders to virtually travel the campus by seeing the places on their cell phones before going there [102] . Smart Mobility is also being explored in the context of Smart Campus [103] , public transportation [104,105] , and smart parking [106,107] .  3.4.7 Smart environment Smart Environment  is a concept where technology is leveraged to promote environmental sustainability. In addressing the crucial task of environmental conservation, there arises a need for Environment Monitoring (EM). In a nutshell, EM involves the continuous monitoring of the environment to detect and combat pollution [108] . To address this challenge, the concept of Smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) has emerged, which involves the utilization of AI, IoT, and ML to create an integrated system [109] . The ultimate goal of SEM is to monitor and take effective actions to make the environment more eco-friendly. Ahmed and Mujtaba [110]  conducted an extensive literature review, presenting a variety of communication technologies that can be employed in IoT devices for SEM. Much of the research in this field centers on monitoring at least one of the following themes: water pollution, air pollution [109] , weather, radiation, chemical leakage [110] , waste management, natural disasters, and agricultural control.   3.5 Smart University taxonomy Sections 3.1 to 3.4  presented the definition of a smart university and its components. One of the objectives was to differentiate between the concepts of smart university and smart campus, which, as discussed in Section 1 , are often confused in the literature. In our definition, a smart campus is part of a smart university. Building upon this distinction and having defined all the components of a smart university, we have developed a taxonomy for smart universities, depicted in Fig. 8 . According to Uskov et al. [111]  a well-constructed smart university taxonomy facilitates strategic identification of technological solutions, teaching and research methodologies, services, and other key elements essential for the evolution of the university of tomorrow. Furthermore, it empowers conventional educational institutions to comprehend, discern, and assess viable avenues for transitioning into smart universities.     4 Bringing together sustainability, technology, and Smart University Given the context of the smart university, we survey studies that can contribute to the achievement of each SDG (Section 4.1 ) and we integrate these two subjects by making a correlation between all SDGs and smart university components (Section 4.2 ). 4.1 Overview of Smart University research to support SDGs As previously discussed, we firmly believe that smart universities can play a significant role in promoting sustainable development. Our primary objective in this section was to investigate the availability of smart university solutions designed to actively support the achievement of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  To grasp an idea of the extent of research exploring the relationship between sustainability and universities, we conducted a search using the terms “sustainable development goals” and “university” on Web of Science (see [112] ). Subsequently, we visualized our findings in a diagram (Fig. 9 ) generated using VOSviewer Software (refer to [113] ). In Fig. 9 , it is important to note that the term “university” encompasses related concepts such as universities, campuses, higher education, higher-education institutions, higher education institution, and university students. The size of each circle in the diagram corresponds to the volume of research papers associated with the respective subject. Notably, the “sustainable development goals” circle is the largest, while the “higher education”, “university”, and “sustainability” circles exhibit significant sizes compared to other topics. From the perspective of this diagram, it becomes evident that universities hold substantial potential for contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as indicated by the significant volume of research papers correlating these two subjects. On a further step, we conducted a survey of technological research with the potential to contribute to each one of the SDGs within the scope of smart campuses or smart universities. Table 1  summarizes our findings. The solutions presented in Table 1  can be employed directly and/or indirectly to enhance the SDGs. While some of them were not originally developed to address a particular SDG, they can still be harnessed to achieve a specific goal. The underlying idea is that for each SDG, there exists a set of diverse actions that, if executed, can distinctly address the issues relevant to that goal. For instance, replacing energy-intensive air conditioning equipment with energy-efficient alternatives directly contributes to energy conservation. Similarly, rainwater harvesting for toilet flushing and plant irrigation clearly conserves potable water consumption. Conversely, the introduction of more daylight in a room design reduces the need for artificial lighting during the day, indirectly conserving energy. From the data presented in Table 1 , it is evident that for each of the seventeen SDGs, there exists at least one solution within the smart university environment that can be leveraged to advance the goals.  Analysis of the data in the table reveals that the most extensively researched topics are closely associated with Quality Education (SDG 4), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11). This observation suggests that, in addition to its primary focus on providing quality education, the university also prioritizes issues related to energy sustainability within the community. Conversely, the least researched subjects within the university context are those that may not inherently align with the university’s primary mission. These include Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG 16), No Poverty (SDG 1), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12).  4.2 Correlation between SDGs and Smart University In Sections 3.1 and 3.4 , we introduced the concepts of the Smart University and the Smart Campus, along with their components. In this section, we align these components with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by evaluating the targets associated with each SDG. When a component is linked to an SDG, it signifies that the component holds the potential to contribute to the achievement of that particular SDG significantly. The results of this alignment are presented in Table 2 .  We believe that smart governance  has the potential to facilitate the achievement of all these goals. By centralizing and organizing comprehensive information about the university and the local community, administrators gain valuable insights. This smart  approach can effectively identify the needs of stakeholders and the university itself, enabling more informed and actionable decision-making to drive improvement. Smart building  can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by offering suitable infrastructure to promote quality education (SDG 4). It also plays a role in enhancing the well-being (SDG 3) of stakeholders through features like comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and temperature. Inside the building, the university has an opportunity to address energy conservation (SDG 7 and SDG 11) and water management (SDG 6 and SDG 11). Additionally, it is crucial for the university to prioritize waste separation (SDG 12), both within and outside the buildings. Some components of the smart university and their alignment with the SDGs are intuitive. For instance, smart environment  primarily emphasizes resource conservation (SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13) and the protection of living beings (SDG 3, 9, 14, and 16). Meanwhile, Smart mobility  involves the adoption of eco-friendly transportation methods to mitigate pollution. On the other hand, certain university components are not as intuitively connected to the SDGs. Consider smart education , which not only contributes to SDG 4 but also holds great potential for reducing inequities (SDGs 1, 2, 5, and 10). Smart education accomplishes this by identifying the specific needs of the local community and guiding educators to provide content that empowers stakeholders to address inequities. For instance, if the university is located in an area where women experience domestic violence, it can offer free professional training to enable them to achieve financial independence and escape such situations, as demonstrated by Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC) [227] . As research stands at the core of any university, another part of it that can be effective in the achievement of all goals is smart research . Given the diverse range of research areas, the smartness embedded within research practices can be instrumental in monitoring various aspects of the university to provide optimal conditions in all environments. For example, researchers can monitor ponds and lakes to support SDG 14 by ensuring the provision of quality water for aquatic life. Moreover, smart research can contribute to the reduction of inequities (SDG 10) by developing more efficient and cost-effective methods in diverse domains, including house construction (SDG 1), food production (SDG 2), and innovations in contraception (SDG 5). 4.2.1 Case study The Smart University can use diverse technologies to implement solutions for sustainable development. Among them, the following stand out: Big Data: [46,228–230] , Cloud Computing [52,230] , and Internet of Things (IoT): [47,52,231–234] . To illustrate a real university scenario where these technologies are employed to pursue SDG targets, we have created a campus map. This map highlights specific locations on the university campus where IoT devices and sensors could be installed to support the attainment of the SDGs and their corresponding targets (targets are denoted by a dot following the SDG number) (see Fig. 10 ).  The university as a whole  can help with target 12.8, which aims to ensure that people have relevant information and awareness about sustainable development. In all university buildings , meters can be placed to help generate indicators for SDGs 6 (drinking water and sanitation - targets 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, which are related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, water quality, and water-use efficiency, respectively), 7 (affordable and clean energy), and 12 (sustainable communities - targets 12.2 and 12.5, which are related to management and use of natural resources and waste reduction, respectively). The streets  of the campus, through the generation of less carbon by means of public transportation, can contribute to the improvement of SDG 13 (action against global climate change) and target 11.2 (safe, accessible, sustainable transportation systems). The buildings, streets, parks, etc  can generate indicators to contribute to target 7.1 (ensuring universal access to energy services). At the university where this research is being conducted (University of Campinas - UNICAMP), there is also a photovoltaic plant that meets target 7.2 (renewable energy). Furthermore, we have that parks  can contribute to target 11.7 (safe and green public space), libraries  to 11.4 (cultural heritage), restaurants  to 12.3 (halving food waste), the Institute of Chemistry  to 12.4 (environmentally adequate management of chemicals), and the rectorate  to 12.7 (promoting sustainable public purchasing practices). The data collected by the IoT devices distributed throughout the campus will culminate in what we refer to as smart data . This smart data will, in turn, underpin the implementation of smart governance  within the organization.    5 Conclusion Universities must prioritize sustainability as a paramount concern beyond providing high-quality education. As influencers, universities possess the ability to raise community awareness regarding this important subject and develop replicable solutions that enhance global sustainability. Implementing these solutions across universities can significantly contribute to achieving broader sustainability goals. Our study revealed a lack of precise definitions for the term smart university and its components. Therefore, as a contribution of our research, we comprehensively defined and elucidated each aspect of a smart university within this paper. In our definition, we compartmentalized the smart university into three main components: smart governance, smart data, and smart campus. Within the context of smart campuses, we delineated five key elements: smart building, smart education, smart research, smart mobility, and smart environment. Crucially, we focused on the core elements of a university — education, and research — defining them within the context of the smart campus as smart education and smart research. Moreover, we correlated the seventeen SDGs with smart university solutions through a survey of recent studies. Our findings indicate that leveraging Smart University solutions can effectively facilitate the accomplishment of the SDGs. Importantly, we emphasized the intrinsic relationship between smart universities and the targets of the SDGs, underscoring the potential for visualizing and advancing these connections. Finally, we presented a case study involving a university map pinpointing locations where specific solutions within the university infrastructure could be effectively employed to achieve targeted SDG.  6 Future work Our analysis highlighted several areas requiring further exploration to realize the SDGs within the smart university. In forthcoming work, we intend to outline strategic initiatives that can underpin university efforts toward achieving these goals. Our study’s first observation underscores the necessity for universities to integrate sustainability considerations into the inception of new construction projects. Embedding sustainability into initial planning ensures subsequent decisions align with these parameters. For instance, a university intending to implement smart solutions should select suppliers committed to sustainable supply chains. Another critical observation pertains to the need for creating a universal interface for smart university solutions. This interface would enable seamless integration of individual solutions into a centralized system, allowing easy comprehension and utilization of generated data. This unified approach would facilitate the creation of sustainability indicators by harnessing independent data from diverse solutions. Furthermore, implementing a framework to integrate existing solutions into a unified system could empower campuses to track their progress toward SDGs comprehensively. Automating the collection of sustainability-related data — such as energy and water consumption — could streamline the generation of sustainability indicators. Notably, private companies like Cisco and Century are developing frameworks aimed at making a campus smarter and assisting the achievement of some SDGs [235] . They developed a smart university framework that connects network buildings and services using Internet Protocol (IP) with the goals of saving energy, climate control, and security. CenturyLink [236]  has been developing a framework that can provide smart university features like ubiquitous access, support real-time applications, provide security and reliability, maximize application performance, reduce operating costs and simplify management. In academia, Kostepen et al. [237]  proposed a framework utilizing various technologies such as sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing, among others. Their implementation encompassed a unified framework solution applicable to the entire university. This solution addressed diverse aspects including energy conservation, enhancing educational quality, evaluating public resource utilization, and optimizing campus facilities, among other functionalities. Although frameworks exist, they frequently fail to represent real-world scenarios accurately. To address this limitation, the concept of a digital twin  emerges as a solution, offering the ability to create digital replicas of physical spaces [238] . While Roda-Sanchez et al. [239]  introduced a smart campus digital twin, our proposal involves future work centered on a sustainability-focused Smart University digital twin to further the achievement of SDGs. To accomplish this, we will refine and enhance the Sustainable Development Goals Green Framework (SDGreen) proposed in our previous work [omitted for blind review]. SDGreen is a framework to automate the data collection process and generate sustainability indicators in universities. Besides the generation of indicators, SDGreen also provides the visualization of the indicators and can generate relevant information to assist the university in the achievement of sustainable goals. SDGreen can additionally warn the managers when an unexpected device measurement is observed by the system. For example, if water usage is much higher than expected, there may be a water leak. SDGreen will monitor the data that is focused on the metrics related to the SDGs. The university will automatically collect relevant information around the campus by using technological devices such as sensors or other IoT devices. The SDGreen’s process of collecting data is very similar for all of SDGs, in the sense that all the data will be collected automatically, using IoT devices and generating the necessary data so that university managers can make decisions focused on sustainability. The framework will receive and process all measurements, generating the data that corresponds to one or more SDGs. SDGreen will be prepared to generate metrics to evaluate all SDGs by simply attaching other solutions that are used to collect data to calculate the SDG indicator.
