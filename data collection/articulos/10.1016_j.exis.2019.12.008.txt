                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have, since 2015, become the normative framework driving global development discourse. The international development community has since taken comprehensive action to mobilise resources in a bid to operationalise these Goals, and there is growing recognition in both policy and public discourse that the private sector can assist in this endeavour. Drawing on data from interviews conducted with community beneficiaries and key informants, we explore the specific case of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives taken in the mining and telecommunications sectors in Ghana in their bid to operationalise the SDGs. What is abundantly clear is that while the CSR initiatives of the private sector hold some potential to contribute to the attainment of a number of the SDGs, the short-term nature of interventions, the lack of coordination between private sector actors and meaningful community participation, stand to limit this potential. We conclude by outlining key lessons for those seeking to maximise the potential of CSR initiatives of the private sector to advance the attainment of the SDGs.

Keywords Private sector  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  Ghana    1 Introduction In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) following the approval of the document, “Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’’. The SDGs marks the global development agenda for promoting “dignity, peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future” (United Nations, 2018 , p. 3). The document consists of 17 goals, 169 targets and 230 indicators with an overarching goal of ensuring that no one is left behind by 20301  1 The 17 SDGs are: 1. No Poverty; 2. Zero Hunger; 3. Good Health and Well Being; 4. Quality Education; 5. Gender Equality; 6. Clean Water and Sanitation; 7. Affordable and Clean Energy; 8. Good Jobs and Economic Growth; 9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; 10. Reduced Inequalities; 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities; 12. Responsible Consumption and Production; 13. Climate Action; 14. Life Below Water; 15. Life on Land; 16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; and 17. Partnerships for the Goals.   . An underlying principle of the SDGs is the recognition of the interdependency between the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development (United Nations, 2018 , 2015 ). Its design involved broad multi-stakeholder consultations between national governments, the international community, the private sector, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and academic institutions. The complex, broad and integrated nature of the SDGs requires collaborative efforts of all stakeholders. Meanwhile, there are concerns regarding the donor-driven nature of the document and the uneven involvement of the private sector and CSOs in its design process (Willis, 2016 ). There is growing recognition in both policy and public discourse that the private sector can help deliver the SDGs at least in part as a result of the sector’s financial resources, innovation and responsiveness2  2 In this paper, we define the private sector as comprising businesses that have for-profit seeking as their main mission. This definition focuses on both informal and formal micro-enterprises, small and medium-scale enterprises and multinational corporations and excludes independent foundations, CSOs and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). We also acknowledge that CSR is used as a generic term for corporate social investment and engagement in both social and philanthropic activities undertaken by corporate organisations.   (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ; Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). For example, the United Nations Global Compact (hereafter, the Compact) White Paper asserts that “a new paradigm in development thinking is recognizing the centrality of private enterprise in pursuit of the development agenda and vice versa’’. The Compact also highlights the importance of the private sector in driving sustainable economic growth, protecting the planet and eliminating poverty through public-private collaborations and strategic partnerships (UN Global Compact, 2014, p. 3). There is the belief among policy makers that the SDGs’ annual investment gap of US$5 trillion-US$7 trillion will be provided by private sector actors (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 2014 ). The private sector has also been identified as having the capacity to reduce social inequalities through the development of inclusive and sustainable business models (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ; UNDP et al., 2016). Indeed, the SDGs creates a unique opportunity for the private sector by providing: a) a framework with visible outcomes endorsed by governments, civil society and businesses; b) a common language on socio-economic and environmental issues with the potential to improve communication, collaboration and coordination; and c) direction for future innovations and investments in new and untapped markets (CISL, 2017 , p.7). The pathways through which the private sector may contribute to national development are broad but can fall under the following: job creation and employment, contribution to national income, delivery of critical goods and services, equity financing, tax revenues, royalties, efficient flow of capital for production as well as engagement in a range of social interventions through the lens of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives (Andrews, 2019 ; Benshaul-Tolonen et al., 2019 ; Yakovleva et al., 2017 ). It is increasingly being accepted in mainstream development thinking that CSR initiatives of the private sector can contribute meaningfully towards sustainable development (Fordham and Robinson, 2019 ). The orthodoxy that CSR interventions are responding to local level needs is shared by stakeholders in the mining and telecommunications sectors of Ghana (ICMM, 2019 ; Andrews, 2019 ; Amponsah and Dartey-Baah, 2015; Dartey-Baah et al., 2015 ). It is hard to imagine a corporation in today’s world of business that does not engage in social activities and for some companies, CSR activities may mark a precise revolution in their business engagement (Manteaw, 2007). The various social initiatives that are vigorously being pursued by mining and telecommunications companies have resulted in CSR programmes moving up the political and economic agenda. However, there are long standing questions of the underlying principles and assumptions underpinning CSR initiatives (The Economist, 2005 ). Firstly, social responsibility is directed solely to shareholders. Secondly, certain CSR initiatives may raise new problems apart from addressing existing ones. Thirdly, some CSR projects may do little more than promote the agenda of the corporation itself while dispelling and/or distracting attention from deeper structural economic, political and social problems that need to be addressed (The Economist, 2005). Informed by these concerns, this study asks the following research question: what are the potentials and limits of private sector CSR initiatives for advancing the attainment of the SDGs in Ghana? We answer this question by focusing specifically on CSR initiatives of mining and telecommunications companies based in Ghana. Our choice of these companies is informed by claims of the alignment of their CSR initiatives with the SDGs (CMM, 2019; Fraser, 2019 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ; UNDP et al., 2016 ; Daily Graphic, 2015 ). For example, the principles of the African Mining Vision (AMV) are aligned with the SDG targets on reducing poverty and inequalities, enhancing economic development and mitigating the negative effects of climate change (Sturman et al., 2020 ). According to the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), mining companies in Ghana, particularly AngloGold Ashanti through its combined workforce and Community Malaria Programme in Obuasi, have made progress in realising SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals). Similarly, the Newmont Ahafo Development Foundation (NADeF) is recognised for its contribution to local governance structures and regional development by working collaboratively with local communities in an attempt to spearhead the achievement of SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) (ICMM, 2019 ). In the telecommunications sector, companies including MTN-Ghana Foundation claim to have invested over GH₵21.5 million between 2007 and 2015 as part of their CSR initiatives to improve health care, education and the living conditions of over 3 million Ghanaians, thereby contributing directly to realising the SDGs (Daily Graphic, 2015 ; MTN-Ghana, 2015 ). Telecommunications companies through digital financial services may also help in promoting inclusivity and gender equality (Vodafone Group, 2019 ). More importantly, the current President of Ghana, Nana Akuffo Addo, has called on private sector actors in the country to help in achieving the SDGs because of their role as primary promoters of social and economic transformation. In effect, the now widely accepted view within policy and popular discourse is that the private sector has the potential to create economic opportunities for ‘uplifting the predicament of the poor in society’ (CitiNews, 2018 ). In examining the CSR initiatives of the private sector in Ghana, we draw on in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with 85 interviewees comprising representatives of mining and telecommunications companies, government officials, donor representatives, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), leaders and community members in the Northern, Upper West, Greater Accra and Western North Regions of Ghana. What is abundantly clear from this research is that, while the CSR initiatives (e.g. provision of social infrastructure and job creation) of the private sector hold some potential to contribute to the attainment of a number of the SDGs, the short-term nature of their interventions, the lack of coordination between private sector actors as well as meaningful community participation, stand to limit this potential. In particular, we find that engagements between the private sector and development stakeholders, especially members of beneficiary communities, are highly limited. We conclude by outlining some lessons for those seeking to maximise the potential of private sector CSR initiatives for advancing the attainment of SDGs. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. The next section reviews the literature on the SDGs and private sector participation, focusing specifically on the mining and telecommunications sectors in Ghana. The focus then turns to the methodology in Section 3 . Drawing on our empirical material, Section 4  uses the case of mining and telecommunications companies’ CSR initiatives to reflect on the broader issue of private sector contributions to the SDGs. This is followed by a discussion of the research findings, at the end of which, some key implications are identified.  2 The SDGs and the private sector This research used the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in framing our understanding of the potentials and limits of the private sector to contribute to the delivery of the 2030 development agenda in Ghana. The SDGs is an outcome of the Rio+20 Conference and builds on the legacy of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Kumi et al., 2014 ). The objective of the SDGs is to eradicate extreme poverty, combat inequality, injustice and climate change by addressing the systematic barriers to human and sustainable development (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ). It has become the cardinal agenda guiding current and future world development, a method for solving global problems, and analysing relationships between the world economy, global society and the earth’s physical environment with an explicit focus on people, prosperity, partnership, planet and peace (Sachs, 2015a ). The SDGs are complex, ambitious and interconnected, and relate to themes ranging from industry, sustainable cities and communities, climate action and infrastructure. The interconnected nature of the SDGs reflects the complexity of the agenda involving efforts by multiple stakeholders through partnerships, market-based solutions and private investments (Kumi, 2019 Yakovleva et al., 2017 ; Scheyvens et al., 2016 ;). A recent white paper, Mapping Mining to the Sustainable Development Goals: An Atlas , recognises the potential contribution of the mining sector to the achievement of the 17 SDGs at national, regional and global levels, and UNDP et al. (2016) point to the sector’s promotion of social inclusion, environmental sustainability and economic development along with its ability to mobilise economic and technological resources, create jobs, generate income, royalties and taxes that may support government investments in poverty eradication (Loayza and Rigolini, 2016 ; UNDP et al., 2016). As highlighted by ICMM (2019) , mining companies in Ghana support participatory decision-making with local communities to strengthen the voices of marginalised people in society. Moreover, mining companies are increasingly adopting gender mainstreaming as an avenue to promote gender equality (Yakovleva, 2007 ). Similarly, businesses in the telecommunications sector contribute to the delivery of the SDGs through the use of new technologies, innovations and data collection. According to GSMA Intelligence (2018 , p.3), the mobile industry is “already positively impacting every one of the 17 SDGs’’ through the provision of mobile networks. The mobile industry is well-placed to deliver the SDGs 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), 4 (Quality Education) and 13 (Climate Action). For example, there are more than 5 billion people around the world who have access to mobile phones, with an additional 7 billion people covered by mobile networks. This creates opportunities for the development of new business models including sharing economy, mobile savings and pay-as-you-go solar models that provide access to clean energy (GSMA Intelligence, 2018 ). In addition, telecommunications companies provide financial inclusion for about 16.9 million women through digital financial platforms like M-PESA (Vodafone Group, 2019 ). The financial services provided by digital companies may help women-owned businesses by reducing their risks and improving access to market and information thereby minimising the gender gap in business ownership. This, in turn, has the potential to enhance the delivery of SDG 5 (Klapper et al., 2016 ). For SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), Vodafone Group (2019)  claims that about 54,712 young people were given workplace experience between 2018 and 2019 while 5, 398 graduates completed their Discover Programme over the past decade. In this regard, telecommunications companies may provide long-lasting employment opportunities for young people to access digital skills and learning in order to promote an inclusive digital economy. These contributions of mining and telecommunications companies discussed above, and many others noted elsewhere (see Yakovleva et al., 2017 ; Loayza and Rigolini, 2016 ; Klapper et al., 2016 ), have brought private sector actors into the limelight of the development discourse. In most accounts, the private sector is pitched as the engine for promoting economic growth and development (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ; Mawdsley, 2015 ). The increasing emphasis on the private sector stems from the need for capital investments in service provision and infrastructural development which are woefully inadequate in many developing countries. Against this backdrop, private sector actors are encouraged to play a proactive role by becoming development agents particularly through their CSR and other development initiatives. The private sector is also recognised for its ability to mobilise the much-needed resources for development. This has come at a critical time when official development assistance (ODA) is shrinking for many developing countries (Sachs, 2015a ). The implementation of the SDGs requires huge financial resources estimated between US$5 trillion to US$7 trillion of investments annually. For developing countries, an estimated US$4 trillion is needed annually to fund investments leaving a funding gap of US$2.5 trillion per year. The majority of these funds have to be mobilised and channelled through private-led investments including blended finance, debt and equity finance and domestic resource mobilisation (Sachs, 2015b ; UNCTAD, 2014). The policy literature draws attention to the private sector as a development stakeholder. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2015 , p.17) views the private sector as the engine for innovation, creativity, efficiency and responsiveness. This view was aptly echoed in the outcome of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA): “we call on all businesses to apply their creativity and innovation to solving sustainable development challenges’’. Further, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and United Nations Global Compact (2013 , p. 4) notes: “in addition to eliminating poverty, the new framework will need to address the drivers of change, such as economic growth, job creation, reduced inequality and innovation that makes better and more careful use of natural resources. Industry plays a prominent role in advancing all these drivers’’. Along similar lines, the World Bank view CSR as a potentially viable route for delivering socio-economic progress (World Bank, 2016 ). From this perspective, CSR initiatives cannot solely be seen through the lens of the so-called ‘business case argument’, as expectations of its potential contributions are much broader (Trebeck, 2008 ). The value of CSR programmes is rooted in the social, economic and environmental sustainability imperatives of doing business (Fordham and Robinson, 2019 ). Some commentators argue that CSR initiatives complement efforts aimed at promoting inclusive development and that the flexibility and social base of private sector actors in the telecommunications and mining sectors are critical for meeting local needs (Mohammed et al., 2019 ; Dartey-Baah et al., 2015 ). Frynas (2005)  suggests that the benefit of CSR must be examined in a much broader context of community development. CSR is, therefore, increasingly being promoted, advocated and recognised by policy makers and development professionals as a pathway to delivering sustainable development (Jenkins, 2005). Despite the view of the private sector as an important stakeholder to help deliver the SDGs, particularly through CSR initiatives, the policy and popular literature assumes an existence of a perfect harmony or shared value between the private sector and beneficiary communities (see Fraser, 2019 ). It is clear that the mainstream argument has failed to acknowledge the inherent conflicts and tensions between companies and beneficiary communities in the delivery of CSR programmes, which sometimes leads to win-lose scenarios instead of win-win outcomes (Fraser, 2019 ; Mawdsley, 2014 ). These inherent tensions and, at times, conflicting relationships between private sector actors and beneficiary communities in the delivery of CSR initiatives represent our point of departure.  3 Methodology 3.1 Study area This study was undertaken in the Northern, Upper West (hereafter, the North), Greater Accra and Western North Regions of Ghana. These regions were purposively selected based on the following. First, the North was selected because it is the most deprived region of Ghana and the levels of disparity and inequality between southern and Northern Ghana are increasing (United Nations Communications Group (UNCG) and the CSO Platform on SDGs, 2017 ). At the same time, there are a number of CSR interventions by telecommunications companies including MTN-Ghana and Vodafone Ghana (Business and Financial Times, 2017 ; Ghana Statistical Service, 2014) in the North and with the potential to address these regional disparities. Second, the Greater Accra Region was selected because of its importance as the headquarters of many telecommunications companies, along with donor and government agencies. Third, the Western North Region, covering specifically Bibiani-Anhwiaso Bekwai Municipality (BABM) and its mining communities of Bibiani Old Town and Chirano was purposively selected because they provided us with the opportunity to interrogate the reality of the CSR initiatives at the local level. Gold mining in BABM dates back to 1902 and the municipality hosts some of the largest gold mining companies in Ghana (Andrews, 2019 ; Resolute Mining Limited, 2018 ).  3.2 Research design and data collection Our research is informed by a qualitative research design involving the use of semi-structured interviews and draws on 85 in-depth semi-structured interviews held with representatives of mining and telecommunications companies, community members, government and donor representatives and NGO workers in the four regions between July 2015 and September 2018. The participants for this research comprised of thirty-two NGO employees that collaborated with mining and telecommunications companies in undertaking CSR initiatives, five government officials from the Ministry of Finance, Department of Social Welfare and National Development Planning Commission, fifteen representatives from two mining and three telecommunications companies in addition to twenty-two community members residing at Bibiani Old Town and Chirano. Letters were sent to the participants to introduce the purpose, nature and objective of the research to gain access. The participants were purposively selected to reflect the diversity of stakeholders (i.e. mining and telecommunications companies, NGOs, government officials, donor representatives and community members) relevant to CSR initiatives and the SDGs. The key informants comprised of Executive Directors, Managers and Community Development Officers and were deemed appropriate as they were in the best position to provide better and adequate information and nuanced perspectives on CSR initiatives by mining and telecommunications companies and the SDGs. Rather than arriving at a representative sample, the use of purposive sampling was informed by the need to explore an in-depth understanding with interviewees. This allowed the capturing of diversity of experiences and perceptions on the potential role and limitations of mining and telecommunications companies to deliver the SDGs in Ghana. For example, donor agencies like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are important stakeholders in the implementation of the SDGs in Ghana. In addition, civil society groups, such as the CSOs Platform on SDGs, bring together NGOs to plan and coordinate initiatives and programmes towards the achievement of the SDGs in Ghana. For this reason, understanding the perception of these important stakeholders about private sector participation in the SDGs is crucial. Data collection for this research was in two phases: July 2015-July 2016 and April-September 2018. Phase one focused on semi-structured interviews as part of a research project on private sector and civil society collaborations and involvement in the implementation of the SDGs in the Northern, Upper West and Greater Accra regions of Ghana. The use of semi-structured interviews was informed by the need for an in-depth understanding of the perceptions and experiences of participants about private sector contributions to the SDGs. The research explored issues such as CSR initiatives by corporate foundations, stakeholder coordination and challenges associated with private sector-civil society collaborations. For phase one, access to participants was through a workshop organised by the West African Civil Society Institute which created an opportunity to network with representatives of three telecommunications companies, donor representatives, NGOs and government officials. For phase two, data collection took place in the Bibiani-Anhwaiso-Bekwai Municipality in the mining communities of Bibiani Old Town and Chirano to gather information from community members on their experience of CSR projects undertaken by two gold mining companies. Views from community members and mining representatives were useful in shedding light on the dynamics associated with CSR initiatives in the mining sector. In addition, the insider position of the authors as natives from the Municipality facilitated access to participants. Participants were selected purposively because of their position as youth and opinion leaders and representatives of mining companies with knowledge about CSR initiatives by mining companies. Interviews were conducted in a face-to-face manner and on average lasted between 45 and 90 minutes. For phase one, all interviews were conducted in English while in phase two, all interviews were conducted in Twi (a local Ghanaian language) because the majority of the community members in Bibiani Old Town and Chirano did not speak English. The interviews were translated into English. Before every interview, a statement of consent covering the objectives and expectations of the interview was read in English and interpreted in the local language (Twi). Issues of data confidentiality and expected output were also explained. The research received approval from the Ethical Committee of the University of Bath. The interviews started with general and indirect questions to help establish rapport and trust with interviewees. Prompts and probes were used and this allowed a thorough discussion of their experiences and expectations of CSR initiatives.  3.3 Data analysis Permission was sought to record the interviews with a digital audio recorder and later transcribed with the consent of interviewees. This ensured the reliability and validity of the data. The transcribed data was coded into primary and secondary themes using NVivo 11. The interview data was analysed thematically by focusing on emergent themes. The analysis followed the six steps in conducting thematic analysis recommended by Braun and Clarke (2006) . These are: a) familiarisation with the data; b) generating initial themes; c) searching for themes; d) reviewing of themes; e) defining; and f) naming themes and report production. As part of data analysis, indexing helped in the identification of primary and secondary themes and the analysis was inductive and iterative in nature. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality, the names of all interviewees and organisations were anonymised. Furthermore, a great deal of reflexivity was exercised in the data analysis to minimize potential bias given the insider positions of the researchers. Member checking, a process where transcripts are sent to interviewees for verification was also carried out. Their feedback were incorporated into the final analysis.   4 Findings 4.1 Corporate social responsibility and the SDGs in Ghana The contributions of the private sector in advancing the SDGs in the context of CSR, as evident in this study, covered the provision of social services such as education, health, sponsorship of entertainment shows, and job creation. These areas of contribution, under the auspices of CSR, are heralded by the mining and telecommunications sectors studied as the key mechanisms for promoting local and national development. Interviewees proudly pointed to how mining companies have invested substantial resources to provide infrastructural facilities, scholarships for needy but brilliant students and the building of hospital blocks as part of their CSR activities:“The mining company has built a school and clinic but it is located at Bungalow [a suburb of Bibiani] where staff of the mines live. Sometimes they also provide scholarship for students who are brilliant but needy to study up to secondary school level. Sometime ago, they resurfaced some of the roads in this community. We also heard recently that they want to help extend electricity to some of the villages’’ (Youth Leader, 15 August 2018, Bibiani Old Town).   Speaking about their involvement in the provision of educational and health infrastructure, a staff of a telecommunications company emphasised that:“In education, we are interested more in infrastructure provision. So, we get requests from communities that they need a classroom block [….] Even though they request for a classroom block, we make sure we provide them with furniture, whiteboard and in some cases where there are no teachers, we go ahead and engage with the Ghana Education Service to see how we can assist them. We provide other things that will make the facility functional’’ (Corporate Staff, 2 June 2016, Accra).   It is clear that some corporate organisations, as part of their CSR initiatives, are supporting the Government of Ghana’s Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies (CPESDP) that highlights the need for infrastructural and social development provision of quality and inclusive education for communities. This has the potential to advance the attainment of SDG 4. However, the community members interviewed in Bibiani Old Town said that while mining companies have built schools and hospitals, these facilities were not accessible to the indigenes. Officials of the mines and their households enjoy the schools and clinics provided in the name of CSR while the local people live in the shanty and environmentally degraded areas with limited access to social services including medical facilities and toilets.“The only thing they [mining companies] have done is the building of a school and a hospital which is also located at Bungalow [a suburb of Bibiani mostly inhabited by mining staff]. So, if your family members are not employees of the mines, you can’t access these facilities. As for me, I have not seen anything that the mining companies have done for us here in Old Town. Look at how we are suffering and we say there is a mining company here’’ (Community Member, 5 June 2018, Bibiani Old Town).   The inequity in access to social infrastructure provided by mining companies in the name of CSR could affect the attainment of SDGs 1 (No Poverty); 3 (Good Health and Well Being); 4 (Quality Education and 10 (Reducing Inequalities). Aside from education and health facilities, interviewees from the mining and telecommunications companies reported that their CSR initiatives contribute to advancing SDG 8 of ensuring decent work. They mentioned partnering with the Government of Ghana on initiatives to reduce youth unemployment in the country as one interviewee puts it:“If private companies create jobs that are absorbed into the economy, then they will contribute to the SDGs and the government’s burden of unemployment would come down. Now there are not even jobs and the government is looking at ways to partner with private companies like us to reduce youth unemployment [.…..] We work with the government through public-private partnership initiatives to help our communities with jobs’’ (Corporate Staff, 2 June 2016, Accra).   The potential of the mining and telecommunications sectors to create new jobs is significant giving the high unemployment situation in Ghana. However, the claim of contributing to employment by the representatives of the mining and telecommunications companies was questioned by some key informants who wondered whether the companies were doing enough to create jobs. A general observation among key informants was that the private sector in Ghana is faced with a number of challenges as one interviewee stated: “if you take the Ghanaian terrain for instance, over the past three-four years, dumsor  [erratic power supply] has become an issue for all companies’’ (Interviewed on 27 January 2016, Accra). Another interviewee added: “The business environment is really tough in terms of regulatory issues. It is not a cool  environment because there are a lot of issues that we are juggling with’’ (Interviewed on 10 August 2018, Chirano). Faced with these challenges, interviewees from the expected CSR beneficiary communities contested whether the mining companies had promoted inclusive growth through the provision of new jobs. A youth leader in Bibiani for instance said:“When they tell you to have skills training, they are indirectly informing you that they will not employ you. There is a mining company in town and we the indigenes suffer from the effects of the mines, but they go and bring someone from Obuasi to do the work. It’s our ancestors who have looked after the gold, but we don’t enjoy anything. The companies go and bring outsiders and the indigenes remain unemployed’’ (Youth leader, 25 September 2018, Bibiani Old Town).   It is evident that jobs created by mining companies did not satisfy the demand from the indigenous community members. Our informants reported that they were expecting the mining companies to at least train and employ some of the local youth to work in the mines as this could have provided a pathway for them to earn income to meet their own needs and that of their households. This raises concerns as to whether the CSR initiatives of the mining companies studied can contribute to promoting equitable employment for local communities. In addition to local employment, our interviews revealed a number of important caveats regarding CSR initiatives of the companies and to which we turn our attention in the subsequent sections.  4.2 Lack of inclusion and meaningful participation in CSR initiatives Rather than adopting an inclusive approach by working with local communities, interviewees from the mining communities noted that participatory local involvement in CSR initiatives was limited. While some officers of the mining companies in Bibiani and Chirano, for example, claimed to engage community members in planning action, and adopt the principle of local ownership through the establishment of community forums and committees, discussions with many community members showed that this was not always the case. This is how one youth leader puts it: “the mining companies always neglect us in the planning of their community projects. I can say that we’ve not benefitted at all from their projects because they don’t involve the youth in the town. They just decide on what they want to do, and we don’t have any idea about why they decided to focus on specific development interventions’’ (Youth leader, 29th  September 2018, Chirano). The participation of community members in CSR projects was reported to have been indirect, and involving only individuals at the top of local hierarchies, such as community leaders, to the neglect of the wider population. According to interviewees, participation in projects occurred through community durbars rather than through a transformative process that enables a wide range of community members to participate and make informed choices within the framework of their socio-cultural and economic realities. As one youth leader concludes “this leads us to perceive CSR initiatives as fulfilling the interests of traditional leaders and the powerful in society’’ (Interviewed on 4 September 2018, Bibiani Old Town). Such statements also speak to how CSR initiatives fail to take into account issues of power relations, elite capture, social justice and wider concerns about community empowerment. These concerns also raise questions about the ability of CSR projects to make a meaningful impact on the development agendas of beneficiary communities. The instances of lack of community involvement in decision-making processes and consequent feelings of neglect and exclusion were reported to have resulted in confrontations between the mining companies and the youth of Bibiani Old Town that led to deaths and the destruction of properties. Our informants were of the view that the activities of the mining companies had displaced youth livelihoods in the small-scale and artisanal mining (galamsey ). This was explained as follows:“In this community [Bibiani Old Town], galamsey  is all we know. But now the mines have taken over our lands and we can no longer do the galamsey . Initially the galamsey  helped us get money to support our family but now, we can’t because the lands have been given to the mines with their soldiers protecting the lands’’ (Community Member, 2 September 2018, Bibiani Old Town).   The situation on community involvement in project design and implementation was found to be somewhat different for foundations established by some telecommunications companies to undertake CSR initiatives. For example, one staff member of a corporate foundation explained: “if we want to build a hospital, we gather the chiefs and the community members and we tell them, we are coming to implement the project for you. We also ask them, how do you want the project to be implemented?’’ (Corporate Staff, 15 March 2016, Accra). Despite such claims of community participation in projects, five key informants interviewed argued that CSR initiatives by telecommunications companies were unable to bring about the needed change in the lives of their beneficiary communities because of their underlying motives. In fact, informants questioned the effectiveness of CSR initiatives: “their CSR doesn’t work. They sometimes find a way of doing some fictitious activities to show that they are doing CSR’’ (Key informant, 18 April 2016, Tamale). The rationale for engaging in CSR was to enable telecommunications companies to meet global standards that allows them to claim legitimacy as responsible corporations. One interviewee gave an example in the following excerpt:“They want to redeem their reputation and so they used the CSR to manage the risk […] Now they are embarking on CSR initiatives. They have a CSR person now, but previously it wasn’t like that and did not form part of their activities’’ (Interviewee, 10 June 2016, Wa).    4.3 Voluntary engagement and skewness of CSR initiatives Interviewees explained that CSR in Ghana is a voluntary act given the absence of a coherent policy framework to guide companies in pursuit of CSR. At the moment, corporate organisations are not regulated by an institutionalised body in terms of their CSR reporting. For this reason, the CSR actions of corporate organisations are based on notions of charity and stewardship:“In advanced countries, companies are always giving to support their communities. However, in Ghana we don’t have that. It is also partly because there are no laid down rules to promote CSR. So, all companies in Ghana are expected to give part of their profit to community work but there is no law to enforce this practice. So, if Company A is drilling a borehole here, how much is their profit and what is the law saying about what they should give? The law does not specify, so they can give US$5000 to CSR when in fact they have made over US$7 million in profits. They can just use the US$5000 to spread their projects in the country and announce that they are promoting development and the SDGs’’ (Interviewed on 23 March 2016, Wa).   The implication is that corporate organisations undertake CSR initiatives they perceive to be useful and necessary for promoting their own interests. Interviewees reported that managers of companies in the mining and telecommunications sectors used their discretion in deciding which sectors and activities they perceived as important. This leads to their monopoly in decision-making, consequently, a lack of accountability for their CSR initiatives. More importantly, CSR is often considered a philanthropic act and is derived from a percentage of profit after tax as described by one representative of a telecommunications company: “as a company, we do not go out to solicit funds. A percentage after tax is given to the foundation to carry out the CSR initiatives on behalf of the business [….]. We set aside 1 % of that profit for CSR initiatives’’ (Corporate staff, 2 June 2016, Accra). The decision to determine how corporate organisations spend their CSR resources is unilaterally set by the companies. This was stated as follows: “we approached a company and we were told it was the Managing Director who decides the kind of CSR they want to undertake’’ (NGO staff, 17 March 2016, Tamale). CSR agenda setting by private sector organisations is largely at the discretion of their managers. A more worrying observation was that in instances where businesses were unable to make profit, CSR often became the target for reducing operational costs. Two key informants explained that due to macroeconomic instability in the Ghanaian economy, a number of organisations, especially in the telecommunications sector, were holding back their CSR initiatives: “[….] if they are giving excuses and cutting down on their CSR because of the economy, you can imagine what will happen in the future if they don’t make any profit. Now we are trying to make businesses understand how giving to community through CSR has direct implications for their work but it has not been easy’’ (Interviewed on 5 February 2016, Tamale). This statement was affirmed by the Sustainability Manager of a telecommunications company:“From the profit we’ve made, we give 1 % as CSR to do good in the communities. If we make a lot of money, the 1 % varies on a monthly basis. The primary issue for us as a business is to strive or survive. If we don’t survive, we cannot do CSR. We need to be comfortable to be able to give out CSR and contribute to the SDGs. But if we’re feeling the pinch, our CSR will suffer. Also, if we can’t make profit, how can we think of giving something out to a community’’ (Interviewed on 2 June 2016, Accra).   Interviewees further reported that the CSR initiatives of companies in the mining and telecommunications sectors were skewed towards specific projects including sponsoring entertainment shows, providing educational scholarships, the construction of health clinics, provision of alternative livelihood and environmental protection programmes. While the focus on, for example, educational scholarships had the potential to contribute to the attainment of quality education (SDG4), interviewees suggested that they still lacked access to certain social services. Moreover, they argued that there were more pressing needs to which corporate organisations could be satisfied by their direct CSR projects:“I am a native of this town. We live on the land of gold but our roads, water and places where we dispose waste have been in bad shape for many years. The youth in this community don’t have jobs. The only company in this community is the mine, yet they don’t employ the youth. We value the school they have built, but they can do more by helping us get good water as well as employing the youth in the mines’’ (Community Member, 9 July 2018, Bibiani Old Town).   In effect, it appears that CSR projects of the mining and telecommunications companies studied are directed towards their own interests as the following interviewee described:“You know, corporate organisations have an interest in promoting their business. That is why you see them promoting Miss Ghana, football or even entertainment shows. They want to be visible for their branding and marketing benefits. They determine where their investments and stuff like that should go purely for business purposes” (Interviewed on 26 October 2015, Tamale).   Another interviewee agrees: “the corporate organisations are interested in projects that are visible and can readily be painted with their colours and carry their flags because they are more interested in their corporate image than the actual social returns’’ (NGO staff, 17 February 2016, Wa). Yet, another interviewee indicated that in Ghana, business strategies of private sector actors were aimed at creating value for shareholders rather than society at large. Self-interest rather than a genuine commitment to promote national development and the advancement of the SDGs, therefore, served as the driving force behind engagement in CSR:“They want everybody to know because it adds to their corporate image[.....] For most telecommunications companies, visibility is key when they want to sponsor any programme. They want the media to be there and they want people to know what they do with their profit” (Interviewed on 21 March 2016, Accra).   Representatives of some foundations in the telecommunications sector concurred with the above statement:“It is not for corporate organisations to come and bring equality in the country because in the first place, we are here to do business. We are also accountable to our shareholders, so we can’t go into a community where we can’t break even” (Interviewed 17 June 2016, Accra).   The profit-orientated nature of the mining and telecommunications companies has meant thier CSR initiatives tend to focus on short-term projects with high visibility impact or based on economic expediency to increase their profits. Interviewees reported that the potential of CSR initiatives to support the delivery of the SDGs depended on the regulatory environment but the absence of this environment limits this potential:“There is an absence of a policy framework around CSR so there is no enabling environment [……] What needs to be done is for the government to come up with or create that enabling environment by introducing a regulatory framework for CSR activities’’ (Interviewed on 12 May 2016, Accra).    4.4 Rhetoric of partnership and sustainability of CSR initiatives Although partnership is expected to be placed centre-stage in the implementation of the SDGs, the competing interest among various stakeholders serves as a potential hindrance. In 2011, the Ghana National Policy on Public-Private Partnership was developed to foster stronger collaboration between the government and the private sector. Our data shows that what is missing in this partnership is accountability mechanisms to ensure that the partnership benefits society. In addition, there is a lack of coherency within and among private sector actors and other development stakeholders. Interviewees raised concerns about the lack of partnership and coordination among private sector actors in the implementation of CSR programmes: “CSR by mining and telecommunications companies in Ghana is usually undertaken in silos with limited stakeholder engagement’’ (Interviewed on 4 June 2016, Accra). The competitive nature of the Ghanaian business environment has meant that private sector organisations, particularly those in the telecommunications sector, undertake CSR initiatives to further their vested interest. A lack of multi-stakeholder engagements results in duplication of CSR initiatives. One CSR Manager of a telecommunications company espoused:“During the flood disaster in Accra in 20153  3 See https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2016/June-3rd/1st-anniversary-of-june-3-disaster-how-it-happened-lessons-learnt.php   , all the companies decided to support the relief effort but we were just going around doing the same thing by providing the same relief items. For example, MTN and Vodafone provided blankets, food, water and the like. So, we were going to provide the same support instead of us all coming together […] If there is proper coordination and engagement, we all join our resources and solve the problem once and for all. Now all the companies develop their own CSR activities without any coordination which is leading to duplication of effort’’ (Interviewed on 14 June 2016, Accra).   The heterogeneous approach to CSR by private sector organisations in Ghana creates potential difficulties for streamlining their operations towards national development and the advancement of the SDGs. It further engenders competition rather than collaboration in the delivery of CSR interventions. The representatives of telecommunications companies we interviewed expressed that competition in the market had compelled them to focus more on branding their CSR as seen below:“We invested in the community instead of doing publicity around our CSR interventions. We did that over a period of time but we soon realised that it wasn’t helping us because of competition from other companies. Telecom A was engaging in similar activities as ourselves in the health sector and they raised high awareness about theirs. People then started to question us and accused us of not doing anything” (Interviewee, 15 May 2016, Accra).   Another concern relates to the sustainability of CSR interventions. Interviewees reported that the short-term nature of CSR projects does not allow for the long-term development priorities of community members. A senior government official bemoaned:“Mostly, they [private organisations] are interested in a one-touch approach  to development. They just do something once and leave. So, I doubt whether a private sector organisation will be able to do long-term projects in communities. They only support one-touch activities and do not focus on long-term projects’’ (Interviewed on 26 April 2016, Accra).   Closely linked to sustainability is the issue of maintenance culture and ownership: once facilities are commissioned and handed over to beneficiary communities, “they still see it as our project’’ (Interviewed on 2 June 2016, Accra). Sustainability from the perspective of the telecommunications companies we included in our research is about win-win for companies and beneficiary communities. Our key informants, however, contested this view, arguing that many private enterprises including the telecommunications companies had failed to ensure long-term sustainability of CSR initiatives. The lack of in-built sustainability mechanisms in the delivery of CSR programmes may limit the potential of such initiatives to contribute to the delivery of the SDGs as stated by one interviewee:“So, the issue I see about the CSR approach to development is that the process is not sufficiently engaging which makes sustainability an issue. Projects are always sustainable when people feel and know that they control the project and they can only feel that when you take them through the whole process” (Interviewee, 29 April 2016, Wa).     5 Discussion This research began with a recognition of how policy discourses have lauded the potential of the private sector to contribute to the delivery of the SDGs via their CSR initiatives. Based on a qualitative case study of CSR initiatives of the mining and telecommunications companies in Ghana, we have demonstrated that the private sector holds some potential to contribute at some level to the attainment of a number of the SDGs. Our findings suggest that the provision of social infrastructure is significant for two main reasons. First, Ghana is currently faced with an infrastructure deficit estimated at GH¢ 30 billion (GhanaWeb, 2018 ). This gap stands to affect the achievement of SDGs 1 (No Poverty), 3 (Good Health and Well Being), 4 (Quality Education) and 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) (Ncube, 2013 ; Wethal, 2019 ). We argue that CSR interventions (e.g. provision of schools, hospitals and roads) of private sector actors not only help address this infrastructure gap but can also contribute to spurring economic growth and development. Second, the provision of social infrastructure by mining and telecommunications companies can provide access to social services by local communities (Amoako, 2017 ; Dartey-Baah, 2015). For example, the educational programmes including provision of scholarships and school facilities via CSR programmes in deprived rural communities are a means by which the poor could get access to formal education which can then boost human capital accumulation in Ghana. The overall outcome is the potential of such initiatives to contribute to the delivery of SDGs 1, 3, 4 and 9. The findings also draw attention to the creation of employment by the mining and telecommunications companies studied (see for example, Benshaul-Tolonen et al., 2019 ; Agyei-Okyere et al., 2019 ). What is so important about this finding is that there is a high unemployment rate among the ‘youth bulge’ in Ghana estimated currently to be around 12.1 % although this figure does not account for under-employment (Ghana Statistical Service, 2016 ). The ability of mining and telecommunications companies to employ local people directly contributes to advancing the realisation of SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). In the mining sector, CSR initiatives are known to be an important mechanism for providing community members with so-called ‘local employment’ (Andrews, 2019 ; Patnaik et al., 2018 ). As Hilson et al. (2019)  argue, many multinational mining companies in Africa have rebranded their CSR as local employment due to the increasing need for unskilled labour. However, while there is increasing emphasis on local content policies in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa, the employment related-CSR initiatives of the companies studied did not promote equitable or sustainable jobs for local inhabitants (Ablo, 2019 , 2015 ). Interviewees in the mining communities lamented how the mines often look to employ people from outside the community to the neglect of the locals owing to lack of employable skills of the local population. They averred that if the mining companies had any altruistic motive to promote local community development, they would have provided the needed training or skills to local people to help them become employed. This situation had resulted in tension between the community and the mining staff. This finding chimes with the work of previous researchers (see Patel et al., 2016 ; Garvin et al., 2009 ; Hilson and Yakovleva, 2007 ) when they report on conflict between local communities and mining companies as a result of perceived lack of economic opportunities by community members in mining areas in Ghana. In effect, despite the fact that the Mapping Mining Atlas recognises the potential of mining and other private sector actors to contribute to reducing poverty and inequality by facilitating equitable access to employment opportunities and enhancing the skills of community members (mainly youth), our findings point to a contradictory situation. Even more crucially, our findings point to a number of salient issues that limit the private sector to fully exploit its potential of contributing positively to the SDGs. First, there is a clear lack of lasting impact of CSR initiatives of mining and telecommunications companies. There is little, if any evidence do demonstrate how CSR initiatives of the mining and telecommunications companies studied have impacted on living conditions as envisaged by community beneficiaries. What is clear is that CSR initiatives reinforce and sustain inequality and injustice in terms of access to social infrastructure (see also Osei-Kojo and Andrews, 2018 ; Essah and Andrews, 2016 ; Andrews, 2016). The finding on the inability of community members to access the schools and clinics built by the mining companies resonates with the work of Manteaw (2007) which reports on the ways in which the CSR initiatives of the mine in Obuasi engendered segregated development between the enclaves occupied by its staff and the satellite villages of the local people. The issue of inequality associated with CSR initiatives of mining companies is equally well documented (Devenin and Bianchi, 2019 ; Andrews, 2019 ; Gilberthorpe and Banks, 2012 ). Second, CSR initiatives are mostly short-term in nature and are based largely on financial business models rather than long-term investment in communities. While the social and ecological reasons for undertaking CSR hold to some extent, unquestionably, there is a strong business dimension as to why the mining and telecommunications companies we studied engage in CSR. Our findings suggest that for most telecommunications and mining companies in Ghana, the crux of their existence is what Manteaw (2007) refers to as ‘the bottom line’ or profit, and for that matter, anything that will result in loss of profit must be vigorously combated. The underlying motivations for undertaking CSR are, therefore, to ‘gain or to extend legitimacy, to maintain level of current legitimacy, or to repair or to defend a lost or threatened legitimacy’ (Amoako, 2017 ; Amponsah and Dartey-Baah, 2015; O’Donovan, 2002 , p. 349). In fact, there are suggestions of ‘dead CSR’ policies being adopted by mining companies because they are being compelled to do so by the Ghana Chamber of Mines (Hilson et al., 2019 ). Efforts to achieve corporate legitimacy reflect ‘organizational myths, or words and actions that are decoupled from the operational code’ (Milne and Patten, 2002 , p. 375). CSR initiatives of the mining and telecommunications companies we studied are thus ‘an elaborate and convincing façade designed or adopted to conceal the backstage activities from prying eyes’ (Milne and Patten, 2002 , p. 375). In effect, while private sector CSR interventions offer opportunity for community members to have access to a range of social amenities, the business case for avoiding public criticisms, enhancing corporate image and economic accountability (profit), appears to be the priority (See also Mohammed et al., 2019 ; Dartey-Baah et al., 2015 ; Gilberthorpe and Banks, 2012 ). Third, the emphasis on profit rather than development also feeds into the sustainability challenges that confront most CSR initiatives. This arises in part as a result of a lack of stakeholder engagement and ownership. The inability of CSR initiatives to bring about the purported changes in the lives of beneficiaries, and hence contribute effectively towards the achievement of the SDGs, stems in part from their misplaced priorities and the lack of community involvement in project design and implementation. Our work corroborates that of Osei-Kojo and Andrews (2018)  who draw attention to what they call ‘dark forces’ (i.e. unsupported priorities, exclusion of communities in decision-making processes and varying expectations of community members) as factors that have mitigated against CSR initiatives living up to the expectation of promoting community development and sustainability of projects. Given that most corporate organisations tend to set their own rules for engaging with communities, they often lose touch with ground level realities in their beneficiary communities (Hilson, 2007 ). Osei-Kojo and Andrews (2018)  found that a marketplace constructed by Chirano Gold Mines was used as a public toilet due to lack of community consultation. However, in their analysis of social license by mining companies in Ghana, Ofori and Ofori (2019)  found high levels of community participation in the design and implementation of CSR social investments as part of CSR by Newmont in the Birim North District. Community participation in CSR projects is therefore a matter of context. Fourth, the problem of sustainability is linked to the voluntary nature of CSR and the absence of regulatory frameworks that could guide CSR processes. There is skewness and duplication of efforts and lack of coherency within and between private sector actors and development stakeholders (e.g. community members) in CSR design processes. While it is obvious that the strength and goals of private sector organisations are determined by the sectors in which to invest their CSR, the extent of skewness and duplication of activities suggests that interventions may not respond to the needs felt by local communities (Osei-Kojo and Andrews, 2018 ). These stand as impediments to the achievement of the SDGs in Ghana. In conclusion, the case of CSR initiatives of mining and telecommunications companies highlights some important lessons for those who are keen to maximise the potential of CSR initiatives of the private sector to advance the attainment of SDGs. First, this case shows that a collective consultative approach is critical to achieving long-term community development, but the extent to which corporate organisations engage in stakeholder consultations during project design and implementation remains limited. In this regard, transforming CSR initiatives require private sector organisations and actors to engage in a process of reversal in what Chambers (1983)  calls ‘putting the last first’ and ‘putting the first last’. Chambers (1997)  suggests that this process must start with the question ‘Whose reality counts?’. In the context of CSR, it is perhaps fair to say that all realities count, those of community beneficiaries, as well as company regulations and concerns. In other words, the business imperatives of private companies are as important as the wellbeing and continuous survival of local communities. Realising this normative goal of win-win situation calls for critical corporate self-evaluation, a process that considers the existing and the development of new relations between social shareholders (society) and corporate shareholders. Finally, multi-stakeholder engagement that establishes a true partnership between corporate organisations, community members, CSOs and government officials in the design and implementation of CSR projects is critical for advancing the SDGs. We argue that until and unless these issues are addressed, the potential of the private sector to fully exploit its contribution to advancing the attainment of the SDGs, particularly via CSR initiatives, will be limited.
