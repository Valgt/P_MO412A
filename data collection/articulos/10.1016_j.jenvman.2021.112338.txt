                  Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 of the Agenda 2030 is addressed to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. Further, one of the major principles underlying the Lisbon Charter is that sustainable and safe management of wastewaters are fundamental to the health of communities and their sustainable socio-economic development. Within this framework, the management of sewage sludge in a sustainable manner is one of the critical issues facing modern society, due to the growing rise of its production, increasing difficulties in properly locating treatment and disposal works, and complying with more stringent environmental quality requirements, thus requiring a re-thinking of its management. This paper discusses major concepts and principles for re-thinking the sludge management in order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.

Keywords Circular economy  Management  Regulation  Sludge  Sustainability  Standardization    1 Introduction Due to poor infrastructure and weak economic conditions, every year millions of people die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 6.2 of the Agenda 2030 is addressed to “achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, and to end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations ”. Within this context, a safe management of wastewaters is fundamental to the health of communities and to their sustainable socio-economic development. Sludge is the unavoidable waste product of any water/wastewater treatment and, although accounts for about 1–2% only of the treated wastewater, contains most of the original pollution. In the EU, where total population is of about 500 million people, sludge production amounts to more than 13 Mt/year, and shows an average generation rate of about 58.9 g/capita/d, ranging 19.9 in Greece thru 107.6 in Portugal. These differences can be explained in terms of water availability, population served, and level of treatment applied. Typical sludge quantities and concentrations of solids and nutrients are shown in Table 1  , being 2 L/cap/d at 4% solids concentration the typical production of primary + activated sludge from municipal plants (Canziani and Spinosa, 2019 ). This paper presents a new approach towards sludge management re-thinking by depcting it as an ancient Temple (Fig. 1  ) which includes (i) Base (Underlying principles), (ii) Columns (Supporting actions), (iii) Roof (Overarching concepts) and (iv) Staircase (Accessing steps).  2 Underlying principles (Base) The underlying principles can be represented by a dualistic interpretation of opposite terms which reflect the technological, economic and social contexts where/when sludge management takes place. These pairs of terms are “locomotive/last wagon ”, “problem/solution ”, “past/future ” and “disposal/recovery ”, and represent a historic approach towards re-thinking sludge management. 2.1 Locomotive/last wagon In traditional approaches sludge generally plays a minor role within the planning context of water and wastewater management systems since it is at the very end of the water cycle, in other words, the “last wagon ” of the train. However, selecting the most appropriate treatment chain to be adopted for any wastewater treatment plant is strongly driven by the final sludge reuse/disposal option(s) available and consistent with the specific local situation (Spinosa et al., 2017 ). For example, treating sludge to provide for its reuse in agriculture where enough agricultural land for spreading sludge is not available is certainly inappropriate. Therefore, while changing the perspective towards a more sustainable economy, sludge management should be considered as the “locomotive ” of the water/wastewater cycle.  2.2 Problem/solution Sludge management is mostly considered to be a “problem ” originated by the growing availability of household running water which induces the production of more sludge as a result of construction of more sewers and wastewater treatment plants (Spinosa, 2012 ). According to Rockfeller (1996) , this means that sewerage should be avoided because “the key to preventing the trouble caused by this homogenized mass of mixed matter is separation at the source ”, e.g. waterless composting toilets and other localized processes. This thesis is highly questionable considering that, apart from the rural environment where the treatment of human wastes without conveyance in a flow of water might have sense, wastewater collection and its treatment are necessary and constitute one of the greatest engineering and public health accomplishments. Therefore, it should be recognized that adequate sludge management is the final necessary step for the “solution ” to the “problem ” of water scarcity.  2.3 Past/future Solutions adopted in the “past ” have been mostly addressed towards sludge disposal, while in a more sustainable vision need to be modified for the “future ” by addressing them towards reuse. Further, the concepts of “past ” and “future ” correlates not only with “time units ” (i.e. when), but also with “spatial units ” (i.e. “where”), the latter illustrating that some countries lag behind in terms of technological and infrastructural development and vice-versa (Spinosa, 2013 ).  2.4 Disposal/recovery As told, the objective of developing sustainable strategies requires a shift in sludge management from solutions aimed at “disposing of ” sludge to those oriented towards “maximizing recycle or recovery benefits ”. As a matter of fact, developed communities may more easily introduce specific requirements for utilizing sludge on land or recovering energy through thermal processes, whilst in developing countries sludge is often simply disposed of at the source, thus posing serious risks for human and aquatic health.   3 Supporting actions (Columns) To support an effective re-thought sludge management within the water cycle, following actions must be performed. 3.1 Reduction of production Reduction of production is a pillar for the development of more sustainable sludge management systems. However, the goal is not pushing sludge production towards an “absolute minimum ” but, instead, making sludge production “compatible ” with its final destination/outlet and the best overall energy/material balance. Strategies for reducing sludge mass/volume include (i) reduction in the wastewater treatment stage through appropriate technologies and operating procedures, and (ii) reduction in the sludge stage, the former option being more easily applicable to existing plants to be upgraded. Reduction methods in the wastewater treatment stage range from approaches based on cellular lysis to those based on increasing sludge age, ozonation and using membrane technology, etc., while options applicable in the sludge stage range from methods specifically reducing sludge volumes by removing water, e.g. thickening, dewatering and drying, to the so-called final treatments, e.g. incineration, gasification, pyrolysis and many other combined processes.  3.2 Improvement of quality The improvement of quality has the purpose to reduce nuisances, health risks and handling costs. Apart from limitation at the source of harmful substances entering the wastewater treatment plant, anaerobic and aerobic processes are widely adopted to stabilize sludge and improve its quality. Anaerobic digestion reduces organic content of sludge and produces biogas which can be used for energy purposes. This process is quite sensitive to environmental conditions, so increasing attention has been paid to pre-treatments able to enhance digestion performance. In particular, the disintegration process (by mechanical, thermo-chemical and biological means) of microbial cells facilitates the hydrolysis step, which is the rate limiting step in digestion, thus increasing the digestion rate. Other improvements include increased loading of anaerobic reactors, efficient mixing technologies, efficient heat recovery by heat exchangers and technologies for biogas upgrading. Aerobic stabilization at ambient temperature is an easy to be operated, but energy-consuming, process which doesn't always provide sufficient stabilization, so it is often applied at smaller plants. Developments include thermophilic conditions, and a primary auto thermal thermophilic aerobic digestion followed by an anaerobic mesophilic digestion (Spinosa, 2012 ). Field of research for sludge quality improvement encompasses estrogenic compounds, enzyme treatment, molecular methods for microbial populations in sludge (Dentel, 2009 ).  3.3 Recovery maximization The adoption of technologies to “maximize recovery ” of useful materials and/or energy is another major pillar. Regarding the material recovery, direct utilization in agriculture is likely to remain the major option, especially for sludge less contaminated by toxic compounds. Composting could become a preferred option for agricultural use because it produces a material that can be easily stored, transported and utilized. The nutrient content of sludge is of high value. Phosphorus, which is a limited resource in nature, can be recovered through anaerobic digestion or from incinerated ash, while nitrogen can be recovered mostly from sludge treatment reject waters. Other material recoveries include production of (i) organic matter, (ii) carbon source, coagulant, adsorbents, (iii) bricks, pumice, slag, artificial lightweight aggregate, ceramsite, and (iv) Portland cement. Available options for energy recovery range from anaerobic digestion to thermal processing, the latter having the advantage to also involve the reduction of volume and destruction of toxic organic compounds. Technologies, such as pyrolysis, gasification, or HTC (Hydrothermal Carbonization) can produce usable/storable fuels to generate energy and biochar, but there are still some uncertainties about their performance and costs. The use of Microbial Fuel Cell for direct conversion of sludge to electricity has been reported by Dentel (2013) .  3.4 System optimization Another important issue is related to the “optimization ” of a system including several processes or operations because a sequence of individually optimized units does not necessarily imply a system “optimized as a whole ”. As a matter of fact, once the target of optimization has been identified (e.g. energy consumption, installation costs, etc.), optimizing the generic “i ” process of the system sequence will determine optimized values which will enter the next “i+1 ” process whose optimized values will be the optimal for the “i+1 ” process itself, but not necessarily the optimal one for both processes together, and so on. For example, a dewatering operation individually optimized to obtain the maximum solids concentration at minimum cost might not be compatible with equipment to be used if sludge has to be spread in agriculture due to a poor flowing aptitude. The optimization of a system must also consider the transportation steps and the possible installation of centralized plants with their advantages and drawbacks. Numerous methods and algorithms are available for calculating the minimum or maximum of the objective function and all these methods are generally developed within an iterative process.  3.5 Regulation/implementation The development of “realistic and enforceable rules and regulation ” is crucial because an optimal and environmentally safe sludge management can only be achieved through objective, transparent, and legally conducted operations (Spinosa and Vignoles, 2012 ). Within this framework, regulation, including clear rules for penalties and sanctions, needs to be adapted to the local context, and issued to avoid imposition of (i) “generic ” and not numerically quantified limits, which may have general applicability but are difficult to be widely applied and prosecuted, and/or (ii) “unjustified ” although numerically quantified limits, which could become dangerous in certain situations. It has also to be considered that regulatory institutions (i) cover a range of scales from national to regional and/or local ones, and (ii) comprise different sectors of law, such as those related to water, health, agriculture, planning and building (Johannssen and Kvalström, 2005 ). Further, while updating/re-designing regulation in the context of circular economy, several aspects should be considered, such as (i) bridging the gap of compliance with existing legislation and regulations, (ii) providing capacity and resources to ensure implementation at the local/municipal level, (iii) enforcing and following up on existing legislation and strengthen the political will to do so, (iv) updating legislation and harmonize legislation relevant to sludge management, (v) changing perception about waste, and (vi) putting society's interest above political interest by accordingly setting the rules of the game.   4 Overarching concepts (Roof) Overarching concepts which frame sludge management re-thinking include the (i) Law of thermodynamics, (ii) Sustainability concept and (iii) Circular Economy concept. 4.1 Law of thermodynamics All human-operated transformations are “not perfect or fully reversible ” and are subject to the 3 Laws of thermodynamics. It follows that:• Energy  is invariably conserved, but assumes different forms some of which cannot be conveniently recovered, so energy/material losses are always occurring (1 st Law ).  • Entropy , which is a measure of the disorder in an isolated system, constantly increases, thus meaning that a worse state than before is involved (2 nd Law ).  • Absolute zero  value is impossible to be reached by finite processes, so that perpetual motion, i.e. infinite recycling, is impossible (3 rd Law ).     4.2 Sustainability concept In compliance with the environmental sustainability concept, sludge management systems with a lower impact on the environment must be at the same time “environmentally bearable ”, “economically convenient ”, and “socially acceptable ”. An unsustainable situation occurs when the total sum of natural resources is used up faster than it can be naturally replenished, in contrast to a sustainable situation where consumption of renewable resources does not exceed nature's ability for replenishment. Within a re-thinking vision, the sustainability concept must be seen from a “relative, not absolute ” point of view, because it depends on the boundaries of the system which must include all the processes and operations composing the system, as a whole, and not only as a part of it. It has also to be considered that a sustainable system should have alternative reuse/disposal options to be, in case, adapted to tackle any market variability or local situation change (Spinosa, 2012 ).  4.3 Circular economy The term “circular economy ” defines an economic system designed to regenerate itself. This conceptual definition is often, and erroneously, represented by a fully closed circle without considering that each cycle is inevitably characterized by a “loss ”, i.e. a waste, that needs to be replaced by a “new resource ” (Fig. 2  ). Therefore, the challenge is to reduce the amount of losses, and consequently the need of new resources, thus re-establishing quantitatively, and not merely qualitatively, the overall “mass/energy balance ”, also considering that the dynamics of recycle flows are substantially different from those of acquiring new resources and/or producing new waste.   5 Accessing steps (staircase) Similarly to an ancient Temple which is elevated on a podium and needs a staircase to be accessed, several “institutional and governance ” steps/items, which are often considered of secondary importance with respect to the strictly technical ones, have to be recognized and taken into account to reach an effective re-thinking. 5.1 Access barriers In order to comply with the goals of SDGs to gain access to water and wastewater systems for everybody, it needs to be considered that certain factors can act as major barriers. Exogenous factors are mainly related to the economic access to public systems, and include water poverty, socially disadvantaged groups or low-income households, while endogenous aspects derive from cultural immanent factors, such as taboos towards handling and re-using of human waste. Understanding how behaviors evolve within societies, and their influence on endogenous barriers, will help to find the appropriate solution. Further, appropriate “pricing mechanisms ” can help to diminish barriers, being able to act as (i) a fine-tuning instrument related to social aspects, and (ii) a revenue raising instrument to cover operation and maintenance costs and ensure long-term investments. Pricing should be configured according to the “polluter pays ” principle and correlated to the quality of the services. Prices could discourage low-level households to enter a water system, so an increasing block tariff structured in a low initial rate up to a specified volume of use (typically estimated at 25–50 l/cap/d) followed by one or several increasingly higher rates for additional uses could be appropriate. However, this could result in higher marginal prices to the customer and, thus, higher average prices for higher-income households. The idea is addressed to discourage extravagant water use and promote water conservation, but this system could result in adverse effects because (i) not every household owns a water meter, (ii) in highly dense populated areas (e.g. slums) many households share one water meter, and (iii) many households are dependent on water vendors (Whittington, 1992 ).  5.2 Institutional dynamics Setting up an institutional system that is capable of promoting sustainability and circular economy fundamentally develops along three lines: (a) legal norms, (b) social embeddedness of rules and (c) the political process (Moreau et al., 2017 ). Legal norms are basically the “rules of the game ” or, in other words, the institutional setting. Social embeddedness implies that the institutional conditions need to be accepted by the people in terms of social and cultural values and norms, while the political process can be described as the “game of the rules ” (Moreau et al., 2017 ; Boelens, 2008 ). However, institutions are also subject to change, and this can be described in several ways:• Path dependency : historical-cultural traditions and policy legacies build a path and influence present actions, thus making it quite difficult setting up a system that opts for circular economy (Sehring, 2009 ).  • Institutional bricolage : … patch[es] together […] institutional arrangements from the cultural resources available to people in response to changing conditions (Cleaver and Franks, 2005 ).  • Institutional syncretism : it occurs when old and new, traditional and modern, informal and formal elements are interwoven in a creative process, thus forming a completely new type of institution (Galvan, 2007 ; Sehring, 2009 ).    And here may lay the answer towards a solution-based approach for a new sludge management: to continue old institutions under new conditions while acknowledging endogenous (embedded social norms, morality, values, etc.) and exogenous (costs, poverty etc.) access barriers.  5.3 Implementation The failure of implementation of laws and their enforcement is a major challenge (Schreiner, 2013 ). To understand why this happens, the concept of “legal-pluralism “ proposes useful insights. Legal practices and norms are not monolithic entities, but are in fact multi-layered and subject to negotiation and enforcement. It is characterized by the co-existence of rules of different origin and legitimation, also resulting as an historical legacy, thus leading to an overlap of legal spheres of local customary, religious, national and even international laws and principles derived from global water policy concepts (Meinzen-Dick and Pradhan, 2002 ). While old rules are still formally accepted, but not applied in practice, viceversa  it can be difficult to establish new rules and gain their social acceptance, since people stick to their conventional ways, e.g. out of habit. Further, legal pluralism includes the distinction between “categorical ”, i.e. official, and “concretized ”, i.e. effective, rights. The categorical right is embodied in the legal status, while the concretized right is embodied in a social relationship between actual people.  5.4 Site-specific circumstances According to Tilley et al. (2014) , a sanitation system is a context-specific series of technologies and services for the management of these wastes (or resources) for their collection, containment, transport, transformation, utilization or disposal. This requires different approaches and involves different solutions subject to (i) influences tied to local economic, political, and cultural priorities, (ii) availability of technologies some of which are expensive and, therefore, only available to a few, (iii) consideration of site specific circumstances, such as climate, soil quality, level of groundwater tables, cultural aspects, space for on-plot systems and possibilities to link on-site systems to higher level city-wide sanitation systems, etc., (iv) distinction between rural, peri-urban and urban areas, formal and informal settlements, i.e. slums.  5.5 Standardization The development of “standardized characterization methods ” is a necessary support to the development of regulation, since well-defined procedures allow legal requirements to be fulfilled in a correct and uniform manner, thus building stakeholder and public confidence. As a matter of fact, fundamentals of characterization methods are well known, but each laboratory may utilize different equipment and accessories, often without any statistical analysis of results in terms of reproducibility and repeatability, so results cannot be reliably compared because obtained under different circumstances and conditions. Therefore, standardization of characterization methods would allow chemical, biological and physical properties of sludge to be correctly evaluated, and its behavior predicted. To this end, CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) have respectively established the Technical Committees CEN/TC308 and ISO/TC275 specifically devoted to the development of standardized characterization and procedures for sludge management.   6 Conclusions As per an underlying principle, sludge should be considered the “locomotive ”, and not the “last wagon ”, of the wastewater cycle, in order to (i) allow an effective sustainable sludge management within the context of a circular economy, and (ii) ensure maximization of sludge value. In this paper it has been shown that “re-thinkingd ” sludge management systems require:• assessing management paths capable of maximizing the recycle/recovery benefits;  • using technically, ecologically and economically feasible methods to reduce sludge quantity at the appropriate level, and not necessarily to the minimum one;  • limiting at the source of harmful substances entering the plant;  • adopting multiple options for sludge destination able to be adapted to local market variabilities;  • developing realistic and enforceable regulation adapted to the local context, including clear rules for penalties and sanctions, supported by standardized characterization procedures and guidelines for good management practices involving citizens and stakeholders in an on-going open dialogue based on mutual trust and respect;  • defining the treatment(s) necessary to optimize the entire system through the development of self-sustaining energy systems, or systems with a low energy environmental impact;  • developing operational systems appropriate to local and site-specific circumstances.
