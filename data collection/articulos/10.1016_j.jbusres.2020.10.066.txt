                  The momentum has been building toward the realisation of the United Nations Development Programme's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this regard, technological upgrading through the adoption of innovative technologies, as in big data analytics (BDA), can be seen as a key enabler of helping to address societal challenges. While there is some evidence for realising value created from BDA adoption, organisational issues associated with societal challenges, specifically those targeting the SDGs, are yet to be appreciated. This study utilises a technology–organisation–environment framework to examine the role of top management support in facilitating value creation from BDA adoption for the realisation SDGs. Based on a survey of 320 UK managers, this study found that the technological driver of BDA coupled with top management support, can significantly help in the adoption process. Therefore, crafting the value needed for effectively supporting the realisation of these goals.

Goal Examples of Empirical Mapping of BDA Adoption for Deriving Value Creation Across the SDGs   No Poverty Jotzo (2013) and Njuguna and McSharry (2017)  emphasised how support from senior management (including government through maintaining regulatory support), and ensuring organisational readiness to support various initiatives, including production sustainability of energy, food security, and water security to help to eliminate poverty.  Zero Hunger Protopop and Shanoyan (2016)  reported how top management support (financial), organisational readiness, and capabilities for BDA play a significant role in agricultural productivity and supply chain efficiency. At the same time, the study acknowledged the complexity of utilising BDA toward achieving the goal by doubling food supplies by 2050.  Good Health and Well-being Reid et al. (2019) and Wang, Kung, and Byrd (2018)  explained how BDA could help to improve the efficiency of various programmes, obtain continuous health updates, and determine physical activities to identify future health-related patterns. As such, they emphasised the role of the government in providing the relevant policies and support. They also acknowledged technical complexity.  Quality Education Kurkovsky (2019)  acknowledged how institutions need to provide the necessary support for BDA adoption to aid understanding of issues associated with students' performance, retention, dynamic curriculum development, and enhancement. At the same time, this would be a complicated task.  Gender Equality MacFeely (2019)  verified the need for providing BDA infrastructure and acknowledged the need for government policies and regulations to help with timeliness and addressing policy needs, especially for complex issues, such as gender inequality, gender pay gap, and career development and progression.  Clean Water and Sanitation Webster (2018)  acknowledged the need for supporting BDA diffusion by providing the required resources and infrastructure driven by the organisation's support. This would provide useful insights for making informed decisions and building a more sustainable approach to water management and consumption.  Affordable and Clean Energy Korkovelos, Khavari, Sahlberg, Howells, and Arderne (2019)  revealed how providing the required organisational support, BDA relevant resources would achieve universal electricity access. Furthermore, policies driven by governments were required to understand the national priorities and sequencing energy and grid extension efforts accordingly.  Decent Work and Economic Growth Di Bella, Leporatti, and Maggino (2018)  argued that, with BDA and other innovative technologies, there would be an increased level of external competition, with personalisation driving demand for capturing relevant policy and regulatory requirements. Hence, realising the business value proposition of BDA would support organisations' economic growth.  Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure Denoncourt (2020)  discussed how it is necessary to enact relevant government policies and legislation to provide an umbrella for the intellectual property ecosystem in the context of BDA adoption (in the context of logistics and supply chain activities).  Reduced Inequality Malhotra et al. (2018)  identified the need for clear realisation of BDA value and organisational support through infrastructure and resources. This could result in identifying patterns associated with equality sensitive issues, including gender, religious, and various forms of cultural discrimination.  Sustainable Cities and Communities Corbett and Mellouli (2017)  argued there was a need for BDA infrastructure utilised by top management to build sustainable cities and communities. This includes congestion, smart parking, and better urban space management and development.  Responsible Consumption & Production Secundo, Ndou, Del Vecchio, and De Pascale (2020)  indicated that BDA resources/infrastructure guided by top management support was necessary to achieve this goal. As such, BDA technologies could help with monitoring the consumption of environmentally friendly products and raise awareness of their benefits among consumers.  Climate Action Malhotra et al. (2018)  verified how BDA could help to track deforestation by combining satellite imagery and crowdsourced witness accounts. Therefore, a clear realisation of BDA value was needed by maintaining organisational support to provide infrastructure and resources.  Life Below Water Malhotra et al., 2018  discussed the need to maintain a clear understanding of BDA benefits by enabling the tracking of data on maritime vessels to disclose illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing activities. Nonetheless, this would require strong organisational support by providing infrastructure and resources.  Life on Land Malhotra et al. (2018)  explained how a clear realisation of the benefits and organisational support through providing the infrastructure and resources is required. Hence, opportunities could then materialise to support NGOs involved in incidents associated with the humanitarian crisis, including obtaining real-time information about the geolocation of victims/survivors.  Peace and Justice Strong Institutions Malhotra et al. (2018)  argued that governments must appreciate related policies and regulatory procedures, through the availability of infrastructure and resources, to help with utilising various online platforms to capture public opinion (social media sentiment analysis) activities.  Partnerships to Achieve the Goal Malhotra et al. (2018)  proposed the need for top government support to facilitate collaborations and partnerships among business, academia, and civil society to allow the convergence of statistics, mobile, and internet data to improve and better understand the hyper-connected world of today.

In this regard, technological upgrading through the adoption of innovative technologies, as in big data analytics (BDA), can be seen as a key enabler of helping to address societal challenges. While there is some evidence for realising value created from BDA adoption, organisational issues associated with societal challenges, specifically those targeting the SDGs, are yet to be appreciated. This study utilises a technology–organisation–environment framework to examine the role of top management support in facilitating value creation from BDA adoption for the realisation SDGs. Based on a survey of 320 UK managers, this study found that the technological driver of BDA coupled with top management support, can significantly help in the adoption process. Therefore, crafting the value needed for effectively supporting the realisation of these goals.   Keywords Big data analytics  Technology–organisation–environment (TOE)  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Adoption    1 Introduction As part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), organisations, as a critical stakeholder in society, are often expected to play a significant role in achieving all identified goals (MacFeely, 2019; United Nations, 2015 ). Organisations are expected to utilise efficient innovative technologies for sufficient productivity levels in their ecosystems. As a result, they have recognised the value of technological upgrading to accomplish societal sustainability and development (Côrte-Real, Ruivo, Oliveira, & Popovič, 2019; Yoo & Kim, 2017 ). In this context, big data analytics (BDA) solutions offer organisations an opportunity to sustain their growth and contribute to various SDGs within their respective settings (Merendino et al., 2018 ). As such, BDA has emerged as a driver for organisations to offer innovative and intelligent services, and at the same time maintain sophisticated predictive capabilities (Xu, Frankwick, & Ramirez, 2016; Yoo & Kim, 2017 ). These capabilities present organisations with the opportunity to develop better-informed business decisions, improve overall firm performance, and help to realise various SDGs. While there have been some success stories for BDA adoption, a large number of organisations have yet to explore the value of big data, their organisational readiness, and the technological capabilities required for such investment. Hence, examining the mechanisms and related dynamics of organisations' BDA adoption is essential and requires further research. Interestingly, there is an extensive body of literature on BDA adoption; however, most works have focused on the individual and behavioural levels (Davis, 1989; Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, & Davis, 2003 ). There has been limited research offering perspectives at the organisational level. Furthermore, studies that have attempted to explore the intention to adopt BDA have not considered value creation through the adoption of innovative technology within organisations (Côrte-Real et al., 2019; Yoo & Kim, 2017 ). In this regard, many of these studies have been driven by marketing with limited focus on operations and predictions aligned with the various SDGs (Erevelles, Fukawa, & Swayne, 2016; Xu et al., 2016 ). Therefore, this study attempts to answer the following questions. (1) Can the use of BDA by organisations help to create value and foster their contributions toward SDGs? (2) How does support from top management within firms facilitate the adoption of BDA for realising SDGs? To answer these research questions, this study first reviews the literature in Section 2  to obtain insights into value creation achieved from BDA. The review carefully examines the societal benefits of BDA and organisational dynamics associated with its adoption; this helps to obtain a theoretical perspective of BDA as an innovative technological upgrading solution with targeted value creation across the identified SDGs. The proposed research model follows this perspective by utilising a technology–organisation–environment (TOE) framework. The study then develops research hypotheses to test the model, as presented in Section 3 . Section 4  presents the methodological approach utilised in the study. Section 5  presents the empirical findings captured in this study. Section 6  discusses the findings of the study and offers insights into how the successful adoption of BDA can help to create context-based value for each SDG. Finally, Section 7  concludes and provides implications, especially for practice.  2 Compiling the SDGs with big data analytics The advancement of a plethora of innovative digital technologies has undoubtedly presented opportunities for compiling new and useful informed knowledge for creating business value. In the context of SDGs, organisations have started to foresee opportunities to utilise BDA as a mechanism to support the compiling of related indicators to improve the performance ecosystem. While the implications of BDA for the SDG indicators are yet to be clarified, predicting a host of new ways to measure and understand human conditions and development progress offers a real opportunity (MacFeely, 2019 ). Fukuda‐Parr & McNeill (2019)  pointed out how organisations need to adopt careful development strategies in order to harness the potential of BDA for the realisation of the SDGs. As a result, many organisations have realised that they can make substantial organisational benefits and simultaneously contribute to society. The use of BDA has the potential to help organisations to realise opportunities in support of sustainable development, while at the same time targeting growth through a series of advantages in various business activities, including supply chain activities (Chen, Preston, & Swink, 2015 ). In this regard, BDA advances the potential to compile datasets that are linkable and offers vast possibilities for undertaking dynamic analyses that could aid understanding of interconnections and offer more policy-relevant and outcome-based evidence (MacFeely, 2019 ). For SDGs, organisations can realise the opportunities of leveraging BDA technologies and associated applications in support of their achievements in meeting targeted goals for their ecosystems (Avtar, Aggarwal, Kharrazi, Kumar, & Kurniawan, 2020 ). As a result, organisations can benefit from utilising BDA through better-informed decisions and real-time insights to take the necessary steps for improvement (MacFeely, 2019, Malhotra, Anand, & Singh, 2018 ).  3 Theoretical development and hypotheses Previous studies have highlighted how organisational innovative resources and capabilities depend on the unique characteristic needs of businesses (Chen et al., 2015; Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; El-Haddadeh, 2020 ). From an SDG viewpoint, realising environmental, economic, and operational performance through the exploitation of BDA could help to foster sustainable business performance (Raut et al., 2019 ). This could result in support for the specific organisational decision-making process required to achieve an SDG and create business value. The TOE framework (Tornatzky & Fleischer, 1990 ) could help to realise the organisational value of BDA use in the context of the SDGs. As such, the TOE framework could expand knowledge of various context-specific factors that affect the adoption and implementation process of innovative technologies across technological, organisational, and environmental levels. Tornatzky and Fleischer (1990)  TOE framework is one of the most extensively used and well-established works to research new innovative technology related to organisational adoption. TOE has demonstrated itself to be an established and apt framework for the adoption of various context-specific innovative technologies in an organisational setting (El-Haddadeh, 2020; Chen et al., 2015 ). Moreover, previous works have validated the TOE framework in the context of BDA in other settings, including supply chain and logistics (Chen et al., 2015; Lai, Sun, & Ren, 2018 ). An apparent shortcoming of the TOE framework is that it is limited in utilising specific measurers; however, the present research does not follow the direct impact of adoption. Instead, it acknowledges the role of top management support in facilitating the adoption process from the SDG value creation perspective. Furthermore, this study goes beyond the adoption process by attempting to understand how it can influence the value creation for SDGs. By doing so, this study ensures that the mechanistic process of TOE framework exploitation is eliminated (Chen et al., 2015; Lai et al., 2018 ). Hence, this study adopts the TOE framework as a theoretical lens to understand the factors that influence the organisational adoption of BDA, specifically in realising value creation for SDGs. Thus, the value creation dimension is utilised to examine associated facilitators. Moreover, this study extends the existing literature by examining how TOE dimensions influence top management support, which results in influencing the BDA adoption process, specifically its association with value creation for SDGs. 3.1 Perceived benefits Many studies have argued that the perceived benefits of an innovation are positively related to the rate of adoption. Lin (2014)  claimed that new innovative technologies, such as BDA, would help organisations to realise perceived benefits, and make them more likely to adopt. Lai et al. (2018)  found a significant positive relationship between the perceived benefits of BDA and the intention to adopt it. Using the TOE framework, Maduku, Mpinganjira, and Duh (2016)  identified a strong relationship between perceived benefits and the intention to adopt new technological innovations. Chen et al. (2015)  suggested that if managers believe the use of BDA to be highly beneficial, then they should be more likely to determine how their organisation could leverage these benefits by using BDA to serve business needs. Thus, this study hypothesises:• H1: Perceived benefits have a significant positive effect on the intention to adopt BDA.     3.2 Technological complexity Technological complexity refers to the extent to which BDA technology is considered challenging to understand and used for the organisation (Lai et al., 2018 ). In this regard, Baig, Shuib, and Yadegaridehkordi (2019)  argued how the complexity of BDA could play a significant role in alienating many businesses from proceeding with the adoption process. Therefore, it could impede organisations from adopting BDA by through such challenges as incompatibility and interoperability with existing data-processing structures (Akter, Wamba, Gunasekaran, Dubey, & Childe, 2016; Wamba et al., 2017; Wang & Hajli, 2017 ). From this viewpoint, this study argues that if an organisation views the adoption of BDA as complex and incompatible with existing IT system and infrastructure work practices, it would be less likely to use and adopt BDA than if it did not hold this view. Specifically, this study posits:• H2: Technological complexity has a significant negative effect on the intention to adopt BDA.     3.3 Organisational readiness Organisational readiness is defined as the availability of the necessary organisational engagement and communication strategies for facilitating BDA (Chen et al., 2015 ). Strategic readiness offers the knowledge that communicates a plan of action and helps top management to form guidelines for adopting BDA (Lokuge et al., 2019 ). Organisational readiness is a critical factor forming top management's attitude toward extensive organisational use of BDA. Furthermore, top management could be supportive of the diffusion of BDA when they regard the firm's strategic goals to be clear and well communicated (Chen et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, organisational readiness has been viewed as critical for effective IT utilisation and moderates the relationship between top management support and BDA adoption (Popovič, Hackney, Tassabehji, & Castelli, 2018 ). Therefore, this study argues that, if an organisation views the adoption of BDA as compatible with existing organisational strategies, it would be more likely that top management would support the adoption of BDA. The following hypothesis is proposed.• H3: Organisation resource readiness has a significant positive effect on top management support for BDA adoption.     3.4 IT infrastructure capabilities IT infrastructure capabilities can be defined as both tangible and intangible resources such as hardware, software, human resources, skills, and experience that an organisation acquires for implementing BDA (Lai et al., 2018 ). Previous studies have argued that a firm with well-developed IT infrastructure capabilities (hardware, software, and expertise) could influence the adoption process of BDA (Lai et al., 2018; Maduku et al., 2016 ). Chen et al. (2015)  suggested that if organisational decision-makers viewed the adoption of BDA as compatible with existing organisational IT infrastructure, they would be more likely to adopt BDA. Kamal (2006)  indicated that the higher the levels of IT infrastructure capabilities a firm possesses, the more likely it would be to adopt new innovative technology, such as BDA. Thus, this study postulates:• H4: IT Infrastructure capabilities have a significant positive effect on top management support for BDA adoption.     3.5 Government policy Government policy refers to the support and guidance that top management in an organisation would receive from the government to develop and adopt new technology, such as BDA (Hsu, Ray, & Li-Hsieh, 2014 ). Supportive governmental policies encourage top management in an organisation to adopt new information technology, such as BDA. The extent to which government policies support the top management in terms of offering technical support, training and funding for BDA would have a significant influence on the adoption process of BDA (Lai et al., 2018 ). Governments' policies could directly inspire the top management of organisations to develop new innovative technologies, such as BDA (Ahani, Rahim, & Nilashi, 2017 ). Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed.• H5: Government policy has a significant positive effect on top management support for BDA adoption.     3.6 Competitive pressure Competitive pressure refers to effects from the external environment that influence the organisation's adoption of BDA. It has been argued that as market competition increases, organisations seek to gain competitive advantage through innovation, such as BDA. Liang, Saraf, Hu, and Xue (2007)  suggested that environmental pressures could positively affect the degree of top management support. The authors argued that higher levels of environmental pressures lead to stronger top management beliefs about the benefits of new technologies. Furthermore, to be more efficient and effective than the firm's competitors, top management would continuously be under pressure to innovate new technologies to gain a competitive advantage. Thus, this study posits:   4 H6: Competitive pressure has a significant positive effect on top management support for BDA adoption. 4.1 Top management support Top management support explains the extent to which top management understands the importance of innovation and the extent to which it is involved in new innovative activities, such as BDA (Ragu-Nathan, Apigian, Ragu-Nathan, & Tu, 2004 ). Baig et al. (2019)  examined the theoretical models of BDA adoption and found that management support has a significant influence on BDA adoption. Furthermore, based on the TOE framework, Park and Kim (2019)  verified how management support could be pivotal for BDA adoption success. Top management could support the implementation process of innovation and hence, would have a significant positive effect on the adoption of BDA (Wang, Gunasekaran, Ngai, & Papadopoulos, 2016 ). Support from top management contributes significantly toward building an environment that provides sufficient resources to help the adoption of new innovative technology (Low, Chen, & Wu, 2011 ); therefore:• H7: Top management support has a significant positive effect on the intention to adopt BDA.     4.2 Organisational value creation for realising Sustainable development goals BDA technologies offer organisations the opportunity to understand uncertainties regarding demand, capacities, and supply availability. In this context, it supports information interpretation and synthesis from multiple sources for the benefit of decision-makers (Côrte-Real et al., 2019 ). As such, BDA can be acknowledged as a value generator for organisations in many industries and is considered as one of the most critical areas of future technologies (Raguseo, 2018 ). Therefore, it can contribute to creating value for businesses, leading to better financial performance, customer satisfaction, and market performance (Vitari & Raguseo, 2019 ). For the SDGs, the role of the successful adoption of BDA in organisations has been somewhat recognised for yielding various opportunities (MacFeely, 2019 ). By understanding its value, this could create in deriving the needed SDG realisation. Thus, this study develops the following hypothesis.• H8: Adoption of BDA has a significant positive effect on creating organisational value for realising the SDGs.      5 Methodology This study adopted a quantitative methodology consisting of online surveys to test the conceptual framework (Collis & Hussey, 2014 ). As this study tests hypotheses using the TOE framework, the deductive approach and survey method was deemed to be the most suitable methodology (Collis & Hussey, 2014 ). Using a convenience sampling method, an online survey was developed targeting managers and decision-makers who used or were familiar with BDA tools and that were aware of the associated SDGs for their respected domains. All of the survey items were designed using a seven-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A screening question was inserted in the questionnaire to filter out respondents who were not familiar with BDA and the SDGs. To ensure that respondents reflected on their answers when answering the questionnaire, several of the items with scales were reverse coded. A pilot study was conducted to test the reliability and validity of the survey items based on the results of 32 completed questionnaires from the targeted respondents. Then, between November 2018 and March 2019, this study collected 364 responses across the UK. After eliminating incomplete surveys, 320 questionnaires were considered for testing the research hypotheses. This study used the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique in Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) to validate the research hypotheses and model fit (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010 ).  6 RESEARCH findings 6.1 Demographic profiling A total of 320 usable questionnaires were obtained for this study, targeting managers and decision-makers in the UK who used or were familiar with BDA tools and applications. Table 1   presents the demographic data obtained from the respondents.  6.2 Descriptive Statistics Table 2   presents the mean and standard deviation for all the items. The government policy construct was initially measured with three items: E_GP1, E_GP2, and E_GP3. Nonetheless, item E_GP3 was removed based on an insignificant factor loading measure. Hair et al. (2010)  verified that initial confirmatory factor analysis could indicate the need for further refinement of the model when relevant model fit indices have low values (i.e. below the minimum recommended criteria).  6.3 Validity and reliability of constructs This study tested the reliability constructs through Cronbach's alpha and validity through convergent and discriminant validity. Cronbach's alpha was used to test the internal consistency of the constructs, where Cronbach's alpha values were considered appropriate (greater than0.7), as seen in Table 3  . Convergent validity was assessed by average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR); the rule of thumb is that the AVE value should be higher than 0.5, and the CR should be greater than 0.70 (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988 ), all of which are met, as shown in Table 3 . On the other hand, the discriminant validity was tested by measuring the correlation between the constructs and square root of AVE, whereby the square root of the derived AVE should be greater than the correlation's row and column values (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988 ). As shown in Table 4  , the results show a significant level of discriminant validity, as AVE is higher than the squared correlation estimate for all the constructs.  6.4 Common method bias Common method bias is often present when a survey has some discrepancies in responses because of how it is designed and phrased as opposed to the real dispositions of respondents (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2012 ). Common method bias was deemed to be present in this study since it employed the same questionnaire to measure both the independent and dependent variables and used the same respondents. Therefore, this study adopted Harman's single-factor test to detect common method bias by using SPSS factor analysis. The rule of thumb for Harman's single-factor test is that the first significant component's eigenvalue (percentage of variance) should be<50% to show the absence of common method bias. The result showed that the largest variance explained by an individual factor is 43%, which is below the 50% threshold. Hence, there is no significant issue with common method variance. Furthermore, the measurement model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis. As suggested by Hair et al. (2010) , this study validated its measurement model based on goodness-of-fit indices, as reported in Table 5  .  6.5 Structural model and hypothesis testing After completing the required validity of the confirmatory factor analysis test, the structural model was tested to confirm the hypothesised relationship between the factors. Table 6   illustrates the results for the structural model; it indicates that all indices illustrate an excellent fit for the measurement model. Furthermore, after establishing the goodness of fit for the structural model, the research hypotheses were tested by analysing the path significance of each relationship. Table 7   presents the results of path estimates. As such, these outcomes support all eight hypotheses, H1–H8. Fig. 1   presents the conceptual model for this study. The results reveal that the organisational value creation can be predicted by the proposed model (R2  = 0.48). In addition, the results verify that top management support and adoption can be determined by the proposed model with variance of R2  = 0.26 and R2  = 0.35. The results indicate that all other independent variables have a positive impact on their critical dependent variables.   7 Discussion and synthesis for SDGs While many studies on BDA adoption have explicitly focused on building understanding around challenges for individuals, achieving organisations' strategic goals from such technological upgrading have yet to be analysed (Grover, Chiang, Liang, & Zhang, 2018 ). The results from the empirical findings reveal that the technological driver of BDA coupled with top management support can play a critical role in influencing the adoption of BDA. As such, these drivers can provide mechanisms for designing real business value to realise the identified SDGs. The obtained results demonstrate a consistent outcome with the extant literature on the organisational added value from the adoption of BDA (Chen et al., 2015, Lai et al., 2018; Lin, 2014; Schoenherr & Swink, 2012 ). Furthermore, the study shows that organisations should carefully consider various technological, organisational, and environmental factors, which could help to realise the value of BDA adoption, and in turn, create real business value for realising the SDGs. Grover et al. (2018) and LaValle, Lesser, Shockley, Hopkins, and Kruschwitz (2011)  emphasised the importance of understanding the mechanisms required to help create and nurture business value from BDA. Therefore, sufficient technical and nontechnical resources are required. For the utilised TOE framework, this study verified a direct impact between the technological components (i.e. technological complexity and perceived benefits) on the adoption of BDA. This outcome appears to be consistent with the literature on TOE adoption (El-Haddadeh, 2020; Chen et al., 2015 ). The results demonstrate how the adoption of BDA, through consideration of these technological factors, directly helps to create organisational value to support the realisation of the SDGs. Moreover, the findings show how TOE organisational and environmental antecedents require the direct support of top management to facilitate the adoption of BDA. While several studies have verified the independency of such factors and acknowledged their external impact (Côrte-Real et al., 2019; Yoo & Kim, 2017 ), others have verified how top management support could play a significant role in facilitating the adoption and use of innovative technologies, including BDA (Chen et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2007 ). Chen, Mocker, Preston, and Teubner (2010), Chen et al. (2015) , and Preston and Karahanna (2009)  identified that top management should play a pivotal role in developing the required vision, and later couple related strategies with associated alignment issues for creating business value from innovative technologies. This study shows clear evidence of how individuals and key decision-makers can realise opportunities related to technological upgrading and associated investments. For BDA technologies, organisations require a rigorous mechanism for capturing, processing, and integrating relevant data. This requires collaborative efforts throughout the organisation and across all departments to help to set up a seamless adoption. In this way, organisations could produce the required value creation for realising the SDGs overall. Nonetheless, the SDGs have been formulated with the acknowledgement that the world needs continuous development while safeguarding humanity's present and future peace and prosperity. Digital innovations have been recognised as a key driver to support such realisation (Avtar et al., 2020 ). In particular, BDA offers unparalleled potential to unlock many existing societal and individual challenges targeted by these SDGs (Fukuda‐Parr & McNeill, 2019; Avtar et al., 2020 ). Therefore, developing successful strategies for the implementation and adoption of BDA could undoubtedly contribute to creating value in support of the SDGs. As such, organisations can carefully examine and exploit the captured insights associated with organisational activities and processes, including productivity, sustainability, customer retention, product and service quality delivery and experiences, as well as competitive advantages (Avtar et al., 2020; MacFeely, 2019; Malhotra et al., 2018 ). By embracing the right adoption strategies, combining SDGs with BDA could offer new approaches and techniques. Businesses across the globe, whether small or large, public, private, or non-profit, are expected to develop the requisite business capabilities and improve their performance to meet the SDGs (Raut et al., 2019; MacFeely, 2019; Malhotra et al., 2018 ). Hence, it is necessary to identify opportunities in which BDA adoption could create value for businesses against each SDG. Therefore, appreciating the importance of developing the right BDA adoption strategies is a crucial driver for compiling the targeted SDG indicators (MacFeely, 2019 ). It is imperative to recognise the value of BDA in supporting the realisation of SDGs in order to develop the required understanding of how organisations can successfully utilise the relevant and specific adoption strategies for each goal. While the abovementioned discussions offer holistic insights into how organisations need to orchestrate their plans carefully to ensure the successful adoption of BDA, it is necessary to recognise the specific value creation for realising each targeted SDG. Therefore, it would be valuable to consider real-life scenarios while demonstrating the empirical mappings of the BDA adoption framework. Table 8   provides a summary of SDG-specific scenarios and mapping with the TOE framework examined in this study.  8 Conclusion and implications Despite the significant investments and resources allocated for the utilisation of BDA, many organisations are yet to appreciate the value that can be created to support the realisation of UNDP SDGs. The objective of this study has been to provide a better understanding of how the successful adoption of BDA in organisations could contribute toward creating value and achieving the SDGs. The study utilised the TOE framework as a theoretical foundation to examine the role of BDA adoption in creating organisational value for realising the SDGs. Specifically, this research explored the role of top management within these businesses, in addition to relevant determinants in facilitating the adoption of BDA in this context. The model was tested empirically based on a survey of BDA experienced managers across the UK. The results verified how the technological driver of BDA should be coupled with top management support to facilitate the organisational adoption process. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the BDA adoption process could be facilitated by appreciating the role of the external environment (through policies and awareness of competitors), the internal dynamics of organisations (through readiness and capabilities supported by top management and associated decision-makers), and the technological component. In this way, organisational value to realise the SDGs can be created. 8.1 Theoretical implications This study provides useful theoretical insights regarding how organisations can utilise technological innovations as a vehicle to achieve the realisation of the SDGs. In particular, the study makes a valuable contribution in advancing the understanding of internal factors (organisational and technical competencies and capabilities) and external factors (competitors and associated legal and political governance settings) that influence how BDA can successfully be utilised within organisations. By examining these elements, this research has shed new light on how upgrading with innovative technologies can create the required business value for organisations to help in realising the SDGs.  8.2 Practical implications The study highlighted that developing an analytics culture in organisations, at the top echelon, is critical for its success. Therefore, top management needs to offer the necessary guidance and support to those who are involved in setting up BDA tools and applications. From a management stance, it is vital for top decision-makers to support initiatives related to utilising new technologies. For technological positioning, emphasis on the perceived benefits of BDA, awareness, training, and building an analytics culture mindset are critical for obtaining top management support for the adoption of BDA. Furthermore, to alleviate perceived or actual BDA technology complexity, it is necessary to develop technical training programs and compatibility/integration processes to facilitate the successful adoption of BDA. Within the organisational setting, readiness, resources and capabilities, and skills challenges have often been a challenge. Therefore, organisations need to address these issues from the beginning. Specifically, organisations need to allocate sufficient financial, human, and IT infrastructure resources for successful BDA implementation. By doing so, organisations would be in a position to embrace the BDA adoption process effortlessly. From an environmental viewpoint, government support for policies that encourage the development and adoption of new technologies is a powerful driver for business to adopt such technologies. This is especially important in the case of BDA since there are many ongoing issues concerning data, such as confidentiality, security, privacy, and governance. More explicit government regulations would go a long way toward supporting the adoption of new technology in general and BDA in particular. From the standpoint of the SDGs, BDA is a common denominator across all SDGs. Arguably, data are essential for (1) measuring SDG targets, (2) monitoring their progress, and (3) facilitating corrective actions to achieve such targets. Each one of these SDGs has multiple targets that require data to measure and track their progress. Therefore, building such capabilities, including data repositories and accompanying analytical tools, would assist stakeholders to recognise the effectiveness of the SDGs. As with other studies, this research has some limitations and shortfalls. The survey sample utilised targeted one country, limiting the generalisability of the findings. Therefore, future research should aim to target organisations in other countries to perform a cross-comparison. Besides, the unit of analysis of this study was not aimed at examining cross-cultural issues, but rather on organisational perspective. Hence, generalisations from this research should be made with caution. While this is a modest contribution to IS/IT adoption at the organisational level, this paper has nevertheless addressed a relevant research gap on how organisations can align their BDA strategies with the SDGs.
