                  The coexistence of fisheries and oil industry operations creates challenges for the state and institutions responsible for natural resources and socioeconomic welfare, as regional sustainable development depends on institutional performance and equilibrium. Through an institutional mapping approach, this study analyzes the Mexican governmental system linked to the fisheries and oil industry and the attention it pays to the sustainable development goals (SDG) in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (SGM). Institutional roles and responsibilities pertaining to the SDGs were quantified and qualified through a relationship matrix using official information for 2018–2022. We identified five sectors directly responsible for the activities of the fisheries and oil industry, which included 37 related institutions and agencies. The Mexican governmental system assumes more responsibility for economic development and infrastructure (SDG 8 and 9) while much less attention is given to food security and gender (SDG 2 and 5). By evaluating the performance of the governmental system, we identified an imbalance in decision-making between the economic, environmental, and societal dimensions. We describe the intricate institutional network operating within the fisheries-oil system of the SGM and discuss institutional actions and their impacts on sustainable development.

Km 4 Carretera Mérida-Tetiz, 97,357 Ucú, Yucatán, México      The coexistence of fisheries and oil industry operations creates challenges for the state and institutions responsible for natural resources and socioeconomic welfare, as regional sustainable development depends on institutional performance and equilibrium. Through an institutional mapping approach, this study analyzes the Mexican governmental system linked to the fisheries and oil industry and the attention it pays to the sustainable development goals (SDG) in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (SGM). Institutional roles and responsibilities pertaining to the SDGs were quantified and qualified through a relationship matrix using official information for 2018–2022. We identified five sectors directly responsible for the activities of the fisheries and oil industry, which included 37 related institutions and agencies. The Mexican governmental system assumes more responsibility for economic development and infrastructure (SDG 8 and 9) while much less attention is given to food security and gender (SDG 2 and 5). By evaluating the performance of the governmental system, we identified an imbalance in decision-making between the economic, environmental, and societal dimensions. We describe the intricate institutional network operating within the fisheries-oil system of the SGM and discuss institutional actions and their impacts on sustainable development.

This agenda promotes sustainable development based on the three dimensions of economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection and consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that integrate 169 priorities that must be addressed at global, national, and community levels (United Nations, 2015 ). Fulfilling the SDGs by adopting and implementing actions and strategies has become a global goal, one that is especially relevant in developing countries with highly biodiverse coastal areas that provide ecosystem services but that are also highly vulnerable to both biophysical and socioeconomic disturbances (Eisenmenger et al., 2020 ; Scown et al., 2023 ). Coastal areas are transition zones between the land and sea in which various extractive activities are conducted. In most coastal zones, marine resources are subject to complicated governance and management regimes (Chuenpagdee and Jentoft, 2019 ). These regimes are even more complex in coastal areas rich in hydrocarbon resources with active hydrocarbon industrial activities operating alongside other productive activities, including industrial and artisanal fishing (Andrews et al., 2021 ; Peña-Puch et al., 2021 ; Salazar-De la Cruz et al., 2020 ). Several authors have exposed serious socio-environmental conflicts and governance challenges in fishing areas subject to the activities of the oil industry, especially in developing states with internal political conflicts (Adeola et al., 2022 ; Onwuka, 2005 ; Ramos-Muñoz and Espinoza-Tenorio, 2020 ). In these regions, ineffective institutional networks have been detected that exist under conditions of ungovernability and in which institutional privileges are linked to corruption, impunity, and a lack of transparency, leading to the deterioration of natural resources, and increasing social and economic vulnerability (Huizar, 2015 ; Onwuka, 2005 ). For the inhabitants of these territories, conditions of weak institutionality have limited their access to fisheries resources, increased the costs of basic services, decreased the overall quality of life, and resulted in a high degree of uncertainty with regard to their livelihoods (Quist and Nygren, 2019 ; Ramos-Muñoz et al., 2019 ). For the precepts of sustainable development to be met in areas in which fisheries and oil industry activities coexist, multiple challenges facing the implementation of effective public policies and strategies must be overcome (Andrews et al., 2021 ; Salazar-De la Cruz et al., 2020 ). Authorities often assume that it is necessary to fulfill multiple political objectives and national agendas with development plans that include 1) economic growth based on furthering industrialization and infrastructure, 2) technification of food production, and 3) social welfare of the most vulnerable inhabitants by exploiting natural capital (Adeola et al., 2022 ; Scown et al., 2023 ; United Nations, 2021 ). Even after the publication of the SDGs, several authors have reported that global sustainability is far from being achieved, as economic goals are prioritized over social and environmental ones (Eisenmenger et al., 2020 ; Scown et al., 2023 ; Zeng et al., 2020 ). Since the 1990s, scholars have generated a sound understanding of the relationships between ecosystem functionality and the ability of an ecosystem to provide goods and services. As a result, the dichotomous vision that guides the creation of sustainable development plans has also been complemented by the inclusion of a criterion to safeguard and promote ecosystem functionality, which agrees with the three dimensions (economy, society, and environment) that define sustainable development, giving rise to a vision of governance, defined as effective interaction and cooperation among public and social actors for common wellbeing, that has been sought for half a century (Chuenpagdee and Jentoft, 2019 ; Holling, 2001 ). This vision of sustainability and governance has permeated multiple institutional levels and can be identified in multiple international instruments that seek to implement its principles such as the SDGs. In turn, nations have assigned the responsibility of operationalizing these principles to their institutions, which aim to develop congruent public policies (Salazar-De la Cruz et al., 2020 ; United Nations, 2021 ). Systematic reviews of governmental agencies must be conducted to identify and evaluate the contributions of these institutions to assess their scope within specific sectors. As such, comprehensive investigations of the agencies responsible for implementing policies must be conducted to evaluate whether the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda are being successfully implemented in areas where fisheries and oil industry activities coexist. Agency functioning and mandates are determined by the rules set forth by the state (Epstein et al., 2020 ), which establishes the systems of norms guiding institutions to fulfill their mandates. These characteristics can be identified via institutional mapping (IM), which is an analytical tool that can be used to delineate institutional properties, influence, and responsibilities (Aligica, 2006 ). Mapping a government system involves systematically understanding the institutions involved in decision-making and the roles they play when addressing issues in shared spaces (McFadden et al., 2010 ). Through an IM approach, this study aimed to analyze the Mexican federal governmental system linked to fishery and oil industries operating in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (SGM), its scope, and its functional limits to determine how its operations align with the aims of the 2030 Agenda. The results of this study provide a first look at the progress made to date in fully implementing the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda. The novel findings of this study allow us to reflect on the effects of institutional actions, or lack thereof, on resource utilization, the environment, and the socioeconomic landscape of the oil-fisheries system of the SGM. In addition, this study further elucidates the complexity and challenges associated with achieving sustainable development in this region of Mexico. By identifying institutional imbalances, the true scope of the existing organizational structure may be defined, highlighting which sectors and agencies must be strengthened to achieve environmental and socioeconomic balance.  2 Study area The Gulf of Mexico is a semi-enclosed basin located between the United States and Mexico that spans ∼ 1600,000 km2  (Fig. 1  ). The SGM is delimited by 3294 km of Mexican coastline from the Rio Bravo to Rio Hondo (Peters et al., 2021 ). Fisheries and oil industries coexist in the SGM and exhibit different organizational structures. Secretaries and state institutions highly regulate the oil industry. Most of the 34 public and private oil companies that extract hydrocarbons within the region utilize infrastructure that meets international operational standards (https://www.amexhi.org ). The fisheries that operate within the SGM can be classified into two types: industrial (IF) and small-scale fisheries (SSF). The IF fleet operates up to 200 km from the coast on boats (<12 m in length) with built-in engines. In contrast, SSF boats are smaller (< 10 m) and operate in areas between 1 and 35 km from the coast (Salas et al., 2019 ). Although IF operates in a structured manner under the direction of private groups, SSF exhibit highly fragmented institutional organization. As a result, thousands of small entities operate SSF boats with little infrastructure. In addition, efforts to meet international standards for SSF operation and market competitiveness (e.g., certification programs, traceability, and technification) are in the early stages of development. Lastly, SSF face the notable challenges of a lack of data, poorly kept records, and insufficient monitoring efforts (Coronado et al., 2020 ; Rivera-Arriaga et al., 2019 ). For more than a century, the environmental conditions of the SGM have favored fishing. Indeed, the diverse marine ecosystems of the SGM, including mangroves, estuaries, and lagoons, are characterized as productive fishing grounds (Islebe et al., 2015 ; Peters et al., 2021 ). Currently, IF and SFF catch more than 350 species, which can be grouped into at least 10 different fisheries. In 2018, the catch volume of these fisheries totaled 340 thousand tons, which was valued at MX$ 9 billion and represented ∼ 16 % and 40 % of the volume and value of the total fishery production of Mexico (CONAPESCA, 2019 ; Salas et al., 2019 ). Approximately 80 thousand fishers (95 % in SSF) work in the SGM, with an unquantified number of individuals indirectly employed in pre- and post-processing activities (Coronado et al., 2022 ). Officially, 25 thousand fishing boats operate within the SGM (95 % in SSF). Multi-species fishing generally takes place within traditional fishing areas located between 1 and 95 km from the coast, which overlap with areas in which oil industry activities are conducted (CONAPESCA, 2019 ; Ramos-Muñoz et al., 2019 ; Torres-Irineoet al., 2021 ). In terms of production, the oil industry of the SGM supplies 89 % of all Mexican hydrocarbons (Peters et al., 2021 ; SENER, 2020 ). Between January 2018 and July 2023, average crude oil production consisted of 1650 thousand barrels per day, with 100 % of this crude oil extracted from the SGM ( https://produccion.hidrocarburos.gob.mx/ ). Since the 1970s, production has been exclusively conducted by the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos  (PEMEX) via a public monopoly. Although Mexican extractive policies have been formulated since 1938 (Ramos-Muñoz and Espinoza-Tenorio, 2020 ), the Mexican energy reform of 2013 allowed the federal government to grant private extraction permits for the first time through a bidding process for oil fields (DOF, 2013 ). In the SGM, the coexistence of fishing and oil industries and their associations with the 2030 Agenda have been barely addressed (Rivera-Arriaga et al., 2019 ; Rivera-Arriaga and Azuz-Adeath, 2019 ). One of the most important promoters of the SDGs in the region is the Intersecretariat Commission for the Sustainable Management of Seas and Coasts (CIMARES). This commission was created in 2008 to coordinate entities of the Federal government responsible for national policy in planning, managing, and sustainably developing the seas and coasts of Mexico (DOF, 2018a ). The Mexican Federal Administration has been promoting initiatives to support alliances, research, and implementation of the SDGs. In 2018, National Planning Law was reformed to include considerations for long-term planning approaches and the 2030 Agenda. In 2020, the Legislative Strategy for the 2030 Agenda identified 128 National Laws with high potential impact and opportunities for SDG progress (DOF, 2018b , 2017 ). In 2022, the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) incorporated yearly budget projects linked to implementing the 2030 Agenda (https://www.transparenciapresupuestaria.gob.mx/es/PTP/ ).  3 Materials and methods The methodological approach of this study utilizes an IM analytical framework to understand how power is distributed and to analyze multiple forms of authority and their influence on decision-making processes, assumed commitments, and political responsibilities (Aligica, 2006 ; McFadden et al., 2010 ). Although the term mapping evokes cartography, IM aims to technically visualize institutional frameworks and structures to represent management schemes accurately and didactically (Aligica, 2006 ; Vogel et al., 2021 ). The process of IM relies on an in-depth content analysis of official documents, including laws, management plans, and government notifications (Bengtsson, 2016 ), to identify specific ideas and responsibilities. In this study, the IM process was delimited to the Mexican federal governmental system operating between 2018 and 2023 linked to fishing and oil activities in the SGM. The methodological design was structured in six phases (Fig. 2  ). PHASE 1. Identification of sectors and agencies  To delimit the government sectors involved in the management of Mexican fishery and oil industries, a literature review focused on studies in the SGM was conducted through academic search engines using the keywords “Mexican fisheries and oil industry” + southwest Gulf of Mexico” + “institutional management” (Celaya Tentori and Almaraz Alvarado, 2018 ; García-Cuéllar et al., 2004 ; Hernández Ochoa, 2017 ; Quist and Nygren, 2019 ; Ramos-Muñoz et al., 2019 ; Salazar-De la Cruz et al., 2020 ; Vidal-Hernández et al., 2012 ). Mexican Laws, management plans, and online data repositories were also consulted (Fig. 2.1 , Table 1  ). PHASE 2. Classification of the organizational structure of the government system  A hierarchical classification was established in accordance with the mandates and functions established in the Organic Law of the Federal Public Administration (DOF 2022a ). Following these criteria, three hierarchical categories were established: I)   state secretariats, II)   coordinated sector entities, and III)   uncoordinated entities (Table 1 ). State secretariats, in coordination with the President of the Republic, are mandated to create laws, regulations, decrees, and agreements, which is why they are considered public entities of the highest level. Coordinated sector entities, which include technical councils and regulatory bodies, are decentralized secondary entities that fall under the executive branch and are empowered with sufficient autonomy to establish acts, procedures, and decisions. These expert and technical bodies optimally realize the principles of public policy by issuing operational standards under the supervision of state secretariats. Uncoordinated entities, which include indirect control entities and decentralized entities, are legal bodies established under the provisions of the Organic Law of the Federal Public Administration (DOF 2022a ). These entities focus on strategic or priority areas to generate information for State sectors and administratively operate in coordination with state secretariats and coordinated sector entities (Fig. 2.2 ). PHASE 3. Institutional and normative identification of the system of government  The official website of the Mexican government was consulted, which includes the guidelines of the federal public administration (https://www.gob.mx/gobierno ), and the administrative agencies and entities linked to the six sectors defined in Phase 1 were identified. Based on our findings, a database was built in which the institutions identified in Phase 2 were listed and ordered hierarchically. In addition, a glossary of acronyms was generated (Table 1 ; Fig. 2.3 ). PHASE 4. Analysis of the regulatory framework and links with the SDGs  The functions of each unit identified in Phase 3 were described, and the corresponding regulatory government frameworks were analyzed, including federal laws and official standards, to evaluate how their obligations, responsibilities, and institutional scope align with the 17 SDGs and their sub-goals (Table 2  , Appendix 1). We used the technique of content analysis and narrative review to evaluate documents (Bengtsson, 2016 ; Said and Chuenpagdee, 2019 ), and any explicit mentions of institutional obligations to comply with SDGs were identified. For example, if institutional regulation explicitly stated that "the institution will be responsible for food and nutrition issues," the institution was considered responsible for SDG 2. In addition, institutions may have been responsible for complying with one or more SDGs (Fig. 2.4 ). The budgets allocated by the Mexican government to these sectors in 2022 were also evaluated (DOF, 2021 ). This information allowed us to establish dimensions and compare the operational capacity of sectors according to the financing they received. PHASE 5. Agency matrix and the SDGs  A matrix was constructed with the information generated during Phase 3 and 4 that was previously ordered and analyzed (Fig. 2.5 ). The vertical axis included each of the identified institutions, and the horizontal axis included each of the 17 SDGs. The matrix was constructed with binary values (0 or 1) that were generated from qualitative data based on the presence or absence of an attribute. Institutional agencies that included mandates linked to the SDGs according to the normative framework were scored with presence (1). On the other hand, when no responsibilities or links to SGDs were identified, the institutional unit was scored with absence (0; Appendix 2). PHASE 6: Analysis and institutional mapping results  Two analyses were performed at this stage (Fig. 2.6 ). The first one quantified the number of SDGs under the purview of each institution (row), with a maximum of N  = 17. The sum of each column represents the number of agencies directly responsible for each of the 17 SDGs. With the aim of establishing five SDG categories, a quintile calculation was performed. The quintile share ratio is a measure of the inequality of the value distribution. It is calculated as the ratio of total value received in a quintile. In this case, the rank was the number of agencies responsible for each SDG (Appendix 1). The calculation was performed using the Excel function Quintile = PERCENTILE.EXC (RANK, parameter 0.2 or 0.4, or, 0.6 or 0.8) as shown in Eqs. (1) –4 :Q 1  1     (1) Q 2  PERCENTILE . EXC  ( RANK , 0.2  )      (2) Q 3  PERCENTILE . EXC  ( RANK , 0.4  )      (3) Q 4  PERCENTILE . EXC  ( RANK , 0.6  )      (4) Q 5  PERCENTILE . EXC  ( RANK , 0.8  )       Q1 corresponds to very low values and, consequently, the SDGs that are served by a lower number of agencies. In contrast, Q5 corresponds to the highest values and, consequently, the SDGs that are served by the greatest number of agencies. Quintiles 2, 3, and 4 correspond to SDGs that received low, intermediate, and high levels of attention, respectively, in terms of the number of agencies that served them. Additionally, the results are presented in a traffic light-style color scale, with light green representing the SDGs that received very high attention and red representing the SDGs that received very low attention. The IM was visually represented in a Sankey diagram, which showed the responsibility of each entity to the SDGs. The diagram was developed in SankeyMATIC (https://sankeymatic.com/ ) with the matrix generated in Phase 5. The IM results show the level of attention that each SDG received according to the institutional frameworks of the fishery and oil industries in the SGM.  4 Results 4.1 Government system and its institutions The Mexican federal government responsible for managing the fisheries and oil industry is shared between five sectors of the first hierarchical order: hydrocarbons, maritime safety, the environment, fisheries, and social welfare. These sectors are composed of 37 agencies belonging to the second and third hierarchical levels (Table 1 ). The five sectors of the first hierarchical level exhibit specific responsibilities with lines of action that are easily identified and described in terms of their mandates related to economic, social, and environmental components, which are stipulated and described in 16 national laws, agreements, and internal regulations analyzed in this study. However, the mandates of the second and third hierarchical levels, which correspond to agencies in charge of carrying out sector-specific responsibilities and generating information, were difficult to map, as agencies belonging to the second or third hierarchical levels could be subordinate to or support more than one agency of the first hierarchical order. For example, in the environment sector (hierarchy 1), the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) and the National Commission for Protected Natural Areas (CONANP) operate as coordinated institutions (hierarchy 2). However, in the fisheries sector (hierarchy 1), CONABIO and CONANP operate as indirect control entities (hierarchy 3). On the other hand, the National Fisheries Commission (CONAPESCA, legally hierarchy 2) operates as though it were an entity of the first hierarchical order due to the absence of a secretariat that oversees fisheries activities. In addition, the National Fisheries Institute (INAPESCA) operates as a decentralized public body (hierarchy 3). Other important aspects to note are the number of agencies comprising each sector, the national budget allocated to each, and the percentage of the total budget distributed in each state of the SGM (Fig. 3  ). The hydrocarbon and maritime safety sectors were comprised of 12 and 11 agencies, respectively. These sectors exhibited greater institutional structure than those of the fisheries and social welfare sectors, which did not have more than five agencies each. On the other hand, according to the budget of expenditures of the federation for the fiscal year of 2022, the distribution of income showed important differences between the hydrocarbon (61 %), social welfare (27 %), maritime security (11 %), environment (3 %), and fisheries (2 %) sectors.  4.2 State agencies and the attention paid to the SDGs From the results of the quintile analysis, the SDGs that were the normative responsibility of fewer than 7 agencies were grouped into the Q1 category (very low level of attention), while those SDGs that were officially served by more than 21 agencies were grouped into the Q5 category (very high level of attention; Table 3  ). Analyzing the normative framework allows us to visualize the differences in institutional responsibilities and the attention paid to the SDGs. For example, PEMEX (hydrocarbon sector) is responsible for up to 11 SDGs, whereas the Secretary of Public Functions is responsible for two SDGs (Fig. 4  ). The SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and 17 (partnerships to achieve goals) received very high attention from the governance system operating in the SGM, as they are addressed in the normative frameworks of more than 21 agencies that stipulate their current and active responsibilities until 2024. The SDGs 4 (quality education), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and 13 (climate action) received high attention. The SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 10 (reducing inequalities), 12 (responsible production and consumption), 14 (underwater life), and 15 (life of terrestrial ecosystems) received intermediate attention. Both SDG 1 (end poverty) and 3 (health and well-being) received low attention. Furthermore, SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender equity), and 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) received very low institutional attention, indicating that these SDGs exhibit little presence within institutional responsibilities (Fig. 4 ).   5 Discussion This study analyzed the current regulatory framework of the fishery and oil industries of the SGM to generate an institutional map and baseline information on the agencies associated with the identified sectors, their responsibilities, and their mandates related to SDGs. The SDG traffic light system may be used to support and promote governance, guiding the balanced development of agencies that operationalize governmental attention on the three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. Following this approach, the current imbalance in the amount of institutional attention paid to each SDG became evident, as some SDGs received substantial governmental attention while others were scarcely addressed. The results of this study should be used to aid decision-making and coordinate collaborative public actions that promote change and streamline the implementation of management plans, from institutions to communities, furthering the 2030 Agenda. Commitments and political responsibility transcend sector boundaries, which makes it difficult to evaluate strategies by analyzing one sector or institution at a time (McFadden et al., 2010 ; Vogel et al., 2021 ). This emphasizes the importance of multisectoral analyses and highlights the relevance of our results in identifying 1) the overlap among the SDGs (those with very high attention), 2) a lack of institutional legal accountability over specific SDGs (those with very low attention), and 3) responsibilities shared among agencies, such as CONABIO or CONANP, and the relevance of their work regarding the five sectors of the first hierarchical order. 5.1 Complexity of the governance system and institutional arrangements The Mexican federal public administration system (2018–2023) was composed of 20 sectors represented by equal numbers of secretaries and 299 coordinated agencies and decentralized entities (https://www.gob.mx/gobierno#secretarias ). The governmental system responsible for the fishery and the oil industries mapped in this study is comprised of five of these sectors (25 % of the total) and 37 agencies (12 % of the 299 agencies in operation). While this study presents the first fisheries-oil institutional map of the SGM, some related studies have identified fewer sectors and actors. In terms of marine management in the SGM, Espinoza-Tenorio et al. (2014)  identified 17 government agencies involved in these actions. In addition, Salazar-De la Cruz et al. (2020)  identified nine types of key actors that coexist, form social networks, and intervene in decision-making within the fisheries-oil system in the SGM based on the perceptions of experts. The Mexican government system has faced complex changes in public policies, regulations, and institutional arrangements, which have resulted in periods of strengthening and the establishment and disappearance of different state agencies (Espinoza-Tenorio et al., 2011 ; Hernández Ochoa, 2017 ; Ramos-Muñoz and Espinoza-Tenorio, 2020 ). For example, fisheries management in Mexico began in the 1930s and was strengthened in 1975 by the establishment of INAPESCA and the Secretary of Fisheries (SEPESCA), which was disbanded in 1988 and reestablished as an entity linked to the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (Hernandez and Kempton, 2003 ). The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA), which instituted CONAPESCA, was established in the 1990s decade. CONAPESCA promoted the General Law of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (LGPAS) in 2007, which was the first to include socio-environmental components and address food security (Celaya Tentori and Almaraz Alvarado, 2018 ). Attention to food security, sustainable development, and the SDGs was also reflected in the modification of the LGPAS in 2018 (DOF, 2018c ). However, in 2018, SAGARPA was disbanded and transformed into the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER). Nevertheless, CONAPESCA and INAPESCA, which are the only agencies responsible for implementing regulations and generating information for fisheries, continue to operate within SADER, which focuses its efforts on the countryside. Consequently, the capacity of the government to enforce fishing laws was debilitated while technical capabilities and surveillance of the fishing areas were weakened, and gaps resulting from a lack of institutional coordination emerged (Coronado et al., 2022 ; Espinosa-Romero, 2021 ; Rivera-Arriaga et al., 2019 ). These changes represent a loss of institutional strength within the fisheries sector and undermine the influence of the environmental sector in decision-making, as this secretariat focuses on agricultural activities. The low prioritization of the fisheries sector in the Mexican public agenda and national budget is also explained by its low contribution to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), especially when contrasted with that of the hydrocarbon sector. In Mexico, in 2018, the contribution of the oil industry to the GDP was around 12 %, while the contribution of fishing and aquaculture to the GDP was 0.08 % (DOF, 2020 ). This figure is one of the lowest worldwide, especially when compared to the first 20 seafood-producing countries (Cai et al., 2019 ). Future research focusing on the coexistence of the fishery and oil industries must analyze economic aspects, including GDP, state budgets, and dependency budgets. Mexican extractive policies for hydrocarbons were articulated in 1938, beginning with the nationalization of industry and the creation of PEMEX, which was administered to attract economic benefits to the federal government (Ramos-Muñoz et al., 2019 ). During this time, little attention was paid to social welfare or the environment. Moreover, for 75 years, few changes were made to institutional regulations until the energy reform of 2013, which created the first permits for private initiatives to exploit oil fields and created new linked agencies and high budgets (Hernández et al., 2016 ; Ramos-Muñoz and Espinoza-Tenorio, 2020 ). Our results are consistent with large budgets and a high number of institutions linked to hydrocarbon sector. This profound legal and institutional transition included changes in the laws, regulations, and standards of the hydrocarbon sector that promoted economic and industrial development, innovation, the creation of new infrastructure, and increased environmental attention (DOF, 2014 ). These changes and mandates are part of a transition toward economic and industrial growth while maintaining the monopolistic structure of the sector and have overlooked the social sector (Hernández Ochoa, 2017 ; Quist, 2019 ; Quist and Nygren, 2019 ). The lack of attention paid to the social sector and the resulting problems and conflicts are not new to the Mexican hydrocarbon industry, which has restricted and excluded SSF since 2003 (Quist, 2019 ; Ramos-Muñoz et al., 2019 ). Although our study did not analyze the statutes of private oil companies, we underscore the need to review petroleum concessions to private companies and their social responsibility programs, oil spills in coastal areas and deep water, and institutional arrangements between government and private oil companies. Social welfare and its related agencies have been priorities in national policy since 2018. The latest reform to the General Law of Social Development (DOF, 2022b ) promotes socioeconomic development for all citizens, including education, health, food security, employment, and living wages. This public policy is the basis of the 16 Mexican public programs and funds intended to promote socially productive activities by directly providing economic support to people and producers (https://programasparaelbienestar.gob.mx/programas-bienestar/ ), including the fishing sector through BIENPESCA, which is currently the only support program. However, before 2019, the fishing sector received 12 subsidies (https://pescandodatos.causanatura.org/subsidios-pesqueros ), including marine gas oil and productive assets (DOF, 2022b , 2020 ). The importance that the government has given to social welfare is evident in the 2022 budget, as the amount destined for social welfare exceeds those of the security, environmental, and fisheries sectors.  5.2 Imbalances in institutional responsibilities A strong institutional framework in areas where the fishery and oil industries coexist is needed for governments to act and comply with international treaties, including the 2030 Agenda (Eisenmenger et al., 2020 ; Rivera-Arriaga and Azuz-Adeath, 2019 ; Scown et al., 2023 ). In addition to the institutional framework, responsible agencies must have sufficient budgets and staff to fulfill their principal functions. Without these elements, the ability of the government to act is limited, which can lead to stagnation or non-compliance and, consequently, ineffective governance (Castellanos Cereceda, 2018 ; Espinosa-Romero, 2021 ; Rivera-Arriaga et al., 2019 ). The Mexican state played an important role during the negotiations leading to the definition of the 2030 Agenda and 17 SDGs. Since the 2030 Agenda entered into force in 2015, the government has published documents analyzing and proposing strategies to shape institutional architecture to address issues associated with the SDGs (Agenda 2030, 2019 ; DOF, 2017 ; United Nations, 2021 ). Despite national initiatives, the level of institutional attention conferred to each SDG by the sectors and agencies analyzed in this study is imbalanced. A large amount of attention and focus has been directed towards economic development and infrastructure. In contrast, little attention has been paid to social issues, especially those related to food security and gender equality. For their part, the environmental SDGs, such as life below water, life on land, and clean water and sanitation, received less attention compared to those related to the economic sector and technological development. These patterns constitute a global trend that has been previously reported by several authors (Rivera-Arriaga and Azuz-Adeath, 2019 ; Said and Chuenpagdee, 2019 ). The imbalance in institutional attention paid to the SDGs may be the result of the number of agencies associated with the sectors evaluated in this study. For example, the hydrocarbon and maritime security sectors contain double the number of agencies as those of the fisheries and environmental sectors (see Fig. 3 ). Although this imbalance is linked to regulatory frameworks and institutional responsibilities, it is also reflected in the budgets allocated to each sector. The funding and human resources allocated to each sector and their respective agencies enable them to generate results and achieve their established objectives (DOF, 2021 ; Gobierno de México, 2017 ). However, performance evaluation, transparency, and fiscal accountability mechanisms are needed, as larger budgets do not necessarily generate better results.  5.3 The 2030 agenda: challenges and opportunities The results of this study revealed a strong focus on SDGs associated with economic and industrial development and infrastructure, which agrees with the current impetus in the SGM for industrial and infrastructure development. In southeastern Mexico, the creation of the Dos Bocas refinery in Tabasco (https://dosbocas.energia.gob.mx/ ) and the railway for the Maya Train in the Yucatan Peninsula (https://www.gob.mx/trenmaya ) are currently prioritized by the federal government. These projects have been subject to criticism due to the lack of transparent information regarding their environmental and social impacts, particularly on coastal and rural areas vulnerable to serious socioeconomic setbacks (CEMDA, 2022 ). This situation is worrisome if we consider the results of this study indicating that the SDGs that receive the least attention are gender equity and the reduction of inequalities. The SDGs related to marine life and fisheries received an intermediate level of attention, although efforts to facilitate compliance with SDG 14 were identified in the SGM (Rivera-Arriaga and Azuz-Adeath, 2019 ). Implementing the Voluntary Guidelines for the Sustainability of Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication was especially emphasized during 2022, which was declared the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture. However, the loss of institutional strength in the Mexican fishing sector is especially worrisome, as the lack of an established secretary limits the responsibilities, budget, personnel, and infrastructure of the sector. The National Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture program (DOF, 2020 ) specifies that CONAPESCA and SADER are responsible for coordinating the implementation and follow-up actions of this program, although the program does not grant CONAPESCA the autonomy or authority to implement public policy. In contrast, the secretary of the environmental sector confers greater capacities to its corresponding agencies than those of the institutions responsible for fisheries in Mexico (Espinoza-Tenorio et al., 2011 ). In recent years, the federal government of Mexico has adopted sustainable management approaches (e.g., ecosystem-based management, co-management strategies, and producer-academic linkages) and promoted the inclusion of environmental, economic, and social aspects into fisheries management (DOF, 2018c ; Espinoza-Tenorio et al., 2011 ; Gobierno de México, 2020 ; United Nations, 2021 ). A similar vision has been developed within the energy and hydrocarbon sectors, presenting a unique opportunity to focus attention and efforts to comply with the SDGs. As Chuenpagdee and Jentof (2019)  suggest, problems are not necessarily solved by identifying them. However, visualizing and analyzing problems can guide government actions, including institutional and regulatory redesigns, organizational innovations, and the development of new management tools that directly support robust and effective solutions to improve governance.   6 Conclusions and future directions The IM of the fisheries and oil industries in the SGM revealed differential government attention paid to the SDGs, highlighting limited expectations for fulfilling the 2030 Agenda. The imbalance observed in the attention given to each SDG arises from the lack of inclusion of SDGs in normative frameworks and institutional responsibilities. Regardless of the level of attention that each SDG receives, the responsible institutions generate conditions that either strengthen or hinder their implementation within the fishery and oil industries of the SGM. For the fisheries and hydrocarbon sectors, additional analyses of the institutional frameworks and federal governance systems, such as the one in this study, are needed, along with institutional maps at state, municipal, and local levels, to understand the complexity of the government and governance system. Research that analyzes and evaluates the lines of action for implementing each SDG is also needed, especially studies that focus on the SDGs that have received the least attention at the institutional level. Evaluations focusing on structural and regulatory changes within the government system, as well as baseline governance and governability studies, contribute to filling knowledge gaps regarding the implementation and performance of public policies. These evaluations are priority research topics that future studies should address. One of the greatest opportunities in the SGM to implement the SDGs and comply with the 2030 Agenda is to encourage the actors and sectors currently allied with the government, including academia, civil society organizations, and producers, to continue working together to ensure sustainability within the fisheries-oil system of the SGM. While we cannot immediately halt global environmental, economic, and social crises, collaboration between actors, sectors, and social networks that promote sustainable actions creates a powerful pathway to ensure sustainable development.
