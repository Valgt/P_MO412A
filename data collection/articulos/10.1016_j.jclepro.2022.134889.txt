                  Achieving the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an intercommunicated mission worldwide. It is primarily known that increasing urban areas and populations can considerably influence numerous SDGs. However, the interaction mechanism between urban expansion (UE), urban population dynamics (UPD), land-use efficiency, and SDGs, until now, has not been fully understood. The present study employed remotely sensed data of population and land covers to analyze spatiotemporal variations in land consumption rate (LCR), population growth rate (PGR) and the ratio of LCR to PGR (LCRPGR) of 31 provinces in China from 1995 to 2015. Moreover, we investigated the relations between land-use efficiency and SDG practice using the Spearman coefficient and explored how economic zones alter the consequence of LCR, PGR, and LCRPGR on SDG implementations. The results show that nine SDGs had synergies with LCRPGR, exceeding the total number of synergy relationships yielded by LCR and PGR, indicating that LCRPGR that considers both LCR and PGR exerts more impacts on SDG implementations compared with the single perspective concerning LCR or PGR. The synergies and trade-offs of LCRPGR were more evident in undeveloped economic zones, while few influences of LCRPGR on SDGs were observed in developing economic zones. It suggests that improving land-use efficiencies to facilitate SDG implementation is essential in undeveloped economic settings. The study provides a better understanding of SDG practice in land-use efficiency for developing countries, i.e., China, and guides the regulations of urban expansion and population growth.

Handling Editor: Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida Achieving the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  is an intercommunicated mission worldwide. It is primarily known that increasing urban areas and populations can considerably influence numerous SDGs. However, the interaction mechanism between urban expansion (UE), urban population dynamics (UPD), land-use efficiency, and SDGs, until now, has not been fully understood. The present study employed remotely sensed data of population and land covers to analyze spatiotemporal variations in land consumption rate (LCR), population growth rate (PGR) and the ratio of LCR to PGR (LCRPGR) of 31 provinces in China from 1995 to 2015. Moreover, we investigated the relations between land-use efficiency and SDG practice using the Spearman coefficient and explored how economic zones alter the consequence of LCR, PGR, and LCRPGR on SDG implementations. The results show that nine SDGs had synergies with LCRPGR, exceeding the total number of synergy relationships yielded by LCR and PGR, indicating that LCRPGR that considers both LCR and PGR exerts more impacts on SDG implementations compared with the single perspective concerning LCR or PGR. The synergies and trade-offs of LCRPGR were more evident in undeveloped economic zones, while few influences of LCRPGR on SDGs were observed in developing economic zones. It suggests that improving land-use efficiencies to facilitate SDG implementation is essential in undeveloped economic settings. The study provides a better understanding of SDG practice in land-use efficiency for developing countries, i.e., China, and guides the regulations of urban expansion and population growth.

Owing to the distinctive roles of cities and communities in sustainable development (Song et al., 2018 ), SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, as a component of 17 SDGs, spotlights the inclusiveness, security, resilience, and sustainability of cities and human settlements. It is noteworthy that urban expansion (UE) and urban population dynamics (UPD), as the essential characteristics of urban developments (Abubakar and Aina, 2019 ; Giuliani et al., 2021 ), should be regarded as the critical, detached issues in countless affairs associated with sustainability (Akuraju et al., 2020 ; Bettencourt and West, 2010 ). While contributing 80% of global GDP, cities emit 70% of carbon and consume 70% of resources (The World Bank, 2020 ), posing challenges to economic, social, and environmental sustainability (ESE) (McDonald et al., 2020 ). It is essential to promote sustainable urban development to realize SDGs (Acuto et al., 2018 ), which requires effectively regulating the interactions between 17 SDGs and UE, as well as SDGs and UPD. Consequently, identifying synergies and trade-off mechanisms between SDGs and urban development characteristic parameters (i.e., UE and UPD) is critical to ensure the effectiveness of SDGs policy (Bennich et al., 2020 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ). By 2018, urban areas worldwide had reached 809,665 km2  (Li et al., 2020 ). The continued UE consumed substantial resources, destroyed biodiversity, and considerably affected local climates (Seto et al., 2011 ). UE increases the difficulty in constructing and maintaining water supply facilities, aggravates the shortage of water resources, and hinders the realization of clean water and sanitation (He et al., 2021 ). Additionally, increasingly built-up areas yield urban heat island effects, which tend to result in global warming and weaken government efforts for climate action (Argüeso et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless, rapid urban developments bring extensive employment opportunities (Sheng et al., 2022 ) and excellent infrastructure (Aljoufie et al., 2013 ), providing decent work, promoting economic growth, and revitalizing industrial development. Meanwhile, the urban population exceeded 4 billion in 2018 and will reach 7 billion by 2050 (UNPD, 2019 ). The rising urban population puts higher education requirements (Muttarak, 2021 ) and medical care (Romeo-Aznar et al., 2022 ). According to Rader et al. (2020) , better public health systems are required in crowded cities to address challenges posed by pandemics, e.g., Corona Virus Disease 2019. The achievement of SDGs should be taken into account the consequence of urban expansion and increasing urban population on the ESE. In particular, Iannillo and Fasolino (2021)  point out that rational urban planning and land use can improve the sustainability of cities. For this reason, SDG 11.3.1 (i.e., the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate, LCRPGR), evaluated by UE and UPD, was proposed, which indicates land use efficiency (Jiang et al., 2021 ; Melchiorri et al., 2019 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ). LCRPGR reflects the holistic effect of UE and UPD and allows them to be directly applicable in terms of synergistic and trade-off studies with SDGs. Economic, social, and environmental sustainability has been extensively explored in previous studies. For example, Han et al. (2021)  investigated the link between UE and ESE based on an environmental Kuznets curve theory. They found that UE yields a positive consequence on economic and social developments. However, rising urban areas can destroy ecological environments. Notably, they also point out that reasonable regulation of urban expansion, such as land resources in big cities for technological innovation and eco-environment land for small towns, could facilitate the implementation of SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), and 15 (life on land). Moreover, D'Adamo et al. (2022)  employed a multi-criteria decision analysis involving 45 SDGs to assess the sustainability of 103 cities over Italian. They found that sustainable policies and green public investments are essential to sustainable cities and land developments. Yu et al. (2018)  utilized the extended snapshot model to reveal the interactions between economic growth, technological improvements, population dynamics, and lifestyles in Sichuan province, China. They found that UPD changes the structures of energy, manufacturing and service industries and that policymakers should conduct the design, formulation, and implementation of policies based upon population, economy, and environment structures. Although numerous attempts were made to clarify the relationship between UE (or UPD) and SDGs, the existing literature mainly focused on the influence of UE and UPD on single or few SDGs. It may yield bias on SDG achievement policy making regarding urban sustainability. Previous studies have demonstrated that LCRPGR may yield potential associations with economic, social, and environmental issues, while how LCRPGR influences SDG practice still awaits a general explanation (Wang et al., 2018 ; Zhao et al., 2022 ). In related research, Jiang et al. (2021)  proposed a new indicator (i.e., the ratio of economic growth to land consumption rates, EGRLCR) according to LCRPGR to investigate the association between economic growth and land consumption. They found that the differences in land use efficiency among varying urban income groups gradually decreased, indicating that land resource allocation for different income groups tends to be more equitable in China's cities over time. Estoque et al. (2021)  investigated spatiotemporal variations in global LCRPGR as well as the correlation between UE and UPD. They found that it is critical to incorporate local natural resources and external factors (e.g., capital and technology) to improve urban sustainability. However, as stated earlier, how LCRPGR interacts to influence SDG realizations, until now, has not been fully explored. Therefore, a holistic investigation is required relating to how (or to what extent can) LCRPGR affect the realization of 17 SDGs. Synergies (i.e., positive correlation) and trade-offs (i.e., negative correlation) were mainly used for relationship measurements between SDGs and interaction determinations between SDGs and related factors (e.g., air pollution and continued increases in impervious surfaces) (Allen et al., 2018 ). Pradhan et al. (2017)  explored the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs in 227 countries worldwide, and they found that SDG 1 had synergies with the majority of SDGs, while it yielded trade-offs with SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and 12 (responsible consumption and production). Zhu et al. (2022)  employed multiple regression methods, e.g., nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient and panel data regression model, to explore the interactions between SDGs involved in air pollution as such SDGs and the others in China. They found that air pollution-related SDGs exerted trade-offs with SDG 12 and had synergies with primarily SDGs. Moreover, Fuso Nerini et al. (2018)  revealed synergies and trade-offs between SDG 7 (i.e., affordable and clean energy) and SDGs 1.1 to 17.9. They found that SDG 7 yielded synergies with 143 targets while trade-offs with 65 targets, indicating that SDG 7 significantly affects the achievements of human welfare, social infrastructure constructions, sustainable urban developments and sustainable management of the natural environments. For nutrient-contaminated waters in China, Wang et al. (2022)  point out that the interactions between SDGs can maintain water cleanliness and can directly affect the realization of 17 SDGs. Previous studies have shown that synergies and trade-offs can be utilized as a better measurement to identify the interactions between SDGs. Based on the above discussion, the present study chose 31 provinces in China to investigate interactions between UE, UPD, LCRPGR, and SDGs (i.e., synergies and trade-offs) from 1995 to 2015. The scientific questions can be summarized in the following aspects:● How do the urban expansion, population growth, and the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate vary in China from 1995 to 2015?  ● How do UE, UPD, and LCRPGR interact to impact the realizations of SDGs 1–17?  ● Can economic zones (e.g., developed and developing regions) change the consequence of UE, UPD, and LCRPGR on SDGs and if so, how?     2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area Our study area is the 31 provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan). As the largest developing country, China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Since then, China has entered a new period of continued urbanization and industrialization. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2021) , China's GDP grew from 9.59 trillion yuan in 2001 (approximately 1.16 trillion dollars) to 101.60 trillion yuan in 2020 (approximately 14.72 trillion dollars), with a per capita GDP growth rate of more than four times. Meanwhile, China's cement production increased from 661 million tons to 2.395 billion tons, pig iron production increased from 156 million to 889 million tons, and power generation increased from 1.48 trillion kWh to 7.78 trillion kWh. Despite China's impressive achievements, rapid urbanization and industrialization brought a series of ecolocigal and environmental problems, e.g., air pollution, deterioration of water quality, and urban heat islands (UNPD, 2019 ). Therefore, China's cities need sustainable development in the face of profound social, economic and environmental problems (Chen et al., 2016 ).  2.2 Materials We employed SDG scores of 31 provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) evaluated by Xu et al. (2020)  (Fig. 1  ). The assessment of chosen SDG scores employed 119 targets that belongs to 17 SDGs. In particular, Xu et al. (2020)  constructed 55 new targets for environmental and social evaluations and also utilized some indicators from the SDG Index Monitoring Framework and Dashboards  report. The data sources selected include China's 19 statistical yearbooks, national census, and national people's congress reports. Throughout the evaluation of data uncertainty, sensitivity, and availability, the chosen data is more accurate and comprehensive than other SDG data (Jeffrey Sachs et al., 2018 ). Following Rockström and Sukhdev (2016) , SDGs were divided into four categories, i.e., environment, society, economy, and management (Table 1  ). Notably, SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) was divided into the economic category based on the research conducted by D'Adamo et al. (2022)  and Fuso Nerini et al. (2018) . Long-term global artificial impervious surface data from 1985 to 2018 (Gong et al., 2020 ) (released by Tsinghua University, http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn ) was utilized to determine urban boundaries (Li et al., 2020 ). Figs. S1a and S1b  provide the spatial distribution of urban boundaries in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH). Gridded population data with a spatial resolution of 1 km (Xu, 2017 ), released by the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center, was used for population growth and LCRPGR calculation. The data covers the period of 1995–2015 with an interval of 5 years. Figs. S1c and S1d  show the distribution of population in the BTH region. We used urban boundaries and population data from 1995 to 2015 to ensure that the analytic time scale of LCR, PGR, and LCRPGR matches the time periods of SDG scores. To examine how economic zones alter the influence of land use efficiency parameters on SDG scores, here, we used a geographic classification scheme, i.e., eastern, central, and western China (Table S3 ) (Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center, 2018 ), to analyze the heterogeneity of the effects of LCR, PGR, and LCRPGR on SDG practice in different regions. According to Zhang et al. (2014) , the scheme considers regional economy, demography, and environment. Additionally, following the National Bureau of Statistics (2019) , considerable differences in economic levels were observed among varying zone settings.  2.3 Methods 2.3.1 Derivation and normalization of LCR, PGR, and LCRPGR LCRPGR refers to the ratio of land consumption rate (LCR) to the population growth rate (PGR), representing land-use efficiency. The urban expansion rate can reveal LCR because urban expansion often is characterized by continued pervious surfaces replaced by impervious surfaces, leading to land consumption. PGR refers to the population change rate in a given period within a specific range. The formulas of LCRPGR, LCR, and PGR are (Zhou et al., 2021 ):(1) L C R = ln ( U r b  t + n   / U r b  t   )   y      (2) P G R = ln ( P o p  t + n   / P o p  t   )   y      (3) L C R P G R = L C R   P G R       where U r b  t     is the urban area of the initial year (the unit: km2 ); U r b  t + n      is the urban area of the last year; P o p  t     is the population within the urban area of the beginning year; P o p  t + n      is the population within the urban area of the last year; t    represents the time node (from 1995 to 2015 with a time interval of 5 years), and y    represents the time interval. LCRPGR is divided into four grades, i.e., (-∞, −1], (−1, 0], (0, 1], and (1, +∞], to determine the different relationships between LCR and PGR, i.e., PGR reduction rate is higher than LCR, PGR reduction rate is lower than LCR, PGR rate is higher than LCR, and PGR rate is lower than LCR. To avoid the inconsistent data range regarding LCRPGR, LCR, and PGR, we normalized three critical parameters according to Xu et al. (2020) . The formula is:(4) x ,  = x − x min   x max  − x min    × 100     where x    is the computing result of formulas (1) to (3) , x max  / x min     represents the upper/lower limit of the corresponding parameter, and x ,     is the normalized value. The data range of x ,     is [0, 100]. Considering data errors, the numerical results of x ,     were limited to the interval of [5%, 95%] to weaken the influence by data uncertainty.  2.3.2 Definition of trade-offs and synergies In this study, synergies and trade-offs were used to explore how land-use efficiency impacts SDG practice. Positive (e.g., LCRPGR, LCR, or PGR were conducive to SDG progress) and negative correlations (e.g., LCRPGR, LCR, or PGR hindered SDG progress) were utilized to represent synergy and trade-off. We chose nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation (ρ   ) to determine the synergy or trade-off between LCRPGR, LCR, and PGR and SDGs 1–17 (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). The Spearman coefficient (ρ -value) effectively measures the monotonic relationship between any combinations of data pairs (Spearman, 1904 ). Moreover, it can capture the nonlinear correlation without being sensitive to outliers (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011 ). Accordingly, it is used widely for the general relationship beyond the linear correlation between variables. Pradhan et al. (2017)  and Zhu et al. (2022)  used the Spearman coefficient to analyze the monotonic relationship between all possible combinations of SDGs in different countries and regions. They found that when the p -value < 0.05 and the ρ   -value > 0.6, a positive correlation (i.e., synergistic relationship) between the two SDGs can be identified. However, when the ρ   -value < −0.6, a negative correlation (i.e., trade-off relationship) can be recognized. In this study, we used the Spearman coefficient, i.e., the positive or negative of ρ   , to represent synergies or trade-offs between LCRPGR, LCR, PGR, and SDGs. Furthermore, the Pearson coefficient was utilized to verify the robustness of the Spearman results (Pearson, 1920 ; X. J. Wu et al., 2022 ; Zhu et al., 2022 ). Moreover, we used the Spearman regression model to test the collinearity between SDGs (Fig. S2 ). Significant correlations between SDGs were observed and the correlation coefficients lie between −0.8 and 0.8.    3 Results and discussion 3.1 Variations in LCR, PGR, and LCRPGR By calculating LCR, PGR and LCRPGR, we have shown the urbanization process in China from 1995 to 2015 (Table 2  ). An increasing trend of LCR was observed before the year 2010 and followed by a decreasing trend during the period of 2010–2015, indicating that the rate of urban expansion in China decreased over time. The possible reason is that, since 2010, UE in China has mainly depended on large cities or urban agglomerations, and urban structure optimization, as a new form, gradually replaced traditional UE (Deng et al., 2020 ). A slightly negative value of PGR between 2000 and 2005 was observed, caused predominantly by urban exodus and lower fertility rates (Zhou et al., 2021 ). Additionally, rapid urban expansion may produce a low population growth in new-built regions compared to central metropolitan areas (Li et al., 2017 ). The highest value of LCPRGR (1.657) was during the period of 2010–2015, when rapid urban expansion in small cities and numerous populations moved to megacities or urban agglomerations (Wang, 2021 ). Variations in LCR and PGR in 31 provinces of China from 1995 to 2015 are shown in Fig. 2  . Urban areas continued growth over time, which means China was in the process of rapid urbanization (Fig. 2 a). Significant increases in LCR were observed in the majority of China's provinces from 1995 to 2010, whereas a decreasing trend of LCR was found in 21 provinces after 2010. It suggests that China's urban expansion rate has slowed down since 2010. Notably, Jiangsu province maintained continuous increases in LCR after 2010. LCR in Jiangsu province from 2010 to 2015 increased by 0.011 compared to 2005 to 2010. The alternate urban expansion of the southern and northern parts of Jiangsu provinces allows for efficient allocation of resources, facilitating rapid urban developments (Shi et al., 2018 ). It is noteworthy that, from 1995 to 2000, Guangdong province yielded the highest LCR value (0.155), followed by Zhejiang province (0.136). LCR in both of them exceeded 0.1 in this period. However, a considerable decrease in LCR of Guangdong province was observed after 2000. It may be due to strictly controlling urban expansion to protect mangrove ecosystems (Ai et al., 2020 ). LCR in 14 provinces reached the highest value between 2000 and 2010, suggesting the peak rate of urban expansion in China appeared during the period. Fig. 2 b provides the population growth rate in 31 provinces of China. As shown, a significantly decreasing trend of PGR in most provinces was observed, and the lowest value emerged between 2010 and 2015, contrary to the temporal variation in LCR during this period. From 2000 to 2005, negative values of PGR in 14 provinces were observed as a result of varying urban boundaries by periods that could lead to the uncertainty of population statistics (Jiang and O'Neill, 2018 ). Among these, Tianjin province reached the lowest RGR (−0.323), followed by Hainan province (−0.299). Temporary urban populations of Hainan province in 2000 and 2005 accounted for 33.171% and 9.401% (Development Statistical Yearbook, 2016  ; Urban Socioeconomic Survey Office; National Bureau of statistics of the People’s Republic of China, 2002 ; 2007 ), which also expresses the effect of population mobility on urban population statistics. In addition, it was found that the maximum PGR value of most provinces appeared during the periods of 1995–2000 and 2005–2010. Generally, decreasing trends regarding the rate of LCR and PGR were observed, and the PGR values in most provinces were lower than the LCR values during the same period. Fig. 3   shows the spatial distribution of LCRPGR at the provincial level in China. As shown, the LCRPGR values of 31 provinces considerably changed over time, and most of them were in the range of (0, 1]. From 1995 to 2000, LCRPGR in 29 provinces was less than 1, suggesting that land consumption rates in China were lower than urban population growths and that the dense population was condensed in limited and crowded urban areas. In addition, a negative value of PGR in Chongqing province-level municipality was observed between 1995 and 2000. LCRPGR in Xinjiang and Qinghai provinces was observed to be higher than 1, suggesting PGR in the two western provinces lagged behind UE. The possible reason is that the two provinces are located in the western part of the Heihe-Tengchong Line (China's population division line, 64% of China's land area in the western part of the line living only 4% of the population), leading to the small population growth. High spatial heterogeneity of LCRPGR variations was observed during the period of 2000–2005, suggesting most provinces were in the early stages of rapid urbanization (Deng et al., 2020 ). This phenomenon is closely related to unplanned and unprecedented urban expansion (Khan et al., 2014 ). For example, Shenzhen, during its rapid development, has seen a vast influx of rural migrants into the city, living in urban villages, where policymakers rejected the place as part of the city (Hao et al., 2011 ). Over the next five years (i.e., from 2005 to 2010), the speed of UE in China was less than that of urban population growth. Massive population migration to cities and urban births bring a large labor force to urban developments (Sijuwade, 2010 ). However, since 2010, China's urban population growth has slowed (Wu et al., 2019 ), leading to the UE rate being higher than urban population growth.  3.2 Correlation analyses between land-use efficiency and SDGs Table 3   illustrates the relationships between LCRPGR, LCR, PGR, and SDGs. As shown, LCRPGR and LCR yielded more synergies than trade-offs with SDGs. However, an opposite trend of PGR was observed. Nine SDGs had synergies with LCRPGR, exceeding the total number of synergy relationships yielded by LCR and PGR, indicating that LCRPGR that considers both LCR and PGR exerts more impacts on SDG implementations compared with the single perspective concerning LCR or PGR. Estoque et al. (2021)  point out that LCR and PGR yield different implications for the realization of SDGs, while LCRPGR emphasizes the integrated effects of LCR and PGR. Our finding indicates that the SDG practice should pay more attention to the holistic consequences of LCR and PGR, i.e., considering the influence of LCRPGR. The results also suggest that a higher urban expansion rate than urban population growth (i.e., LCR > PGR) can significantly promote SDG realizations. The possible reason is that lower population densities provide ample and comfortable spaces for metropolia to attract immigrants and enhance urban vitality (Cortinovis et al., 2022 ). SDG 1 (no poverty) was positively correlated with LCRPGR (ρ -value = 0.248**), suggesting that high LCRPGR can considerably reduce poverty. Similarity, synergies of LCRPGR were observed with SDG 2 (zero hunger, ρ -value = 0.211*), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, ρ -value = 0.342**), SDG 4 (quality education, ρ -value = 0.413*), and SDG 5 (gender equality, ρ -value = 0.218*). Urban expansion often is accompanied by the construction of various facilities (Wang et al., 2020 ), which requires facility design, construction, building materials, and transportation. Many people can benefit from the procedure, i.e., increasing income and improving the quality of life (including sufficient food, good health care, and better education). SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure, ρ -value = 0.298**) was positively associated with LCRPGR. The possible reason is that available urban lands can provide sufficient fields for industrial developments and infrastructure constructions, which, in turn, helps improve the quality and efficiency of urban land use (Yigitcanlar et al., 2008 ). The synergy relationship between SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) and LCRPGR (ρ -value = 0.342**) suggested that optimized land-use efficiency (i.e., higher LCRPGR) can be conducive to social equity (Dorius and Firebaugh, 2010 ). Our finding is consistent with an investigation of land use efficiency indicators in China conducted by Jiang et al. (2021) . They suggest that improving LCRPGR can promote social equality. A highly positive correlation between SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and LCRPGR was observed at a 1% significant level, indicating that it is vital to improving land use efficiencies for urban sustainability (Chiesura, 2004 ; Oktay, 2012 ). It is reasonable since better land use efficiencies can reduce the inequality of urban facilities (Pandey et al., 2022 ) and provide sufficient land resources for ecological restoration (L. J. Zhang et al., 2022 ). In particular, LCRPGR exhibited a synergistic effect with SDG 17 (partnership for the goals, ρ -value = 0.204**). However, it is noteworthy that LCRPGR was not directly related to SDG 17. Instead, LCRPGR promotes sustainable urban developments to enhance the ability and confidence of cities to communicate with the outside world (Tjandradewi and Marcotullio, 2009 ). In addition, rapid urban expansion with appropriate population growth can attract external resources and strengthen inter-city resource exchange, which strongly promotes the city's ability to communicate with the outside regions (Estoque et al., 2021 ). It was found that LCR had synergy relationships with SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land). Undoubtedly, urban expansion requires a lot of labor and technical support, thus creating many decent works and promoting economic development. Additionally, it realizes better infrastructure and technological innovation (Ioannides and Rossi-Hansberg, 2010 ). The positive correlation between LCR and SDG 12 is due to rapid urban expansion bringing sound urban planning that can improve resource utilization and reduce waste (Agudelo-Vera et al., 2012 ). The finding that LCR can promote the improvement of SDG 15 is contrary to the investigation conducted by McDonald et al. (2020)  that global urban growth destroys biodiversity. It is because the vegetation in China's cities has been gradually improving as cities expand and repaired (Zhou et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the Chinese government achieved good results by continued large-scale ecological restoration projects (Cui et al., 2021 ). Trade-off relationships between PGR and SDGs 13 (climate action) and 1 (no poverty) were observed, indicating that urban population explosion hinders the implementation of SGDs 1 and 13. The dense urban population creates the phenomenon of urban poverty. Notably, urban population excess may lead to a lack of food supply (Donohoe, 2003 ). Hunger can impact social welfare and yield poverty. Moreover, population overabundance would result in the scarcity of educational resources and the deterioration of medical conditions and thus impeding urban sustainability. Moreover, the urban population can emit more waste gas, and the ability to resist disasters will be weak (Jarzebski et al., 2021 ). Our results are consistent with existing theoretical analyses. We interpreted trade-offs and synergies between LCRPGR, LCR, PGR and SDGs from society, economy and environment perspectives (Fig. 4  ). The land-use efficiency, i.e., LCRPGR, is the cornerstone of sustainable urban development and can largely influence human well-being by driving social progress, economic development and regional integration (Yu et al., 2019 ; Zhao et al., 2021 ). LCR, the annual growth rate of UE, is a powerful boost to economic growth that benefits 75% of the financial goals in terms of SDGs. Rapid economic developments induced by urban expansion, to some extent, can promote the ability of China's environmental restoration, especially in the extension of urban green spaces (Chen et al., 2019 ). Urban population growth arranges pressure on environments and economies, predicting that slowing population growth can help urban sustainability (Chen et al., 2022 ). Our results provide new insight into the realizations of SDGs 1–17 and highlight the distinctive roles of land-use efficiency in sustainable developments.  3.3 Robustness of analytical results To verify the robustness of analytical results, we compared our results with related studies and found that our results were highly consistent with existing literature on the influence of UE, UPD, and LCRPGR on environmental, economic, and social perspectives (Han et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2021 ; Liu and Sun, 2020 ). We have shown that LCRPGR, LCR, and PGR have practical significance for realizing SDGs. It is noteworthy that, without weakening the impact of data errors, Spearman's analysis can eliminate the effect of outliers (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011 ) and comprehensively express correlations using sample ranking (Abdullah, 1990 ). Our results clearly identify synergies and trade-offs of LCRPGR, LCR, or PGR on SDGs and judge its significance by explicitness. In addition, the comparison of Pearson and Spearman's results shows that synergy and trade-off measurements were robust whether linear or nonlinear relationships between LCRPGR, LCR, PGR, and SDGs were observed (Warchold et al., 2021 ) (Table S2 ).  3.4 How do economic zones impact correlations? We further investigated the heterogeneity of the correlations between LCRPGR, LCR, PGR and SDGs under different economic settings. We determined how economic zones impact the consequence of LCRPGT, LCR, and PGR on SDG realizations. Table S3  provides the details of economic zone division, i.e., developed economic zone (DEZ, i.e., eastern China), developing economic zone (DIEZ, i.e., central China), and undeveloped economic zone (UEZ, i.e., western China). Generally speaking, the synergies and trade-offs of LCRPGR were more evident in UEZ. At the same time, few influences of LCRPGR on SDGs were observed in DIEZs (Fig. 5  ), indicating that it is essential to improve land-use efficiencies to facilitate SDG implementation in undeveloped economic settings (Deng and Bai, 2014 ). LCRPGR in UEZ had synergistic effects with 11 SDGs. The association strength ranking from high to low was SDGs 4 (quality education), 17 (partnerships for the goals), 3 (good health and well-being), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), 1 (no poverty), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 10 (reduced inequalities), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 2 (zero hunger), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 15 (life on land). Differences in synergies of LCRPGR with SDGs 6, 15, and 16 were observed between UEZ and the national scale. LCRPGR in UEZ (ρ -value = 0.355*) yielded more contributions to clean water and sanitation than the national scale (ρ -value = 0.185). LCRPGR in UEZ (ρ-value = 0.355*) yielded more contributions to clean water and sanitation than the national scale (ρ -value = 0.185). Water utilization in the western part of China is inefficient and has a high potential for improvement. Therefore, appropriate land-use efficiency is more important for the construction of water-related facilities (Liang et al., 2021 ). This is particularly true in water-scarce regions. The synergistic relationship between LCRPGR and SDG 15 in UEZ is due to the government's annually increasing number of funds for ecological protection (De Clercq et al., 2018 ). China's origin of the Yangtze River and Yellow River is in UEZ, i.e., the western part of China. Hence, the coordinated developments of UEZ can improve environments and protect water sources (Yang et al., 2006 ). The possible reason for positive relationships between LCRPGR and SDG 16 is proper population density helps government and functional departments manage. In developed regions, LCRPGR yielded synergistic effects with SDGs 5 (ρ -value = 0.543**), 4 (ρ -value = 0.355*), and 11 (ρ -value = 0.317*). It suggests that proper land-use efficiency in eastern China helps quality education and gender equality, as well as sustainable cities and communities (Zhang et al., 2017 ). LCRPGR significantly affected SDGs 11 (ρ -value = 0.527**), 4 (ρ -value = 0.421**), and 9 (ρ -value = 0.405*) in developing regions, where is associated with few number of SDGs. It was found that the consequence of LCRPGR on SDG 11 in DIEZ (ρ -value = 0.527**) and UEZ (ρ -value = 0.506**) was higher than that in DEZ (ρ -value = 0.317*) because of implemented sustainable engineering in the western and central parts of China (Peng and Deng, 2021 ). Besides, we noted the developed regions (ρ -value = 0.553**) yielded the highest synergistic correlation between LCRPGR and SDG 4 (quality education), followed by developing regions (ρ -value = 0.421**) and undeveloped regions (ρ -value = 0.355**). The trend suggests that undeveloped regions need proper land-use efficiency to make sure education developments (Franco et al., 2019 ). Fig. 6   shows that a more substantial influence of LCR on SDGs in undeveloped and developing economic zones was observed than that in developed economic zones. LCR had no obvious relationships with the majority of SDGs. Synergistic correlation of LCR with SDGs 6 (ρ -value = 0.521**), 7 (ρ -value = 0.520**), and 15 (ρ -value = 0.464*) were observed in DIEZ, suggesting that continued urban expansion may promote clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and life on land. In undeveloped regions, a considerably positive correlation between LCR and SDG 15 was observed (ρ -value = 0.494**). The possible reason for synergistic relationships between them in developing and undeveloped regions is that ecological environments in central and western parts of China are more fragile (Song and Deng, 2017 ), and economic developments, induced by urban expansion, can promote remarkable restoration in terms of eco-environments. In addition, urban expansion in developing regions can significantly stimulate the realizations of SDGs 6 (ρ -value = 0.521**) and 7 (ρ -value = 0.520**). Urban expansions in developing regions have promoted the construction of water supply facilities and energy transmission, further strengthening the complementarity between the eastern and western parts of China (J. X. Wu et al., 2022 ). Fig. 7   shows that trade-offs of PGR were more significant in undeveloped economic zones, suggesting that urban population regulation plays a vital role in SDG realizations in the undeveloped economic zone. PGR had trade-off relationships with SDGs 1, 11 and 13. Rapid urban population growth in the UEZ interfered with poverty eradication, urban sustainability, and air pollution mitigation. Notably, in UEZ, the conflict between sustainable developments and population growth may exist in some cities (Chen et al., 2016 ), which tend to be more suited to the development mode of small towns (Xu and Sun, 2021 ). In general, our finding indicates that more attention should be paid to the UE and UPD of cities in undeveloped regions to promote SDG implementation.  3.5 Limitations and future research directions We noted several research limitations. Firstly, the calculation of LCRPGR involves two related elements: urban boundary (Zhou et al., 2022 ) and population (Lloyd et al., 2017 ; Xu, 2017 ). Both of them can significantly impact the accuracy of calculated results. In the present study, we used urban boundary data retrieved by Li et al. (2020)  to determine urban areas’ dynamic changes. The data relies on underlying surface-spectrum characteristics, which may confuse rural settlements, urban villages, and urban areas, leading to uncertainty in population statistics (Cao et al., 2018 ). The data bias tend to be more evident in underdeveloped regions. For example, negative values of PGR were observed in western and central parts of China (Fig. 2 b). The chosen population data in this study is 1 km spatial resolution, whose spatial details stand coarse compared with the data from WorldPop with a resolution of 100-m (Lloyd et al., 2017 ). However, high spatial resolution population data lack historical records and can not assist time-series regression analyses. Hence, future studies require more accurate urban boundaries, high spatiotemporal population data to support related research. While the proposed method effectively illustrates how land-use efficiency impacts the implementation of SDGs, it only considered the interactions between SDG and LCRPGR at a provincial scale over a yearly time scale. It is insufficient to guide SDG practice solutions in a fine spatial resolution (i.e., at a county level). Moreover, varying counties’ social and ecological settings may yield different sustainability concerns (Kates Robert et al., 2001 ). Therefore, studies involving synergies and trade-offs between LCRPGR and SDGs require the understanding and information of more acceptable population and urban boundary parameters, sustainable goals, and targets on a fine spatiotemporal scale. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the evaluation of 17 SDG scores involves hundreds of targets (U.N., 2015 ), which yields challenges in conducting real-time SDG evaluations. This is particularly true in large-scale SDG evaluation. Generally speaking, the time scale of studies that conduct SDG evaluation in China was delayed by about 4–5 years (Gao et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; J. L. Zhang et al., 2022 ). The SDG score used in this study is up to the year 2015 (Xu et al., 2020 ). It is necessary to consider more recent data (i.e., the year 2020). The lack of data has constrained in-depth analyses of SDGs. With this in mind, establishments such as the SDG Big Data Platform  (https://sdg.casearth.cn/ ) may resolve the real-time data acquisition. In the future, we will try refining the data and methods used in SDG evaluation.   4 Conclusions and policy implications 4.1 Conclusions Compared with previous studies, the novelty of the study lies in providing new empirical evidence regarding the interaction between land-use efficiency (including land consumption rate, population growth rate and LCRPGR) and SDGs on the provincial scale. More importantly, we first explained how economic zones regulate the consequence of LCR, PGR, LCRPGR, and SDG realizations. We systemic analyzed the synergies and trade-offs between LCRPGR, LCR, PGR, and 17 SDGs. The conclusions can be drawn as follows.● During the period of 1995–2015, urban areas continued growth over time, which means China was in the process of rapid urbanization. Significant increases in LCR were observed in the majority of China's provinces from 1995 to 2010, whereas a decreasing trend of LCR was found in 21 provinces after 2010. The maximum PGR value of most provinces appeared during the periods of 1995–2000 and 2005–2010. The LCRPGR values of 31 provinces considerably changed over time, and most of them were in the range of (0, 1].  ● LCRPGR and LCR yielded more synergies than trade-offs with SDGs. However, an opposite trend of PGR was observed. Nine SDGs had synergies with LCRPGR, exceeding the total number of synergy relationships yielded by LCR and PGR, indicating that LCRPGR that considers both LCR and PGR exerts more impacts on SDG implementations compared with the single perspective concerning LCR or PGR.  ● The synergies and trade-offs of LCRPGR were more evident in UEZ, while few influences of LCRPGR on SDGs were observed in DIEZs, indicating that it is essential to improve land-use efficiencies to facilitate SDG implementation in undeveloped economic settings.     4.2 Policy implications We provide new insight into SDG realizations from the perspective of land-use efficiency by analyzing the interactions between LCRPGR, LCR, PGR, and SDGs. The present study gives a better understanding of SDG practice in sustainable urban development for developing countries, i.e., China, and guides the regulations of urban expansion and population growth. Considering that our results may provide helpful pieces of knowledge regarding the realization of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, the following policy suggestions were expressed. Synergic relationships between LCRPGR and the majority of SDGs indicate that higher LCRPGR is conducive to promoting the practice of SDGs. Thus, the government can maintain the rate of urban expansion more elevated than that of urban population growth to help SDG realizations in western and central parts of China. Additionally, in those regions, such issues, i.e., population migration and brain drain, should be taken into consideration. The massive population loss can lead to a weakening of urban vitality. Therefore, maintaining population growth is one of the core foundations for urban development in the central and western parts of China. Cities in developed regions should optimize the internal structure as the primary regulation direction. The developed regions have been under enormous pressure on energy and food supplies, traffic congestion, and high housing costs (Li et al., 2019 ). Urban agglomerations and satellite cities provide good cases for the sustainable development of megacities. For instance, the construction of the Xiongan New Area has alleviated non-capital functions for Beijing. It is noteworthy that urban population excess may lead to a lack of food supply. Hunger can impact social welfare and yield poverty. Moreover, population overabundance would influence adequate educational facilities and medical conditions, thus impeding urban sustainability. In developing and undeveloped zones, the government should continue to invest in ecological governance to ensure the sustainable development of SDG 15 (life on land). Additionally, it is vital to enhance fragile ecological environments and the efficiencies of water resources (Deng and Bai, 2014 ). This is particularly true in western China. Environmental protection can help the Maowusu Desert evolve into an oasis, improve the ecological quality of Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia provinces, and thus promote sustainable development (Liu et al., 2020 ). Notably, the government should invest in education research and projects, i.e., support the construction of SDG 4 (quality education), so that more people scientifically participate in the construction of SDGs. Simultaneously, the government should formulate related policies that encourage more talents to aid middle and western cities’ development, which can alleviate the inequality between eastern and western China.
