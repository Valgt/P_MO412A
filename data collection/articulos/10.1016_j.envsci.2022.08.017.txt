                  This paper aims to examine methods of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in Ghana, map their perceived impacts on water resources, and analyse the implications of these perceptions for meeting the targets related to Clean Water of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). The paper draws on 74 interviews with artisanal and small-scale gold miners and other stakeholders to investigate communities’ perceptions of the effects of ASM methods (alluvial mining, surface/open-pit mining, and underground mining) on water bodies. We find that different ASM methods impact surface and groundwater in distinct ways while concurrently having a synergistic negative effect on water bodies. Stakeholders – including community leaders – perceive that the mining methods employed in ASM cause various forms of environmental degradation – thus affecting progress towards SDG 6, target 6.3 (water quality) – and severely hinder the availability of clean water for domestic and agricultural purposes, thus endangering the livelihoods of communities and affecting progress towards SDG 6, target 6.4 (sustainable water use). The community perceived impacts of ASM activities on water resources have implications for community acceptance of formalisation efforts in Ghana. We contend that a better understanding of these perceived impacts can help shape the country’s policy for achieving the targets of SDG 6 in relation to Clean Water by 2030. In particular, we propose that the integration of the Community Mining Scheme as part of formalisation efforts of informal gold mining in Ghana not only responds to SDG 6 target 6b (participation of local communities in water management) but also has the potential to reverse the current large-scale mining ‘bias’ in policy, while addressing the galamsey challenge that contributes to the increasing impact of informal gold mining on SDG 6, targets 6.3 and 6.4.

Table 2   Forms of alluvial mining method in Ghana’s ASM Description   Dig and wash ‘Dig and wash’ method is employed to extract (shallow) alluvial deposits that are usually found in a low-lying area or old valleys at a depth of not greater than 3 m (Aryee et al., 2003 ).  Dredging This method is employed on rivers with dredging machines.2  Small-scale miners use suction dredges that float on water bodies, particularly rivers. It consists of a sluice box aided by pontoons, attached to a suction hose. Usually, 2–5 persons are involved in the dredging method, but one to two persons operate the machines on the river. The gold-bearing sediments in the river are excavated directly by suction from the stream/riverbed and transported hydraulically onto sluice boards mounted along the bank of the stream/river for washing (Bansah et al., 2016 : 9). Most of the ASM operators who employ this method are Chinese migrants who venture into illegal mining through the support of the local people.3   Anomabo method It is a dredging method used in the mining of gold bearing gravels from riverbeds. Gold bearing gravels are deposited after rainy seasons, where loose materials are eroded and deposited on the riverbeds. For this method, ‘a miner dives and scoops the gold bearing gravel from the riverbed. The gravel is then put in a bucket, hoisted up onto a raft and then washed onshore’. It is usually done by 2 persons (Bansah et al., 2016 : 11).  More blade This is a modified form of ‘dig and wash’ method. It is called ‘more blade’ method because of the number of persons, sluice board involved, and pans used in washing mineralised materials for more gold. It mostly has about 50 miners working for the site owner and 10 persons assigned with sluice boxes in the pits for sluicing activities. Some members of the crew manually fetch water and pour it onto the sluice board (Bansah et al., 2016 ).    2 Interview with one of the current executive members of the Small-Scale Mining Association Prestea Branch on 17 August 2017, Prestea. 3 Interview with underground ‘ghetto’ miner on 20 July 2021, Bondaye.

Ban on informal ASM operations and the CMS    a The ban on informal ASM still applies even though it was released in 2019; informal gold mining is still illegal and military intervention is used to stop people from engaging in informal ASM.   Table 5 ASM methods and linkages with progress towards SDG 6 targets.  Table 5    SDG 6 on Clean Water Targets ASM methods versus progress towards SDG 6 water-related targets Formalisation policy / Solution to ASM problem: the government Ban on informal ASM and Community Mining Scheme (CMS)    6.1: achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all The various ASM methods do not contribute to equitable access to safe drinking water for all Ghanaians as small-scale miners contaminate water sources for rural communities. Unless there are changes in the policy framework for ASM. The ban on informal mining and the CMS do not achieve this target.  6.3: improve water quality by reducing pollution Underground ‘ghetto’ miners do not typically use mercury in underground spaces. Therefore, there is limited potential for mercury pollution. Open pit miners who channel wastewater back into the old open pits can help reduce water pollution. Alluvial mining does not improve water quality but rather it intensifies water pollution. The ban is now making people resort to illegal mining at night. ASM at night is done haphazardly and could increase water pollution.  6.4: substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity The ASM methods do not increase water use efficiency unless environmentally friendly technologies are adopted to achieve this target. The ban and CMS are not meeting this target. No progress is made.  6.5: implement integrated water resources management at all levels All the ASM methods employed do not apply integrated water resources management principles. The ban on informal ASM and the CMS do not offer solution to lack of integrated approach to water resources management in the ASM sector.  6.6: protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, rivers, and aquifers The current ASM methods offer limited opportunities to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. Just that few miners (open-pit/surface miners) try to protect rivers and its catchment areas by channelling their wastewater into big pits of large mining companies. Underground ‘ghetto’ miners who use dynamites in blasting gradually pollute underground water with blasting agents. The ban has reduced illegal gold mining in some parts of the country, but in some areas such as Prestea-Bondaye mining area, illegal mining activities have still not stopped. The CMS offers the potential to protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including forests but it is at infant stage to assess the actual progress. In some areas, where the CMS is implemented, informal or illegal mining activities have decreased.

We contend that a better understanding of these perceived impacts can help shape the country’s policy for achieving the targets of SDG 6 in relation to Clean Water by 2030. In particular, we propose that the integration of the Community Mining Scheme as part of formalisation efforts of informal gold mining in Ghana not only responds to SDG 6 target 6b (participation of local communities in water management) but also has the potential to reverse the current large-scale mining ‘bias’ in policy, while addressing the galamsey challenge that contributes to the increasing impact of informal gold mining on SDG 6, targets 6.3 and 6.4.   Keywords Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM)  Water resources  Sustainability  Sustainable Development Goal 6  Mercury contamination  Environmental degradation  Mining methods    1 Introduction The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) provide a development framework to help nations on the global agenda ‘to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity’ (UNDP, 2021 ). The 17 SDGs are integrated to ensure that development balances social, economic, and environmental sustainability (ibid.). Research shows that SDGs can guide national policy development on natural resources and formalisation of informal mining with the inclusion of environmental dimensions (Hilson and Maconachie, 2020a ; Kinyondo and Huggins, 2021 ; Laing and Moonsammy, 2021 ; Maconachie and Conteh, 2021 ). In Africa, formalisation of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) – low-tech, labour-intensive mineral extraction and processing activity – can help governments contribute to the achievement of the development targets linked to the SDGs (Maconachie and Conteh, 2021; Mensah et al., 2020 ). ASM can be linked to SDGs in diverse ways through its negative and positive externalities (Hirons, 2020; Laing and Moonsammy, 2021 ). The positive externalities of ASM are highlighted in the ASM literature. For instance, it provides direct and alternative employment opportunities to rural populations (Fisher et al., 2009; Hentschel et al., 2003; Hilson, 2016 ). It is reported that about 100 million people depend on ASM globally (World Bank, 2013 ). The sector contributes to government revenue (through taxes and foreign exchange earnings) (Hentschel et al., 2003; Hilson, 2016; Laing and Moonsammy, 2021 ) and stimulates local economies through linkages with other sectors/industries (Arthur-Holmes et al., 2022 ). The negative externalities are manifested in the form of environmental impacts, gender discrimination and unfair treatment of women, and child labour (e.g. Arthur-Holmes, 2021; Arthur-Holmes and Abrefa Busia, 2021; Buss et al., 2019, 2021; Maconachie and Conteh, 2021; Yakovleva et al., 2022 ). Researchers have highlighted the environmental impacts of ASM to include land degradation, destruction of flora and fauna, air pollution, and heavy metal contamination of sediments, surface and groundwater (e.g., Arthur et al., 2016 ; Hilson et al., 2018 ; Hilson et al., 2020a ; Ofosu et al., 2020 ). For instance, the use of mercury in ASM affects soil and water from a variety of sources (Amankwah and Anim-Sackey, 2003 ; Hirons, 2020 ; Mantey et al., 2020 ). Besides, water pollution and contamination are common problems in the ASM sector due to the methods of extraction and processing (Bansah et al., 2018; Hilson et al., 2020a; Ofosu et al., 2020 ). Clean water is one of the key elements in the transformative promise of the 2030 SDGs agenda (see  Table 1 ). Despite the abovementioned impacts, there is a lack of understanding of how communities and stakeholders in the ASM sector perceive and deal with the impact on water bodies, especially given the use of different mining methods in ASM. The perceived impact of ASM operations is relevant for community acceptance of government policy to progress towards SDG targets such as Goal 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation (e.g. Veiga et al., 2014 ; Ofosu et al., 2020 ; Hilson and Maconachie, 2020a ). As is indicated in the literature, further research is welcome to examine ways to achieve progress towards SDGs in the ASM sector (e.g. Kinyondo and Huggins, 2021 ; Laing and Moonsammy, 2021 ; Maconachie and Conteh, 2021 ; Niesenbaum, 2020 ; Pedersen et al., 2021 ; Sadan and Dan, 2021 ). Using the case of Guyana, Laing and Moonsammy (2021, p. 147)  noted that, the ASM sector has ‘contributed to significant levels of deforestation and water pollution, threatening process on other SDGs’. Though the Minamata Convention on Mercury has the potential to reduce water contamination by mercury emissions, there is still inadequate information about its inclusion and consideration in the formalisation of ASM in Africa (Buss et al., 2021 ; Hilson et al., 2018, 2020a ). In Ghana, the government has shown commitment to improving access to safe and potable water, but the approach adopted has been affected by an incomplete understanding of the impact of rampant ASM activities. To contribute to addressing these problems, this paper aims to: 1) identify methods of ASM using the case of Ghana, 2) map the community perceptions of these methods on water resources, and 3) analyse whether the current policy framework or ASM methods employed in Ghana can contribute to the achievement of SDG 6 targets. This paper adds to the existing literature on ASM by discussing the environmental impacts of ASM methods and contributes to the ongoing debate on the need to enhance the environmental performance in the ASM sector. It acknowledges the significance of ASM methods and stakeholders’ perceived environmental impacts of ASM methods in addressing environmental pollution, especially on water resources. Further, this paper extends our understanding of ASM and its implications on global development policies (SDGs). Our analysis also provides relevant information to assist policymakers in Ghana and other African countries to link the ASM policy framework with SDG targets since the social, health and environmental challenges associated with ASM operations intersect with some of the 17 SDGs, for example, SDG 1 No poverty; SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being; SDG 5 Gender Equality; SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; and SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production.  2 ASM in Ghana: formalisation, contestations, and prospects Artisanal or small-scale gold mining is contested with different meanings due to its various criteria. Universally, there is no single definition for ASM. In Ghana, small-scale gold mining is operationalised and defined as ‘mining by any method not involving substantial expenditure by individuals or group of persons not exceeding nine or by a cooperative society made up of ten or more persons’ (Government of Ghana, 1989 cited in Aryee et al., 2003 : 131). In other countries, for example Mali, artisanal mining is interpreted by the government as ‘operations engaged in the extraction and beneficiation of mineral commodities sourced from primary and secondary deposit, outcrops or sub-outcrops, using manual methods and traditional processes’ (Konate, 2006 : 108) while in the case of gold mining, the operation is considered ‘small-scale’ if the operations employ semi-permanent, semi-industrial or industrial processes and its daily output of ore does not exceed 150 tonnes (ibid.). Comparing these two definitions, small-scale mining is based on a specific number of people in Ghana whiles in Mali, the daily output of ore is used to define ASM. Despite this ASM universal definition issue, it is estimated that the ASM sector directly employs about 1 million of the Ghanaian population and creates millions of other jobs for people (Hilson, 2017 ). According to Hilson (2017) , Ghana’s ASM sector produced 1.2 million ounces of gold in 2016 which represented 31 % of the total gold production. In Ghana, small-scale (gold) mining has two forms: registered (small-scale) mining and informal, illegal or unregistered (small-scale) mining activities, locally called galamsey. Registered small-scale miners are those who have obtained mining licenses from the Minerals Commission to undertake mining activities on their concessions. Unregistered small-scale miners are those who engage in mining extractions and/or processing ores without having a mining license to operate and they often work on mineral concessions owned by large-scale mining companies without their permission, on people’s land, and in areas prohibited for mining (Amankwah and Anim-Sackey, 2003 ). The mining sector is governed by Ghana’s principal laws on mining, namely the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703) and the Minerals Commission Act, 1993 (Act 450). The Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703) was amended in 2015 (the Minerals and Mining Act, 2015 (Act 900) and recently in 2019 (Adu-Baffour et al., 2021 ). These laws highlight the ‘state ownership of minerals in their natural states, licensing regulations, mineral rights, and the statutory powers of the relevant regulating institutions within the ASM sector’. Sections 82–99 of Act 703 is devoted to ‘ASM addressing areas including licensing, composition, functions of district mining offices, obligations of a miner as well as mercury distribution and use’ (ibid., 6). As Adu-Baffour et al. (2021)  note, ‘there are other relevant laws such as environmental legislations (including those related to forest protection, protection of water bodies and water use), tax legislation, customary law relating to land tenure, the law of corporations, contract law, and administrative law principles concerning the exercise of government powers’. Generally, those permitted to engage in ASM operations are citizens of a country concerned; thus, foreign nationals are not allowed to participate in small-scale mining (Bugnosen, 2003 ; Crawford and Botchwey, 2016 ; Hilson et al., 2014 ). However, in Ghana, Chinese nationals tend to participate in small-scale gold mining by conniving with some Ghanaians to acquire mining licenses and act as owners of the ASM operations (Hilson et al., 2014 ). Most Chinese citizens engage in the illegal segment of ASM despite having knowledge of its ramifications for foreign nationals (Hilson et al., 2014; Crawford and Botchwey, 2017 ). The rise in gold prices in 2008 resulted in a rush for foreign miners, particularly those from China into Ghana (Crawford and Botchwey, 2016; Kane, 2013 ). In 2013, about 50,000 miners were reported to have traveled from China to Ghana during the peak of the gold rush (Kane, 2013 ). At the national level, Hilson and Potter (2003)  noted that about 85 % of Ghana’s artisanal and small-scale miners do not register for mining permits. This is pointed to the delays in the processing of small-scale mining license applications (due to the cumbersome and bureaucratic processes), lack of mineralised land for mining, and the costly permit fees (Banchirigah, 2008; Hilson and Potter, 2003, 2005 ). As is documented in the literature, the complex nature of the licensing process is responsible for the increasing activities of illegal mining in Ghana and other African countries (Patel et al., 2016; Tschakert and Singha, 2007 ). For instance, Boafo et al. (2019)  argue that the interaction between formal institutions (the Minerals Commission and Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources) and informal institutions (the chieftaincy and customary land institutions) facilitates ‘illegalities’ in the mining sector. It is well established in the ASM literature that the rigidity of licensing process also breeds corruption in the ASM sector in Ghana (Crawford and Botchwey, 2017 ). Since 2013, there has been significant public condemnation among Ghanaian citizens concerning the environmental destruction caused by the spate of illegal small-scale mining (Armah et al., 2013; Eduful et al., 2020 ). Following these mounting pressures, the government of Ghana in February 2017 issued a ban on all ASM activities – both licensed and unlicensed ASM, which tasked various stakeholders to fight against illegal mining across the country. In April 2017, CitiFM (an Accra-based radio station) with the Ghana Media Coalition Against Galamsey launched the ‘#StopGalamseyNow Campaign’ to pressure the government to protect the environment. Subsequently, the government established Operation Vanguard (a task force consisting of the Police and Military) to enforce the ban. In this regard, ASM operators who were caught engaging in ASM were imprisoned and their equipment was burnt (Hilson, 2017; Hilson and Maconachie, 2020b; Osei et al., 2021 ). Though local authorities (including chiefs) and people could be blamed for working with foreigners to obtain lands and mining licenses, it is argued that the government imposed the ban on ASM and employed military interventions as a response to ‘escape scrutiny over its choice of strategy to combat illegal mining’ (Hilson and Maconachie, 2020b : 1).  3 Methods of ASM The laws and policies regulating Ghana’s ASM sector have recently gone through some modifications to clamp down on illegal mining operations and to reduce the destruction of water bodies that serve as sources of drinking water for some rural communities. Yet, such modifications have not addressed the ASM menace in the country. The Minerals Commissions, Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, and other policy institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have not shown enough commitment to address the diverse impacts of ASM methods on the environment. As a case in point, the licensing process must provide a critical assessment of ASM method(s) and how the prospective artisanal/small-scale miners will minimise the environmental impacts. Besides, the need to understand the nuances in the methods of ASM operations is relevant to meeting the development targets of the SDGs, specifically goal 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation. In Ghana, local people employ different ASM methods to extract gold. The methods of ASM are the three (3) standard mining methods, namely, alluvial mining, surface/open pit mining, and underground mining (Chirikure, 2015 ). This classification is based on the location of the mineral ore/deposit and its extraction. 3.1 Alluvial mining The alluvial mining method is done in placer deposits or waterlogged areas where there are alluvial gold deposits, usually in a low-lying area or at the riverbeds. For the initial phase of extraction of alluvial gold deposits in low-lying areas, miners clear the vegetation and then excavate the soil to reach the gold-rich layer (Aryee et al., 2003 ). Afterwards, they remove the mineralised rocks or sand and transport them to nearby streams for washing or along the banks of rivers. In Ghana, most informal miners used to be involved in this method. But, over the years, there have been considerable changes in ASM operations due to the introduction of mill machines by Chinese miners (Boafo et al., 2019 ). Hitherto, small-scale miners did not use mill machines at the processing sites for crushing mineralised materials, but only used wooden boards with blankets for sluicing.1  1 Interview with an alluvial miner (employing Chang fa  processing method) on 25 July 2017, Bondaye. This miner provided in-depth description of this mining method and how local people have modified their mining technique to get more gold.   Under this mining method, there are four (4) forms based on how alluvial mineral deposits are extracted (see  Table 2 ). In terms of the potential impact of alluvial mining on SDG 6, target 6.3 (water quality), the literature suggests a negative impact. The washing of the auriferous materials is done directly in the waters or right at the banks (Bansah, 2019 ), and this situation affects the chemistry of the water (Hirons, 2020 ; Mantey et al., 2020 ). Some miners perform amalgamation on the waters, increasing the potential for mercury pollution (Bansah et al., 2016; Kinyondo and Huggins, 2021 ). Dredging of waterways dislodges sediments and increases suspended particles loading in the water. These particles may contain toxic heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic to increase the pollution load of the water (Bansah et al., 2018 ).  3.2 Surface /Open-pit mining The surface mining method is employed when the mineral ore or rocks are found near the earth’s surface (Ahadzi, 2007; Wetherelt et al., 2011 ). Heavy equipment such as earthmovers is used to remove the soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (called the overburden) and then excavators are used to extract the mineral (Kinyondo and Huggins, 2021 ; Piro and Lipkina, 2020 ; Ramani, 2012 ). Trucks are used to transport the ore deposits extracted. There are different variants of surface mining methods including opencast and mountainous mining (Altiti et al., 2021 ). Usually, people refer to surface mining as open pit mining. The open pit mining is employed for extraction of both metallic and non-metallic ores (Altiti et al., 2021 ; Ramani, 2012 ). According to Altiti et al. (2021 : 1) open pit mining has ‘a traditional cone-shaded extraction and is usually employed to exploit a near-surface, nonselective and low-grade zones deposit. In Ghana, some informal gold miners operate in the abandoned open pits of large-scale mining companies. In the case of the Prestea-Bondaye mining area, most informal gold miners work in the abandoned pits of multinational large-scale mining companies (Arthur-Holmes and Abrefa Busia, 2022a; Hilson and Yakovleva, 2007 ). Some small-scale mining operators, especially those with licensed concessions use trucks, bulldozers, and excavators for open pit mining compared to unregistered ASM operators who use shovels, pickaxes, and other simple equipment.2  2 From interview with one of the current executive members of the Small-Scale Mining Association - Prestea Branch on 17 August 2017, Prestea   In open pit mining, the analysis of literature also suggests a negative impact on SDG 6.3. It is uncommon to find sediment ponds or basins for cleaning the murky brown water (or contaminated water) on a mine site. As a result, effluents (wastewater) from the sluicing processes are typically discharged into the environment without any form of treatment. The wastewater eventually ends in surface water systems and pollutes these water resources (Bansah et al., 2018 ). In some instances, piles of excavated soils are poorly contained, and they easily get washed into surface waters during heavy downpours. Poorly disposed waste materials (tailings) are also washed into rivers and streams during heavy rains (Aryee et al., 2003 ; Bansah et al., 2018) .  3.3 Underground mining Underground mining is a technique used to extract hard rock or minerals from underground workings. The underground workings are mostly in old and abandoned mines, where small-scale underground miners access by the shafts or adits (Bansah et al., 2016 ). In the underground mines, gold-bearing rock is broken into fragments with either chisel and hammer or dynamite and then carried in sacks to the surface for processing. This kind of underground mining is called underground ‘ghetto’ mining. Those who break the gold-bearing rock into fragments are called chiselers while the men who bring forth the fragmented gold-bearing rock and loose sand materials to the surface are called ‘lokko boys’.3  3 From interview with underground ‘ghetto’ miners on 24 August 2017, Bondaye   Underground mining, particularly the ‘ghetto’ one usually involves 15–30 persons depending on the height of the underground pit (Aryee et al., 2003; Bansah et al., 2016 ). It is also called underground ‘hard rock’ mining, when the ore is extracted along lode rock formation (Bansah et al., 2016 ). In terms of impacts on SDG 6.3, underground ‘ghetto’ miners do not typically use mercury in underground spaces, thus providing less potential for mercury pollution. However, they use mercury for gold extraction on the surface which could cause water pollution (Mantey et al., 2020 ). Those who use dynamites in blasting mineral-bearing rock gradually pollute ground water with blasting agents.4  4 Interview with underground ‘ghetto’ miners on 24 August 2017, Bondaye     4 Research setting and methodology This paper emerged from qualitative research that draws on a multi-site fieldwork carried out in July-September, 2017 in Prestea-Bondaye Mining Area (PBMA) in the Prestea Huni Valley Municipal District (PHMD) of the Western Region of Ghana. PBMA is located in Southwestern Ghana and covers about 50 km north of the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. PBMA is one of the hotspots for ASM operations in Ghana, famous for large-scale underground mining and the co-existence of small- and large-scale mining (Arthur, 2018; Arthur-Holmes and Abrefa Busia, 2022a; Hilson and Hu, 2022 ). From a historical account, formal gold mining in the area commenced as far back as 1873. Mines were operated by various multinational (private) companies from 1873 to 1965; however, in 1965, they were nationalised and later privatised in 1985 (Barradas, 2012 ). Over the past 2 decades, PBMA unlicensed ASM sites have absorbed thousands of people including those who migrated to the area in search of employment (see e.g. Arthur-Holmes and Abrefa Busia, 2022b; Hilson and Hu, 2022 ). The fieldwork in 2017 coincided with the period the government placed a ban on ASM across the country. Though PBMA was one of the most heavily-policed areas during ‘Operation Vanguard’, people interviewed were still mining or taking on ASM-related tasks. This multi-site fieldwork was part of a wider research that sought to map the various ASM forms in the PBMA, the kind of ASM operations women participate in, and women’s struggles at the ASM sites and their intrahousehold bargaining household. Initially, the perceived environmental impacts of ASM operations, particularly on water resources were not the focus but the interviews with 2 traditional leaders in Bondaye and an executive member of the Small-Scale Mining Association (SSMA) – Prestea Branch – brought up a critical assessment of different impacts of ASM methods on water bodies from them. The traditional leaders and one SSMA executive stressed that the government did not need to impose a ban on all ASM activities across the country (in 2017) because some activities did not destroy the water bodies. In this case, underground ‘ghetto’ mining and open-pit mining were mentioned as typical examples. They further attributed the destruction and contamination of rivers to the use of dredging and alluvial mining. These words were echoed in other interviews with small-scale miners. This subsequently influenced the first author to collect information from artisanal/small-scale miners, traditional leaders, and SSMA executive members on their perception of the impacts and severity of mining methods employed by ASM operators in the area. In line with this objective, the first author interviewed 29 male and 24 female artisanal miners, 2 executive members of SSMA (1 current and 1former), 2 traditional leaders, and 2 members of the Bondaye Unit Committee ( Table 3 ). As part of the wider research, a multistage sampling involving purposive, snowball and convenience sampling techniques as well as social networks were employed. The convenience sampling technique also helped select male and female miners for interviews on the basis of their availability at the mine sites and willingness to partake in the study. Social networks and the snowball sampling technique were used to obtain access to conduct interviews with traditional leaders, mine site committee members and town council leaders. Responses from the fieldwork in 2017 were complemented with unstructured interviews with 5 current and 10 retired male artisanal miners from July to October 2021 in the PBMA. This was done to obtain new dynamics of ASM operations in the country following the amendment of the Minerals and Mining Act, 2015 (Act 900) in 2019. The unstructured interviews allowed ‘interviewees to talk about the subjects within their own frames of reference’ (May, 2011 : 136). In total, 74 interviews were conducted on the ban on ASM and the impacts of mining methods on water resources (See Table 3 ). The interviews were recorded after seeking permission from interviewees and conducted in Wassa and Fante languages. In addition to the interviews, the first author embarked on field observations of the various ASM sites in the PBMA to document the mining methods and their impacts on water bodies. The recorded interviews were listened and transcribed verbatim in English by the first author for content validity. Next, the transcripts were given to the second author to check if there were translation errors. Afterwards, the first author read the field notes for overall understanding and subsequently for coding (identification of themes). We employed a reflexive thematic analytical approach to analyse the data because of its pragmatic and flexible approach to analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2020 ). The field notes were added to the transcript. The first author coded the data through repeated readings of the transcripts using a general inductive, experiential method. Codes were then grouped into themes on the impacts of ASM methods on water bodies and water use. Next, the first and second authors discussed the codes and the themes that emerged to check, refine and verify the themes as a true reflection of the interviewees’ responses or words. Following this, the first author discussed the themes with the other authors. After all authors had agreed on the themes, the data on the perceived impacts of ASM methods on water resources and water use were analysed and presented as our findings.  5 Findings 5.1 Community perceived impacts of ASM methods on water bodies (SDG 6.3) 5.1.1 Alluvial mining The alluvial mining process poses threat to water-related ecosystems. It directly pollutes rivers or streams and their catchment area. Alluvial mining has caused large tracts of land to be degraded in the PBMA; thus increasing erosion rate and river siltation. Interviewees indicate that traditional alluvial mining (dig and wash) does not destroy rivers or streams to a larger extent but the ‘more blade form’ of alluvial mining does so by creating massive destruction to water bodies and wetlands. Besides, because the ‘more blade form’ uses much water for processing, it severely impacts surface waters by polluting them and changing their colour. Alluvial miners, who use alluvial washing plants for processing mineralised materials, destroy a large proportion of surface waters due to their scale of production compared to ‘dig and wash’. Due to the nature of alluvial mining and the use of mercury (Hg) in the amalgamation process, many rivers/streams are polluted and contaminated with heavy metals in the area. Most streams in Prestea and Bondaye are filled with ‘somp’ 5  5 Waste mineralised materials after sluicing   and the others are made of muddy sand. On the other hand, 33 interviewees mentions that the impacts on groundwater are minor unless wastewater or contaminated water with mercury and other poisonous chemicals leach through the soil into ground water in water basins.6  6 Interviews with male and female miners July to September 2017, and July to October 2021   During heavy rainfall, heaps of disposed waste materials containing mercury are washed into streams and rivers. Regarding the forms of alluvial mining methods, dredging is considered the one with more severe impacts on surface waters because extraction and processing of gold-bearing deposits are done on rivers, particularly at the riverbed or bank. In relation to groundwater, the impact is not considered to be direct unless contaminated water with heavy metals leaches through the soil into aquifers and pollute them. Most interviewees perceive the impact of dredging on groundwater as more severe. While ASM causes land degradation and alteration of the ecosystem services, 10 artisanal/small-scale miners indicate that most local miners’ worked with environmental conservation principles in mind until the introduction of technologies by Chinese ‘gold seekers’ in the early 2000s, thus causing people to abandon indigenous knowledge of protecting water bodies. Some mention that instead of the government blaming local miners for working on rivers to extract gold, they should rather accuse the Chinese citizens who connive with the local people to do that.7  7 From interviews with one current and former executive member of the Small-scale Mining Association- Prestea Branch on 17 August 2017, Prestea, and also interviews with some small-scale miners   However, the ten (10) ASM operators emphasise that the government’s inability to stop Chinese and other foreign nationals from engaging in ASM with impunity is partly responsible for the current state and destruction of water bodies in the country.8  8 Interview with 10 ASM operators on 15 September 2021, Bondaye who stated this.   Concerning the ban, artisanal/small-scale miners blamed the National Democratic Congress (NDC) ruling government at the time for the devastation of local water bodies since it was during their tenure that Chinese citizens increasingly began engaging in ASM.9  9 From interviews of 8 small-scale miners on 26 - 28 July 2017, Prestea   An underground miner states that documentaries of informal gold mining on television show that Chinese-driven galamsey operations are the primary cause of the ban on ASM activities, which have affected some Ghanaian miners who do not use their technologies to extract gold.10  10 Interview with underground miner on 15 August 2017, Bondaye    5.1.2 Surface/open pit mining Our findings show that few small-scale miners engage in open-pit mining in the PBMA, especially those with licensed concessions. In most of the ASM sites visited, informal small-scale miners work in abandoned open pits of large-scale mining companies in the area. An executive member of SSMA – Prestea Branch clarifies that some ASM operators engage in ‘large area surface mining’ without the use of heavy machines and hence do not create large open pits unlike the large mining companies. Observation shows that water pumped from old open mine pits for processing of mineralised materials is mostly not channeled back into the pits. The wastewater and waste materials from gold processing meander their way into streams and rivers which contaminate them with mercury and other heavy metals. Such a processing technique has severe impacts on surface water. However, it has less or no impact on surface water, especially when the open pit miners channel the wastewater from their processing of mineralised materials to the mine pits, where the water used was pumped from.11  11 Interview with a mine site committee member at Papa Amolley site (Not Embolle), 24 July 2017, Bondaye   Many small-scale miners, who use Chinese diesel-powered machines for crushing mineralised materials into fine particles for sluicing, usually mount them close to riverbeds or banks to get water for their operation. Such practice greatly destroys water-related ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, and rivers in the areas of operations. For instance, River Ankobra and its catchment area in the district are greatly polluted as seen in its muddy colours.12  12 Interview with small-scale miner on 18 August 2017, Prestea   Similar to alluvial mining, surface mining has caused land degradation in the PBMA, thus exposing the degraded land to erosion and further creating a pathway for wastewater to drain into streams and rivers. Where wastewaste contains heavy metals such as mercury, rivers or streams get contaminated.  5.1.3 Underground mining Underground mining usually involves blasting and thus underground ‘ghetto’ miners use toxic chemicals (dynamites) to break the gold-bearing rock into fragments. Consequently, blasting produces cracks in rocks which cause wastewater to leach into underground water. This situation indirectly pollutes underground water with blasting agents. In some cases, it destroys underground water in water basins which provide sources of drinking water for some residents. A typical example is the spring water at Bondaye near Bondaye Mine Shaft. The local people call it ‘Korikori’. The destruction of Korikori was due to a synergetic effect of both underground and surface mining operations. Observations show that ASM operators near Prestea Goldfields School employ different mining methods, for example, alluvial and underground mining for gold extraction and use water from streams for processing. These operations have created synergic impacts on the environment. Most interviewees report that underground ‘ghetto’ mining does impact surface water only when the wastewater from underground mines is pumped to the surface and drained into rivers or streams. The potential of underground mining to pollute or contaminate rivers/streams also depends on whether the underground mining is closer to such water bodies. More so, activities of underground ‘ghetto’ mining has fewer implications for rivers/streams given that its effects are indirect.13  13 Interview with underground and alluvial miners on 18 July 2017 and 14 September 2021, Bondaye respectively.   Underground ‘ghetto’ miners interviewed emphasise that all artisanal/small-scale miners should engage in this form of ASM and, therefore, issues of environmental pollution would not cause the government to ban ASM activities as thousands of people, especially rural people depend on it as their source of livelihood. However, such suggestions can limit the innovation in the ASM sector. About twenty-nine (29) interviewees perceive underground ‘ghetto’ mining to have a severe impact on underground water.  5.1.4 Summary: perceived impacts of ASM methods on the quality of water resources Our findings show that ASM methods directly or indirectly impact surface and ground water. The extraction and the processing of minerals determine the severity of the impacts on water resources. Interviewees also perceive the impacts of ASM methods on rivers and streams through their turbidity (as seen in the colour of the rivers and streams). Observations show that increasing informal ASM operations cause deforestation, which in turn contributes to degraded water quality through erosion, soil sedimentation, and alteration of riverbeds.  Table 4 , below, summarises perceived impacts of each mining method on surface and underground water bodies.   5.2 Perceived impacts of ASM methods on water use Our findings show that due to intensive alluvial mining activities in the study area, many rivers have been dried up and contaminated with heavy metals, which no longer provide access to water resources for domestic use. A female sub-chief at Bondaye notes that Chang fa operations (alluvial mining)  have contaminated surface and ground waters with chemicals, destroying sources of drinking water in the area. She further states that; Chang fa operations have affected our source of drinking. Now, no one can use that yellowish and dark river water to cook or drink. We buy pure water (sachet water) and drink it. For cooking, there is a community pipe stand to get water. You see [to first author] that we do not drink Korikori anymore .   Additionally, a current executive member of SSMA – Prestea Branch emphasises that small-scale miners are not supposed to operate near the rivers or work in them, but some nonchalant citizens still do it.14  14 Interview with one current executive member of the Small-scale Mining Association – Prestea Branch on 13 August 2017, Prestea   We find that most residents do not use water from rivers for cooking or drinking. Those who use it put their health at risk. Thus, 29 interviewees reported that rivers contaminated with mercury and other toxic chemicals create health problems for people who drink water from them or use it to bathe. For instance, a male miner at Bondaye notes that; I got skin rashes after bathing in the rivers here [ASM site]. Then I realised that I cannot bathe in the river. Sometimes, it is not the chemicals that make people get skin rashes, but the water is not good. Just look at the colour. It was not like that when we were not working here.    Also, a female miner at Prestea reports that; When I was young and we went to our farm, which was on the Bondaye to Gambia road, we drank water from a stream, it was white and not dirty. Now, the colour of the stream is yellowish, and we cannot drink it anymore. It is destroyed by Chang fa operators [alluvial miners] who are working close to the stream. It is sad that now people buy sachet water when going to farm.    Thirty-four (34) interviewees express that due to water pollution and contamination in the area, water from rivers can no longer be used for irrigation because it contains mercury. Besides, mercury in soil and sedimentation have made tracts of wetlands unsuitable for farming. For instance, farming cannot take place in some low-lying lands since they have become muddy. Eight (8) retired ASM operators stress that even after the ban on ASM operations, people are still not able to use water from rivers for domestic purposes. Further, almost four and half years after the ban, the colour of the rivers polluted by ASM operations remains the same.   6 Discussion SDGs provide a reference point for development policies to deal with social issues and improve the well-being of people. The SDGs also provide institutional capacity to protect freshwater. Our findings on the perceived impacts of ASM methods on water resources suggest that Ghana’s aim to achieve the overall targets of SDG 6 on Clean Water by 2030 may be threatened by ASM operations. As is shown in Table 4 , ASM methods have adverse impacts on water quality (SDG 6.3) and water resources that provide water for cooking, drinking, and irrigation purpose (SDG 6.4). In Ghana, the government is making efforts towards achieving the targets of SDG 6 related to Clean Water. Data from WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene show that 41 % of the Ghanaian population uses a safely managed drinking water service (SDG indicator 6.1.1, 2020) (WHO and UNICEF, 2021 ). Access to safe drinking water is a human right and has been a goal of national and international policy frameworks (Bains et al., 2020 ). Therefore, governments in Africa must prioritise interventions, including environmental protection programs to ensure that the extractive industries do not affect such rights. Yet, efforts in Ghana have not sufficiently addressed ASM problems. As a result, ASM activities have affected ground and surface water resources and polluted/contaminated rivers with heavy metals. This situation increases the water treatment cost of the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) as this state institution relies on surface water bodies like river Pra, Densu and Ankobra for water supply to various communities. For instance, in 2017, the GWCL ‘shut down a water treatment plant due to the extreme pollution and high cost of treatment’ (Samuel et al., 2018 : 111). Such situation affected the capacity of GWCL to achieve equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water to Ghanaians. It is established that alluvial mining methods that use mercury in the amalgamation process greatly contaminate rivers (e.g. Hilson, 2006 ; Nartey et al., 2011 ). Currently, as indicated in  Table 5 , the policy framework of ASM and poor knowledge of ASM methods could make it difficult for the country to achieve the SDG 6 targets related to Clean Water. In other countries (e.g. Guyana), research shows that ASM could help Guyana to meet economic-related SDG targets but ‘at a significant social and environmental cost’ (Laing and Moonsammy, 2021 : 147). In Ghana, alluvial mining, particularly dredging and other destructive alluvial mining techniques such as ‘the more blade’ have great potential to undermine water quality through water pollution (Target 6.3). Due to the impact of these ASM methods, there is little hope of ASM ensuring sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity (Target 6.4) in the country (see Table 5 ). The integrated water resources management in Ghana’s ASM policy framework does not provide specific and detailed guidelines to address the negative impacts of ASM on water resources. Thus, the current ASM policy could be improved to ensure sustainable mining practices. Moreover, the current mining methods used in the ASM sector cannot help in improving water quality (Target 6.3) but rather lead to the drying up, pollution, and heavy metal contamination of surface water bodies. ASM methods that cause deforestation, in turn, affect water quality through erosion, river sedimentation and alteration of riverbeds. The risk of not considering water quality has dire consequences (Samuel et al., 2018 ). Studies have shown that the concentration of mercury (Hg), Lead (Pb), Arsenic (As), and Cadmium (Cd) in rivers contaminated by informal gold mining activities exceeds that of WHO’s recommended guidelines for safe drinking water (e.g. Affum et al., 2016 ; Saim et al., 2021 ). Research conducted on ASM in the Western Region of Ghana shows that ‘water quality was significantly affected by turbidity, followed by manganese and iron, leading to a water quality index at least 500 % higher than the upper limit for potability’ (Bansah et al., 2018 : 465). The ban on ASM and increased use of military, police and other security personnel for monitoring have not eventually been effective in reducing mercury and metallic pollutants used in ASM (Saim, 2021 ). Studies have also highlighted poor water quality in mining communities (e.g. Barenblitt et al., 2021 ; Forkuor et al., 2020 ). Understanding community perceptions of the impacts of economic activity on their livelihoods and the environment is essential for the development of policy aiming to promote sustainable development (Zapata et al., 2010 ). An ASM policy offering potential to integrate community’s views in water resource management is the Community Mining Scheme (CMS) implemented in 2019. The CMS aims to decentralise ASM operations by granting prospective small-scale miners a mining license to work through the support of the district/municipal assembly. Currently, the scheme does not offer additional information concerning what ASM methods should be used nor advice on the measures to ensure environmental sustainability. The creation of a platform within the CMS for communities to voice their concerns and contribute to water resources management would be a contribution towards SDG 6, target 6.b ‘support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management’. The issue of informal gold mining (galamsey) as a cause of the destruction of water bodies in the country is overstretched in the media. Even with the registered ASM operations, most do not adhere to any environmental regulations though the ASM policy framework requires small-scale miners to minimise the impacts of their activities on the environment, especially on water bodies. Thus, if critical attention is not given, the government could spend huge sums of money to reclaim damaged land and clean polluted water resources (Li et al., 2021a ). As is identified in Table 5 , the country has not managed to meet the stated SDG 6 targets on clean water, that poses critical concerns for the nation’s contribution to the achievement of the global SDGs. Although there are national policies that include achieving sustainable management of surface water bodies, attention has not been given to the various ASM methods and their negative impacts on water systems. Additionally, most ASM operations are conducted in a ‘hit and run manner’ because of their illegal or informal status (Arthur-Holmes and Abrefa Busia, 2021 ). Therefore, protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, rivers, and aquifers remains a serious challenge. This situation is seen as an environmental problem, yet poverty is increasingly pushing many people in rural areas into informal gold mining. Thus, to reduce the diverse adverse impacts of mining methods employed in the ASM sector, water quality and water-related ecosystem assessment could be done regularly to make effective changes in the policy framework guiding ASM activities in Ghana. Even if these checks cannot be done on a large scale due to inadequate resources and logistics, government officials including representatives of EPA and Minerals Institutions at the district level can focus on ASM operations within their jurisdiction rather than rely on resources from the centralised state institutions for directions. To understand the environmental impacts of ASM, evidence points to large-scale mining ‘bias’ and complexities of licensing processes as drivers of informality in Africa’s ASM sector and in Ghana more specifically (e.g. Hilson et al., 2022 ; Pedersen et al., 2021 ). Several scholars have highlighted that the regulatory framework of ASM in African countries, for example Ghana, Zimbabwe, Liberia and Mozambique have impacted the governments’ efforts to bring informal ASM operations into the formal sector (e.g. Hilson and Maconachie, 2020c ; Van Bockstael, 2014 ). The alleged failure of African governments and mining institutions to identify the needs of artisanal or small-scale miners has generated a cumbrous legal and policy framework (Hilson et al., 2014 ). This prevailing dynamic coupled with delays in issuing mining permits and costly application fees have discouraged prospective small-scale miners to operate legally (Hilson and Potter, 2005 ). In Ghana, the government tends to favour large-scale mining by prioritising its activities and providing tax breaks to attract foreign investment needed to develop large-scale extractive industry (Hilson, 2017, 2019 ). Further to this, Hilson (2019)  emphasised that the policy framework that exists for extractive industries in most African countries is characterised by what he refers to as a large-scale mining ‘bias’, which enables ‘governments to secure steady streams of revenue in the form of taxes, rents and permit fees from large-scale mining and mineral exploration companies with relative ease’ (Hilson et al., 2020b : 2) while failing to show commitment to growing the ASM sector. Hilson and Yakovleva (2007)  also noted that the release of large concessions to multinational mining companies has deprived communities in Prestea of fertile lands for farming, therefore, causing some to engage in informal gold mining. In the PBMA and some other mining communities in Ghana, local people find it difficult to have piece of land to register for a mining permit. Consequently, they resort to informal ASM operations, which are intensifying the destruction of water bodies in the area. Relevant to the foregoing discussion, most people who operate in the informal ASM spaces do not have the requisite knowledge about environmental management practices to minimise the impact of their activities on water systems. Therefore, the promotion of education and training, through formal and informal education- such as peer-to-peer learning should be a priority (Vazquez-Brust et al., 2009 ) As part of addressing the ASM challenge in Ghana, the CMS, if fused with a list of Designated Areas  (for ASM) has the potential to tackle situations affecting progress towards SDG 6, especially ‘where the rent-seeking behaviour linked to ASM licensing is pervasive and a large-scale mining “bias” is embedded’ (Hilson et al., 2022 : 224). The decentralised system of ASM licensing, therefore, ‘requires engagement and demands greater input from local governments to execute and monitor’ (ibid., 221). Finally, in alignment with SDG 6.5 ‘Implement integrated water resource management at all levels’, we take a leaf from the literature about integrated water resource management (IWRM), where IWRM is seen as a ‘place-based nexus for multiple actors to consensually and communicatively integrate strategic decisions’ (Saravanan et al., 2009 : 77). Integration through coordination, cooperation and citizen engagement are key principles of IWRM (Di Vaio et al., 2021 ) which are yet to be embedded in Ghana’s water management policies (Erdiaw-Kwasie et al., 2020 ). Research demonstrates that water and land risks overlap in mining regions (Kunz et al., 2022 ). We suggest that policy-makers and researchers should work on the development of an agenda bridging integrative water resource governance and mineral resource governance, where CMS could have a strategically integrative role. Integrated water management literature offers examples of good practice in the correction of pervasive bias and power differences. Four (4) relates to our community-based findings and can be highlighted as areas for further research to investigate its adaptation in the context of ASM challenges: provide opportunities to share and deliberate available information; decentralise licenses for resource use, regulation and monitoring; build the capacity of local strategic actors to design rules; build the capacity of disadvantaged actors to make their views heard and integrate indigenous knowledge and rules in water resources management framework (Saravanan et al., 2009 ; Di Vaio et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2021b ).  7 Conclusion This paper contributes to the debate on formalisation of ASM in Africa by offering insights into ASM methods in Ghana and their implications for water resources against the targets of SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation. We argue that ASM methods impact surface and ground water differently and pollute water systems with heavy metals through direct and indirect channels. Specifically, environmental impacts of mining methods vary depending on the extent of water and soil pollution, with the dredging form of alluvial mining being the most impactful and underground mining the less impactful - although still damaging. Mercury used in sluicing and amalgamation drains into surface waters and contaminate them. Also, wastewater pumped from underground ‘ghetto’ mines containing blasting agents pollute surface waters. We find that the government ban on ASM operations cannot help the country meet the targets of SDG 6 on Clean Water. The ban has made people resort to illegal mining activities at night, hence driving the ‘informality’ further to ‘illegality’ (Bansah, 2019 ). It is clear how ASM methods destroy ground and surface water which serve as sources of water for domestic and irrigation purposes. Ghana’s Minerals Commission and other stakeholders need to consider legislating a bill to prevent people from adopting dredging method in extracting gold bearing in mind its severe impacts on water bodies. Finally, we argue that critical attention needs to be paid to the ASM methods when designing environmental policies to reduce water pollution and contamination in Ghana. We suggest that having and sharing information on the impacts of ASM methods on water resources from the perspectives of traditional leaders and artisanal/small-scale miners will help influence the strategic adoption of effective environmental management practices and regulations in the ASM sector. We also suggest that stakeholder integration practices applied in integrated water resource management offer promising avenues for the governance of the ASM sector. As noted by Vazquez-Brust et al. (2009) , addressing the environmental challenges of low-income communities in Africa require a comprehensive stakeholder integration, where customary leaders and chiefs are central players; it also requires giving more voice and agency to artisanal miners, for instance, promoting local and regional artisanal mining associations that can later engage in political discussions. Moreover, the CMS as part of formalisation efforts of informal gold mining in Ghana has the potential to challenge the large-scale mining ‘bias’ and address the galamsey challenge that contributes to the increasing impact on the environment, especially on water resources. Empowering communities within the CMS to have a stronger monitoring and decision-making role in terms of ASM impact on water bodies will also directly contribute to SDG 6.b ‘support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management’. Since Ghana’s ASM framework and policy interventions provide directions for other African countries which face similar ASM concerns, the CMS with consideration of the environmental impacts of ASM methods has the capacity to address issues including the large-scale mining ‘bias’, formalisation hurdles, environmental protection and monitoring, and unsustainable mining practices which hinder the growth of the ASM sector in Africa.
