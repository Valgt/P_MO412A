                  Accelerated urbanization and population expansion present substantial pressures on the built environment, particularly in terms of inadequate space and pronounced inequality of building provision. A comprehensive understanding of building space provision and inequality of city remains constrained. This study utilizes high-quality building structure data and fine-scale gridded population product to investigate the building space provision and inequality across 67 Chinese cities from a three-dimensional (3-D) perspective. We integrate both dimensions of building space provision and inequality to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the built environment. With an overall average building volume per capita (perBV: 517.67 m3 /person) and Gini measures (BV-Gini: 0.497), our study reveals that tier-1 cities suffer shortage of building space, while rapidly developing tier-2 cities are confronted with high degree of inequality. The results indicate that urban areas are characterized by a more limited building space provision (perBV: 1,074.52m3/person for rural, and 500.83 m3/person for urban) and higher inequality (BV-Gini: 0.494 for urban, and 0.427 for rural) compared to rural areas. This study provides valuable insights into comprehension of the built environment from 3-D building perspective toward achieving adequate and equitable building space, consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the principles of New Urban Agenda.

Accelerated urbanization and population expansion present substantial pressures on the built environment, particularly in terms of inadequate space and pronounced inequality of building provision. A comprehensive understanding of building space provision and inequality of city remains constrained. This study utilizes high-quality building structure data and fine-scale gridded population product to investigate the building space provision and inequality across 67 Chinese cities from a three-dimensional (3-D) perspective. We integrate both dimensions of building space provision and inequality to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the built environment. With an overall average building volume per capita (perBV : 517.67 m3  /person) and Gini measures (BV-Gini : 0.497), our study reveals that tier-1 cities suffer shortage of building space, while rapidly developing tier-2 cities are confronted with high degree of inequality. The results indicate that urban areas are characterized by a more limited building space provision (perBV : 1,074.52m3 /person for rural, and 500.83 m3 /person for urban) and higher inequality (BV-Gini : 0.494 for urban, and 0.427 for rural) compared to rural areas. This study provides valuable insights into comprehension of the built environment from 3-D building perspective toward achieving adequate and equitable building space, consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the principles of New Urban Agenda.

Although serving as a crucial service provider, the building sector is widely recognized to be one of the most consequential contributors to multidimensional urban sustainability development issues on a global scale (Scrucca et al., 2023 ). These challenges span environmental and social domains, notably in urban energy consumption (e.g., building is responsible for ∼36 % of global final energy consumption and 37 % of global energy related CO2  emissions (Pan & Zhang, 2020 ; UNEP, 2021 )) (Güneralp et al., 2017 ), urban heat island (Yin et al., 2018 ), as well as health problems and human wellbeing (Altomonte et al., 2020 ). Continuous urbanization and exponential urban population growth have posed the built environment to be one of the greatest challenges with increasing stress and urban density in recent decades (Scrucca et al., 2023 Ferrer, Thomé, & Scavarda, 2018; Scrucca, Ingrao, Barberio, Matarazzo, & Lagioia, 2023 ). According to UH Habitat, roughly 2.8 billion people are estimated to be affected by different forms of housing inadequacy, of which close to 1.1 billion reside in slums and informal settlements (UN, 2023 ), indicating the overcrowding problem and lack of living space in the built environment. These challenges are projected to intensify, with cities hosting over half the world's population since 2007, and projected to reach 60 % by 2030, and 70 % by 2050 (UN, 2022 ). Urbanization also brings about significant inequality in the built environment (Pandey et al., 2022 ), exacerbated by substantial migration both between and within cities. Particularly concerning is the impact of the poor equality of building space on urban sustainability (Scrucca et al., 2023 ; Sun et al., 2020 ), economic growth (Calderón & Servén, 2014 ), and the spread of infections like COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2021 ). These challenges may be especially pronounced in China, considering the projection that the urban population will grow by 255 million by the year 2050 (UN 2019 ). Thus, understanding the patterns of building space provision and inequality is a pressing need to guide sustainable urban development (Thacker et al., 2019 ), especially in areas such as China that are under specific contexts of enduring long-term stress to the built environment due to rapid urbanization. However, how to improve and manage the built environment toward sustainable development remains a challenge. There is limited information and discussion on building space patterns, particularly with regard to the adequate provision and equitable allocation of building space in cities for their populations. Deeper insights into the building space provision resources and the equality level within city holds significant importance for various reasons. Firstly, measuring the supply and allocation of building space to the population directly reflects the living space provision and inequality within urban building conditions (Ghosh et al., 2020 ). Employing proper quantification methods, assessing building space provision and inequality becomes a valuable means to evaluate the sustainability performance of the built environment, thereby helping with urban planning and management. Secondly, the strategic role of building space provision and inequality is directly related to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the principles of the New Urban Agenda. Building sector has been demonstrated its direct and indirect impacts on achieving 13 goals and 25 targets of 2030 SDG Agenda (Adshead et al., 2019 ; Omer & Noguchi, 2020 ), spanning people's health and well-being, renewable energy; sustainable communities and cities, etc. (Omer & Noguchi, 2020 ; Scrucca et al., 2023 ). Specifically, on the one hand, detailed insights into the building space provision and inequality can indeed address various SDGs sectoral goals, such as poverty reduction (SDG 1), good health and well-being (SDG 3), economic growth (SDG 8), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), and climate action (SDG 13). The building space provision is directly connected to the issue of inadequate housing, a key focus of sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) as highlighted by UH Habitat. This is especially relevant to target 11.1 of SDG , which aims to estimate the indicator of the proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing. Moreover, comprehending the building space inequality can directly participate in the achievement of SDG 11 and indirectly contribute to reducing social inequality (aligns with SDG 10) (Ghosh et al., 2020 ; Reddy & Leslie, 2015 ). On the other hand, the New Urban Agenda emphasizes the need for cities to provide high-quality buildings and public spaces and to promote the role of affordable and sustainable housing (Caprotti et al., 2017 ; Satterthwaite, 2016 ). Thus, the building space analysis can help identify areas of unsustainable building resource usage, providing valuable quantitative results that can be used to monitor progress towards the goals of the New Urban Agenda. Lastly, understanding existing building space provision and inequality is pivotal to ensuring equitable access and opportunities to public resources in the future, given the built environment patterns persist over extended periods (Pandey et al., 2022 ; Thacker et al., 2019 ). Despite the critical role of understanding building spaces in advancing urban sustainability management, this field is marked by prominent gaps. Most notably, there is a lack of integrated analyses that incorporate two crucial dimensions: building space provision and inequality within cities, which provides insights into both the availability and distribution of building space resources. Existing practices involve manual measurement, using metrics such as estimated Persons per room (PPR) from American Community Surveys (Blake, Kellerson, & Simic, 2007 ) or per capita building area from China Population Census (http://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/ndsj/ ), or the household surveys (Patel et al., 2014 ). These survey-based methods, while resource-intensive and lacking spatial details for different scales, typically measure horizontal building space based on per room or per area, overlooking the valuable vertical aspect. Thanks to up-to-date remote-sensing-based products and advanced GIS technologies, they offer high temporal and spatial resolution materials for investigating building space provision and inequality from regions to scales (Li et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2022 ; Zhou et al., 2022 ). For instance, the building volume per capita is a helpful measure to quantify the building space provision within cities in a vertical aspect (Ghosh et al., 2020 ; Reddy & Leslie, 2015 ). This information can be derived from fine-scale three-dimensional (3-D) building structure data with height information, coupled with population data, enabling multi-scale analysis and detailed spatial insights. Numerous sources like OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org ), Microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/building-footprints ), and the Worldpop Data (https://www.worldpop.org/datacatalog/ ) offer high-quality, public, and free building structure and population products. Prior research focused on discussing the urban-rural infrastructure provisioning gaps, (Pandey et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2022 ), but comprehensive investigation into building space inequality, including disparities both within cities and between urban and rural areas, remains unexplored. These gaps limit our understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of building space provision and inequality on achieving urban sustainability. This study introduces an approach to quantitatively analyze the building space provision and inequality from a 3-D building perspective. Given China's unique urbanization and development context, it serves as an essential case study for sustainable building space management. We employ high-quality 3-D building structure data and fine-scale gridded population data to examine the provision and inequality of building space in 67 Chinese cities, using two proxies of building volume per capita (perBV ) and the Gini coefficient (BV-Gini ). We further integrate these measures into a conceptual framework to study the building space patterns in terms of two dimensions: building space provision and inequality. More specifically, our analysis delves into the heterogeneities of building space provision and inequality across the studied cities, encompassing national and local spatial patterns as well as variations between urban and rural areas. Additionally, we develop a linear regression model to understand how urbanization drivers correlate with building space inequality. Through our analysis, we aim to provide an in-depth understanding of the current patterns and, more critically, the degrees of building space provision and inequality in cities of China from a 3-D building perspective, which is instrumental in promoting the development of urban sustainability. In summary, the main focus of this study is on the following three research questions. (1) Firstly, what is the pattern of building space in cities of China considering both the adequacy of provision and the equality of allocation? (2) Secondly, what is the variation of the provision and inequality of building space among selected cities and between the urban-rural areas of these cities? (3) Thirdly, what are the key drivers of the observed building space inequalities? Apart from unswerving these questions, we also anticipate that the research framework established in this study holds promising potentials for generalization and application across a wide range of global regions.  2 Study area and materials 2.1 Study data In our analyses of investigating building space provision and inequality, we selected interested cities based on two key criteria: (1) the high-resolution spatial data, including detailed information on building structures and population, should be available with complete spatial details for the selected city; (2) the selection aimed to encompass cities at different stages of urban development, considering factors such as population size, economic level, and overall city size. This selection strategy can ensure a representative analysis of building space heterogeneity and inner patterns (e.g., between urban and rural areas) among Chinese cities. Following our selection criteria, we reviewed the public data sources for building structure and population information. Overall, 67 cities in mainland China, including 26 capital cities of provinces or autonomous regions, were selected as the focus of our study on investigating building space provision and inequality. More specifically, these cities are grouped into five tiers according to the city classification system published by China Business Network (CBN) in 2016 (CBNweekly, 2016 ). The spatial distributions and city tiers of the 67 interested cities are illustrated in Fig. 1  . These cities, in fact, are on a continuous path of growth in urban size, population, and economic development, as outlined in China's urbanization plan. This growth could potentially create substantial challenges for the built environment. Our analysis of building space provision and inequality in these representative cities, each at a different stage of urbanization and situated in various regions, is expected to provide valuable insights for planners and decision-makers regarding the current state of building space across Chinese cities.  2.2 Materials and preprocessing To effectively measure the building space provision and inequality for cities, we mainly utilized four fundamental categories of data (as shown in Table 1  ), including building structure, population, land-use data, and administrative boundaries. Specifically, the building structure and population data are adopted to provide the information and spatial details of building space and the distribution of population for cities. Moreover, we employed land use data to filter buildings from other types of land, which contain areas with specific land uses including industrial, transportation, and undeveloped land, to prevent their potential effects. The administrative boundaries are adopted as the fundamental materials applied to multi-scale aggregation analysis. In addition, we have collected multidimensional urbanization drivers to analyze their correlation with inequality, the specific drivers will be introduced in Section 3.4  together with the methodology. 2.2.1 High-quality building structure data Infrastructure services, integral to the preocess of urbanization, facilitate a multitude of urban activities. Buildings, in particular, provide the primary spaces where individuals reside and engage in various activities (Pandey, Brelsford, & Seto, 2022; Reddy & Leslie, 2015 ) . Here we employ high-quality building footprint with height information obtained from Baidu Map of 2015 (Table 1 ). The building data utilized in our study is expected to offer a comprehensive 3-D view of the building space in reality, providing details that surpass the limitations at a 2-D perspective, such as only considering the floor area of a building. This selection allows us to acquire more information and spatial details of building space in a low-cost, fast and time-efficient manner compared to the traditional surveying. During the selection of cities, to ensure the completeness of building data in terms of attributes and spatial coverage, we conducted the visual inspections to check the building outlines with high-resolution satellite images. In total, we collected over 11 million high-quality building footprint data with vertical height information across 67 cities in mainland China.  2.2.2 Population data To explore the allocation of building space to the population, we adopted a gridded population product produced by WorldPop at a high resolution of 100 m (see Table 1 ). Specifically, the gridded population data are generated based on a "top-down" methodology that disaggregates administrative unit-based census and projection counts to approximately 100 m grid cells with detailed spatial patterns. This population data can provide a flexible manner to aggregate population estimates into different spatial units, which has been widely applied into supporting various urban studies and analyses (Lloyd et al., 2017 ; Tatem, 2017 ). Based on the data, the building space allocated to people can be measured up to the resolution of 100 m and aggregated over various levels of administrative units. In our analysis, the gridded population data were processed and derived through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform by selecting the year of 2015.  2.2.3 Land-use data To focus the building space analysis on most active zones of the city and to avoid the potentially bias caused by other areas of buildings, we adopted a land-use data for a preprocessed filtering. Given the current lack of consistent and complete building function information (e.g., building types such as residential building, commercial facilities, and public services) for all the studies cities, we employed a fine-scale land-use map (Table 1 ) of 2015 as the spatial filtering to preprocess the building structure and population data. Specifically, the land use data contains three urban land use types, including urban, rural and other land, which has been widely applied to different regional studies (Lian et al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2017 ). We used the land-use data to exclude buildings in areas with other special land uses such as industrial, transportation, and undeveloped land, to avoid potential impacts and calculation bias. Moreover, this land-use data allowed us to identify urban and rural areas and investigate the urban-rural disparity for further discussion.  2.2.4 Administrative boundaries Multiple geographical scales, from macro- to micro-perspectives, are essential to reveal the spatial heterogeneity across regions (Li et al., 2022 ). We adopted the administrative boundaries for the aggregate analysis to give insight to the building space from different scales. The aggregation of building space is further expected to support as quantitative measurements for understanding urban morphology and to discuss its associations related to urbanization. In particular, the administrative boundaries are obtained from the China Resource and Environment Science and Data Center (Table 1 ), which provides high-quality urban administrative hierarchical divisions from national, city to county level.    3 Research design 3.1 Methodology framework To give an in-depth investigation of building space provision and inequality for cities, we devised and implemented metrics to examine the patterns of building space. As illustrated in Fig. 2  , our analysis and subsequent discussion consisted of following primary components: (1) Quantifying of building space provision (building volume per capita, perBV ) and the inequality (Gini coefficient, BV-Gini ) based on fine-scale building structure and gridded population data. We adopted these two metrics to estimate the overall provision and inequality of building space from a 3-D perspective within the studied cities. (2) Exploring the heterogeneity patterns of building space by taking two dimensions i.e., the provision (the level of perBV ) and inequality (the level of BV-Gini ), into the one unified framework (the matrix analysis shown in Fig. 4 ). (3) Evaluating the urban-rural building space disparity. The disparity of building space between urban and rural areas is investigated based on the comparison of provision and inequality between the two areas. We also explore the potential impact of the urban-rural provision gap on the city's inequality through Pearson analysis. (4) Exploring the association of spatial drivers (including aspects of natural elements, urban morphology, and urbanization) on building space inequality (measured by BV-Gini) using the Ordinary Least Squares regression model.  3.2 Measurement of building space provision To examine the building space provision within the cities, we utilized a proxy, namely the building volume per capita (perBV ), as a standard measurement. The perBV , calculated using building structure data and gridded population data, offers a more cost-effective and efficient evaluation of overall building space conditions with spatial details, compared to traditional community housing surveys such as the American Community Surveys and household surveys in China (Ghosh et al., 2020 ). It can be typically defined as follows:(1) p e r B V i  = V i  P i          where V i    and P i    indicates the aggerated building volume and population in region i  , respectively. To derive the regional perBV  based on building structure and gridded population data, we applied a series of preprocessing steps: (1) removed original building structure vector data with invalid height (e.g., zero values); (2) aggregated the building structure vector data to derive the total building volume gridded data at the same resolution as WorldPop population gridded data (i.e., ∼100 m); (3) masked the gridded building volume and population data for built-up area based on the high-resolution land-use map (i.e., restrictions from urban and rural areas of land-use map). (4) derived the perBV  indicators at national, city, and county scales for both global, urban, and rural regions by dividing regional total volume by the population. These approaches allow us to capture the heterogeneity of building space conditions both between (i.e., national, city, and county scales) and within regions (i.e., global, urban, and rural). Moreover, given that the city level is the basic unit that holds the respective urban planning and management in China, we mainly focus on evaluating building space provision and inequality at the city scale, while also providing national and district-scale data for discussion. The data were processed using the GEE platform and the indicators were calculated using Python 3.9.  3.3 Examining building space inequality in cities To quantify the building space inequality in cities, we calculated the modified Gini coefficient to derive the BV-Gini based on spatial building structure and gridded population data. As one of the most widely used tools for measuring inequality, the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient were adopted in this study, which has been applied across various scientific disciplines such as renewable energy (Millward-Hopkins, 2022 ; Wang et al., 2023 ), environmental studies (Chen et al., 2022 ; Han et al., 2023 ), and, urban sustainability(Xu et al., 2022 ; Zhou et al., 2022 ). Generally, the Gini coefficient can be defined mathematically based on the Lorenz curves as follows:(2) G i n i = A A + B          where A is the area between the Lorenz curve and the equality line, and B is the area below the Lorenz line (illustrated in Fig. 3  ). In this study, the building space Lorenz curve was defined as a ranked distribution of the cumulative percentage of the population on the horizontal axis versus the cumulative percentage of the building volume distributed along the vertical axis. Specifically, we graphed the cumulative percentage of the total building volume (y) that is cumulatively shared by x% of the population. This computational step allowed us to assess building space inequality across cities, quantified by the BV-Gini index. The BV-Gini coefficient is determined by the equation:(3) B V − G i n i = 1 − ∑ j = 1  n  ( P j  − P j − 1    )  ( V j  + V j − 1    )         where n is the number of units in a city (i.e., the grid cell in this study), P j    is the cumulative proportion of population; V j    is the cumulative proportion of building volume allocated by the corresponding group of people. The BV­Gini  coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. Similarly, we examined the BV-Gini  coefficient at city level with overall, urban, and rural sectors, utilizing the GEE platform and Python 3.9.  3.4 Investigating building space patterns of cities To explicitly investigate the building space patterns to inform sustainable management, we proposed a framework to conceptualize the interrelation between building space provision and inequality within the selected cities by applying a matrix analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 4  , the matrix is developed based on two dimensions of our measurements on building space: the level of perBV  and the level of BV-Gini . A high to low value of perBV  values on the x-axis indicates of the adequate to inadequate building space provision, while the y-axis denotes high to low level of building space inequality (i.e., the values of BV-Gini ). Hence, these two dimensions establish four quadrants that delineate distinct building space patterns, offering a framework for helping with sustainable management of the built environment. In particular, four building space patterns for Chinese cities were summarized in Table 2  . For instance, cities with adequate building space and equal distribution are characterized as having sustainable building provision, which are classified as a High-Low pattern mainly distributed in Quadrant IV. Similarly, cities exhibiting an unbalanced pattern of building provision suggest that the current level of building space provision or equality is insufficient to support the sustainable development of built environment. These cities can be categoried into two patterns: the High-High pattern with an adequate provision and high inequality distributed in Quadrant II, and the Low-Low pattern with an inadequate provision and low inequality distributed in Quadrant III. Ultimately, cities with inadequate provision and high-level inequality of building space are considered as the unsustainable building space, indicating the urgent need to improve their building space in to create adequate and equitable communities. Such cities are shown a Low-High pattern primarily distributed in Quadrant I.  3.5 Drivers of building space inequality Inequality in building space is a complex issue, which could be influenced by various multidimensional drivers, including spatial configuration, natural conditions, and urbanization (Chen et al., 2022 ; Pandey et al., 2022 ). In this study, we gathered a range of variables from open-source databases to explore their associations with building space inequality, which are shown in Table 3  . The variables were classified into six categories: geographic attributes (latitude and longitude of the regional center), topographic features (elevation and aspect), socioeconomic variables (Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per capita GDP), transportation variables (road density), urban morphology variables (morphological parameters from both horizontal and vertical perspectives, such as the building coverage ratio, building volume density), and, urbanization index (features characterizing the degree of regional urbanization, such as the nighttime light intensity). To understand how the spatial drivers were associated with the inequality, we conducted liner model to investigate their correlations between the variables and the BV-Gini . We first aggregated the available variables into city and district scales using mean, standard deviation, sum, and coefficient of variation (CV) values, and then preprocessed them through min-max normalization and log transformation. Pearson correlation coefficient of the variables and BV-Gini  were calculated to select the significantly correlated variables with the inequality. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model was developed for our discussion, which can be defined as follows:(4) B V − G i n i = β 1  d 1  + β 2  d 2  + … + β n  d n  + ε         where B V − G i n i    and d n    are the inequality measured by BV-Gini  and spatial drivers listed in Table 3 . n is the total number of drivers, which in this study was 13.   4 Results 4.1 Overall patterns of building space provision and inequality Using building structure and gridded population data, we investigated the building space provision and inequality patterns of 67 Chinese cities based on the two metrics: perBV  and BV-Gini . Overall, our findings showed that the building space provision for people and the BV-Gini  in China were approximately 517.67 m3 /person and 0.497, respectively (Fig. 5   (a) and (b)). As shown in Fig. 5 , we observed a significant decrease in median perBV  values from tier-5 to tier-1 (noted that the median for tier-5 cities may be biased due to the small sample), indicating that higher city development level corresponds to a more limited building space provision. However, BV-Gini  values revealed that tier-2 cities had greater inequality compared to the tier-1 cities. In Fig. 6  (a), we present the classification of the selected cities into four distinct building space patterns based on perBV  and BV-Gini  with illustrating their proportion and density estimation. More specifically, we observe that ∼62.7 % of Chinese cities exhibit an unbalanced pattern of building space. This pattern manifests in two ways: adequate building space but greater inequality (quadrant II with high perBV  and BV-Gini  values (H H) in Fig. 6 (a)) or relatively equal building distribution but inadequate space (quadrant III with low perBV  and BV-Gini  values (L-L) in Fig. 6 (a)). These unbalanced building space patterns are primarily observed in northern and coastal cities of China (Fig. 6 (b)). Furthermore, our result also reveals an l -L pattern with relatively equal building distribution but inadequate space among megacities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hongkong (Fig. 5 (a) and (b)). Specifically, these five tier-1 cities serve as the main economic centers of China and have shortage in building space provision, which are ∼31.15 %, ∼43.52 %, ∼32.32 %, ∼18.82 % and ∼57.61 % below average perBV  of China. Although these cities experience inadequate provision on building space compared to other tier cities, the BV-Gini  values of these cities were below average BV-Gini  values (Beijing=0.432, Shanghai=0.484, Guangzhou=0.492, Shenzhen=0.373, Hongkong=0.417), indicating the relatively high equality in building space. This result may be due to the over-density of the population within these cities which has caused an inadequate provision from the overall building space allocated to the individual, resulting in a relatively equal pattern measured by BV-Gini . However, it is crucial to closely examine cities (∼11.9 %) that suffer from inadequate building space and unequal distribution, as they represent unsustainable building space cities (L-H pattern in Fig. 6 (a)). Our observations indicate that mainly fast-developing tier-2 cities, such as Changsha, Wuhan, and Nanning (as illustrated in Fig. 6 (c)), exhibit unsustainable building space. Despite having building space provision density similar to first-tier cities, there is a significant inequality in distribution among these cities. More specifically, Fig. 7   displays the Lorenz curves of the four patterns, providing insights into the distribution of each pattern of cities, described by the proportion of building space allocated to the top, middle, and bottom cumulated 10 % population. Our results reveal that such cities suffer from high building space inequality, as the bottom 10 % population receives only ∼1.31 % of the city's building space, while the top 10 % population receives approximately 48.81 % of the building space, almost half of the urban building space (Fig. 7 (a)). In contrast, cities with sustainable building supply types allocate ∼1.73 and ∼32 % building space to the bottom and top 10 % population, respectively (Fig. 7 (d)). This situation is likely due to the rapid growth and inflow of population in these tier-2 cities. Such phenomenon has exerted considerable on the available building space provision in these cities, leading to an inadequate supply and unequal distribution of building space to accommodate the growing population. As a result, these cities remain far off the mark in achieving sustainable building space, necessitating sufficient development and management on building space provision such as major shifts in urban policy and investments. Such strategic actions will contribute to advancing the cities' alignment with the 2030 SDGs agenda (UN, 2023 ).  4.2 Building space provision and inequality between urban and rural areas To gain insights into the urban-rural gap and regional disparity on building space in the studied cities, we examined the building space provision and inequality within urban and rural areas. As illustrated in Fig. 8  (a), results reveal that, building space in urban areas, the provision were found to be more crowded, and there was greater inequality compared to rural areas. The per capita provision in rural areas (p e r B V r u r a l     =1074.52 m3 /person) was found to be approximately 2.15 times higher than in urban areas (p e r B V u r b a n     =500.83 m3 /person). Most cities have a rural-to-urban perBV  ratio greater than 1, further supporting this finding. In addition, our analysis of the ratio between building capacity and population distribution in urban and rural contexts indicates a prevalent inadequacy of building space provision across most cities, with urban areas exhibiting a higher population proportion relative to their available building volume (see in Fig. 8 (b)). The findings further reveal a disparity in building space characterized by higher inequality in urban areas (B V − G i n i u r b a n     =0.494) compared to rural regions (B V − G i n i r u r a l     =0.427). Notably, approximately 79.1 % of cities exhibit higher BV-Gini values within urban areas than rural areas (Fig. 9  (c)), underscoring the significant inequality present in urban building space as contrasted with rural regions. This finding aligns with the results of previous studies conducted in India and South Africa, suggesting that urban infrastructure provision exhibits greater inequality than rural infrastructure provision (Pandey et al., 2022 ). Moreover, examining the notable disparities in the rural-to-urban perBV  ratio across cities, we delve into a potential link between distinct urban landscape structures and the spatial heterogeneity of urban-rural building space. To investigate this, we calculate two urban landscape pattern metrics, the Landscape division index (DIVISION) and the Largest patch index (LPI), employed by FRAGSTATS 4.2 (https://fragstats.org/ ). A higher DIVISION value signifies increased scattering and disorder within the urban landscape, while a lower value indicates more aggregated land patch arrangement. Conversely, the LPI metric exhibits a contrasting trend. Our results establish a significant correlation between the rural-to-urban perBV  gap and the landscape pattern metrics within cities (Fig. 9 (a) and (b)). Both DIVISION and LPI metrics consistently demonstrate that a more monotonously centralized and clustered urban form corresponds to a wider gap in building space provision between urban and rural areas (DIVISION ∼ rural-to-urban perBV  ratio: Person r  = 0.38, p  = 0.002, and LPI ∼ rural-to-urban perBV  ratio: Person r  = 0.38, p  = 0.002). For instance, cities like Sanya, Jiangmen, and Lanzhou, with discrete and irregular urban landscape patterns (i.e., high DIVISION and low LPI values in Fig. 9 ), tend to exhibit comparable development levels between rural and urban domains, resulting in a small gap in building space provision. In contrast, cities like Taiyuan, Xining, and Tianjin, characterized by compact and aggregated urban land patterns (i.e., low DIVISION and high LPI values in Fig. 9 ), concentrate dense populations and economic activities in the urban region, thus enlarging the urban-rural gap of building space provision (Fig. 9 ). These findings underscore the fundamental role of urban landscape patterns in shaping disparities in urban-rural infrastructure. Consequently, the fundamental landscape pattern fosters the emergence of the disparity of provision and the inequality in terms of building space between urban and rural areas (Liu et al., 2015 ). Hence, urban planners should be aware that the future land-use patterns will profoundly influence the configuration of urban-rural infrastructure. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that substantial disparity in building space provision between urban and rural areas is closely associated with considerable regional inequality. Specifically, the results indicate that the rural-to-urban gap is positively correlated with the inequality coefficient (measured by BV-Gini  values, Person r  = 0.3, p  = 0.003 in Fig. 9 (d)). Thus, to promote adequate provision and improve equality of building space for sustainable urban development, one important part is to focus on narrowing the urban-rural gap which could help reducing overall inequality for cities (Wan et al., 2022 ). Local governments in these cities with larger rural-urban gap should bring the overcrowding of urban building space provision and the unbalanced building space between rural and urban areas to the forefront.  4.3 Drivers of building space inequality In this study, we further explore the multidimensional spatial drivers that may correlate to building space inequality in cities. To achieve this, we incorporated 13 spatial drivers from various aspects, including geographic, urban morphologic, topographic, socioeconomic, urbanization, and transportation, following data preprocessing. To initially examine the correlation between all variables and building space inequality (measured by the BV-Gini index), we constructed a Pearson correlation matrix, which is presented in Fig. 10  . We then developed two Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models (R c i t y  2   :0.502 and R d i s t r i c t  2   :0.278) to reveal the relationships among the explanatory variables, at both the city and district scales, which help us to understand how these multidimensional spatial variables drive building space inequality. Our analysis revealed notable associations between different spatial variables and the BV-Gini coefficient, as illustrated in Fig. 10 . Above all, we found a significant positive correlation (p  < 0.001) between latitude and building space inequality, suggesting that northern China may experience greater inequality compared to southern China. We further note that this finding may be relevant to previous research indicating better rural housing quality in southern China (Xu et al., 2022 ), which emphasized the need to improve built environment in northern China. As expected, results demonstrate that urban socioeconomic factors and the urbanization intensity are positively linked with building space inequality. Regions with high coefficient of variation of per capita GDP, nighttime light intensity, and standard of deviation of NDBI exhibit high inequality, as indicated in Table 4  . Additionally, we also found that transportation condition is associated with building space inequality at city scale (p  = 0.027), implying that well-developed urban road systems tend to exhibit high equality. In the context of urban morphology, our analysis identifies a strong link between efficient horizontal and vertical utilization of building space and the mitigation of inequality. Notably, the utilization of 3-D building space (measured by BVD) demonstrates a more pronounced impact (a smaller p  values) on inequality reduction compared to 2-D building space utilization (measured by BCR). This underscores the crucial role of optimizing both horizontal expansion and vertical space usage within urban areas to address building space inequality, with particular emphasis on the strategic enhancement of 3-D building space for improving equity. The study also revealed a positive correlation between building height differences within a region and inequality. In summary, these results suggest that a compact and more balanced arrangement of tall buildings in a city or region may contribute to sustainable building space with adequate space and high equality.   5 Discussion 5.1 Divergent building space provision and inequality patterns in China During 2010–2020, cities in mainland China are rapidly developing and expanding with the urban population rising from 49 % to 61 %, leading to great pressure on built environment (World Bank, 2018 ). This study gives insights into the built environment by analyzing building space provision and inequality and discussing their role in support to urban sustainability. By measuring the provision and inequality of building space within 67 Chinese cities, results reveal the significant spatial heterogeneity across the studied cities, finding notable challenges in achieving adequate and equitable building space patterns. Our analysis reveals that megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hongkong face building space stress with overcrowding issue, as their perBV  all below average (i.e., ∼31.15, ∼43.52, ∼32.32, ∼18.82 and ∼57.61 %, respectively). In fact, in developed cities, it is common for people to move in large numbers in order to pursue their careers, burdening established infrastructure provision in the cities. For instance, evidenced by 2010 China Population Census (http://www.stats.gov.cn/ ), 36.62, 41.82, and 38.24 % of urban residents in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou lived in an area of 20m2  or less per capita, respectively, all higher than the national average level of 25.78 %. And the crowded housing conditions are found to have a mitigation trend in 2020, down to 23.84, 28.65 and 35.3 %, but still above the national average (12.69 %). In this regard, our results are in good agreement with the report, in addition to providing more information from a 3-D building perspective with spatial details. For the spatial heterogeneity, we found a notably north-south divide, where northern Chinese cities show an unbalanced development with adequate building space but poor equality. This high inequality in building space could be closely associated with continuous urban shrinkage in the north-eastern China. More specifically, China experiences spatial aggregation and north-eastern cities have continuously shrunk since 1990 due to reindustrialization and economic restructuring, showing significant population loss (Li & Mykhnenko, 2018 ; Ma et al., 2020 ; Zhai et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). Thus, in our results, cities in north-eastern were found to have adequate building space, which may link to the population loss, but were also found to have significant unevenness of building space. These findings underscore the need for urgent policies guiding and managing these cities towards sustainable building space patterns. Furthermore, results highlight a widening urban-rural gap in building space provision in China through comparable measures. Urban areas within the studied cities exhibit more inadequate provision and greater inequality in building space for residents compared to rural areas, which is in line with the earlier finding (Pandey et al., 2022 ). More importantly, the large urban-rural disparity and regional gap in China are the root causes of multidimensional inequality (Wu et al., 2017 ; Xie & Zhou, 2014 ; Zhao et al., 2019 ). In this context, it is crucial to develop and manage sustainable urban infrastructure between urban and rural areas, given their substantial and unequal impacts on environmental risk, public health and well-being (Pearsall et al., 2021 ). While urban areas face crowded building space provision, rural areas confront dual sustainable challenges: housing quality and unequal distribution (Xu et al., 2022 a, 2022 b). Thus, in China, the rural vitalization strategy, proposed at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), including the goals of achieving equal access to basic public services and improving urban and rural integration. However, several aspects limit the generalizability of our findings to other contexts. The distinct political, cultural, economic, and social characteristics of China may inhibit the direct transferability of certain conclusions to other urban environments. The applicability of specific findings and strategies from our study may require further validation and modification by differences in demographics, economic structure, building regulations, and urban planning practices across various contexts. Nevertheless, our study enhances comprehension of the current state of building spaces, providing valuable insights for policy makers and urban planners to promote an adequate and equitable built environment. This, in turn, fosters progress towards sustainable and equitable urban development.  5.2 Implications for achieving sustainable development goals and new urban agenda Adequate and equitable building space crucially drives multiple SDGs, directly or indirectly fostering their achievement (Habitat for Humanity, 2021 ; Thacker et al., 2019 ), which is also directly related to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda. This study examines the building space provision and inequality for 67 Chinese cities with rich quantitative measurements and spatial details. Specifically, our evaluation of building space provision based on the perBV  can directly evaluate the accommodation building space condition. The metric provides valuable information directly contributed to estimate the proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing in the target 11.1 of SDG (UN, 2023 ), and to evaluate the sustainable building resources usage towards the goals of the New Urban Agenda. Moreover, the building space provision results can also address various SDGs. For example, our assessment of building space provision can offer valuable insights that enhance the living environment and promote well-being, which is the core idea of SDG3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. The results can further contribute to the construction of adequate and sustainable building space, thereby supporting the achievement of SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. The methodology can further advance urban sustainability research by providing details into building spaces provision, an aspect currently insufficient in existing researches. Additionally, we quantified the city building space inequality using the indicator of BV-Gini that provides measurable and comparable information on the building space distribution. Moreover, this indicator can also be further generalized and applied to other regions and scales to provide multidimensional details, both numerically and spatially. Such information and understanding on inequality in building space is helpful for evaluating the process towards the SDGs achievement, mainly participating directly in SDG 11 and actively contribute to reduce inequality (SDG 10). This result can also relate to achieving SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Moreover, the New Urban Agenda emphasizes sustainable urban development for social inclusion and ending poverty (2017 ). The insights of building space inequality and its relation to socioeconomic and urban morphological factors discussed in this study can contribute to the goal through informing urban sustainable management and policy decisions. In sum, we anticipate that the methodology and findings of this study will contribute to the adequant and equitable provision of building space. This is expected to cultivate an urban environment that is inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, aligning with both the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda.  5.3 Limitations and future work This study proposes a methodology that aims to provide insights into building space provision and inequality, which was applied to 67 Chinese cities. However, the study had several limitations that require further investigation in future research. In particular, the use of public, open-source, and free data materials may introduce some bias in the estimated building volume per capita and BV-Gini indicators when compared to statistics or household census data. That is, the gridded population map may contain inherent errors such as under-estimates of urban populations in some areas, which could introduce uncertainties into our results. Moreover, the building data also has limitations on the representations of the building space in reality, such as lacking the specific attribute information of housing buildings. This deficiency might restrict the exploration of living environments, with a primary emphasis on residential buildings. Despite this limitation, our proposed methodology provides a cost-effective and efficient way to identify and assess the provision and inequality of building space in cities. With the current feasible data-driven approaches, building function information can be obtained through fusing multi-source spatial data, which enables the methodology of our study to be extended to understanding housing provision and inequality in the future. Furthermore, the methodology can be developed and expanded to assess the current building space conditions for different regions and scales with available data, and is particularly useful for those areas experiencing rapid urbanization but lacking urban survey data or with high data acquisition costs. The increasing availability of remote-sensing data and advanced GIS technologies can enhance our methodology for understanding building space provision and inequality across different scales and regions. For instance, detailed building structure data can be extracted from very high-resolution (VHR) optical images or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (Frantz et al., 2021 ; Li, Koks, Taubenböck and van Vliet, 2020 ; Li et al., 2020 ; Ren et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2022 ), while population data with spatial details can be estimated by integrating urban socioeconomic factors with local census data (Chen et al., 2020 ; Leyk et al., 2019 ; Lloyd et al., 2017 ). Secondly, the building space inequality is quantified using the Gini coefficient in our analyses, while alternative ways of quantifying urban inequality (e.g., Atkinson's index, Theil index and General Entropy (GE) measures) can be explored for different regions and scales. Thirdly, the correlations of spatial drivers may have limited generalizability beyond the selected Chinese cities. In fact, local regions may have specific urban planning and management policies for developing urban infrastructures, which could lead to variations in drivers associated with building space inequality across different spatial scales and regions. Therefore, further examination and discussion are necessary to explore the correlativity of spatial variables driven to the inequality.   6 Conclusion Comprehensive understanding of building space patterns and inequality is crucial for advancing urban sustainability, and this aspect has been relatively under-explored in existing studies. This study employs available high-quality 3-D building structure and fine-scale gridded population data, to investigate the patterns and level of building space provision and inequality from a 3-D building perspective. By utilizing and applying quantitative metrics, namely building volume per capita (perBV ) and Gini coefficient (BV-Gini ), across 67 Chinese cities, we have investigated building space patterns for selected cities. This examination is based on a conceptual framework that integrated the perspectives from two dimensions: the provision and the inequality in building space. Overall, we examined an average perBV  and BV-Gini  of 517.67 m3  per person and 0.497 of the studied cities. Our findings reveal notable spatial heterogeneities in building space provision and inequality across 67 Chinese cities where the tier-1 cities exhibit inadequate building space relative to their population. Furthermore, rapidly developing tier-2 cities face significant challenges in achieving adequate and equitable building space patterns (relatively low perBV  and high BV-Gini  values). Notably, urban areas within the studied cities demonstrate lower building space (perBV  in rural regions is approximately 2.15 times that of in urban areas) and more uneven distribution (BV-Gini : 0.494 for urban, and 0.427 for rural) compared to rural areas. The results also emphasized the importance of addressing this urban-rural gap to reduce the overall building space inequality level. In addition, we discussed multidimensional spatial drivers of building space inequality. Results underscored that enhancing the horizontal expansion and vertical space utilization of built environment within cities is strongly correlated with reducing inequality, and the strategic utilization of 3-D building space provision holds significant potential for improving equality. The findings of this study provide insights to understand the sustainability of built environment for cities with spatial details and critical 3-D building information, which at an integrated perspective of two dimensions of building space provision and inequality. These insights contribute to understanding the pivotal role they play in urban sustainability development. Future analyses can extend our methodology to diverse data sets, scales, and regions, providing valuable references and practical applications for addressing the provision and inequality issues of building space in alignment with the SDGs.
