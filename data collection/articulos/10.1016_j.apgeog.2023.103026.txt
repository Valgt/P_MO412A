                  Spatial access to health is important for Sustainable Development Goal 3, yet most existing studies have largely focused on the primary health care level without considering other hierarchies of health facilities. This study analyzed spatial accessibility to primary, secondary, and tertiary health facilities in Ghana. Accumulated distance and network analysis were used in measuring accessibility by drawing insights from Ghana's Upper West region. The results show that 61% of the population have access to primary health care facilities within recommended standards. Also, 81% have access to secondary health care facilities, but the degree of access varies with mode of transportation (i.e., motorcycle or car) and other barriers such as speed and road conditions. On the contrary, only 48% of the population can reach tertiary medical centres in the recommended 30-min journey time. Considering other demographic and socioeconomic factors, the results of overall access show that the highest spatial concentration of healthcare facilities does not translate into high overall healthcare access among the inhabitants. The results imply a varied degree of spatial accessibility across different hierarchies of health facilities, with transportation, socioeconomic, and demographic factors playing critical roles in determining overall access. The findings suggest that for progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 3, it is imperative to focus on addressing rural transport infrastructure, inadequacy of doctors, and national health insurance subscriptions to scale up access towards universal primary health care for all and also improve secondary and tertiary access.

Wei Spatial access to health is important for Sustainable Development Goal 3, yet most existing studies have largely focused on the primary health care level without considering other hierarchies of health facilities. This study analyzed spatial accessibility to primary, secondary, and tertiary health facilities in Ghana. Accumulated distance and network analysis were used in measuring accessibility by drawing insights from Ghana's Upper West region. The results show that 61% of the population have access to primary health care facilities within recommended standards. Also, 81% have access to secondary health care facilities, but the degree of access varies with mode of transportation (i.e., motorcycle or car) and other barriers such as speed and road conditions. On the contrary, only 48% of the population can reach tertiary medical centres in the recommended 30-min journey time. Considering other demographic and socioeconomic factors, the results of overall access show that the highest spatial concentration of healthcare facilities does not translate into high overall healthcare access among the inhabitants. The results imply a varied degree of spatial accessibility across different hierarchies of health facilities, with transportation, socioeconomic, and demographic factors playing critical roles in determining overall access. The findings suggest that for progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 3, it is imperative to focus on addressing rural transport infrastructure, inadequacy of doctors, and national health insurance subscriptions to scale up access towards universal primary health care for all and also improve secondary and tertiary access.   Keywords Accessibility  Health  Sustainable development goal  Ghana    1 Introduction The United Nations’ Agenda 2030 emphasizes good health and human well-being in achieving sustainable development (United Nations, 2015 ). Therefore, the international agenda places issues of promoting wellbeing and guaranteeing healthy lives at all stages as goal three of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 3 has thirteen targets, of which the first nine (e.g., reductions in maternal health, under-five mortality, communicable disease, etc.) are outcome targets that depend on the availability and access to healthcare to be achieved (United Nations, 2015 ). Although availability is essential, uneven accessibility to health services is noted to impact various health outcomes (Tao, Cheng, Zheng, & Li, 2018 ). Ghana adopted a five-tier health delivery system to ensure decentralized, responsive and ready access to medical care throughout the country. These levels of healthcare delivery include: 1) the community-based health planning and services (CHPS) – which promotes basic healthcare for women and children, particularly in remote communities. Here, there is a stationed community health officer and nurse, assisted by community health volunteers to conduct health surveillance and promotion in their catchment communities; 2) health centres – which provide basic preventive, curative, and reproductive health care services. Specialists in nutrition, laboratory services, midwifery, public health, and the environment work there under the direction of physician assistants in health centres. Health centres perform minor surgical services and refer complicated cases to the appropriate higher level; 3) district hospital (DH) – this is the first referral and comprehensive care hospital in the hierarchy of health care delivery. These hospitals offer district-level health promotion services as well as preventative, curative, outpatient, and inpatient care. District hospitals provide technical and supervisory services to health centres and CHPS compounds in their catchment areas; 4) regional hospital – which provides specialized care not available at the district hospital and forms the next level of referral from the district hospital. Their specialists should include, general medical physicians, pediatricians, midwives, surgeons and general and specialized nurses; 5) teaching hospital – the apex of healthcare delivery in the country. These hospitals deliver complex therapeutic tertiary health care, provide quality treatment protocols and clinical standards, provide training for health professionals, and contribute to the quality of healthcare delivery through research. Equitable access to health care for everyone is a fundamental goal of the SDGs (UN, 2015 ). However, there are marked spatial inequalities in healthcare access in Ghana (Peprah, Budu, Agyemang-Duah, Abalo, & Gyimah, 2020 ; Stewart et al., 2016 ; Yawson et al., 2017 ). Recently, a number of initiatives have been made to lessen these access to healthcare disparities. Prominent among these are the free maternal health care program (Witter, Adjei, Armar-Klemesu, & Graham, 2009 ; Azaare, Akweongo, Aryeetey, & Dwomoh, 2020 ; Darlinjon et al., 2018 ), the national health insurance scheme to eliminate financial obstacles that restrict access to and utilization of healthcare (Dixon, Luginaah, & Mkandawire, 2014 ; Witter & Garshong, 2009 ), and the construction of health infrastructure to serve deprived areas. Despite these interventions, available evidence has established a strong relationship between socio-economic inequalities and healthcare access and utilization in Ghana (Fenny, Asuman, Crentsil, & Odame, 2018 ; Kuuire, Bisung, Rishworth, Dixon, & Luginaah, 2016 ; Novignon, Ofori, Tabiri, & Pulok, 2019 ). Even when health facilities are available, geographic accessibility – defined here as the distance and time spent accessing health facilities – has been identified as a critical challenge (Agbenyo, Marshall Nunbogu, & Dongzagla, 2017 ; Ashiagbor, Ofori-Asenso, Forkuo, & Agyei-Frimpong, 2020 ). Apart from its association with delays in receiving appropriate care, it also results in unmet healthcare needs, particularly emergency health services such as referrals (Atuoye et al., 2015 ). Existing studies have attributed these inequalities in health access to poor transportation infrastructure and lack of motorised transport (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ). For example, Atuoye et al. (2015)  have demonstrated the multiple ways poor transportation networks affect maternal healthcare access and utilization in Ghana. Other researchers have also emphasized how poor road networks reinforce existing inequalities in access to health care in rural Ghana (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ; Ganle, Parker, Fitzpatrick, & Otupiri, 2014 ; Peprah et al., 2020 ). Also, it has been well documented that prehospital and emergency care services are inadequate and rural areas are hardly served (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ; Atuoye et al., 2015 ; Tansley et al., 2016 ). For instance, about 21% of the population lack access to ambulance service during health emergencies within 60 min of travel time (Tansley et al., 2016 ), whilst about 30% cannot access essential surgery services within 2 h of referral (Stewart et al., 2016 ). The Upper West Region, which has historically been underdeveloped provides the most extreme situation of these access disparities (Rishworth, Dixon, Luginaah, Mkandawire, & Prince, 2016 ; Agbenyo et al., 2017 ; Atuoye et al., 2015 ). Hence, the need to understand these geographic disparities in health care access for informed policy interventions. Studies in elsewhere and Ghana have explored the nexus of the geography and spatial spread of health care and population from different perspectives. Some studies have examined the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) for spatial accessibility analysis of specific medical conditions concerning the distribution of healthcare facilities (Kuupiel et al., 2020 ; Kuupiel, Tlou, Bawontuo, & Mashamba-Thompson, 2019 ). Other studies have mapped spatial access using GIS based on the means of transport and poverty (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ; Tansley et al., 2017 ). Although these studies have fostered an understanding of the situation, there are still some critical gaps in GIS and spatial analysis of accessibility across levels or hierarchies of health facilities (i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary) (Ashiagbor et al., 2020 ). Most of the existing spatial analyses of health access have largely focused on primary health care level without considering other hierarchies of health facilities. This affects policy and decision-making on the determination of the selection of sites and levels of health facilities for various population distributions. In addition, existing studies tend to focus on individual cases or districts thus limiting our understanding of differences in health care access at the regional or sub-national level. This study aims to address this gap by producing empirical evidence of the availability and accessibility of health care across different levels of medical facilities in Ghana (i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary) by drawing insights from the Upper West region. Through this, the study will contribute evidence for tracking the achievement of SDG 3 target eight which seeks to realize universal health coverage. To do this, Section 2  provides an overview of the study area. Section 3  provides the description of the data and methods of analysis. Section 4  presents the results of the study while Sections 5 and 6  situate the results within the general context of the literature and draw implications for policy.  2 Study area While Ghana has made significant socio-economic progress over the past decade, there remain stark geographic disparities in health access (GSS, 2020 ; Ministry of Health, 2022 ), with the Upper West Region (Fig. 1  ) being one of the most deprived (GSS, 2020 ). As of 2021, the Upper West Region has a total population of about 900,000, and is one of the least developed regions in the country with only 26.4% of the total population classified as urban, compared to a nationwide average of 56.7% (GSS, 2022 ). Compared to a national multidimensional poverty index (MPI) – a result of poverty prevalence and severity – of 0.236, the Upper West Region has a higher MPI of 0.348, and six out of every ten persons (65.5% of the population) are multidimensionally poor (GSS, 2020 ). This reflects the state of deprivation in the region in terms of living standard, health and education. The worsening climatic conditions continue to undermine subsistence agriculture which remains the primary economic base of the region (Nyantakyi-Frimpong & Bezner-Kerr, 2015 ). As reported by other studies, about 63.6% of the people experience food insecurity (Atuoye & Luginaah, 2017 ) and child malnutrition remains a major health challenge (Van Asselt & Ecker, 2017 ). A recent study argues that the increasing agricultural workload on women due to the worsening climate is perpetuating child malnutrition and curative healthcare access for nutrition (Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2021 ). Other studies suggest that the high child malnutrition in the region is likely a result of the high maternal micronutrient deficiency (Ewusie, Ahiadeke, Beyene, & Hamid, 2014 ). The historically rooted underdevelopment has resulted in an underserved health care structure for the Upper West Region. The region has one of the worst doctor-to-patient ratios in the nation (1:10,362, compared to a ratio of 1:2586 in Greater Accra) (Ministry of Health, 2022 ), making access to health care a major challenge, especially in rural communities. According to recent statistics, about 23.9% of pregnant women in the region did not have skilled delivery, and about 25.2% had less than four antenatal care visits in 2021 (Ministry of Health, 2022 ). Additionally, 75% of the region's households reside outside the prescribed 8 km radius of a health center, which restricts geographic access to healthcare in times of need (Rishworth et al., 2016 ). Generally, health facilities are staffed below the required standard, and the workload is higher (Ghana Statistical Service, 2018 ). There are also issues of gendered health inequalities in terms of healthcare access and utilization. Women are generally responsible for child care, water collection, household nutrition and the care needs of sick household members (GSS, 2018 ; Nunbogu, Elliott, & Bisung, 2022 ; Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2021 ). Although maternal care is free of charge under Ghana's free maternal health care program and National Health insurance scheme, women still walk longer distances to access care. Some rural communities are hard to reach during the wet seasons owing to the bad road network (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ). This implies that women living in such communities face fundamental challenges related to maternal health care access. As in Ghana more broadly, women have also experienced physical and verbal abuse, and prejudice based on status of education at health facilities in the region (Sumankuuro, Crockett, & Wang, 2017 ; Ganle et a., 2015 ), and these experiences influence their health seeking behaviours (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ).  3 Data and methods 3.1 Data The data used in this study were gathered from several sources. The population data was obtained from Landscan data, a spatially distributed world population dataset generated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) (Bhaduri, 2002 ). Landscan has a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km and is the most used global population data owing to its finest resolution and longest time series (Jiang et al., 2021 ). In this study, Landscan data for 2020 were downloaded from the website https://landscan.ornl.gov/ (accessed on August 8, 2022). Topographic (digital elevation model) data was downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website while land use/cover information was extracted from the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 global land use data for 2022.1  1 https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cfcb7609de5f478eb7666240902d4d3d .   Ghana districts shapefile and GPS locations of all health facilities in Ghana were obtained from the Centre for Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Services (CERGIS). Eleven districts that constituted the Upper West Region were extracted from the Ghana districts shapefile and used as the units of analysis. Similarly, a select by location  function in ArcGIS Pro 3.0 was used to select all health facilities within the 11 districts in UWR (Fig. 2  ). This process resulted in 386 health facilities ranging from maternity homes, clinics to a regional hospital. However, 322 (83%) out of the 386 health facilities were used in this study, thus, excluding Reproductive Child Health (RCH) and maternity homes since these usually provide limited services (see also Ashiagbor et al., 2020 ). The 322 health facilities were grouped into three hierarchies that correspond with the levels of district-level healthcare in Ghana. These are: primary or community level (241), secondary or sub-district level (69), and tertiary or district level (12) according to the Ministry of Health categorization of Ghana's healthcare facilities. Primary or community health care level facilities are the community health planning and services (CHPS) compounds and clinics. Secondary or sub-district health facilities comprised health centres and polyclinics. The tertiary facilities are the district and regional hospitals which perform specialized health services and receive referred patients from the primary and secondary levels. Fig. 2  depicts the spread of health facilities in Upper West Region. An assessment of Ghana's Planning Standards provided details on the allowed range for utilizing each category of health service (Town and Country Planning Department, 2010 ). Per the Standards, the acceptable range for CHPS and clinics is 5 km and 10 min walking distance respectively from most houses. For health centres, the acceptable radius is between 8 km and 16 km while the district hospital is supposed to serve the whole district. Data on National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) coverage was obtained from the NHIS offices in the districts. Poverty incidence information for all districts in the Upper West Region was obtained after a review of “Ghana Poverty Mapping Report” (GSS, 2018 ) while information on the distribution of health personnel (medical doctors, midwives, and registered general nurses) by districts came from a review of the Upper West Regional Health Services, 2021 Annual Report (Upper West Regional Health Services, 2021 ).  3.2 Methods Accessibility in this paper refers to the ease with which a person can go to a health facility. Accessibility analysis helps to answer basic questions such as how many people live within 5 km or 30-min’ drive to a facility and is essential for identifying areas with poor access. There are various approaches to measuring accessibility (e.g., Acheampong & Asabere, 2022 ; Weiss et al., 2020 ; Zhang, Li, Deng, & Li, 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ), however, in this paper two approaches to measuring accessibility to health facilities were used. These two categories highlight visualization of service areas of health facilities, using time and distance as metrics (Aday & Andersen, 1974 ). Travel distance and time, as travel impedance, play a significant role in the use of healthcare services (Lovett, Haynes, Sünnenberg, & Gale, 2002 ) and survival of trauma patients (Tansley et al., 2019 ). Over the years, the simple distance measure or Euclidean distance has been a traditional metric for measuring access to healthcare (Agbenyo et al., 2017; Ashiagbor et al., 2020 ; Jones, Ashby, Momin, & Naidoo, 2010 ). This method determines accessibility by a simple buffer distance around a facility. The simplicity of this method means that it is still used in several research and planning in relation to access to health facilities even though it does not consider the fact that pedestrians and vehicles do not usually travel in straight lines but by road. The Euclidean distance metric conceives accessibility as a straight-line distance between two points and is appropriate where guidelines exist in relation to maximum travel time or distance to a facility (e.g., a health centre should be within 8–16 km of most homes) (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ). A drawback of the Euclidean distance measure is that it overestimates the catchment population of health facilities since it does not consider travel cost and impedance such as slope and surface conditions which affect actual travel routes and time. Advances in Geographic Information System (GIS) have made it possible to delineate service areas by incorporating road network and travel times among others (Kotavaara et al., 2021 ; Reshadat, Zangeneh, Saeidi, Teimouri, & Yigitcanlar, 2019 ). Measuring accessibility using GIS software and road network is considered a better approach with improved precision (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ; Delmelle et al., 2013 ; Reshadat et al., 2019 ). Evaluating accessibility via network analysis relies on a network dataset that has information about the underlying transportation network including road hierarchies, crossings, speed limits, surface condition and so on. Network analysis is used to determine how far an individual can travel within a certain time via various modes of transport such as walking or driving (ESRI, 2021 ). When General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) datasets are available, these can be incorporated into a network dataset to establish accessibility based on public transport (Kotavaara et al., 2021 ). A drawback of a network analysis, however, is that it requires the sourcing and preparation of road network and travel speeds, which are time consuming (Ni, Wang, Rui, Qian, & Wang, 2015 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ). This method is also not appropriate when data availability and quality are issues, particularly in developing countries (Ahlström, Pilesjö, & Lindberg, 2011 ). Although the lack of road network data can be addressed by the availability of OpenStreeMap (OSM), championed by volunteer contributions, the quality of OSM data remains a concern in places like Africa (Arsanjani, Barron, Bakillah, & Helbich, 2013 ). Similarly, Delmelle, Marsh, Dony, and Delamater (2019)  established that travel estimates based on OSM road network are comparable to commercial network providers such as ArcGIS™ Online only when the mean number of people contributing to OSM along a route is larger. Thus, a greater number of contributors to OSM is a precondition for correcting fundamental errors and improving quality of OSM dataset (Haklay, Basiouka, Antoniou, & Ather, 2010 ). This precondition is hard to achieve in underserved and remote regions in Africa where contribution attempts could be low owing to limited smart phones usage and internet access (Kenny, 2000 ). Therefore, data required to model turns, incorporate travel speeds, implement pedestrian restrictions, and honour one-way restrictions among others (Delmelle et al., 2013 , p. 675) is absent. In this study, we apply a spatial approach that utilizes land use/cover and topographic data (Fig. 3  ) to determine accessibility. This spatial approach enables estimation of more realistic walk time and distance to health facilities by accounting for the slope, type of surface, and existence of natural barriers like rivers, flooded areas, and mountains, and is an improvement over the Euclidean distance metric, which assumes a uniform accessibility in all directions. In this spatial approach, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to determine the slope (incline) of the land, and the incline was used to establish the maximum walking speed. For instance, Tobler's hiking function states that an incline of −3° will result in a 6 km/h walking speed limit while a maximum speed of 5 km/h is achieved on flat terrains (Tobler, 1993 ). While walking speeds vary depending on several factors such as age, weight, fitness among others, normal walking speed of a human being is estimated at about 5 km/h (Arango & Montufar, 2008 ; Browning, Baker, Herron, & Kram, 2006 ), consistent with Tobler's hiking function. Tobler's hiking function is expressed by a mathematical formula as follows:(Eq. 1) W = 6 ⅇ − 3 ⋅ 5 ( ⅆ h  ⅆ x   + 0.05  )        Where: W  = walking velocity or estimated speed of travel (in km/h). S  = slope = ⅆ h  ⅆ x      = slope angle (in degrees). dh=  elevation difference dx=  distance. In addition to calculating walking speeds from the DEM, impedances and obstacles were incorporated into the model. It is assumed that individuals walking to a health facility will not swim through rivers, water bodies, or walk across marshy areas even though doing so may represent the least geographic distance from their origins to a health facility. Therefore, water features and flooded vegetation extracted from Sentinel-2 land use/cover for 2022 (Fig. 3 b) were incorporated into the model as barriers that could not be crossed. In terms of impedances, the same data was used to arrive at three land surface types — built (including roads), crops/savanna, and tree cover/forests — to represent impedance range from low to high, respectively (see Esri, 2021 ). A value of 1  was assigned to built area, which represents the least difficult and quickest to traverse, 2  to crops/savanna, and 3  to forests. This implies that walking across a crop field/savanna and forest is twice and three times, respectively, as challenging to walk as built area. The spatial model was used to establish ease of access to secondary and primary health facilities such as health centres and CHPS compounds, respectively. This model was considered appropriate because there are standards on the maximum walk or travel distance it should take a person to reach these facilities. Our spatial approach enables off-road modelling of accessibility particularly in settings where footpaths and tracks are common and the major means of transport is by foot (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ). The model was executed using the Distance Accumulation  algorithm in ArcGIS Pro (3.0). In addition to the spatial approach, a network measure was used to determine accessibility to secondary health facilities such as health centres using the road network and travel time. The service area extent of the health centres was set at 8, 16, and 32 km which correspondent to high, medium, and low access respectively. Performing the accumulated distance and network measure of accessibility to secondary health facilities simultaneously enabled a comparison of the serviced population between these methods. Finally, access to hospitals, i.e., tertiary health facilities was determined using ‘Service Area’ and ‘Origin Destination (OD) Cost Matrix’ algorithms under the Network Analyst in ArcGIS Pro platform. Concentric service area polygons as disks were created with cut-off cost of 30, 60, and 120 min. The ‘OD Cost Matrix’ algorithm on the other hand was used to establish the travel distance and time to the closest hospital from each district in the Upper West Region. In the ‘OD Cost Matrix’ layer, hospitals were entered as destinations while the centroids of the districts were entered as origins. Using the centroids of the districts as origins provided a uniform standard for comparing ease of access to hospitals among the districts. The output from the ‘OD Cost Matrix’ tool consists of straight lines (showing the least-cost travel distance by car) in kilometres and drive-time in minutes (see also Lakhani et al., 2019 ). As explained earlier, collecting and processing road network data for network analysis is complex and time-consuming. In addition, this process is hampered by poor and non-existent data on road network and their conditions especially in Africa. Consequently, we relied on ArcGIS Online network dataset to produce the ‘Service Areas’ and ‘OD Cost Matrix’ outputs. This network dataset covers 247 countries and is produced and hosted by ESRI ArcGIS Online (Environmental Systems Research Institute [ESRI], 2022 ). ESRI categorizes this network dataset into six classes reflecting the quality of routing service in each of the 247 countries. Ghana's road network data is classified as ‘fixed speeds’, indicating a network dataset that is complete. The ‘fixed speeds’ network dataset is based on static trip times calculated from vehicle mean speeds and excludes dynamic traffic conditions (ESRI, 2022 ). Thus, results from this network dataset will not change by varying the day and time of travel, a situation that does not truly depict reality especially in bigger metropolitan areas. Furthermore, ArcGIS Online tends to overstate travel distance in contrast to Google Maps, resulting in percent difference values that are higher at shorter trips and diminish over longer travel distances (Delmelle et al., 2019 , p. 1262). Notwithstanding these limitations, ArcGIS Online network data is considered adequate and acceptable for the current analysis because the study area is predominantly rural suggesting little changes in results if travel day and time were varied. Following Delmelle et al. (2019) , we deployed this dataset to estimate accessibility to only secondary and tertiary health facilities which require higher travel distances compared to primary health facilities. A spatial approach which determines accessibility to health facilities as well as the corresponding population can be an effective tool to support health care planning efforts to ensure equity in health service delivery. Such an approach can identify areas with limited geographic access to health facilities and the population within those areas to support evidence-based delivery of health care especially in rural areas (Lakhani, 2021 ). The health facilities ‘service areas’ created using the accumulated distance and network analysis methods were intersected with the 2020 Landscan population distribution data to generate population with varying levels of access under each method. More significantly, the results will show subtle differences in access to health facilities among the districts in Upper West Region under both methods and provide the basis for new investments in roads and health facilities. A weigted overlay algorithm in ArcGIS Pro (3.0) was used to generate a combined accessibility map taking into consideration, spatial and aspatial factors that influence access to health services. Based on information available, eight (8) variables were used in the modelling of overall healthcare accessibilty (Table 1  ). These are: percent of the population with NHIS subscription, poverty incidence, population per medical doctor, population per midwife, population per registered general nurse, percent population with 30 min access to the nearest hospital (tertiary health facility) by motorized transport, percent population within 8 km of the nearest health centre (secondary health facility) by walking and motorized transport, and percent population with access to the nearest CHPS compound or clinic (primary health facility) within 5 km by foot. Raster layers of the percent population within 8 km accumulated distance of the nearest health centre and by motorized travel were combined into one layer using the weighted sum  algorithm in ArcGIS Pro and the final output reclassified. The eight (8) variables were reclassified into a three-point scale, namely – low accessibility, moderate accessibility, and high accessibility. The variables were first symbolized using Natural Breaks (Jenks) into three classes that correspond to the three-point scale and then rasterized. High, moderate, and low values for some variables such as poverty and population per medical doctor were reclassified as low, moderate, and high accessibility, respectively. The reason being that higher poverty rates and population per medical doctor impede healthcare access. On the other hand, some variables such as percent population with NHIS subscription and percent population within the recommended travel distance to all hierarchies of health facilities tend to increase healthcare accessibility. Therefore high, moderate, and low values for these variables were reclassified as high, moderate, and low accessibility, respectively. In terms of weight or relative importance of the variables, we based our judgment on insights from the regional health services report (Ghana statistical service, 2022 ) and the national health sector assessment report (Ministry of Health, 2022 ). Health insurance coverage and poverty incidence coverage were rated 20% and 5%, respectively. Though the incidence of poverty in the region may likely affect health insurance enrolment (Dixon, Luginaah, & Mkandawire, 2014 ; Dixon et al., 2014 ), the region recorded an insurance coverage of 79.7% compared to the national average of 54.4% (Ministry of Health, 2022 ). Also, about 91.6% of patients in the Upper West Region accessed health care with valid insurance in 2021 (Ghana statistical service, 2022 ). The variable for population per midwife was weighted 10% with reference to the 5.4% improvement in skilled deliveries recorded in 2021 (Ghana statistical service, 2022 ), while the variable for population per registered nurse was weighted 5%. For instance, about 80% of mothers in Upper West Region received skilled delivery and post-natal care in 2021 (Ministry of Health, 2022 ). The relative influence of the proportion of people within 30 min travel time to a district hospital, 8 km travel to health centres and 5 km radius of CHPS compound were rated 25%, 15% and 10%, respectively.   4 Results 4.1 Service areas and population—Primary healthcare Primary medical amenities such as CHPS compounds and clinics are the initial stop during illness; they provide essential health care services. Table 2   indicates that 29.95%, 61.49%, and 93.67% of people in the Upper West Region could walk to the nearest primary health facility within 2 km, 5 km, and 20 km, respectively. This implies that less than half (29.95%) of the population of Upper West Region has high access to primary health facilities, while 61.49% have access within the 5 km distance to health facilities as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). About 312,311 residents, representing 38.51% of the total population within the region, are outside the 5 km radius, the recommended optimum distance to a health facility. At the district level, the mean, minimum, and maximum percentage of people within a 2 km walking distance of the nearest primary health facility were 26.44%, 11.29%, and 81.75%, respectively. Wa Municipal has the highest number of inhabitants within a 2 km walk of the nearest primary health facility (81.75%), while Sissala East recorded the least (11.29%) (Table 2  and Fig. 4  ). The mean, minimum, and maximum percentages of people within a 5-km radius of the nearest primary health facility were 61.24%, 26.46%, and 94.42%, respectively. Sissala East recorded the lowest percent of inhabitants (26.46%) within a 5 km radius from the nearest primary health facility. Wa East and Sissala East had the highest percentage of their inhabitants, i.e., 67% and 74%, respectively, beyond the recommended 5 km travel distance to the nearest primary health facility. These populations are underserved and are compelled to travel longer distances to access basic health care in times of sickness, which may be inconvenient for the elderly, expectant mothers, and the disabled. On the other hand, the entire population of three districts, i.e., Wa Municipal, Lawra Municipal, and Nandom Distict, are relatively well served and can access the nearest primary health facility within 5 km.  4.2 Service areas and population—Secondary healthcare Health centres, which are considered secondary health facilities, are the next tier of municipal or district-level health care services. By offering patients curative services in addition to mother and child health care services, health centres provide more services than CHPS and clinics (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ). Thus, health centres are rational destination for patients who maybe suffering from serious health problems. The accumulated distance analysis showed that the population within 8 km of the health centres was 457,590 representing 56% of the total population of the study area (Fig. 5  ). This figure is below that of Agbenyo et al. (2017)  who found that 70% of the communities in the Wa West District had access to health centres within 5 km walking distance. About 655,945 people representing 80.88% of the population of Upper West Region are within 16 km radius, the optimum travel distance to the nearest health centre according to Ghana's Planning Standards. At the district level, the mean, minimum and maximum percentage of people within an 8 km travel distance to the nearest health centre were 55.39%, 35.20%, and 88.69% respectively. Wa East District had the lowest number of inhabitants within the 8 km buffer of health centres (35.20%) while Wa Municipal had the highest (88.69%). On the other hand, the network analysis which incorporates travel speed and other barriers such as availbility of roads and their conditions, showed that only 421,669 representing 52% of the population can access the nearest health centre within 8 km travel by road. This implies that about four (4) percent of the inhabitants of Upper West Region who are within the 8 km accumulated distance from the nearest health centre are under-served when it comes to accessing health centres by road. This is critical since certain health emergencies require motorized transport rather than by foot. The population within 16 km distance, the maximum range of access to a health centre according to the planning standards is about 690,194 representing 85% of the total population. A total of 120,852 people consisting of 15% of the entire population of the study area are outside the 16 km threshold if travel is by road. When travel mode is by car or motorcycle rather than walking, an additional 4% of the population will have access to health centres within the 16 km radius. At the district level, the percentage of people within 8 km travel by road to the nearest health centre ranged from 16% (Wa West) to 92% (Wa Municipal) (Fig. 6  b). The average and median percentage of people within the 8 km distance is 51% and 53% respectively. The difference between the percent population with access via 8 km accumulated distance and by motorized transport ranged from −19.93% (Sissala East) to 19.03% (Wa West). Sissala East, Nandom, Sissala West, and Wa Municipal recorded negative values while the remaining districts recorded positive values. This shows that access to health centres within an 8 km distance in Upper West Region differ according to the mode of travel. Districts that recorded negative values suggest that the inhabitants in these districts have higher access within 8 km of the neareest health centre via motorized transport as opposed to walking while the reverse is true for those that recorded positive values. The percentage of people served within the 16 km travel by road across all districts ranged from 68% (Wa East) to 100% (Wa Municipal). The average and median percentage of inhabitants within the 16 km threshold is 85% and 90% respectively. These numbers are higher compared with those served within the 16 km accumulated distance – which recorded an average and median percentage of 81% and 84% respectively. Yet, there are significant variations among the districts in terms of access by motorized travel and by walking within the 16 km threshold. The variation between the percent population with access via 16 km accumulated distance and by motorized transport ranged from −20.68% (Sissala East) to 3.42% (Nandom). This shows that differential accessibilty by motorized transport and walking to heath centres in rural areas with motorable roads increases with increasing distance away from the facility.  4.3 Service areas and population-tertiary healthcare Fig. 7   shows spatial access to district hospitals in the Upper West Region. It demonstrates how roads facilitate or limit healthcare accessibility in the region. Per Ghana's Planning Standards, a district hospital is intended to service the whole district. This suggests that inhabitants anywhere within the district should be able to reach a district hospital within a reasonable travel time preferable 30 min drive (Bosanac, Parkinson, & Hall, 1976 ). Per the 30 min threshold, 387,597 inhabitants representing 48% of the total population of the region can reach the nearest district hospital within 30 min drive. Out of this number, 9.77% lies within the first quartile (25th percentile), 48% within the middle quartile (50th percentile) and then 85% within the upper quartile (75th percentile) (Fig. 8  ). Within an hour's drive, 78% of the population is served while 95% can access the nearest district hospital within 2 h drive. The findings suggest that 52% and 22% of the total population of Upper West Region (811,046 people) cannot reach a district hospital within 30 min and an hour, respectively, if they have access to motorized transport. At the district level, the mean, mimimum and maximum percentage of people within the high accessibility zone to a district hospital, i.e., within 30 min drive is 45%, 0.12% and 97% respectively. Two districts, i.e., Wa East and Daffiama-Bussie-Issa have less than one percentage of their population within the 30 min drive range of a district hospital (Fig. 10   ). This is not surprising given that these two are among the three districts in the study area without a district hospital. Inhabitants in these districts must therefore travel to other districts in order to access healthcare services offered by a district hospital. Despite not having a district hospital, about 27% of the inhabitants in Lambussie-Karni are within the high accessibility zone to the nearest district hospital. The reason being that Lambussie-Karni is surrounded by districts with a district hospital. In constrast, only 9.77% of the inhabitants in the Wa West district can access a district hospital within 30 min, if they have access to motorized transport, despite the availability of a district hospital. Indeed, Fig. 9 b shows that Wa West has the highest spatial concentration of health facilities in the study area yet it is one of the districts with the least percentage of its inhabitants with access to both secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities (Figs. 6 and 7 ). Inadequate or lack of motorable roads in the Wa West district account for the limited spatial accessibility of health facilities among its inhabitants (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ). The percentage of people with moderate accessibility, i.e, an hour's drive to the nearest district hospital across all districts ranged from 42% (Wa East) to 100% (Wa Municipal) (Fig. 10 ). The number of inhabitants with moderate accessibility to a district hospital in the districts tends to reduce significantly during the wet season. As a result, many of these residents experience a number of deprivations when it comes to having access to a hospital and other related services that would ensure their health. From Fig. 7 b, the mean travel time from the centroid of each district to the nearest hospital, which is also a proxy for access to ambulance services, was 45 min (standard deviation = 35.8 min), minimum travel time 6.4 min, and maximum travel time 114 min.  4.4 Overall accessibility to healthcare in the Upper West Region Fig. 11   is a map showing general accessibility to healthcare in the study area which considers socioeconomic and demographic variables (see Table 1 ). It shows that five districts are within the high accessibility zone, four within moderate accessibility while two are within low accessibility. Inhabitants in Wa West and Wa East districts are the most deprived in terms of access to healthcare in the region. These results are not surprising given that Wa East does not have a district hospital as well as a single medical doctor. While Fig. 9 b shows for, instance, that Wa West had the highest spatial concentration of healthcare facilities relative to the other districts, this did not translate into high healthcare access among the inhabitants. Apart from the poor road network which impedes healthcare access, other factors such as inadequate number of medical doctors, low NHIS subscription rate, and high poverty prevalence combine to make Wa West the most vulnerable district in terms of access to healthcare.   5 Discussion 5.1 Accessibility across levels and important role of transport infrastructure Health and wellbeing are greatly influenced by access to healthcare (Gulliford et al., 2002 ). Yet, spatial disparity in the location of health facilities is a significant factor for unequal access to health outcomes (Wang, 2012 ). The findings of this study suggest that the Upper West Region has a moderate level of accessibility to primary healthcare, with an estimated 61 percent of the population having access within the prescribed 5 km by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Fig. 4 ). This figure is lower than that of Ashanti Region which has about 81.5% of its population within 5 km travel to all health facilities (Ashiagbor et al., 2020 ). In addition, there are significant disparities in primary health care access across the districts that need policy attention. While over 85% of the entire population of three districts, i.e., Wa Municipal, Lawra Municipal, and Nandom Distict are within the recommended 5 km of primary health facility, 67% and 74% of the inhabitants in Wa East and Sissala East respectively, must travel beyond 5 km to access the nearest primary health facility. Longer distance travels by foot may inconvenience the aged, children, expectant mothers, and the disabled and ultimately affect their health and well-being. It is evident that interventions to improve population well-being and limit mortality by increasing the number and availability of medical workers, beds, and medical equipment, etc., are less likely to yield the needed results if geographic disparity in distribution of health facilities is not addressed. Our results indicate an estimated 56% of the population of Upper West Region is within 8 km accumulated distance to the nearest health centre (secondary healthcare) (Fig. 5 ). Despite this moderate regional level access, spatial accessibility to health centres remains poor in some districts, particularly rural districts. Less than 50% of the population of Sissala West, Wa East, Wa West, and Sissala East Districts is within the 8 km recommended distance. For Wa West and Wa East Districts, these numbers are lesser when travel is by road or motorized transport. This demonstrates the important role of a good road network in improving access to healthcare particularly in rural districts. At the regional level, only 52% of the inhabitants can reach the nearest health centre within 8 km if they have access to motorized transport. The findings also suggests that 4% of the inhabitants who can reach the nearest health centre within 8 km by foot cannot do so if they must travel by car or a motorbike. This is a critical health challenge since some medical emergencies (e.g., labour and motor accidents trauma) require motorized transport instead of foot to prevent avoidable deaths and improve health-outcomes. Our results also demonstrate that Wa West has the highest difference (19%) between the population within 8 km accumulated distance of a health centre and by motorized transport. Whereas patients who travel by motorized transport have much better accessibility to health centres within a given travel distance or time (see Zhou et al., 2021 ), our findings suggest that in districts such as Wa West, Lambussie-Karni, Daffiama-Bussie, and Wa East, the reverse is true where a higher percentage of inhabitants have access within 8 km walk distance compared to motorized travel. However, in districts such as Wa Municipal, Nandom, Sissala East and West, we found that inhabitants travelling by motorized transport have better accessibility to health centres within 8 km distance. Thus, differential accessibility by motorized transport and walking to health centres is a function of the availability and motorability of roads. Areas with good road network tend to have better access to health centres. This suggests the need for investment in road infrastructure in addition to provision of health care facilities to guarantee better health-outcomes. Access to hospitals (tertiary healthcare) was much lower compared to primary and secondary healthcare. Our findings show that only 48% and 78% of the inhabitants in Upper West Region can reach a hospital within 30 min and an hour respectively. It means that 52% of the total population of Upper West Region (811,046 people) cannot reach a hospital within 30 min if they have access to motorized transport. In addition, there are significant disparities in access to hospitals across the districts in the study area. For instance, less than a percent of the inhabitants in Wa East and Daffiama-Bussie-Issa districts can access a hospital within 30 min travel. Coincidently, these two districts lack a district hospital and must rely on hospitals in other districts during instances of medical referrals and emergencies. There are significant differences among the districts in terms of overall access to health services (Fig. 11 ). Districts where a higher percentage of the inhabitants can reach health services in the least time are typically urbanized with higher population, especially those concentrated westward along the main arterial roads in the region, and Sissala East (Fig. 9 a). This confirms a study by Kotavaara et al. (2021)  who established regional differences in health services access in Finland. They discovered that residents travelled shorter times to access health services in places with higher population densities. Four out of the five districts in Upper West Region (Fig. 11 ) that have high overall accessibility to health services have attained municipality status, demonstrating higher levels of population concentration. The two districts with the poorest overall accessibility, i.e., Wa East and West districts are mostly rural, characterized by poor or limited roads, and experience high poverty incidence compared to the other districts. Although, Sissala East had the highest percent of its inhabitants (74%) beyond the recommended 5 km travel distance to the closest primary health facility, low poverty incidence rates (second to Wa Municipal), higher NHIS subscriptions, higher motorable access to secondary and tertiary facilities and low population per registered general nurse, together, make it one of the districts with high overall access to health services. Several assumptions underlie this study which may affect the strength of our approach to health accessibility modelling. First, it was assumed that patients would not swim across rivers or water bodies and would not walk-through marshy areas even though doing so may represent the fastest route. Consequently, water bodies and marshy areas were modelled as barriers that could not be crossed. The model did not capture bridges that would normally facilitate walking across rivers. As a result, compared to the Euclidean distance metric, estimates of the number of individuals who have access to health facilities within specific distances may be underestimated. Second, under the network analysis approach, the centroids of the districts were assumed as the points of origin for estimating the ‘Origin Destination Cost Matrix’. Although this provided a uniform standard for comparing accessibility to hospitals among the districts, it does not reflect the actual point of origin for patients seeking care in a hospital. Finally, the ‘Origin Destination Cost Matrix’ estimates the shortest travel time and distance to a hospital closest to each district. The closest hospital may not always be the choice of patients because of several factors such as competition, capacity, and availability of services (Lakhani, 2021 ). Despite the above limitations, our study and methods showed several strengths. First, the accumulated distance approach enables a more realistic estimates of walk time compared to the Euclidean distance. Slope and natural barriers like rivers affect walk time and route, yet these are not accounted for in Euclidean distance measures of health accessibility. Thus, this study is an improvement over previous studies that relied on Euclidean distance to estimate health care access (Agbenyo et al., 2017 ; Ashiagbor et al., 2020 ). Second, this study estimated accessibility to health care using the accumulated distance approach and network analysis which enabled a comparison of accessibility between motorized travel and by foot. This approach has highlighted the role of roads in shaping inequities in health care access among districts in the Upper West Region. Finally, this study combined socio-economic, availability of health workers and health insurance coverage to establish overall accessibility to health care, thus going beyond previous which relied on only spatial-based measures of accessibility.  5.2 Important role of other factors and implications for policy and SDGs Results of this study have demonstrated that high physical accessibility through concentration of facilities does not necessarily translate into high health care access. Studies have shown that household level economic, demographic, sociocultural and political barriers have implications in terms of access to health (Peters et al., 2008 ). Despite the critical role of road infrastructure and availability of district hospitals, the findings showed that poor doctor patient ratio, high incidence of poverty and low NHIS subscription rate impede accessibility in some areas. From policy perspective, progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 3 must give due consideration to addressing rural transport infrastructure, providing hospitals in all districts, addressing economic inequalities, inadequacy of doctors and national health insurance subscription. For example, in terms of road infrastructure, it is imperative to improve road networks leading to health facilities. Studies have shown an inextricable relationsip between transportation and health care in rural areas (Atuoye et al., 2015 ). This implies that to scale up physical health care access, improvement in road infrastructure is imperative. In terms of policy directions, there is a need for national and sub-national policy initiatives for rural transportation. Secondly, economic inequalities in access to health for the poor has long been addressed through national health insurance schemes (Odeyemi & Nixon, 2013 ). Despite this, low subscription rate remains a major problem especially for primary health care (Macha, Kuwawenaruwa, Makawia, Mtei, & Borghi, 2014 ). In this study, low subscription to NHIS played a critical role in hindering full access to health care. For the SDG 3, national and sub-national governments will need to rollout comprehensive approaches for health insurance through advocacy. Finally, low presence of medical doctors is also a major factor. The findings suggest a need for improvement in doctor patient ratio through national policy on training of medical doctors. From the perspective of practice, alternative transportation such as motorcycle ambulance has been explored and used in other areas where road network or infrastructure is generally poor (Apiratwarakul et al., 2022 ; Ssebunya & Matovu, 2016 ). Although motorcycle ambulance has its own challenges such as cost, it nonetheless has contributed towards increasing access to primary health facilities especially in rural areas (Ssebunya & Matovu, 2016 ). A study in Malawi showed a reduction in referral delays by using motorcycle ambulance in rural areas (Hofman, Dzimadzi, Lungu, Ratsma, & Hussein, 2008 ). However, innovations are necessary in making motorcycle ambulance safer (Ssebunya & Matovu, 2016 ). Also considering the low patronage of the NHIS, an alternative funding model through community-based health insurance scheme (CBHIS) could be necessary in addressing some barriers of subscription. Studies have shown that CBHIS has prospects as it is locally owned and managed within the sociocultural context (Asfaw & Braun, 2005 ; Conde et al., 2022 ).   6 Conclusion This study is in response to the need for additional empirical evidence on measuring access to healthcare using spatial and aspatial factors in GIS. Using data from the Upper West region of Ghana, the study measured access to healthcare at three levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Using accumulated distance, the results showed that 61% and 81% of the population have access to primary and secondary health facilities, respectively, within the recommended maximum travel distances. These numbers are higher compared with the population with access to tertiary facilities (48%). Disaggregation of access by hierarchy of health facilities provided additional insights into the inequalities in access to healthcare. However, factoring transportation barriers and mode of travel, physical access is further reduced. Nonetheless, spatial access did not translate into full accessibility when socioeconomic and demographic variables were considered. Poverty incidence, subscription to national health insurance and number of doctors significantly influenced access. The combined spatial analysis with socioeconomic and demographic variables provided better insights into the overall healthcare accessibility at various levels. The findings suggest that it is imperative to consider rural transport infrastructure improvement, health insurance subscription, and increment in doctors present in rural areas for progress towards SDG 3.
