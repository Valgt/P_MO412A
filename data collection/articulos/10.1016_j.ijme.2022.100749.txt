                  Universities have an important role in ensuring that business school graduates can address issues regarding sustainable development and the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. While business schools have been progressively growing understanding of the SDGs, many have an unclear conception of their importance to business or how to effectively embed them into their curriculum. This paper explores the outcomes of one university in applying the SDGs as a learning framework for understanding global sustainability. Qualitative methodology was used to explore student perceptions regarding the efficacy of industry collaboration and Experiential Education Project-based Learning (EEPBL) methods, to integrate learning of SDGs into a university course. Through thematic analysis of 375 reflective essays and 18 semi-structured interviews, students reported an enhanced awareness and knowledge of SDGs, acquisition of key employability skills and development of new global perspectives. They found value in industry collaboration and EEPBL for acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the SDGs in a business context, and many developed an appreciation of their own agency for sustainability action in the future. This research can be presented as an example of one approach to both teaching students about the SDGs and embedding sustainability into their business curriculum.

Increasingly, employees in small and large organisations will be exposed to global ethical issues such as human rights abuses, child and slave labour, inequality, destruction of the environment, corruption and discrimination, as more businesses are called to account for their actions in a global community (Dean et al., 2018 ; Iftakhar & Bahauddin, 2018 ; SDSN, 2017 ). There is a growing recognition for the need to help students develop a greater awareness of ethical and sustainability issues (Zamora-Polo et al., 2019 ). With this enhanced awareness, our society can address these business and societal concerns that now garner much global attention and censure (Dellaportas et al., 2014 ; Voola et al., 2018 ). A key approach to embed this learning into the business curriculum is utilising the United Nations (UN) 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework for identifying and addressing ethical and sustainability problems. Illustrating this approach, this paper aims to report the findings of students undertaking an undergraduate business capstone subject at a major Australian university, providing insights of their experience on the learning of SDGs in the curriculum. The key aim is to utilise these findings to understand and inform future education approaches that will effectively embed knowledge, insight and personal agency regarding the UN SDGs and their connection to ethical and sustainable business practices. According to research by (Weybrecht, 2022 ), while business schools have been increasing their awareness of the SDGs since 2015, their approaches have been haphazard and inconsistent. Many business schools still use traditional management or business education approaches which discourage critical thinking or self-directed learning (Ndubuka & Rey-Marmonier, 2019 ), failing to utilise more transformational learning approaches such as experiential learning, critical reflection, collaborative or problem-based learning. Traditional learning approaches do not create the structures that foster student agency (Vaughn, 2020 ), which enables students to believe in their own ability to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Ortiz and Huber-Heim (2017)  refer to a successful experiential learning approach to SDG 1, end to poverty, whereby the students were actively involved in experiential activities and collaborations that enabled them to develop possible solutions to the SDG. This paper builds on such research by providing a further case study using experiential education through project-based learning (EEPBL) to teach students about the SDGs, providing them with the structure and agency to empower them to develop practical solutions for implementation in an organisation. The capstone subject, at the centre of this research, aims to fulfil the learning outcomes that develop skills for future employment in a sustainable, socially inclusive economy, by means of multidisciplinary teamwork to solve a complex business problem. This aligns with Biggs (1996)  theory of constructive alignment whereby the capstone subject employs an outcomes-based approach to teaching designed to specifically meet the learning outcomes. EEPBL was selected as the teaching approach in the capstone subject as traditional pedagogies merely impart knowledge to students, not leading them to make innovative action and change in regard to sustainability and the SDGs (Chineme et al., 2019 ). While other forms of learning such as service learning, indigenous knowledge-based learning and immersion programs have been successful in encouraging transformative action regarding the SDGs (Killian et al., 2019 ; Wood & Pansarella, 2019 ), the size and scale of this capstone subject (over 300 enrolled students) meant that EEPBL was the most effective and practical option. It also most appropriately met the unit learning outcomes, as the project-based learning approach was chosen to meet the requirements of developing skills for future employment via a multidisciplinary teamwork experience. This research contributes to the current business education literature by exploring how the implementation of EEPBL pedagogical methods, enriched by collaboration with industry representatives, can assist the integration of SDGs into university curriculum in a way that ensures students' ongoing engagement and motivation in addressing these business and social concerns. It also addresses a research gap regarding the inclusion and embedding of the SDGs into universities' courses and other activities (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). It seeks to understand the impact on final capstone students in a business course, using the SDGs as a learning context for developing an understanding of the concerns faced by organisations and governments, regarding addressing these global goals for sustainable development. It builds on the Gap Frame by implementing some of the approaches suggested by Muff et al. (2018) , such as asking teams of students from various cultural backgrounds to identify problems within selected global organisations and to ascertain their priority issues in regard to the implementation of the SDGs. Students are then required to isolate and recommend shared value strategies for their particular business, in order to work towards the achievement of true business sustainability (Dyllick & Muff, 2016 ). This research further extends the current business education literature by exploring how the implementation of EEPBL pedagogical methods, enriched by collaboration with industry representatives, can assist the integration of SDGs into university curriculum in a way that ensures students' ongoing engagement and motivation in addressing these business and social concerns. It also addresses a research gap regarding the inclusion and embedding of the SDGs into universities’ courses and other activities (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). The structure of this paper is as follows: “Literature Review” section will identify the current insights and arguments most relevant in setting the narrative for this paper. “Methods” section describes the method and procedures which includes the background context, participants, data collection and data analysis. For “Results/Findings” section, students’ experience and perspectives from reflective essays and semi-structured interviews will be analysed and presented. The “Discussions and future directions for research” section give the insights and recommendations for future research directions. Finally, the “Conclusions” section provides concluding remarks on learning of SDGs in the university business schools.  2 Literature review 2.1 SDGs in business curriculum The SDGs were developed and agreed by 193 member states in 2015. As part of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), they are a “universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030” (UN, n.d.). All 17 SDGs are interrelated and incorporate economic, social and environmental sustainability objectives for achievement by 2030 (UN, n.d.; WHO ). Accomplishing the SDGs will require significant commitment from all member countries and meaningful participation from businesses and industries (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). Increasingly, organisations must focus upon, and provide evidence of, their commitment to the triple bottom line (TBL) which is expanding their business focus from just financial gains, to incorporate social and environmental concerns (Abdelgaffar, 2021 ; Elkington, 2013 ; Nwagwu, 2020 ). By focussing on the SDGs as part of their commitment to TBL (Ferro et al., 2019 ), organisations will be better placed to manage risks, meet customer demands and improve supply chains for sustainable access to necessary resources (Ghosh & Rajan, 2019 ). By understanding the important role businesses play in accomplishing the SDGs, it is also meaningful to consider the pivotal role to be played by universities in this context (Weybrecht, 2022 ). Universities have a critical task in preparing business graduates to have the resources, skills, and awareness to confront problems, and maximise opportunities, related to sustainable development and the realisation of the SDGs by 2030 (Cole & Snider, 2019 ; Mori Junior et al., 2019 ). This view aligns with the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) by the United Nations Global Compact in 2007, which nominates education as the key conduit for promoting sustainable development and corporate social responsibility (CSR) (Parkes et al., 2017 ). Over 800 business schools reported their progress towards the PRME mission “to transform business and management education, and develop the responsible leaders of tomorrow” (Wall et al., 2020 , pp. 640–653; Wersun et al., 2021 ). PRME's next stage is being influenced by the formal embracing of the 2015 UN SDGs, which guide curriculum design and teaching approaches (Parkes et al., 2017 ). As responsible management learning has only recently begun to materialize as a unique research field (Laasch et al., 2020 ), it is important to consider the teaching and learning of sustainability in higher education in this context. One key process for teaching sustainability via PRME is through the SDGs (Storey et al., 2017 ). Most research undertaken in relation to PRME associate its implementation to the SDGs through the business schools (Avelar et al., 2022 ). In this regard, the SDGs are considered a significant medium for embedding sustainability into university business strategies and curriculum in order to create positive impact while addressing the key global issues (Mori Junior et al., 2019 ). The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), established in 2012 under the authority of the UN Secretary-General, was founded to rally global scientific and technological capability to develop and implement the SDGs (SDSN, 2017 ). This network created a “Getting Started with the SDGs in Universities” guide, encouraging universities to incorporate the SDGs into their curriculum (Dean et al., 2018 ). The guide recommended that universities were responsible for ensuring that students, including those from developing countries, had the skills, information, training and impetus to provide real solutions regarding the implementation of the SDGs (SDSN, 2017 ). While a number of universities have played an active role in supporting the SDGs, greater work needs to be done regarding the embedding of sustainability, particularly into their business curriculum (Driscoll et al., 2017 ; Ferrer-Estévez & Chalmeta, 2021 ; Weybrecht, 2022 ). While many business schools provide courses featuring ethics and sustainability, they are generally not part of the mainstream education requirements (Voola et al., 2018 ). Business schools tend to focus more intensely on the role of organisations in addressing environmental challenges but neglecting their responsibilities regarding human rights issues embodied in SDGs such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Quality Education (SDG 4), Peace Justice and Strong Institutions (SDG 16), and other social considerations such as gender equality (SDG 5) and poverty (SDG 1) (Fisher & McAdams, 2015 ). There has also been a great deal of variation regarding how and in what way Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) incorporate sustainability and the SDGs into their curriculum (Weybrecht, 2017 ). Some methods include the adoption of specialist degrees or specific elective subjects (Nicholls et al., 2013 ), while others involve an interdisciplinary process by integrating teaching of the SDGs into the common business subjects such as management, economics and marketing (Beddewela et al., 2017 ). In many cases, the teaching approach fails to provide students with the ability to put their learning of SDGs into practice, rendering them an added extra to business and not part of their core strategy (Beddewela et al., 2017 ; Weybrecht, 2017 ). By entrenching SDGs into business curriculum in a way beneficial and applicable to students, universities will provide graduates with meaningful technical and cultural capital as well as enhancing their employability (Jelonek & Urbaniec, 2019 ).  2.2 Experiential education through project-based learning (EEPBL) There are multiple ways for designing learning that facilitates the attainment of the resources, skills and awareness for understanding and acting upon the SDGs. Based on constructivist assumptions (Von Glasersfeld, 1989 ), EEPBL is a student-centred concept, founded on the premise that learning is context specific, with learners dynamically engaged in the learning process via the investigation of legitimate real-life issues (Al-Balushi & Al-Aamri, 2014 ; Birdman et al., 2020 ; Blumenfeld et al., 1991 ). EEPBL approaches to university teaching have generally been acknowledged as successful pedagogical methods for enhancing student learning (de Los Rios et al., 2010 ; Hunt & Chalmers, 2021 ). These forms of learning differ from the traditional approaches, which focus on content memorization and passive learning. Hence, EEPBL approaches require the learner to take a more active role in their education. By integrating the knowledge they have gained from previous life and learning experiences with the use of disciplinary tools, models, technologies and scenarios, EEPBL guides students to solve problems and address issues that might arise in a real world situation (Dean et al., 2018 ; Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006 ). When avenues supporting EEPBL are embedded into curriculum, this can lead to powerful learning phenomena by enabling students to practice skills and undertake experiences they can transfer to effective practices in a complex world (Dean et al., 2018 ; Fang et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, there is agreement amongst researchers that traditional educational methods do not precipitate the innovative or effective knowledge and understanding of sustainability (Chineme et al., 2019 ; David, 1991 , p. pp52; Frisk & Larson, 2011 ). However, preliminary research on the employment of EEPBL techniques in teaching this domain have indicated greater success in regard to enabling student understanding and engendering future action towards achieving the SDGs (Chineme et al., 2019 ; Dean et al., 2018 ; Pérez-Sánchez et al., 2020 ). Educators can provide students with EEPBL opportunities and environments that mirror similar situations to those they will confront in future work roles, to pilot them more effectively through the learning process. An approach to establishing such environments, as well as successfully achieving outcomes using EEPBL to teach sustainability and the SDGs, is effective cooperation between universities and industry (Paletta et al., 2019 ; Piekarski et al., 2019 ). There are a number of options available to universities in developing collaborative arrangements with key business stakeholders, in the forms of guest lecturers, industry projects and problem-solving and innovation initiatives (Paletta et al., 2019 ; Ryan & Hauser, 2020 ). Not only does this collaboration make the process for implementing and addressing the SDGs easier by combining resources, knowledge and technology to confront the challenges (Paletta et al., 2019 ), but studies show that the role of industry is vital in developing transformative learning experiences for students in sustainability courses (Afacan, 2014 ; Iyer-Raniga & Andamon, 2016 ). Furthermore, this type of collaborative learning enhances students’ abilities to build stronger connections between business and education in regards to sustainability and the SDGs, generating a more consistent commitment to social and environmental responsibilities (Cottafava et al., 2019 ; Slahova et al., 2007 ). In line with the growing concern for the environment and global inequalities, organisations are progressively placing expectations on universities to ensure that their graduates can proficiently apply sustainability concepts to solve complex business challenges. However, business schools appear to have delayed action on these assumptions (Ndubuka & Rey-Marmonier, 2019 ). Currently, there is limited understanding regarding how universities are approaching the incorporation of the SDGs into their programs (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ), the current and previous knowledge held by students regarding the SDGs (Zamora-Polo et al., 2019 ), what pedagogical methods are being utilised to put SDG and sustainability teaching into practice (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ; Valderrama-Hernández et al., 2020 ) and an evaluation of student perceptions and learning outcomes when teaching SDGs using EEPBL (Dean et al., 2018 ). To fulfil the SDGs and prepare suitably skilled graduates, universities will need to rethink and restructure the current curriculum (Shiel et al., 2020 ). They also need to examine the adoption of different learning processes to more effectively enrich student learning about how to address the SDGs, as well developing the skills, aptitudes and cross cultural awareness to implement relevant courses of action (Aarts et al., 2020 ; Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). There are clear advantages for universities in strategically embedding SDGs into their learning programs, particularly the impacts this will have on community and even global engagement with the goals (Kopnina, 2018 ). To entrench learning of SDGs into university programs, interactive learning and teaching approaches will need to be implemented to “motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development” (UNESCO, 2014 ). Muff et al. (2018)  uses a concept called Gap Frame which operates on the premise that there is a “safe space” to consider the current state of the world and an ideal future state which we can live satisfactorily on our planet. Using the Gap Frame to analyse the most critical issues in a country and/or organisation that relate to the environment, economy, governance and society can assist businesses in converting these issues into long-term opportunities referred to by Dyllick and Muff (2016)  as “true business sustainability”. Other programs focussing on embedding SDGs into Higher education include Aim2Flourish, which provides a platform for educators to encourage students to want to make a better world by focussing on successful sustainable and socially responsible business initiatives (Nonet & Petrescu, 2018 ). The Carbon Literacy Project (CPL) is a further education program that aims to provide relevant learning about climate change and carbon emissions to generate action towards one of the major global sustainability challenges (Dunk et al., 2017 ). While these are useful programs available to educators, the EEPBL utilised in this paper was selected to encourage broader sustainability learning beyond climate change, and to further present students with a problem to analyse and solve. The Gap Frame, Aim2Flourish and the CPL are all tools that could be utilised as resources within this paper's EEPBL approach in future iterations.   3 Methods 3.1 Background context The capstone subject at the focus of this research, is a core final year business subject in a large public Australian University. As a non-exam assessment-based subject, students are expected to draw from prior knowledge and experiences gained from previously enrolled business subjects whilst attempting all the assessments. The learning outcomes associated with the capstone subject are:1. Develop skills for future employment in a sustainable, socially inclusive economy (LO1)  2. Develop the ability to work in a diverse multi-disciplinary team and use research skills and disciplinary knowledge to solve a complex business challenge. (LO2)    Assessments come in the form of three group assessments (Project scoping assignment – 10%, SDG project proposal assignment – 40%, video presentation – 20%), one individual reflective essay (20%) and group participation/discussion during class (10%). Students are put into groups set by the lecturer that ensured a good mix of gender, ethnicity and academic ability (based on previous academic results). This capstone subject adopted a flexible EEPBL approach coupled with in-class active learning activities. As part of a team in a multinational Australian company of their choice, each student group was tasked to evaluate the current strategies of the company undertaken in addressing a real-life SDG problem impacting its operations, analysing the gaps/challenges and write an SDG project proposal outlining innovative strategies, which could be implemented to mitigate the problem. For the project scoping assignment, significant extensive research was required by each student group to analyse and select one country in which the multinational Australian company has operations. They then had to identify one SDG that their chosen organisation most needed to address and provide a justification for why this was the case, before completing the SDG project proposal. Over the period of each semester, various learning activities were facilitated to familiarise students with the SDGs. One example had students learning from real life examples through in-class discussions with international development consultants with extensive SDG project experience. These consultants were invited as industry speakers to share their experience and insights on specific SDG topics. Another activity was having library research skills sessions by university librarians to guide students in regard to undertaking in-depth research and analysis of the SDGs and related issues, using the library databases and web sources. The rest of the learning activities involve the lecturer facilitating group discussions, allowing students in their groups to problem solve and generate ideas during classes.  3.2 Participants A total of 375 reflective essays of students followed by 18 one-to-one in-depth semi-structured interviews during the academic year 2020 were selected for this study. The cohort student population for the capstone subject was 375 students. For the one-to-one in-depth semi-structured interviews, an email invitation was sent out to the cohort student population in December 2020.23 students accepted the invitation to participate in this study. These students have completed and passed the capstone subject. The selected interviews for this study were then limited to 18 because at this point the researchers felt that data saturation, the point during the collection of data and its analysis whereby little or no new information regarding the research, had been reached. This aligns with research into data saturation by Guest et al. (2006)  that found that the initial five or six interviews in a qualitative dataset elicited the bulk of new material, and that limited fresh information was obtained as the sample size neared 18–20 interviews. The students were made aware it was voluntary to participate in this study and that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time without giving any reasons. The students were assured of confidentiality for this study and that the data collected was to be used for research purposes only. Ethics consent was granted for this research by the university's Human Research Ethics Committee.  3.3 Data collection Data was initially collected through reflective essays, which required students to reflect on the learning of SDGs and their educational experience in the capstone subject. The 375 students consented to their reflective essays being analysed for the purposes of the research over the period of two semesters in 2020. To further triangulate the data and gain deeper insights, the selected one-to-one in-depth semi-structured interviews were then employed between January and February 2021. This approach enabled us to capture the students’ lived experience and their perceptions of the learning of SDGs through EEPBL. The interviews were fairly informal and conversational, framed around the following open-ended questions (1) What was your understanding/perspectives of SDGs before and after completing the capstone subject? (2) How did you find the learning of SDGs through EEPBL? Share your experience, (3) Share any highlights and challenges of learning of SDGs through EEPBL, (4) How was the teaching/discussion session of SDGs by the industry speakers? Share your experience, (5) Share with us of any knowledge and skills gained during the learning of SDGs through EEPBL. As lockdown restrictions were in place, the interviews were audio recorded online via a video conferencing tool ZOOM. Each interview lasted around 45–60 min and was carefully transcribed. Information was de-identified and each student allocated a pseudonym (S1–S18 for interviews, S19–S395 for reflective essays).  3.4 Data analysis Qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis both adopt the same analytical method by analysing text data and eliciting student comments and perceptions (Braun & Clarke, 2006 ; Mayring, 2004 ). Qualitative content analysis was used for reflective essays. The analysis of reflective essays was done in NVivo 12.0 software whereby the student reflections were coded by each author, forming coding lists. Thematic analysis was used for the interviews. The students’ experience and perspectives from the interviews were analysed and coded by each author using NVivo 12.0 software, forming coding lists. Both of the abovementioned analysis were iterative as each author continued to analyse and refine until data saturation was achieved and no new codes manifested. With the coding lists and interpretations generated and collated from the reflective essays and interview data, the authors then convened to discuss and compare each other's lists and interpretations. Upon detailed analysis and discussions amongst the authors, adjustments and refinements were made to the codes which were then categorised into main themes and sub-themes. A final round of review was conducted by each author. The entire approach ensured data triangulation between the reflective essay data and interview data, meaning that meticulous interpretation and rich insights could be obtained from them while increasing the credibility and validity of the research findings (Elo et al., 2014 ; Howitt, 2019 ).   4 Results/findings This study analyses the perceptions of final capstone students in a business course, regarding the use of the UN SDGs in assisting their understanding of their application to organisations and governments, and the skills and benefits they believe they attained from learning about the SDGs in a collaborative, project-based learning approach. Upon the analysis of the collected data, the following main themes were identified and mapped to the corresponding learning outcomes of the capstone subject (See Table 1  ). Sub-themes were further identified and expanded according to the corresponding main themes. Although each main theme was presented and sub-themes expanded upon separately, they are not independent of each other and may interlink to varying extent. While valuable data was obtained from the reflective essays and are included in the results section, the rich data gleaned from the semi-structured interviews were explored and examined in more depth. 4.1 Theme 1: awareness and knowledge of SDGs 4.1.1 Sub-theme 1.1: enhanced awareness of SDGs Students were asked if they heard of SDGs prior to enrolling into the capstone subject. The majority of them (91%) commented that they had heard little about them or had no idea what they were but that their awareness was enhanced during the learning in the capstone subject:I've heard of them, but never really read into it much. So I didn't really know much about it. I just knew they existed. And that was more or less everything. You think I was like in year 11, or 12 when I first came across the SDGs. I think it was related to my history class that we just had like a general conversation and someone just talked about it. (S9)  I had never heard of the SDG’s. After learning about them I felt ignorant that I was oblivious to something so important. (S223)   Those students who had heard about SDGs were largely individuals who had undertaken a Health and Human Development subject in their final year of high school or undertaking a double degree incorporating Arts subjects such as Global Politics and International Relations. Students admitted that they had mostly studied the SDGs by rote learning the goals and gaining an understanding of how the goals had been met in various countries. There was limited analysis of the goals as they applied to business and very little regarding providing real solutions relating to the implementation of the SDGs. This finding reflects what other studies have found: while universities support the SDGs, there has been limited work in regard to the embedding of SDGs from all perspectives into their mainstream curriculum (Driscoll et al., 2017 ; Ferrer-Estévez & Chalmeta, 2021 ; Weybrecht, 2022 ).  4.1.2 Sub-theme 1.2: knowledge of SDGs broadened Many students saw benefit in having a broader knowledge of SDGs, especially in regard to the interrelated nature of the 17 goals:Before I understand sustainability as environment … pollute less, carbon-free product and things like that …. that I think that is sustainability. But actually, what we're looking at SDGs … it is education, it is zero hunger, it is good health and well-being … all these goals. I realised that … environment is only one part of sustainability. Sustainability is so broad. (S18)  Before this project, I had heard of the SDGs but knew very little about them other than that they were supposed to make the world more sustainable. As a result, having an in-depth knowledge of these goals will be useful as a graduate as this knowledge can be applied to every organisation. (S92)  … When in [foundation year studies], I look at SDGs as separate issues … but in [this subject], somehow I look at it differently. It looked like every problem seems interrelated with each other. It's like poverty is related to “no hunger”, and then related to “health and well-being. (S10)   This supports the research demonstrating that business schools focus more specifically on the environmental issues as they relate to organisations but fail to consider the interconnected nature of the goals, whereby the obtaining success in relation one goal will mean confronting issues that are ore generally associated with another goal (Fisher & McAdams, 2015 ).   4.2 Theme 2: skills acquired through the learning of SDGs using EEPBL Connecting their learning of the SDGs to the development of key employability skills was another interesting finding in this study. All of the students in this study identified the employability skills (Critical thinking, communication, teamwork, problem solving, etc) and research skills they acquired throughout the period of their learning. This reinforces previous research findings (de Los Rios et al., 2010 ; Dean et al., 2018 ; Fang et al., 2022 ; Hunt & Chalmers, 2021 ) that implementing an EEPBL approach in Higher Education enhances student learning and facilitates the ability of students to exercise skills and apply behaviours that will replicate real workplace scenarios and issues.The Group Project allowed us to activate critical thinking in a business context. We were expected to collaborate as a diverse team and evaluate a chosen company’s alignment with the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDG). As a team, this not only challenged our preconceptions of Nike, but made us question our original thought processes about whether the company was doing enough (S21).  I think, definitely a high level of critical thinking and problem solving … there were a lot of times where I was getting frustrated because more problems kept arising, or as I did more research, I was realising that our plans changed so many times throughout the journey because, you know, you start with one thing, and then you'd start doing more research. (S14)  Critical thinking in both commerce and law involves identifying issues and analysing them to identify how they can be solved. The major project required this the most as my group did not know how to solve the issues we initially identified. It was only after thorough research and discussion that we understood the issues well enough to begin creating solutions. (S334)   Students also noted technical skills (Data analysis and project management) which they acquired and made clear links between how being able to undertake “deeper research and creative thinking [allowed them] to identify strategies that other industries use to [enhance] their work” (S162).… having the opportunity to actually find the data that we needed to inform our decision, then analyse that data and think about how that could interact with our [SDG] project … (S6)  One of the main things that I picked up was the sort of aspect of project management that was a part of this report that we did … (S15)  … it just helped us in creating a better project plan of how we will tackle [issues], how we will end our own project, how an actual project was fielded and created. (S9)   Many students felt they were enlightened regarding the importance of finding and analysing data, then using it to develop “the best conclusions and decisions … by weighing influencing factors such as time, project implementability, risk, and reward” (S45), which also highlighted their development of important project management skills.  4.3 Theme 3: benefits of learning SDGs using EEPBL Many students (58%) appreciated the practical way in learning about the SDGs and recognising how to deal with SDG related issues from a practical, business-focussed lens:the biggest difference is there's sort of a different way that you need to approach learning the SDGs … when you're just learning it, in terms of like, just the knowledge of “What the SDGs are, this is how they have been incorporated” versus “Here is this SDG, how are you going to look at the goal and how are you going to build a project that will further this?” … I think the practical learning approach was really useful … (S6)  … it was like a practical project. And we actually had to try and figure out how to really implement a measure to deal with the [SDG]. It is very different from learning about it theoretically because you sort of realise you get through and you're trying to find a bunch of information on specifics … (S7)  The unit’s learning of the UN’s SDGs and application of this knowledge through the major project has equipped me with a better understanding of the sustainability obligations corporations and the wider global community face going forward to achieving a prosperous future. (S174)  Oh … the learning was a lot more practical. So, you know, sometimes in [Arts subjects] … and not that I'm not having a go at [the way SDGs is taught] … but you know, they say “everyone should fight for this and this”. [The way Art subjects teach SDGs] sometimes neglect to put in perspective for our students how difficult it is to make these [changes for this SDG] projects … So it put everything into perspective for me [learning in this capstone subject] (S11)   This confirms one of the key objectives of EEPBL which integrates the use of learners’ prior knowledge with relevant learning tools to provide a practical, real life learning experience that encourages more realistic perspectives and self-efficacy regarding current business issues (Dean et al., 2018 ; Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006 ).  4.4 Theme 4: collaborative teaching of SDGs with industry partners Many students highlighted the usefulness of industry speakers sharing their SDGs perspectives and practical experiences in managing SDGs related projects. While there were no significant insights from the reflective essays, 75% of the students from the semi-structured interviews noted that the programme had taught them ‘reality’ via the guest speakers, who were mainly active or former entrepreneurs.… Just having an extra perspective of people that are involved in [SDG] … something that's so relevant to the subject … I think that hearing someone firsthand experience is definitely helpful. (S4)  I found the industry speakers really interesting actually … it's having that knowledge or hearing about someone who has actually done it. And I think hearing about the challenges and just kind of the process of it. It was interesting to hear [how they did it] and then kind of doing it ourselves (S14)   It is interesting that some students identified that while industry collaboration is clearly needed to advance the SDGs, hearing passionate and empathetic individuals who speak about the SDGs from a personal perspective is what will instigate changed behaviour and awareness in young people.Most industry speakers represent a company and be like “if you work for us, that's what we do …“. Whereas with this industry speaker that we had … it was not about like making profit. It was not about necessarily representing a company. It was improving a situation that needs improvement. And it's not for our benefits … it's for millions of other children and people around the world that are not as privileged which to me was just a really nice change to see that those people do exist that tries to make the world a better place, not just for the privilege, but also for the people who are not as privileged (S9)  … Give first hand accounts of what they're doing and gave us ideas, or possible ideas of what we can do for our [SDG project assignment]. (S3)  These views indicate that the development of partnerships with industry is important in influencing young adults regarding the importance of the SDGs. Further, these alliances must be enhanced via the inclusion of inspirational and impassioned industry representatives, to stimulate student interest and agency regarding their individual commitment to acting upon sustainability and the SDGs.    4.5 Theme 5: develop a different perspective after learning SDGs One of the most significant findings was the changes in perspective of the students regarding the SDGs, their significance to industry and to the students themselves. The participants (65%) identified that their learning and understanding of SDGs were broadly different in the capstone subject compared to what they had learned in their other subjects:… a lot of work in in the arts degree is analytical or theoretical … Whereas in [this capstone subject], it's more so about application … I think it was really useful. And then I think this is sort of mostly like, or, as well as for like the entire business degree, but it helps me sort of think about how a lot of the things that I learned in international relations can be sort of thought about but then put into an actual project or an actual actually utilised (S6)  Before completing this subject, I had moderate knowledge of the SDGs through various assessment centres and their case studies often requiring inclusion of SDGs as a factor. After my experience, I now understand how to integrate them better into decision-making and strategies. The primary goal I see myself working towards in my future career in law is Goal 16 because I am passionate about improving access to justice so anyone who needs justice can obtain it. (S198)  … In my arts degree, I did one called global governance. you would look at an SDG like poverty but then you would only apply that on an issue level, not really on a detailed analysis level … not [looking at the data compared to how we do it in this capstone subject]. [Arts] was more of a governance policy, politic political lens rather than a data driven lens. (S11)   Students felt their view of society and world has changed:What I really appreciated from it was … as an example in our assignment, we as a group were saying “Well, the country doesn't have has low attendance rates at school, because it's not compulsory education. So we'll just make education compulsory.” And then as we went [deeper into the topic], we were like “That's such a privileged point of view.” Because you can't just walk into a country … a country that doesn't have equal access to education and just say “make it compulsory”. You've got to make the access to it equal first before you can say it's compulsory. (S14)  It is important to be aware of these SDGs as a commerce graduate, as corporations have a major role to play in the fulfillment of these goals due to their major negative contributions leading to the requirement of many of the SDGs. I will be able to use this knowledge in my career to ensure that the work I am doing is for the betterment of society and in working to achieve these goals, rather than becoming part of the problem. (S46)  I think it just makes my thinking more critical in terms of seeing, knowing more about humanity problems in the world … it just made me wondering there's already a lot of people trying to solve a lot like most of these problems. But it's still happening and still getting worse.. what we can actually do to help reduce the problem … (S10)  I think it does change your perspective. I think you see the world a bit differently … I think it obviously improves your comprehension and understanding of the world, but in a way also improves your empathy. You sort of understand other people better, but you can also see why people act the way they do and you can understand their emotions and the things that people have gone through because you have learned about it and you have studied it too. I think that's good. (S1)   There was recognition by these students that learning SDGs from multiple perspectives enhanced their knowledge and mastery of the goals, as well as their relevance at various social and economic levels. This aligns with the notion that the SDGs are strongly interconnected and as such, given their breadth and the interdependence of the sustainable development agenda, there needs to be a stronger interdisciplinary approach to embedding them in the curricula (Albareda-Tiana et al., 2018 ; Annan-Diab & Molinari, 2017 ). Students commented that their personal perspective of life has changed after enhancing their understanding of SDGs:I think that it definitely made me think more about what I want to do with my career in terms of whether I want to solely work for a company, which is going to focus on itself, or whether I want to work for a company that's going to actively try and [achieve} this and is well rounded as well, as you know. (S15)  I think as a person coming from a very privileged position and living in a developed country, there's so many things that you just rose coloured glasses on and you're like “yeah, we can just like go in and do this”. But it's just … it's a really like a privileged way of thinking. So I think this [learning of SDGs] is really good for that because it just makes you think differently and proves to you that you can't be so short sighted. (S14)  The major project enlightened me to the level of influence the commercial industry holds in ensuring the SDGs are adhered to, and ultimately achieved. (S306)  I found this [SDG subject] more interesting because beforehand, I was always questioning “Why is business always maximising profit? Why is it always about [gross domestic product]?” I like that this [SDG subject] was because it was focused more on social meaning. (S5)   It is particularly interesting here that these students are subconsciously identifying what the World Business Council for Sustainable Development has long argued that generally education, specifically business education, has been built on a classic capitalist perspective (Barnett, 2004 ; Muff et al., 2013 ). Not changing this perspective will make it difficult to change behaviour towards sustainability. The acknowledgement of the above students that they have a privileged perspective regarding the SDGs and their implementation, indicates an implicit understanding of the disproportionate power structure of the current neoliberal capitalist development framework (Brissett, 2018; Boluk, Cavaliere & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019; Alm et al., 2021 ). This paradigm not only promotes greater inequalities and places pressure on natural resources, intensifying damage to eco-systems (Kopnina, 2018  Washington, 2018) but also ignores the impacts of culture and economic wealth on the achievement of the SDGs (Zheng et al., 2021).  4.6 Theme 6: understanding of their own agency in regard to implementing the SDGs A final theme of note was the identification by some students that they have individual agency in regard to implementing the SDGs and are not necessarily reliant on governments or organisations to take action. A number of students (43%) indicated that by undertaking the subject, they now believed that they could contribute to the accomplishment of the SDGs through their own endeavours.Overall, I do feel that Commerce graduates have a responsibility to make the future of business sustainable, as corporations are a large contributor to climate change, and the SDGs will be a helpful framework to assist me in upholding this responsibility. (S257)  If we use our knowledge of the SDG’s to underpin our decision making process and explain the importance to our co-workers, we are in a position to make a difference. (S85)  My first reaction was SDGs would not be relevant to my career goal given my pursuit of a career in the legal industry. However, I now realise the naivety of this notion. Laws and regulations involved in the work I undertake will undeniably be aimed at achieving specific purposes, some of which will be aligned with certain SDGs. In this sense, I will have a role in furthering sustainability goals and outcomes by ensuring that laws are complied with (S317).  I would say through learning about SDGs. And then people actually how they incorporate that into their operations. Maybe it's business for myself, personally, I think I've noticed that Oh, okay. So prior to it, I was very interested in sustainability and understanding how that worked. And then, of course, you know, going into work was thinking about gender equality and how that affects me in the corporate workplace, unfortunately, definitely has solidified that I would say, and also has let me know, okay, I can have a greater impact than I may have imagined previously. (S16)   It is worth noting that the development of student agency regarding the SDGs are not formally taught or evaluated in the capstone subjects. Despite this, almost half of the students described the value that they had gained from understanding the depth and breadth of the goals and the opportunities they may have to contribute to their execution in the future. This was an important aspect of the course that was implicit in the subject material and teaching approach, which incorporated industry speakers, experiential learning and extended research. In summing up, the themes considered here suggest that the students gained significant value from participating in the capstone subject examined and the explanatory quotes and accompanying commentary display the types of benefits they received. In the ensuing section, we review how the findings underpin and extend the extant literature.   5 Discussions and future directions for research Several contributions have been made to the body of knowledge pertaining to the learning of SDGs. Responding to the call for more qualitative findings (Ferrer-Estévez & Chalmeta, 2021 ), this paper provides rich insights on the integration of SDGs in the business curricular of educational institutions, the impacts of pedagogical approaches for learning of SDGs and the skills and knowledge acquired through the learning of SDGs. In addition, this paper focuses its findings at undergraduate level from an Australian university, hence contributing to the literature seeking further research at different study levels (Pérez-Sánchez et al., 2020 ; SDSN, 2017 ) and in regions other than Europe or America (Avelar et al., 2019 ; Figueiró & Raufflet, 2015 ). 5.1 Theoretical implications Our findings suggest that the initial lack of awareness by many business students, as demonstrated by the comments in Theme 1, are in line with previous studies on the student awareness level of SDGs (Alvarez-Risco et al., 2021 ; Zamora-Polo et al., 2019 ). Students indicated that there has been a lack of exposure to SDGs prior to enrolment in university, and even within their undergraduate courses, particularly in regard to the role of business and organisations in their achievement of the SDGs. This aligns with previous research suggesting that sustainability is not a widely understood topic in society, and that encouraging and assuring the interest of students and future business leaders in global sustainability requires significant action (de Paula Arruda Filho et al., 2019 ). It also has implications for structure-agency theory by Vaughn (2020) . This theoretical concept maintains that individual agency is influenced by the structures, organisations, or rules of a person's environment (Mawonde & Togo, 2021 ). Lack of awareness and appreciation of the SDGs by the students can be classed as both a structural and an agency problem. Our findings confirm that in universities where there is a focus principally on imparting knowledge about the SDGs as a concept rather than a shared duty, student awareness and cognizance of the SDGs is limited, as is their recognition of them as a vehicle through which business can transform the lives of others globally. It further highlights the importance of university business schools in incorporating the SDGs into the curriculum of core subjects, so that the perceived knowledge gap can be narrowed. The findings also highlight significant positive impacts the incorporation of the SDGs had in expanding students’ knowledge of global sustainability, thereby achieving the important outcomes of further expanding their cultural awareness of countries and continuing their development as global citizens (Rajabifard et al., 2021 ; Tyran, 2017 ). The comments in Theme 6 highlighted that some students discovered their own agency in terms of the impact that they can have in contributing to the achievement of the SDGs, via their choice of employer or employment. Our findings support Giddens (1979), by demonstrating that providing an environmental structure where students can easily obtain knowledge and participate in exploring SDG initiatives, encourages an understanding of how and what they can do as individuals in contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. Furthermore, it supports preliminary research by de Freitas Nunes (2021)  that the use of dialogue (discussion, collaboration, problem solving) and global social responsibility education can, explicitly and implicitly, mould students' perspectives of their individual ability to address sustainability issues, by contributing to, or eliciting, social change of local/global magnitude. This addresses an acknowledged gap in the literature relating to universities and the SDGs, and their progress in cultivating sustainability competencies in students and developing personal and professional agency (Alm et al., 2021 ; Chankseliani & McCowan, 2021 ). In addition, the insight of some students as reflected in Theme 5, regarding the impact of their privileged position on truly understanding and enacting appropriate change for the SDGs, corroborates the need for pedagogical methodologies that educate students to appreciate and implement an empathetic sustainability agenda that transcends neoliberal capitalism as the sole dogma (Alm et al., 2021 ; Huckle & Wals, 2015 ; Manteaw, 2008 ). This paper further contributes to the literature on pedagogical methods for teaching SDGs in higher education, specifically considering the impact and relevance of the EEPBL approaches (Dean et al., 2018 ; Pérez-Sánchez et al., 2020 ; Wyness & Dalton, 2018 ). The EEPBL approach utilised in the capstone subject in this investigation, provided a platform for students to work together, using prior the discipline knowledge/skills they had already attained in the course of their degree, to collaborate in groups on a real-life SDG problem. Importantly, the findings revealed in Themes 2 and 3, illustrate how an effective and engaging EEPBL approach in the learning of SDGs enabled students to acquire several employability skills (combination of technical skills, soft skills and research skills) critical for graduating university students (Suleman, 2018 ; Wyness & Dalton, 2018 ). This builds on previous studies whereby EEPBL models were implemented as active teaching methods, encouraging students to be the key protagonists in their learning journey (Cottafava et al., 2019 ; Killian et al., 2019 ; Mann et al., 2021 ). As with these previous studies, this investigation demonstrates how students have used EEPBL to solve challenging problems, identify areas for investigation, and provide recommendations utilising their research, prior knowledge, available resources, and critical reflection dynamically and collaboratively. It also provides a blueprint for other educators to build on in developing their own EEPBL pedagogy for teaching sustainability.  5.2 Practical implications Our findings embodied in Theme 4 also revealed a number of practical implications for universities. The industry speaker sessions added further value to SDGs learning, consistent with previous findings by Ryan and Hauser (2020)  that industry/university partnerships are essential to realizing the implementation of the SDGs. Having someone to share their perspectives, challenges and grassroot insights from a business perspective, enhances the students’ understanding of the economic gains related to SDG accomplishment, while furthering their understanding of practical requirements such as the need to set project targets and develop practical and realistic solutions guided by data. A significant finding from the student perspectives, was the revelation that the selected industry speakers spoke of their commitment to the SDGs arising from their own passion and empathy with the goals, rather than from an organizational or brand promotion perspective. This industry collaboration approach reflects findings by Odelami and Fasakin (2019)  highlighting the importance of awareness and agency in eliciting the active involvement of young people in the sustainability development agenda. Exposing students to industry representatives who exhibit passion and empathy to speak about the SDGs, may further inspire students to promote the cause of SDGs as future business leaders from a personal, as well as an organizational approach, to sustainability development issues. In line with the call to investigate further the combination of pedagogical approaches for SDGs (Figueiró & Raufflet, 2015 ), our findings noted the impacts of combining the library research skills and industry speaker sessions with the EEPBL approach. The library research skills sessions enabled students to do extensive research using the library databases and appropriate web sources. Students were guided not just at citing the sources but further at investigating more deeply and analysing the real-time data/indicators of SDGs. As students remarked, the learning lens in this capstone subject was different to the lens utilised to learn about the SDGs in arts subjects, which approached the topic from a historical and policy perspective. This implies the teaching of SDGs in business curriculum can differentiate from arts or other curriculum, providing students with a broader and more nuanced understanding of their social and economic importance. This research has its limitations. Firstly, the research was qualitative and the sample size of the interviews was small. Hence, the validity and generalisation of the findings may be limited. Our findings also did not provide a comparative breakdown of students’ perceptions according to enrolment status. Future research work could include a survey which compare quantitative results on the learning of SDGs between local and international students. Another limitation was while students indicated the benefits received from interacting with industry speakers and gaining different perspectives, we are unsure of the influence these speakers may have on the students acting as champions of the SDGs as future industry and business leaders. This requires further investigation in future research. This research only considered the perceptions of students, hence future studies can look at the perceptions of academic staff and tutors involved in the teaching of SDGs in the capstone subject. As the research was only limited to business undergraduate students, it will also be interesting to study and compare the learning of SDGs in capstone subjects at business postgraduate level.   6 Conclusions The application of the UN SDGs to business school courses is a significant step in producing graduates who are cognizant that the achievement of global sustainability is linked inextricably with the accomplishment of the SDGs. However, educating future generations for sustainability and the achievement of the SDGs provides significant challenges for universities in regard to how, what and when to integrate relevant materials and processes into their curriculum. This research has shown that while there is still some way to go to ensure that universities’ educational approaches are appropriately bound to the achievement of global sustainability, business course content and activities can easily be adapted to align and respond to the SDGs. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the focus of sustainability education can transcend simply the provision of subject matter regarding historical, existing and developing sustainability problems, to achieving the engagement of students in EEPBL education environments, enabling them to explore real life sustainability issues in current global contexts. This approach encouraged and empowered students to develop appropriate and practical responses to country specific sustainability issues, explicitly incorporating the SDGs. From the student responses, this method expanded their understanding of the SDGs and highlighted their own agency as graduates, in terms of taking future action towards the achievement of global sustainability. Finally, this research serves as a potential model for effectively teaching university business students about the UN SDGs, by employing engaging and practical EEPBL pedagogical frameworks, and as a potential guide for embedding sustainability education into university curriculum. By reflecting on student insights regarding their developed nation perspectives on addressing sustainability, this research could be used to instigate permanent, more culturally and economically nuanced changes to the current sustainability via economic growth model generally applied in business education.
