                  Objectives
                  The aims of this article were to analyse the burden of NCDs and their RFs in the Mercosur countries between 1990 and 2019 and to project mortality trends for 2030.
               
                  Study design
                  Epidemiological study of time series.
               
                  Methods
                  The present study used data from the Global Burden of Disease study. The absolute number of deaths, mortality rates, disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, years lived with disability and the burden of premature mortality by NCD attributable to the RFs were evaluated. Projections were made up to 2030. Age-standardised rates were used to draw comparisons by years and by countries. The analysis was conducted using the RStudio software.
               
                  Results
                  Between 1990 and 2019, a decrease was found in the premature mortality rates caused by NCDs in all the countries, except for Paraguay, which remained stable. When analysing premature mortality rates due to NCDs up to 2030, it was predicted that none of the countries would achieve the sustainable development goal of a one-third reduction in premature mortality by NCDs. Regarding the impacts of the RFs for NCDs, smoking, dietary risks, high blood pressure (BP) and high body mass index (BMI) were the main risks attributable to premature deaths due to NCDs.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The results showed that mortality rates are declining in Mercosur countries; however, none of the countries are predicted to achieve the sustainable development goal of a one-third reduction in mortality due to NCDs by 2030. In addition to access to adequate treatment, progress is required in public regulation actions to reduce RFs, such as smoking, dietary risks, high BP and high BMI.

Alfredo Balena n 190 Santa Efigênia Belo Horizonte MG CEP: 30130-100 Brazil       Objectives The aims of this article were to analyse the burden of NCDs and their RFs in the Mercosur countries between 1990 and 2019 and to project mortality trends for 2030.  Study design Epidemiological study of time series.  Methods The present study used data from the Global Burden of Disease study. The absolute number of deaths, mortality rates, disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, years lived with disability and the burden of premature mortality by NCD attributable to the RFs were evaluated. Projections were made up to 2030. Age-standardised rates were used to draw comparisons by years and by countries. The analysis was conducted using the RStudio software.  Results Between 1990 and 2019, a decrease was found in the premature mortality rates caused by NCDs in all the countries, except for Paraguay, which remained stable. When analysing premature mortality rates due to NCDs up to 2030, it was predicted that none of the countries would achieve the sustainable development goal of a one-third reduction in premature mortality by NCDs. Regarding the impacts of the RFs for NCDs, smoking, dietary risks, high blood pressure (BP) and high body mass index (BMI) were the main risks attributable to premature deaths due to NCDs.  Conclusions The results showed that mortality rates are declining in Mercosur countries; however, none of the countries are predicted to achieve the sustainable development goal of a one-third reduction in mortality due to NCDs by 2030. In addition to access to adequate treatment, progress is required in public regulation actions to reduce RFs, such as smoking, dietary risks, high BP and high BMI.   Keywords Chronic diseases  Risk factors  2030 agenda  Public regulations    Introduction Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the main causes of death worldwide and represent a threat to health and global development. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that approximately 40 million annual deaths are caused by NCDs,1  , 2   and of these deaths, one-third are premature (i.e. they occur in people aged <70 years). NCDs are multifactorial and have common risk factors (RFs), such as smoking, abusive consumption of alcoholic beverages, physical inactivity and inadequate nutrition.1  , 3   Therefore, acting in an integrated manner to promote and prevent these RFs may result in health benefits for the majority of NCDs.4   Investigating the disease burden attributable to RFs is essential to evaluate, support and guide public policies in the fight against these diseases, in addition to contributing to the knowledge of the dynamics of these RFs and their variations over time.5  , 6   The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides estimates that are comparable to and consistent with the disease burden and the RFs for each country using standardised methods and a large group of RFs.7–9   Using the GBD as a tool to provide estimates that are comparable between countries is useful for decision-makers. The member countries of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur; i.e. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) have different levels of socio-economic and cultural development, which may impact the populations’ health. The study of the burden of NCDs in Mercosur countries, as well as the disease burden attributable to the RFs in these countries, may generate useful data regarding the similarities and differences between the countries. The results may also provide information exchanges among the countries concerning successful actions, failures, advancements and challenges in the prevention of NCDs, thus enabling improvements in health policies. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyse the burden of NCDs and their RFs in the Mercosur countries between 1990 and 2019 and to project mortality trends for 2030.  Methods This is an epidemiological study of time series, analysing mortality data and RFs from the GBD, from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.10   Sources of data and methods are described elsewhere.8   The GBD uses numerous country data sources, including mortality information systems, vital records and epidemiological surveys on RFs, which are available online.34   Definition of NCDs The present study analysed NCD premature deaths, as defined by the WHO, among individuals aged 30–69 years for four main NCDs, namely, neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes mellitus.5    Metrics The metrics used to analyse the burden of NCDs were as follows: absolute number of deaths, mortality rates, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) and disability-adjusted life years (DALY), which refers to the sum of YLL and YLD, by NCD.11    Estimates for the burden attributable to RFs The GBD uses a hierarchical list of RFs that are analysed in four levels. Level 1 stratifies the RFs into three groups (metabolic, behavioural and environmental), and levels 2, 3 and 4 allocate the RFs from level 1 into smaller groups. Altogether, in 2019, the GBD study analysed 87 RFs.10   To calculate the burden attributable to RFs, the GBD follows the structure established for compared risk assessment, which follows five main steps: (1) to estimate the exposure level by means of the available sources; (2) to identify the pairs of RFs and their outcomes according to the available evidence; (3) to calculate the relative risks in terms of exposure; (4) to estimate the minimum level of theoretical risk of exposure (Theoretical Minimum Risk Exposure Level; and (5) to estimate the Population Attributable Factor or the proportion of NCDs that would be prevented in the population if the RF were eliminated.7  , 10  , 12    Analyses The metrics were presented for the group of countries and for each Mercosur member country (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) in 1990 and 2019. The change percentage between 1990 and 2019 was also verified. Considering target 3.4 from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and indicator 3.4.1,13   projections were made for 2030 using the linear regression method, considering that mortality rates behaved similarly to the country trends seen between 2015 and 2019. To analyse the burden of premature mortality caused by NCDs attributable to RFs, hierarchical level 2 was used. For each of the studied RFs, the burden attributable to the total of NCDs and to each disease separately was estimated. The study constructed a ranking of RFs to represent the changes that occurred between 1990 and 2019. Age-standardised rates were considered to compare the countries and the years studied. The analysis was conducted using the RStudio software (RStudio Team, 2019), and the images were produced using the Ggplot package.  Ethical considerations The GBD Brazil project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Project CAAE – 62803316.7.0000.5149.   Results Table 1   presents the number of deaths, mortality rates, DALY, YLL and YLD according to the groups of causes for the Mercosur countries in 1990 and 2019. In Argentina, the absolute number of deaths due to NCDs increased by 3.7%, whereas the rates showed a 32.4% decline between 1990 and 2019. Among the causes, CVDs had the highest percentage change (−50.0%) in mortality rates. In terms of DALY, an increase was observed for diabetes mellitus, which had the highest impact on YLD (+72.2%). In Brazil, deaths caused by NCDs in absolute numbers increased by 49.6%; however, the mortality rates showed a decline (−39.3%) during the study period. Decreases in DALY (−36.7%) and YLL (−39.8%) rates were also observed. Mortality rates for CVD, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus and neoplasms were reduced by 52.0%, 41.0%, 24.8% and 17.9%, respectively. The DALY and YLL rates also showed similar declines, whereas the YLD rates increased for diabetes mellitus (+13.2%). In Paraguay, stability was observed in premature mortality rates for NCDs over the study period. The only decreases were found in mortality rates due to CVDs (−23.4%), as well as in DALY, YLL and YLD. In terms of the other causes of NCDs, an increase was observed in the mortality rates for DALY, YLL and YLD. In Uruguay, there was a decline in the absolute number of deaths, mortality rates, DALY and YLL by most causes. Regarding YLD, decreases were only found for CVDs (−14.6%) and respiratory diseases (−4.4%; Table 1 ). In terms of the trends between 1990 and 2019, Paraguay had the worst performance of the Mercosur countries. Paraguay showed stabilised total NCD rates, CVD decline, but increased rates of diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory diseases and neoplasms, whereas the other countries showed a decline for all NCDs (Fig. 1  ). Fig. 2   shows the projections of premature mortality rates caused by NCDs by 2030. It can be seen that although the Mercosur countries present a declining trend in mortality rates, none of the countries are predicted to achieve the SDG of a one-third reduction in premature deaths caused by NCDs by 2030. Fig. 3   shows the ranking of the main RFs attributable to premature deaths due to NCDs in 1990 and 2019 in the Mercosur countries and the percentage of change during the study period. In 1990, tobacco ranked the top RF in all the countries, except Paraguay. In 1990, the rate of premature mortality caused by NCDs attributed to smoking was highest in Brazil (204.3/100,000 inhabitants), followed by Argentina and Uruguay with the same rates (192.8/100,000 inhabitants). In 2019, the smoking mortality rates declined in all countries: in Argentina was 106.4 per 100,000 inhabitants (‒44.8%), Brazil 81.7 per 100,000 inhabitants (‒60%), Paraguay 81.2 per 100,000 inhabitants (‒19.5%) and Uruguay 119.8 per 100,000 inhabitants (‒37.9%). The percentage change in premature mortality as a result of high blood pressure (BP) reduced in Argentina (‒37.5%), Brazil (‒52.1%), Uruguay (‒48.8) and Paraguay (‒25.3%). Dietary risks were the third highest RF attributable to premature NCDs deaths in 1990, and in 2019, there was a reduction in all countries: Argentina (‒48.8%), Brazil (‒51.8%), Paraguay (‒17.2%) and Uruguay (‒52%). High body mass index (BMI) was the fourth highest RF in 1990, and in 2019, although it had reduced in Brazil (‒26.7%), Argentina (‒21.8%) and Uruguay (‒23.5%), it was the top RF in Paraguay and the third in Brazil. There was a reduction in NCD mortality attributable to RFs, in most countries, over the study period (Fig. 2 ). Fig. 4   shows the premature mortality rate from NCDs attributable to RFs in 1990 and 2019 in the Mercosur countries for the four specific diseases (i.e. CVDs, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus and neoplasms). In Argentina, in 1990, smoking was the main RF and was responsible for 100.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants from CVD and 73.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants from neoplasms. In 2019, smoking continued to be ranked first place and was responsible for approximately 40.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants from CVD and 50.3 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants from neoplasms (Fig. 4 ). In Brazil, in 1990, smoking was responsible for 276.0 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and was mainly associated with deaths caused by CVD (121.4/100,000 inhabitants) and neoplasms (51.6/100,000 inhabitants). In 2019, smoking dropped to the second highest RF, registering 39.0 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants from CVD and 28.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants from neoplasms (Fig. 4 ). In Paraguay, in 1990, high BP was the main RF and represented 114.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by CVD. The second and third highest RFs were dietary risks and smoking, with 82.7 and 62.6 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. In 2019, high BP and high BMI were the top RFs for premature mortality (Fig. 4 ). In Uruguay, tobacco, dietary risks and high systolic BP were, in that order, the three main RFs attributable to premature mortality caused by CVD in 1990. |In 2019, all RFs showed a reduction, but tobacco continued to be the most frequent RF associated with premature mortality (Fig. 3 ).  Discussion The present study shows a decrease in premature mortality rates due to NCDs in three Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay) and stability in Paraguay between 1990 and 2019. Despite this decline, none of the countries are predicted to achieve the SDG of a one-third reduction in mortality by NCDs by 2030. Mortality rates from CVDs were highest and were the leading cause of deaths in Brazil and Paraguay between 1990 and 2019. In Uruguay, the highest mortality rates were for neoplasms. In Argentina, CVD occupied the first place between 1990 and 1998, and afterwards, neoplasms moved to the top position. In terms of the RFs, a group of behavioural and metabolic RFs, including smoking, dietary risks, high BP and high BMI, were the most common RFs attributable to premature deaths by NCDs. There was a significant reduction in deaths attributable to NCDs by RFs between 1990 and 2019. A reduction in premature mortality rates caused by NCDs in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay has also been demonstrated in other studies.14  , 15   This can be explained by public policies that have been implemented in these countries since the initial changes occurred due to epidemiological transition, especially in terms of prevention and control of RFs. The Mercosur countries have been implementing measures to prevent NCDs for some time. In 2008, the ad hoc  group of NCDs were created, and in 2015, the Technical Committee for NCDs (CIENT, in Spanish) was created. At this time, ministers of the countries recognised the importance of continued prevention of NCDs. Taking this into account, these countries celebrated the signing of agreements regarding sodium consumption, prevention and control of obesity, and the economic costs of smoking.16  , 17   In terms of dietary risks and high BMI, the Mercosur group sent out recommendations in 2016 for policies to protect traditional diets from each country, together with the recognition of the value of in natura  foods and less processed foods.18   In 1990, Argentina implemented the Program for the Prevention and Control of Diabetes and Hypertension, and since 2005, that programme has become part of the Cardiovascular Risk Program.15   In 2001, the Vigilance in Public Health was also implemented in Argentina through a loan from the World Bank, which aimed to standardise data collection and notification of RFs for NCDs.15   Moreover, in 2003, the National Program for Tobacco Control was established, which aimed to reduce smoking, encourage quitting and reduce the exposure to passive smoking through health education actions, involvement in local projects, vigilance and research.15   Recently, Argentina prohibited the use of trans fats in industrialised foods19   and passed a law that encourages the population to adopt a healthy diet by means of front-of-package warning labelling regarding the contents of commercialised foods.20   In Brazil, the creation of the Unified Health System (SUS) stands out, as well as health guidance through the Family Health Strategy. In addition, other important policies in Brazil were as follows: Decree no. 5.659, the Picture-Convention on Control of Tobacco (CQCT, in Portuguese) in 2006;21   Law no. 12.546, from 2011, which prohibited smoking in collective environments, increased taxes on cigarettes by 85% and established a minimum price for sales; Presidential Decree no. 8.262 from 2014, which increased warnings on cigarette packages and regulated smoke-free environments;22   the 2006 Food guide for the Brazilian Population and its revision in 2014;23   the Plan for Reducing Salt Consumption;24   the organisation of the Risk Factor Surveillance and protection against NCDs since 2006;25   as well as other health surveys, such as the National Health Survey in 201326   and the Plan for Strategic Actions to Combat NCDs in Brazil, 2011–2022.27   In 1980, Uruguay created the National Resources Fund, responsible for financing dialysis treatments, cancer treatments and selected supplies. In 1989, the Kidney Health Program was created, and in 1994, the Honorary Commission for Cardiovascular Health and the Honorary Commission to combat cancer were created. In 2005, the National Nutrition Program was established, as was the National Program for Cancer Control and the National Program for Tobacco Control.15   Moreover, Uruguay is part of the Working Group on Fiscal Policies for Health, which established a 50% increase in taxes on tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks.28   In this study, Paraguay showed a stabilisation in NCD premature mortality and had the worst performance of Mercosur countries, which can be explained by the low socio-economic development, lower investments in assistance and fewer RF reduction programmes in this country. The health system in Paraguay is fragmented, and there are challenges in the availability of diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. Stronger measures are needed to achieve the SDG targets.28   The study highlights the reduction of RFs in Mercosur countries, especially tobacco and high BP, which has resulted in a decline in mortality rates. Evidence indicates that the management of RFs for NCDs is more effective when regulatory measures are established by the State to control the commercial determinants of health through the regulation of sales practices and the availability of goods and services1  , 29  , 30   (e.g. the taxation of products that are harmful to health, food labelling and the regulation of alcohol and tobacco products).30   Evidence suggests that for the effective reduction of NCDs, investment in regulatory practices and health promotion, in addition to control and assistance, is required (WHO, 2013).5   A modelling study in Turkey highlighted that the reduction of mortality from CVDs occurred due to the reduction of cardiovascular RFs by approximately 42% and improvements in medical and surgical treatments, which explained 47% of the decline in deaths. These findings emphasise the importance of primary prevention and evidence-based medical treatments in controlling coronary heart disease.31   Regardless of the decline in mortality caused by NCDs in most of the countries in the group, none of the countries are predicted to achieve the SDG of a one-third reduction in mortality by 2030. In other words, although premature mortality due to NCDs is, to some extent, decreasing in most countries, the pace of change is too slow, indicating that there are still challenges to be overcome by these countries.32   In Argentina, there is a strong need to improve the prevention and control of NCDs by focussing on RFs.33   In Brazil, there remains a need to support the formulation and implementation of efficient and broad public policies, which are sustainable and based on primary health care, as well as the need for improvements in health networks and services.33   In Uruguay, challenges associated with the health system, as well as the demands imposed by population ageing and by changes in the epidemiological profile, still persist.33   In terms of Paraguay, there is a need to improve intersectoral actions and integrated national responses, with strong participation from the population.28   Finally, the data revealed the importance of the GBD study, as it provides data that are comparable between countries, with the purpose of guiding planning and health actions in the Mercosur countries. The present study has some limitations that need to be highlighted. The GBD study assumes that the RFs are distributed uniformly in all the countries for given ages and sex, thus requiring a degree of caution when interpreting the data. Moreover, the most distal RFs, such as social health determinants, were not evaluated in this study, and it is well-known that these may have an impact on the prevalence of intermediate RFs and even impact the estimates of attributable mortality. Although the GBD methodology adjusts for the different definitions of RFs to a standardised definition, the adjustments may not be sufficient, thus potentially generating bias. Conclusions The present study indicates that although the Mercosur countries show a trend towards a decline in mortality rates, none of the countries are predicted to achieve the SDG of a one-third reduction in deaths due to NCDs by 2030. Moreover, the present study shows that there is a group of behaviour and metabolic RFs, including smoking, dietary risks, high BP and high BMI, that are the most common RFs attributable to premature deaths caused by NCDs. These results reveal the urgency in accelerating efforts to achieve effective progress, as well as the need to create partnerships and provide exchanges between the countries.
