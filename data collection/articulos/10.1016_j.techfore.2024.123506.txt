                  Several variables influence income distributions both for developed and developing countries. Based on the submissions of extant evaluations, policymakers have implemented several policy guidelines to curtail widening income gaps. Unfortunately, the wave of income disparity, particularly in developing countries, remained untamed. Surprisingly, scholars have rarely considered the perspective of innovation patenting receipts (IPRs) in income distribution inquiries. Thus, this investigation enriches the literature by evaluating how IPRs influenced income distributions in BRICS economies characterized by widening income gaps. Based on the estimates of the panel quantile autoregressive distributed lag model (PQARDL), several interesting outcomes sufficed: First, the enlisted variables converged to long-run equilibrium. Second, the study discovered that IPRs intensified income disparities across all quantiles of income distributions. Specifically, income disparities increased by 0.08 %, 0.88 %, and 0.09 % at the lower, middle, and upper-quantile, respectively owing to increasing IPRs. This outcome validated the skill-biased technological diffusion hypothesis. Among the control variables, geopolitical risks, open trade, and population contributed significantly to income asymmetry at various quantiles. Conversely, human capital development and, to some extent, financial development minified income disparities. We have outlined several policy options to ensure the attainment of SDG10.

Several variables influence income distributions both for developed and developing countries. Based on the submissions of extant evaluations, policymakers have implemented several policy guidelines to curtail widening income gaps. Unfortunately, the wave of income disparity, particularly in developing countries, remained untamed. Surprisingly, scholars have rarely considered the perspective of innovation patenting receipts (IPRs) in income distribution inquiries. Thus, this investigation enriches the literature by evaluating how IPRs influenced income distributions in BRICS economies characterized by widening income gaps. Based on the estimates of the panel quantile autoregressive distributed lag model (PQARDL), several interesting outcomes sufficed: First, the enlisted variables converged to long-run equilibrium. Second, the study discovered that IPRs intensified income disparities across all quantiles of income distributions. Specifically, income disparities increased by 0.08 %, 0.88 %, and 0.09 % at the lower, middle, and upper-quantile, respectively owing to increasing IPRs. This outcome validated the skill-biased technological diffusion hypothesis. Among the control variables, geopolitical risks, open trade, and population contributed significantly to income asymmetry at various quantiles. Conversely, human capital development and, to some extent, financial development minified income disparities. We have outlined several policy options to ensure the attainment of SDG10.

Specifically, the UN categorized the task of narrowing income gaps as the 10th in the list of SDGs. Accordingly, SDG10  seeks to narrow both between and within-countries income gaps drastically by 2030. It aims that by 2030, the income of the marginalised 40 % of the population has improved beyond the national average. Countries could actualize this objective by raising household consumption and income per capita of the neglected 40 %. The goal also emphasized the empowerment and inclusion of all classes of society in political, economic, and social protection programmes. Nonetheless, the goal highlights that equitable income distributions and inclusive growth are realizable through the elimination of all discriminatory laws. Hence, the institutionalization of appropriate legislation and non-discriminatory practices is essential for the enthronement of an egalitarian society. Although there are notable contradictions in the UN's SDGs (Guzel et al., 2021 ), however, it represents a pathway towards non-discriminatory prosperity. Irrespective of the provisions of SDGs, with particular reference to income distributions, several countries are still grappling with income disparities. Unfortunately, most countries within this category are found among the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) nations. Among other major emerging economies, income polarization has maintained upward trends in BRICS economies.1  1 https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rising-inequality-a-major-issue-of-our-time/ .   Particularly, the Republic of South Africa (RSA) is notable as the world's most polarized economy (Heimberger, 2020; Uche et al., 2023a ). Besides, the World Inequality Report (World Inequality Report, 2022 ) underscored that income disparity in RSA maintained an extreme position throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Accordingly, in RSA, the bottom 50 % of the population earns only 5.3 %, whereas the top 10 % earns 66.5 % of the national income. Other BRICS nations are also saddled with varying degrees of income disparities. For instance, it is 10.1 %, 13.1 %, 14.4 %, and 17.0 % for the bottom 50 % in Brazil, India, China, and the Russian Federation, respectively. Conversely, it is 58 %, 57 %, 41 %, and 46 % for the top 10 % of the population in that order. Fig. 1   is a graphical illustration of income inequality trends within the BRICS nations. The figure portrays the earlier submission that RSA is the most polarized, followed by Brazil, India, the Russian Federation, and China. Undoubtedly, this trend of income disparities portends several negativities both for these countries and the entire globe. Notably, income inequality bridles unwholesome social discontent and anxieties. It is the major driving force of the observed political discrimination and populist nationalism (World Inequality Report, 2022 ). Furthermore, it can engender social distrust and impair democratic governance. It aggravates poverty, slow growth, social discontent, and social injustice. Not the least, widening income gaps undermines both social, political, and economic stabilities. Hence, it is incumbent on policymakers and other relevant stakeholders to invoke policy strategies capable of mitigating the awkward trend of income distributions. Understandably, economic literature is replete with varying analogies on drivers of income distributions. Several factors, including resource endowments, globalization, human development, technology, financial development, and entrepreneurship (Adams, 2008 ; Asamoah et al., 2021 ; Biyase, 2023 ; Uche et al., 2023a ; Wu et al., 2023 ) have been identified. Scholars have also explored the causal effects of research and development (R&D), economic policy uncertainties, and geopolitical risks (Bircan et al., 2017 ; Chan et al., 2022 ; Chu et al., 2022 ; Doğan et al., 2022 ). Nonetheless, the submissions of these empirical evaluations are fragmented and ambiguous. Hence, the menace of income disparities, particularly in these emerging economies remained widespread. This unfortunate trend reinforces the fact that some essential factors are unverified. Remarkably, a striking evidence within income inequality inquiries is the scant attention paid to the effects of innovative patenting receipts (IPRs). IPRs represent the exclusive rights in terms of income accruing to innovators. These privileged receipts in the form of patents, protection of copyrights, and trade secrets are outlined in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (ATIPRs). The World Trade Organization promulgated the agreement in 1994. The agreement provided sets of minimum global standards for the administration of the rights of inventors and innovators (Adams, 2008 ). Unarguably, a plausible understanding of how these rights shape income distributions is of essence for policy moderation. Unfortunately, while few studies explored the theoretical dimensions (Chu, 2011 ; Chu, 2022 ; Chu et al., 2023 ; Churchill et al., 2022 ; Ghosh et al., 2022 ; Hu et al., 2023 ), few others explored the empirical perspectives of some developed countries (Hailemariam et al., 2021 ; Kanwal and Eyisi, 2023 ). Overall, there is a lack of empirical evidence in the context of emerging economies. We suggest that IPRs should be a significant policy focus for income distributions and harmonization mostly for emerging economies. This position hinges on the background that innovative patenting rights (IPRTs) have moved beyond the corridors of legal analysis to the frontiers of economic policy moderation (Maskus, 2000 ; Adams, 2008 ). Maskus (2000)  argued that effective IPRTs either limit or promote economic development. It can also encourage the development of new businesses, knowledge diffusions, rationalization of inefficient industries, and advancement of technologies (Churchill et al., 2022 ). On the flip side, IPRTs may also harm or limit developmental prospects by encouraging monopolistic tendencies (Chu, 2022 ). It is also notable that the strengths of IPR influence market structures and consumer welfare (Adams, 2008 ). Thus, each country needs to understand and harmonize this nexus to effectively reap the full benefits and mitigate the harmful aspects of IPRTs. Interestingly, among the global economies, China and India have remained top of the list of countries contributing to the growth of innovation patenting (World Intellectual Property Report, 2022 ). According to the Global Innovative Index, China emerged as the 1st among the upper-middle-income countries. India is ranked 1st among the lower-middle-income groups. Likewise, the Russian Federation is ranked 7th among the 36 upper-middle-income countries. Brazil is ranked 9th, while South Africa is ranked 14th in the group of 36 upper-middle-income economies (World Intellectual Property Report, 2022 ). Figs. 2 and 3    depict a graphical overview of the trend of intellectual property receipts for both the BRICS and selected G7 nations. The evidence portrayed in the graphs are eloquent testimonies that BRICS nations are closing the gaps between them and G7 nations in terms of IPRs. Therefore, it behooves on policymakers in BRICS to harmonize these rights/receipts for equitable prosperities. This will be another step towards the realization of the United Nations SDG10 . On the above background, the current study enriches income distribution inquiries by unravelling the relationship prevailing between IPR and income distributions in BRICS. Sequel to the above, the following research question subsists: does innovation-patenting receipts influence income distributions in BRICS economies? To provide a valuable response to the research question, we hypothesized that IPR is a positive and significant predictor of income disparities in BRICS. Likewise, this study also extends the trajectory of empirical knowledge by verifying the influence of geopolitical risk factors (GPR) on income distributions. Remarkably, the influence of GPR on income distributions is currently underreported for both the BRICS and other nations. Besides, the study enclosed other notable determinants of income distributions like human capital, financial development, trade openness, and population. Essentially, these steps are predicated on the need to provide an all-inclusive empirical evaluation devoid of omitted variable bias. Moreover, such steps are lacking in extant studies. The study also implemented several recently proposed panel-data estimators. This includes the novel panel quantile autoregressive distributed lags (PQARDL) of Chishti and Patel (2023)  and the novel panel non-parametric quantile Granger causality (PNQGC) test were implemented. Notably, these techniques are time-variant panel procedures that avail consistent estimates across the distributions of the predicted variable. Previous studies failed to take advantage of these novel panel time-variant models. Thus, these steps are essential to enhance our understanding of the relationship between IPR and income distribution, as well as the enlisted control variables. Hence, the outcomes of this investigation are expected to shape and redirect policy moderation about IPR administrations. Thus, the option to either reserve or promote the exclusive rights of innovators will be made clearer for both BRICS and other global economies. Other components of the investigations are thus structured: Section 2  provides the theoretical and empirical literature; Section 3  exposes the applicable methodologies; Section 4  avails the data analysis and discussion, while the study is summarized in Section 5 .  2 Literature review 2.1 Theoretical literature From the classical era, economists have explored the causal relationship between innovations and economic progress (Rosen, 1994 ; Kurokawa, 2014 ; Aghion et al., 2019 ). During the modern era, the influence of innovations on economic performance is intertwined with technological diffusions and catch-up processes. Thus, there are both product innovations and process innovations (Asamoah et al., 2021 ). In this regard, Wong et al. (2005)  explained that while product innovations are mainly observed in middle- and low-income economies, process innovations are comparatively widespread. Innovations may not affect income distributions directly, however, they penetrate through the restrictive effects of property rights (innovation patenting). Notably, such exclusive rights may compound income asymmetry since wealth is concentrated in the hands of few individuals (Antonelli and Gehringer, 2017 ). Furthermore, extant literature conceived that IPRs also could trigger income asymmetry directly through wage distributions (Saini, 2020 ). Likewise, the skill-biased technological diffusion hypothesis (Autor et al., 1997 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ) predicts a positive relationship between technology and income inequality. These arguments are embedded in the skilled-unskilled labour wage differentials (Lemieux, 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). When highly skilled workers are rewarded relative to their unskilled counterparts, expectedly, skewed distributions ensue (Kiedaisch, 2017 ). Despite the above notions, some divergent analogies explain that strengthening IPRs engenders equitable distributions (see Zhang et al., 2018 ). A critical theoretical orientation in this perspective is the Schumpeterian hypothesis (Zhang et al., 2018 ) that foreclosed income inequality reducing the effects of technological advances (Antonelli and Gehringer, 2017 ). Remarkably, the fragmented submissions demand more clarification to shape the policy trajectories. Expectedly, a precise understanding of these dynamics projects a win-win situation for the selected economies. On this note, we have exposed, thematically, the views of extant studies about the relationship. On the existing relationship between IPR and income distributions, Adams (2008)  affirmed a positive interaction. The study is based on a study of 61 developing countries over the 1985–2001 periods, and estimates of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The study revealed that strengthening IPRs impacted positively on income inequality. Similar evidence is provided in Chu (2010)  in the instance of the US economy. Within a two-country R&D-based heterogeneity growth model, Chu (2011)  reaffirmed that strengthening IPR is pro-inequality in both developed and developing countries. Lee (2011)  applied a survey analytical panel framework in the study of European community households during the 1996–2001 period. On the evidence of its empirical estimates, the study reaffirmed a positive relationship between IPRs and income disparity in the selected countries. Similar to the above studies, Seo et al. (2015)  exerted that innovation patenting contributed positively to widening income gaps among countries. Contrary to the opinions of these earlier studies, Antonelli and Gehringer (2017)  validated the Schumpeterian hypothesis. Accordingly, the study reported that IPRs reduced income disparities in the case of OECD countries during the 1985–2005 period. Lahsen and Piper (2019)  extended a supporting narrative in the case of Latin American countries. Based on Latin American data that spans the 1986–2015 periods, the study emphasized the income disparity minimizing effects of innovation patenting in Latin America. The submissions of Saito (2017) , and Reddix-Smalls (n.d.)  contradicted the pro-equity effects argument. Rather, they argued that IPRs constituted a major drag on income equalization particularly in Japan, France, and the US, respectively. The submissions of Chu and Cozzi (2018)  are also affirmative of the pro-inequality effects of innovation patenting. Besides these conflicting submissions, some extant studies availed fragmented analogies on the nexus. For instance, Saini (2020)  stated that the effects of IPRs on income distributions are a function of the development stage of the economy. Accordingly, strengthening the depth of IPR is pro-inequality in countries with higher levels of development, and vice-versa. For Zhang et al. (2018) , a strong innovation-patenting regime exacerbated income inequality mostly when its effects are driven by revenue as against output base. Likewise, Aghion et al. (2019)  exposed that innovation patenting impacted more positively on different measures of inequality. However, the study emphasized that the reverse is observed when a broad measure of inequality is articulated. In the cases of 64 middle-and-low-income and 25 high-income countries during the 2000–2016 periods, Asamoah et al. (2021)  affirmed a positive correlation between IPRs and income disparities. Likewise, on the estimates of ARDL and time-series data spanning 1987–2018 periods, Cetin et al. (2021)  exposed the income inequality exacerbating effects of IPRs in Turkey. For Chu et al. (2021) , IPRs and income distributions shared an inverted U-shaped relationship in the case of the US economy. Kiedaisch (2017) , Yang (2021)  and Chan et al. (2022)  further extend the inverted U-shaped analogy. These fragmented positions require urgent harmonization for plausible policy guidelines. In addition, recent studies also extended the ambiguities surrounding IPRs and income distribution nexuses. For instance, Biyase (2023)  considered IPRs pro-inequality in the case of BRICS economies based on estimates of selected time-invariant OLS models and annual data between 1990 and 2017. Although this study considered the perspective of BRICS, however, its major limitation lies specifically in its inability to galvanize updated data and application of robust econometric tools. As such, its inferences could be misleading. Hence, the urgent need for more insights extended beyond the post-COVID-19 era. Furthermore, within a variety-expansion model calibrated for the US economy, Chu et al. (2023)  inferred that IPRs could be pro-inequality and at the same time pro-equity. The study emphasized that the eventual effects are contingent on interest-rate channel and R&D–capital productivity ratio. Kanwal and Eyisi (2023)  emphasized a direct relationship between IPRs and income inequality in the cases of 31 frontier markets during the 2003–2018 periods. Likewise, Wu et al. (2023)  provided an inconclusive analogy about the IPRs – income distribution relationship from the perspective of 60 countries categorized on their stages of development. Based on the estimates of FMOLS and annual panel series during the 1996–2018 periods, the study emphasized that IPRs - income distribution relationships are heterogeneous and contingent upon the stage of development of each country.  2.2 Literature gaps Unarguably, the inferences of extant studies are both inconclusive, contradictory, and ambiguous. They failed to articulate streamlined policy options that could ensure consistent curtailment of income disparities and the attainment of SDG10 for both the BRICS nations and other countries. Their fragmented submissions, scant attention to the perspectives of emerging countries, belated data span, as well as reliance on less robust econometrics estimators compelled the current study. Thus, with a focus on frontline emerging economies, updated data stream, applications of more robust estimators, and inclusions of key control variables, the lacuna in literature is adequately covered in this study.   3 Materials and methods 3.1 Materials This study paid particular attention to BRICS economies consisting of five emerging countries. These are Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa. To provide valid empirical narratives, the study harnesses relevant data for each economy. Accordingly, we selected annual datasets spanning the 1997–2021 period for empirical analysis. We could not extend the data frame beyond this range due to the limitations imposed by data availability. Relevant macroeconomic variables including income inequality, intellectual property receipts, geopolitical risk factors, human capital development, financial development, trade openness, and population were galvanized for empirical estimates. Meanwhile, Table 1   portrays elaborate information on the enclosed datasets. Apparently, the composition of the panel series conformed to a macro-panel framework. The panel structure embodies a larger time (T ) dimension and a shorter cross-sectional (N ) dimension (T  >  N ). Based on this, we adopted all relevant estimation techniques peculiar to macro-panel structure for robust analysis.  3.2 Theoretical foundation and model Building upon the established hypothesis, this study follows Iwaisako (2013)  and Hu et al. (2023)  by augmenting the Romer (1989)  variety-expansion framework. Particularly, in this study, one aspect of the growth process (innovation patenting receipt) is considered among other independent predictors of income distribution. Following this modification, the present study enclosed IPRs as a major predictor of income distributions in the case of BRICS countries. Likewise, based on insights from extant literature, the study considered a list of control variables in the model. The control variables include geopolitical risk factors (Bircan et al., 2017 ), human capital (Effiom and Uche, 2022 ; Hu et al., 2023 ), financial development (Cetin et al., 2021 ; Biyase, 2023 ), trade openness (Sein and Prokop, 2022 ) and population (Aghion et al., 2019 ; Uche et al., 2023a ). Following the above, the following empirical specification subsists:(1) INQ it  = f IPR it  GPR it  HC it  FD it  TP it  POP it       In Eq. (1) , Inq  , Ipr  ,Gpr  , Hc  , Fd  , Tp  , Pop   depict income inequality, intellectual property receipts, geopolitical risk factors, human capital, financial development, trade openness, and population, respectively. The time and cross-sectional dimensions are captured by i   and t  , respectively. To provide more explicit empirical specification, we therefore transform Eq. (1)  into Eq. (2)  with the inclusions of econometrics notations.(2) INQ it  = θ o  + θ 1  IPR it  + θ 2  GPR it  + θ 3  HC it  + θ 4  FD it  + θ 5  TP it  + θ 6  POP it  + ε it      In Eq. (2) , θ o    captures the intercept which measures persistency effects, while θ 1    - depicts all the coefficients of the relevant control variables. From the above estimation notations, and based on both theoretical and empirical literature, both IPR ,  GPR ,  TP   and POP   are positive predictors of income inequality. Conversely, HC   and FD   are potential negative predictors of income inequality. The hypothetical elasticities of the estimated relationship are captured below: θ 1  = Δ INQ it   Δ IPR it    > 0  ; θ 2  = Δ INQ it   Δ GPR it    > 0  ; θ 3  = Δ INQ it   Δ HC it    < 0  ; θ 4  = Δ INQ it   Δ FD it    < 0  ; θ 5  = Δ INQ it   Δ TP it    > 0  ; θ 6  = Δ INQ it   Δ POP it    > 0  .  3.3 Econometric tools The current study parleyed a plethora of panel econometric procedures to provide elaborate empirical explanations for the research questions. Accordingly, all the relevant techniques are explained hereafter. 3.3.1 Cross-sectional dependency and slope heterogeneity tests Due to financial development and trade openness, cross-section dependence (CSD) emerges in panel data sets. Furthermore, the spillover effects of trade openness and financial development are caused by several unattended global factors. To address this problem, the study employed Pesaran's (2004)  CSD test for optimal discoveries, as seen in the equation below:(3) CSD = 2 T  i i − 1      ∑ i = 1  i − 1   ∑ j = i + 1  i  ρ ̂  ij    → N 0 1      Another test that is relevant in panel data is the slope homogeneity test. Because standard tests, such as SURE (seemingly unrelated regression equation), cannot handle heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependency, the Pesaran and Yamagata's test is used to eliminate bias in results. The equation for the test is as follows:(4) ∆ ̂  SCH  = N  1 2   2 K   − 1 2    1 N  S − K      (5) ∆ ̂  ASCH  = N  1 2   2 K T − K − 1    T + 1    − 1 2    1 N  S − K      where ∆ ̂  SCH  = delta tilde and  ∆ ̂  ASCH  = the adjusted delta tilde  . Although the Pesaran and Yamagata (2008)  slope homogeneity test is essential, we could not use it in this study due to our small sample size.  3.3.2 Panel unit-root tests Although first-generation unit root checks can be used to confirm the combination sequence, they produce wasteful results due to cross-section dependency among the panel data series. As a result, the article depends on the CIPS test, which provides valid results even in the face of cross-sectional dependency. The CIPS test equation is as follows:(6) ∆ V i . t   = π i . t   + π i  W it − 1   + π i  V t − 1   ¯  + ∑ J = 0  p  π i , J   ∆ V t − 1    ¯  + ∑ J = 0  p  π i . J   W it − 1   + μ it     where V t − 1   ¯  = average of the cross sections .   Thus, the following equation can be used to calculate CIPS:(7) CIPS ̂  = 1 / 2 ∑ i = 1  n  CADF    where CADF = cross − sectionally augmented dickey − fuller .    3.3.3 Panel cointegration test The study then used the second-generation Westerlund (2007)  cointegration technique to examine the long-run relationship between the selected series. This cointegration test is significant for its ability to estimate a stable outcome in the presence of CSD and variation. The Westerlund test equation is as follows:(8) ∆ Y it  = γ i  d t  + b i  Y it − 1   + φ i `  X it − 1   + ∑ j = 1  pi  b ij  ∆ Y i . t − j   + ∑ j = qi  pi  Y ij  ∆ X i . t − j   + ε t       Furthermore, when the null hypothesis is accepted, it implies a case of no cointegration and verifies a case of cointegration if the alternative hypothesis is accepted.  3.3.4 Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lags (PQARDL) model The Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PQARDL) technique was applied in the study due to its suitability for analyzing panel data and meeting the research objectives. The PQARDL technique was developed to analyse panel data while incorporating possible heterogeneity and time dynamics (Cho et al., 2015 ). The study investigates the short- and long-term effects of financial development, population, trade openness, and innovation on inequality at various quantiles (percentiles) of the distribution. The PQARDL technique allows for quantile estimation, which aids in capturing any heterogeneity in the effects of the independent variables across the distribution. This allows for a deeper grasp of how these variables affect inequality across different quantiles (Chishti and Patel, 2023 ). Furthermore, the PQARDL technique includes autoregressive dynamics and lagged variables, which are important for capturing time dynamics in data and investigating long-term correlations between variables of interest Zaman et al. (2023) . In summary, the PQARDL technique was chosen for its ability to analyse panel data while accounting for heterogeneity and time dynamics, allowing quantile estimation, aligning with the study's objectives, and facilitating an in-depth evaluation of the link between financial development, population, trade openness, innovation, and inequality. We provide the QARDL model in the proposed structure (Cho et al., 2015 ; Zaman et al., 2023 ; Appiah et al., 2023 ).(9) QInQ it  = ∝ i  Ψ  + ∑ i = 1  p 1   b it  Ψ  ∆ InQ it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 2   c it  Ψ  ∆ IPR it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 3   d it  Ψ  ∆ GPR it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 4   e it  Ψ  ∆ HC it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 5   f it  Ψ  ∆ FD it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 6   g it  Ψ  ∆ TP it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 7   h it  Ψ  ∆ POP it − 1   + ε it       The residuals are independent, and consistently distributed, with zero mean and a constant variance. The elements c d e f g h    represent the coefficients to be calculated. The ECM is incorporated into the previously described model. The parameter μit specifies is the speed of transition to the equilibrium level. InQ is the dependent variable in the ECM model, and it is expressed as follows:(10) QInQ it  = ∝ i  Ψ  + ∑ i = 1  p 1   b it  Ψ  ∆ InQ it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 2   c it  Ψ  ∆ IPR it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 3   d it  Ψ  ∆ GPR it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 4   e it  Ψ  ∆ HC it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 5   f it  Ψ  ∆ FD it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 6   g it  Ψ  ∆ TP it − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p 7   h it  Ψ  ∆ POP it − 1   + μ i  ECT it − 1   + ε it       The following quantiles were used in the empirical studies: (Ψ  ) = (0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90). Compared to other techniques, the Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lags (PQARDL) model has several advantages. Its unique attributes are better appreciated when working with panel data and dynamic interactions across time. Thus, the main advantages of the PQARDL model are: PQARDL models dynamic relationships across time in panel data using autoregressive distributed lags process. While quantile regression sheds light on how the connection between variables varies across different quantiles of the dependent variable, traditional regression models concentrate on predicting conditional means. This attributed is especially helpful when handling asymmetric distributions or heterogeneous impacts. By including lagged dependent and independent variables, PQARDL can handle the challenges of endogeneity (Chishti and Patel, 2023 ). The PQARDL model can assist in reducing endogeneity issues by including lagged values. This quality ensures that accurate estimations of the causal linkages between variables are produced. This is particularly crucial for panel data analysis since endogeneity is frequently encountered. Additionally, PQARDL is an excellent tool for managing variability in panel data among individual units (Chishti and Patel, 2023 ). The model's greater relevance in critical unit-specific effects stems from its capacity to capture individual heterogeneity and dynamic interactions. Notably, results that emanate from OLS estimates are significantly influenced by outliers. Hence, due to its emphasis on conditional quantiles, PQARDL is more resilient to outliers and accurately depicts the underlying relationships. Although the PQARDL model has these benefits, the peculiarities of the data and the research issue determine which estimating technique is best. Understandably, the PQARDL technique may not apply to all data series and some unique objectives. Thus, in choosing any estimation approach, researchers should carefully assess the objectives of their investigation and the nature of their data.  3.3.5 Panel non-parametric quantile Granger causality test Based on insights from prior studies (see, for example, Canay, 2011 ; Jeong et al., 2012 ; and Dong et al., 2021 ), we followed the non-parametric Granger causality (NPPGC) model to evaluate the likelihood of non-linear causality among panel series. Following Dong et al. (2021) , the novel NPPGC used in this study can be described as follows:(11) γ it  = α i  + ∑ k = 1  q  γ k  δ  γ i , t − k   + ∑ k = 1  q  β k  δ  X i , t − k   + ε i , t       Eq. (11)  can be rewritten by eliminating the fixed effects to consider unobserved heterogeneity (see Dong et al., 2021 : 7). Based on Dong et al. (2021) , by taking into account the case of heterogeneity and fixed effects, Eq. (11)  is transformed to be(12) Y i , t   ̂  = Y i , t   − α i  ̂       By considering this, Q δ  Y it  I it    , Dong et al. (2021)  suggested introducing a non-parametric kernel approach based on Jeong et al. (2012), which accounts for non-linear tendency. This approach is described as follows:(13) Q δ  ̂  Y it  ∣ I it  ̂   ̂   − 1    δ ⃒ I i , t          Thus, Eq. (13)  provides a non-parametric panel granger causality that accounts for outliners, solves misspecification errors, and observes possible asymmetries and heterogeneity issues.    4 Data analysis and discussion The empirical estimates of this study were preceded by notable pre-estimation evaluations. Among such pre-evaluation procedures are summary statistics, and the cross-sectional dependence test. It also includes the second-generation panel unit root test. The outcome of these preceding tests is summarized in Tables 2–4    , accordingly. Accordingly, the descriptive statistics are summarized in Table 2  for clearer insights. Among the enlisted variables, the average income inequality gap in BRICS is 44.662. Likewise, on average, the level of trade openness is 43.234, average population growth 19.50. Other variables, including intellectual property receipts, geopolitical risk factors, human capital, and financial development have expected values of 19.29, 4.58, 2.47, and 4.167, respectively. There is evidence of strong convergence among the series hence their mean values lie in between their maximum and minimum values. Among all the variables, trade openness is more dispersed (12.559) followed by income inequality (10.85). Meanwhile, GPR is the least dispersed (0.197). Regarding skewness, it is noted that while some series have positive tails (INQ, IPR, GPR, HC,  and POP ), others (FD  and TP ) have negative tails. Likewise, the evidence portrays that, unlike other variables, GPR deviated from normal distribution. By implication, the presence of abnormal distributions and divergent tails suggests the presence of nonlinearity among the enclosed variables. Thus, the application of time-insensitive techniques will avail misleading estimates. Unfortunately, most existing studies failed on this part. To circumvent the potential spurious analogies, the present study harnessed recent nonlinear panel estimators that are time-sensitive and rigorous to notable economic shocks. The study also verified the possible cross-sectional error dependency among the enlisted variables. The outcome of this pre-estimation test is summarized in Table 3 . Accordingly, Table 3  portrays the outcome of the CD test. Going by the evidence, there is strong evidence to conclude that there is the presence of cross-sectional error spillover among the panel variables. Hence, the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis. This attribute also requires the application of panel estimators that produce consistent estimates amidst these defects. Based on the attributes of the applicable variables, a notable process to forestall potential spurious results is the application of panel unit-root procedures that account for cross-section dependence. To this end, the study harnessed the second-generation panel unit-root toolkit (Table 4 ). A further step was taken to verify whether the enlisted panel series share a common long-run trend. To verify this effect, the study employed the Westerlund (2007)  panel cointegration toolkit since it produces consistent outcomes regardless of cross-sectional dependence, and nonlinearity (Obiakor et al., 2022 ; Opuala et al., 2023 ; Uche et al., 2022 ; Uche et al., 2023b ). Following the above position, the outcomes of the panel long-term estimates are summarized in Table 5  . Going by the outcome of the cointegration evaluation, the null hypothesis of no long-term convergence is rejected. Thus, it is evident that the enlisted panel variables converged to long-term equilibrium. Given this outcome, the study has the impetus to verify both short and long-run specific effects of each enlisted explanatory variables on income inequality. Besides, the study also verified these effects over the distributions of the response variable (income inequality). The outcomes of both the short and long-run effects are summarized in Table 6  . As earlier highlighted, very recent and robust panel estimators were deployed in analyzing how intellectual property receipts and the selected control variables influenced income distributions in BRICS. The subsisting relationship between IPR and its predictors is summarized in Table 6 . Notably, the PQARDL procedure unveils the reactions of the response variable within the short and long terms and over a range of distributions. Accordingly, the reactions of the response variable to changes in the explanatory variables are distilled at both the lower (0.25), middle (0.50), and upper (0.75) quantiles of the distributions. From the empirical estimates, it is ascertained that IPRs exacerbate unequal distributions of income in BRICS. Moreover, the unpleasant effects of IPR on income distributions became more intense moving from the lower to the upmost quantile of the distributions of inequality. Specifically, IPRs heightened income inequality by about 0.08 % at the lower quantile, 0.88 % at the middle quantile, and 0.093 % at the upper quantile of the distributions. This implies that the degree of income polarization in the BRICS economies intensifies as innovative patenting increases. The short-run outcome is also consistent with the long-run effects. The outcome invalidates the income inequality-reducing effects of innovations predictions of the Schumpeterian hypothesis. On the flip side, the outcome is consistent with the skill-biased technological diffusion hypothesis. Some extant studies (Aghion et al., 2019 ; Asamoah et al., 2021 ; Kanwal and Eyisi, 2023 ) reported similar outcomes particularly in the US, 31 emerging markets and 32 frontier emerging markets. The discovery is also consistent with the submissions of Hu et al. (2023)  who argued that stronger patent protection promotes income asymmetry in the US. Unarguably, the rate of income polarization in BRICS economies has reached an unimaginable state. Likewise, the rate of innovative patenting is also on the increase. This implies that policymakers in these nations have not fathomed or even factored in the potential income asymmetric effects of IPRs within their policy guidelines. Thus, there is an urgent need for policy adjustment in this direction. Policymakers must ensure that the magnified wage differentials between the highly-skilled and unskilled labourers are curtailed. A situation whereby only 10 % of the population appropriates as much as 60 % of the national income is condemnable. Policymakers have the responsibility to scrutinize the prevailing innovative patenting rights. If the prevailing arrangement portrays some monopolistic tendencies, it is incumbent on policymakers to alter such an unpleasant structure to pave the way for inclusive prosperity. The imposition of higher tax rates is inevitable to curtail the widening income gaps. Among the control variables, the study discovered that geopolitical risk factor (GPR) is another variable leading to the observed widening income gaps in BRICS. The long-run empirical estimates revealed that income inequality widened significantly by approximately 4 % and 6 % at the middle and upper quantiles of the distributions given a 1 % increase in GPR. The short-run results are relatively inconsistent. This outcome connotes that GPR has a strong influence on the widening income gaps in BRICS. Instances like the current Russia – Ukraine war and similar events are culprits in this dimension. Thus, it is incumbent on policymakers to curtail the subsisting geopolitical risks. At most, it is expected of them to curtail its influence to its barest minimum. Notably, some previous studies (Bircan et al., 2017 ) also lend their voices to the negative effects of GPR on income distributions. Interestingly, the investigation ascertained that both human capital and financial development are negative predictors of income inequality in BRICS. Specifically, human capital helped in reducing inequality by approximately 7 %, 9 %, and 11 % at the lower, middle, and upper quantiles of the distributions. Similar analogies subsist in extant literature (Hailemariam et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, financial development improved income distribution by approximately 11 % at the middle-quantile. However, the effects of financial development became unwelcoming at the upper quantile where it exacerbated income disparity by approximately 6 %. Their short-run effects are mostly inconsistent. To this end, BRICS nations can effectively curtail the menace of income disparities through human capital development. If the capacities of greater numbers of the population are improved, their innovation as well as earning capacities will improve. Through this, the widening income gaps would be reduced drastically. Thus, it behooves policymakers to craft more robust and sustainable national human capital development plan. Placing more emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Such education policy has the potential to improve the innovative capacities of people. It is also critical to review the financial development strategies in these countries. The unfavourable effects recorded in the upper quantile suggest instances of inconsistencies. As such, policies that could ensure the sustainability of such favourable effects recorded in the middle quantile are essential. Promoting a financial system that is more sensitive to the peculiarities of the people it is targeted upon suffices here. Instances, where the financial system operators impose arbitrary interest rates on poor households, should be disposed of. On the effects of trade openness and population, the study uncovered that these two variables are contributing significantly to the widening income gaps in BRICS. Specifically, trade openness exacerbated income inequality by 0.014 %, 0.037 %, and 0.048 % at the lower, medium, and upper quantiles of the distributions, respectively. On the other hand, population growth heightened the menace of income polarization significantly by 0.036 %, 0.079 %, and 0.0126 % at the lower, middle, and upper quantiles of income distributions, respectively. Meanwhile, the unpleasant effects of trade openness became insignificant at the upper quantile of income distributions. Similar to other variables, the short-run effects of both trade openness and population on income distributions were largely inconsistent. Given these outcomes, it is obvious that the trade relationship between these countries and their trading partners is largely pro-inequality. This implies that the BRICS are trapped in a trade relationship that is insensitive to the welfare of their citizens. Hence, necessary adjustments are expedient to ensure and promote more people-oriented trade policies. The BRICS should rather look inwardly and fine-tune trade strategies among them. In this case, intelligent or smart openness is essential to curtail income polarization in these countries. Notwithstanding the numerous population control measures in most BRICS countries, particularly in China, its negative effects on income distributions seem uncontrollable. Its significant unfavourable effects increase along the distributions of inequality. Specifically, population exacerbated income inequality by approximately 0.04 %, 0.08 %, and 0.13 % at the lower, middle, and upper quantiles of income distributions, respectively. This outcome entails that the population control measures are not effective in addressing the menace of inequitable income distributions within the BRICS. Several studies, including Aghion et al. (2019)  and Uche et al. (2023a)  have highlighted the negative effects of population growth on income distributions. Unarguably, the BRICS population, particularly in China and India represents almost half of the global population. Thus, in addition to the subsisting population control measures, these countries are encouraged to harness the full potential of their populations. When the human capacities of these populations are fully developed through education, the BRICS nation will ultimately reap their full potential. Through this process, the present skewed income distribution patterns will give room for more inclusive prosperity. For robustness check, the study employed the novel panel non-parametric quantile Granger causality test to assess the causal effects between income inequality and its enlisted predictors. The non-parametric quantile Granger causality plots are displayed in (Fig. 4  ). The plots portray the causal interactions of the selected explanatory variables over the distributions of income inequality in BRICS. Accordingly, the nonlinear causality Granger causality plots denote that IPRs significantly drive income inequality, particularly at the upper quantiles (0.75 and 0.90) of the distributions. The plots also revealed that GPR caused income inequality significantly at the lower (0.25), middle (0.5), and lower-upper (0.75) quantiles of income distributions. Human capital caused inequality significantly only at the upper quantiles (0.75 and 0.95), whereas financial development caused income inequality only at the middle quantile (0.5) and lower-upper (0.75) quantile of the distribution. Further evidence revealed that trade openness Granger caused income disparity significantly at the lower (0.25) and middle (0.5) quantiles. Additionally, population Granger caused income disparity significantly across all the quantiles, except at the middle (0.5) quantile. Overall, the robustness of the empirical estimates is further reinforced by the outcome of all the relevant post-estimation statistics. To this end, it is imperative to highlight that the estimates are homoscedastic (LM test), stable (CUSUM and CUSUM2  graphs) and the cross-sectional errors are normalized (Jarque-Bera test). More evidence revealed that the selected series are, on average (R2  = 54 %) strong predictors of income distributions in the selected countries (BRICS). Likewise, the speed of adjustments increases along the quantiles. It is −0.40 %, −0.46 %, and − 0.54 % at the lower (0.25), middle (0.5), and upper (0.75) quantiles of the distributions of income inequality. Likewise, they reflect the expected sign (negative) and significance.  5 Summary and policy insights Policy guidelines that affect income distributive propensities of IPRs, particularly for the BRICS economies are currently underreported. Paradoxically, these countries are up on the global scale of both income inequality and innovation patenting. Thus, it is essential to critique the possible spillover effects between these two macroeconomic variables. To this end, this study filled a notable void in the literature by questioning the relevance of IPRs on income distributions in these emerging economies. To provide valid empirical answers, the study harnessed annual panel series across the BRICS countries spanning the 1997–2021 period. Notable steps were taken within this purvey. This includes the adoption of a novel panel quantile ARDL (PQARDL) estimator and the novel panel nonparametric quantile Granger causality test procedure for empirical evaluation. These estimators are remarkable since they capture the influence of time and shocks on economic parameters. Likewise, the empirical evaluations were preceded by the second-generation unit-root test toolkit. Besides, the study enlisted other notable variables including geopolitical risk factors, human development, financial development, trade openness, and population as control variables. Given the steps taken, the problems of endogeneity as well as omitted variable bias were circumvented. Following the empirical estimates, the study uncovered that IPRs (innovative patenting) constitute a major clog on the path to equitable prosperities in BRICS countries. Particularly, its effects increase across the quantiles of income inequality distributions. The outcome eloquently validates the skill-biased technological diffusion hypothesis. As such, harmonizing the existing innovative patenting structure is urgently needed to tame the rising income gaps in these countries. Policy guidelines that will make the structure of innovative patenting less-monopolistic and welfare-oriented are critical. Policymakers could introduce a more stringent tax regime on such exclusive rights. This has the potential to moderate the widening income disparities in these countries. It was also unraveled that geopolitical risks, trade openness, as well as population growth are strong positive enablers of income disparities in BRICS economies. As such, it behooves policymakers to curtail the incursion of both national, regional, as well as global geopolitical risks on the economic system. When such efforts are adequately projected, the trend of income inequality in BRICS will be curtailed. In this instance, policymakers are encouraged to enthrone intelligent openness in their trade relationship with their trading partners. Additionally, the wave of income inequality could be mitigated when these countries look more inwardly. Strengthening trade within the block could minimize the negative effects of open trade on income distributions in the region. Beyond the subsisting population growth control measures, the BRICS countries should build more human capacities. Investing in more human capital development projects promises more equitable income distributions and inclusive prosperity. When more capacities are developed, their innovative capacities improve ultimately. Such a programme can set these countries on the path of SDG10. It is also imperative to ensure that the subsisting financial system is adjusted. Moreover, its administration and implementation should be constantly monitored. The income equalization potentials of the financial development can be harnessed when the subsisting structure is made more sensitive to public welfare and less stringent. A situation where the financial system is pro-inequality will frustrate the attainment of the SDG10.  6 Limitations of the study and future research options The study explored the dimensions of intellectual property receipts and selected control variables on income distributions in BRICS economies. The extent of its investigations, choice of data range, and estimation techniques were premised on its specific objectives. As such, the inferences hereon may not apply comprehensively to all emerging and developing countries. Forthwith, it is imperative to understudy the perspectives of other emerging and developing countries. The inclusion of more predictors not listed herein is essential for more insights. Such predictors may include economic growth, technological advancements, labour market conditions, and social safety nets. Besides, it is imperative to extend the data beyond the span of this study for more policy insights. Not the least, country-specific studies are also encouraged. The enlistment of other time-variant estimators could provide more empirical insights. In all, policies that ensure more inclusive prosperity and attainment of SDG10 are encouraged.
