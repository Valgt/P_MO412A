                  The United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda for sustainable development seeks to eliminate poverty in all its forms. An estimated 1.3 billion people in the BRICS countries are below the poverty line. This study examines the nexus between digital financial inclusions (DFI) and income inequality GINI) in the context of BRICS countries, with a focus on the moderate impacts of technological innovation (TI) and infrastructure development (ID). Applying the Driscoll-Kraay (DK) and fixed effects tests, the results show that DFI significantly negatively influences income inequality, with TI and ID contributing to strengthening this effect. The findings indicate that implementing TI and ID can potentially decrease income inequality in BRICS nations by facilitating faster, more secure, cost-effective transactions and offering greater access to markets and essential services. This study emphasises the need for policymakers to prioritise the implementation of TI and ID to accomplish sustainable development goals and encourage financial inclusion for all in the BRICS countries.

They are disproportionately bigger for people living in Eastern countries, households having the lowest debt-to-income ratios, and those who attend school full-time. [19 ] Negative  Digital Finance and ICT Inequality ICT in the banking industry in digital finance helps reduce poverty in rural and urban areas. ICT does not directly impact income disparity. [6 ] Negative  Digital Finance and Technology Inequality Digital technologies' potential to reduce inequality hinges on accessibility and availability, especially for women who may already experience barriers to financial inclusion. Digital finance has a traditional positive effect on inequality. [20 ] Positive  Financial Inclusions Inequality Population, income, and income inequality all positively correlate with financial inclusion. However, unemployment inhibits it. This research suggested researchers research digital finance. [21 ] Positive  Digital Financial Inclusions Inequality Although the growth of the inclusive income gap between urban and rural communities is narrowed because of digital financing, its effectiveness is constrained by other variables. There is a lot of variation amongst the various regions. [22 ] Negative  FinTech, Financial Inclusion Inequality We contend that financial inclusion caused by FinTech impacts inequality directly and indirectly. We find fresh proof that financial inclusion is FinTech's main conduit for reducing income inequality. [3 ] Negative     Table 2 The variables’ descriptions.

The United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda for sustainable development seeks to eliminate poverty in all its forms. An estimated 1.3 billion people in the BRICS countries are below the poverty line. This study examines the nexus between digital financial inclusions (DFI) and income inequality GINI) in the context of BRICS countries, with a focus on the moderate impacts of technological innovation (TI) and infrastructure development (ID). Applying the Driscoll-Kraay (DK) and fixed effects tests, the results show that DFI significantly negatively influences income inequality, with TI and ID contributing to strengthening this effect. The findings indicate that implementing TI and ID can potentially decrease income inequality in BRICS nations by facilitating faster, more secure, cost-effective transactions and offering greater access to markets and essential services. This study emphasises the need for policymakers to prioritise the implementation of TI and ID to accomplish sustainable development goals and encourage financial inclusion for all in the BRICS countries.

Unfortunately, despite global efforts, there is still a wide gap between those who can access financial services and those who do not, particularly in developing countries [3 ]. This gap is further exacerbated by income inequality, which limits the opportunities and benefits that formal financial services may give [4 ]. However, with the rapid growth of technology and telecommunications, digital finance has emerged as a promising means to alleviate financial exclusion and economic inequality [5–7 ]. Digital financial inclusion uses digital platforms like mobile banking and e-wallets to give individuals and businesses access to financial services [8 ]. It can reach people in remote and underserved regions where traditional brick-and-mortar banking institutions are unavailable [9 ]. Through these online channels, individuals and businesses can access crucial financial resources and services, such as credit, insurance, and payment systems, increasing their financial capability and stability [10 ]. This study aims to investigate the linkage between income inequality and digital financial inclusion and how this relationship can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. The SDGs are a group of 17 global objectives that the UN approved in 2015 to promote sustainable development and eliminate poverty by the year 2030. Specifically, this study will investigate the role of technology and infrastructure in facilitating digital financial inclusion and its impact on reducing income inequality. To understand the potential of digital financial inclusion, it is important first to assess the current condition of financial inclusion and income inequality globally. Despite recent progress, the World Bank estimates that over 1.7 billion adults globally cannot access formal financial services [11 ]. This lack of access is much more pronounced in developing countries, where nearly 80 % of adults do not have access to financial services [12 ]. Therefore, lack of access is commonly due to a lack of physical infrastructure, such as bank branches and ATMs, and the high cost of ordinary financial services in these areas [13 ]. Financial exclusion has serious effects since it restricts people's capacity to save, invest, and access credit and insurance services, hindering economic progress and exposing them to economic shocks [14 ]. Besides that, income inequality is still a persistent issue in several countries, as an estimated 1.3 billion people in the BRICS countries are below the poverty line, where the wealthiest persons and businesses have access to a broader range of financial services and opportunities than those with lower incomes [15 ,16 ]. This inequality perpetuates the wealth divide and restricts economic growth and development potential. However, digital financial inclusion can bridge this gap by giving people access to broader financial services and opportunities. Technology has made digital financial services more affordable, secure, and accessible, allowing them to reach people in underserved areas [17 ]. Mobile banking and e-wallets, for example, enable consumers to access financial services and make transactions directly from their mobile devices, reducing the need for physical infrastructure. This may significantly lower costs and increase user convenience [13 ]. Furthermore, digital financial services offer a more secure and transparent alternative to traditional cash transactions, lowering the risk of fraud and corruption [11 ]. Digital financial inclusion can help reduce income inequality by promoting financial access and providing individuals with important financial literacy and services. Access to financial services can help people save, invest, and get credit and insurance. This can lead to more financial freedom and social mobility, narrowing the wealth gap between the affluent and poor [18 ]. Despite several significant developments in research on DFI and income inequality, there is still a gap in understanding the moderating role of technology innovation (TI) and infrastructure development (ID) in this nexus. Regarding our investigations, this gap has not been effectively addressed in the existing research identified in the literature matrix (Table 1  ). Furthermore, most studies in this area have concentrated on developed countries, with little research on developing economies, particularly BRICS states. This gap is especially concerning given that the BRICS countries have some of the world's most populated and fastest-growing economies, and knowing the role of DFI and its moderators in these countries is critical in attaining sustainable development goals. Moreover, there is insufficient empirical evidence on the specific measures via  which technological innovation and infrastructure development contribute to digital financial inclusion to minimising income inequality in developing countries as discussed in Table 1 . This is a key gap because understanding the particular routes through which these factors can affect income inequality is essential for developing effective policies and actions to address inequality. To address identified knowledge gaps, this study seeks to understand the relationship between digital financial inclusion and income inequality in BRICS countries by studying the moderating influence of technological innovation and infrastructure development. Our findings will highlight the potential of DFIs to help reduce income inequality and the relevance of strong TI and ID policies in achieving this goal. Hence, this research addresses three significant questions: Does DFI help reduce income disparity? How does technological advancement affect DFI's ability to reduce income inequality? What effect does DFI have on inequality of income in the BRICS nations? Last but not least, how might infrastructure support the link between DFI and income inequality? This study contributes to a better understanding the relationship between digital financial inclusion and inequality in the BRICS countries region. It can also help identify the potential of technological innovation and infrastructure development to bridge the gap between digital financial inclusion and inequality. This can provide insights into policy formulation and decision-making and guide the development of interventions that increase financial inclusion and reduce inequality. This research can also inform the development of effective strategies to increase access to digital financial services and ensure those services are used responsibly and effectively. Such strategies can promote economic growth and development in the BRICS countries. Finally, this research can be used to identify opportunities for collaboration and exchange of knowledge and resources among the BRICS countries. This contribution is especially concerning considering that the BRICS countries have among of the world's most populous and fastest-growing economies, and understanding the role of DFI and its moderators in these countries is crucial in achieving sustainable development goals. The remaining sections of this study include the literature review, methods, results, and commentary. The literature review will critically assess prior studies relating to this research topic. The methodology section will explore the methodologies and procedures used to perform this research. Following that, the results section will offer the findings and their descriptions. Finally, the study will conclude thoroughly with the findings and their implications.  2 Literature review This study investigates the connections between digital finance, the role of technological innovation, and infrastructure development by reviewing three key research areas. 2.1 Income inequality & theoretical review Inequality can be defined in various ways, such as the unequal distribution of money, influence, or status within or between groups. It differs from the concept of injustice in that it focuses on the lack of equality across society's diverse groups rather than specific instances of unjust or wrongful treatment of people [23 ]. Inequality is widely studied in various fields, including economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, and psychology. It includes economic, social, and political inequality. Economic inequality is often measured by the gap in income and wealth across people, households, and nations. Social inequality, on the other hand, is frequently assessed based on individuals' access to power, influence, and public services such as education and healthcare. Representing various social groups in government and decision-making organisations is used to measure political inequality. Finally, cultural inequality is frequently measured by how different society groups are treated and given chances and the prevalence of social norms and beliefs that may disadvantage particular groups [24 ]. Inequality has grown frequently nationally and internationally in the past few years. Throughout history, societies have experienced difficulties in tackling inequality, which has been related to several social, economic, and political issues, such as poverty, poor health, restricted educational possibilities, and a lack of job opportunities (Deaton, 2021). Inequality can have a substantial impact on both individual's lives and societies. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend its causes and effects (Yenn, 2022). Addressing these problems requires a thorough strategy considering the various needs and experiences of people from various backgrounds. Meanwhile, understanding inequality's roots and effects is crucial for effective inequality reduction (Deo et al., 2022).  2.2 Empirical review 2.2.1 Nexus between digital finance and income inequality Digital finance, commonly known as fintech, applies technology to financial services. It has rapidly transformed over the last decade, and its impact on financial inclusion and inequality has attracted the attention of researchers and policymakers. In this literature review, we will investigate the relationship between digital finance and inequality and how digital finance can accelerate and alleviate current inequality. According to the World Bank, 1.7 billion adults worldwide do not have access to basic financial services, with the majority living in low-income countries and among women, rural areas, and small-scale enterprises (World Bank, 2017). Digital finance has the potential to alleviate inequality in numerous ways. According to Ref. [25 ], the introduction of mobile money in Kenya led to a 2 % decrease in the share of households living in extreme poverty. This decline was mostly attributed to increased access to savings and decreased transaction costs. The study also discovered that the benefit was bigger for the poorest households, implying that digital money can help overcome the inequality gap. It can make it easier for underserved populations to get financial services while providing a forum for people to increase their financial literacy and awareness. By providing users access to banking services, digital finance can also provide a safe and economical way to send and receive money, save and spend money, and obtain credit (Deo et al., 2022). On top of that, by facilitating access to money for small enterprises and expanding access to foreign markets, digital finance can help economic growth and inequality reduction in emerging countries. Furthermore, it may cut the cost of financial services and expand credit availability, lowering poverty and increasing deprived economic prospects. Digital financial inclusions can reduce the income gap, as [26 ] explored digital finance initiatives aimed at helping low-income populations in developing countries. He argues that digital finance initiatives can potentially improve access to financial services. Likewise, Li et al. (2020) examined the elements that could aid in closing the income gap in China. The study's findings indicated that digital financial inclusion is one element that can narrow the income gap between urban and rural areas. Likewise [27 ], noted digital financial inclusion affects economic growth and accelerates access to financial services, enhancing efficiency, raising transparency, and lowering costs. Moreover [28 ], evaluated the role of digital financial inclusion in reducing poverty. It noticed that financial inclusion in the informal economy enabled individuals to access financial services and increased their financial capability, significantly reducing poverty. Digital finance has given access and options to the household for consumption [29 ]. examined the nexus of digital finance affecting household consumption, pointing out that this impact is positive and significant. Likewise [30 ], explored how digital financial inclusion affects the susceptibility of rural households to poverty in China. His research demonstrates that digital financial inclusion considerably reduces rural households' vulnerability to poverty. Digital finance is beneficial not only for individual customers but also for firms. For example [31 ], demonstrated that digital micro-financial services could provide SMEs greater access to financial services and potentially increase their economic growth. Similarly [32 ], examined the impacts of the United Arab Emirates' switch to a cashless society and the adoption of digital payments. This study found substantial barriers to the UAE's cashless economy, such as a lack of consumer trust in the digital payment system, financial literacy, and an outdated banking system. Few researchers, on the other hand, say that one of the most significant effects of digital finance on inequality is the potential to expand the gap between those with access to financial services and those without. Because digital money primarily relies on technology and internet connectivity, it may leave marginalised and vulnerable communities behind. Aside from accessibility, the cost of digital finance can also contribute to inequality. Fees for digital financial transactions might be prohibitively expensive for low-income persons, making it impossible for them to engage in the digital financial ecosystem fully. According to studies, digital financial services can be more expensive in terms of transaction fees, data usage, and device cost when compared to traditional financial services [33 ,34 ]. As a result, low-income people may be denied access to the benefits of digital finance, forcing them to rely on more expensive and inefficient traditional financial services. The literature suggests that the nexus between digital money and inequality is complex and can have positive and negative effects. However, there is a lack of research on how digital financial inclusion affects income inequality in developing nations, specifically in BRICS countries. The BRICS countries have significant income and wealth inequality levels, and their digital financial environments are rapidly developing. As a result, it is critical to research the influence of digital financial inclusion on income inequality in these countries. This research could help policymakers establish targeted actions and policies to ensure that the benefits of digital finance are inclusive and equitable for all parts of society. The hypothesis can be expressed as follows after reviewing the literature.H1 Implementing digital finance in BRICS, such as mobile money, can reduce poverty and bridge the inequality gap, particularly for the poorest households.    2.2.2 Nexus between technological innovations and income inequality Technological innovation and inequality are two key concerns thoroughly investigated in numerous disciplines. Technological innovation introduces new ideas, products, or procedures that cause substantial societal changes. In contrast, inequality refers to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities among individuals or groups in society. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in understanding the relationship between technological innovation and inequality. This literature review explores existing studies on the relationship between technological innovation and inequality and identifies current issues and arguments in this field. For decades, the relationship between technical advancement and inequality has been debated. Some scholars claim that technological innovation can reduce inequality by introducing new job possibilities and enhancing productivity [35–37 ]. For example, the use of new technology in the industrial sector has resulted in the development of new, high-paying employment, hence reducing income disparity [38 ]. Furthermore, technical advancements such as the internet and e-commerce have offered individuals from marginalised communities new chances to engage in the global economy, lowering social and economic inequality [37 ]. However, other researchers believe technological progress might aggravate inequality by establishing a digital divide between those with access to technology and those without access [39–41 ]. This divide limits people's prospects and enhances socioeconomic inequities [42 ]. For example, individuals with greater access to technology have a better chance of acquiring new skills and information, boosting their employability and income. In contrast, those with restricted access could be left behind [43 ]. Therefore, this shift has decreased job opportunities for low-skilled workers, increasing unemployment. The quality of employment offered has decreased due to automation and computerisation, which has substantially impacted job quality [44 ]. As many employments once seen as secure are no longer so, new technology advancements have reduced job security. As a result, there is more job dissatisfaction and lower overall performance [45 ]. Another key component of the relationship between technological innovation and inequality is the influence of technical development on wealth distribution. Automation and artificial intelligence, for example, have displaced workers in numerous industries, particularly low-skilled labour [43 ]. revealed a stronger correlation between access to ICTs and income inequality in countries with weak institutional and regulatory frameworks and countries with higher levels of inequality. As a result, income inequality has increased, and the wage portion of national income has decreased [46 ]. Furthermore, the concentration of wealth within a very small number of persons who control and benefit from this new technology has contributed to increasing income and wealth inequality [47 ]. Finally, the relationship between technological innovation and inequality is a complicated and intricate problem that has increased the interest of scholars. While some research suggests that technological innovation can help alleviate inequality, others contend it can worsen it. In addition, the impact of technological innovation on inequality is determined by various factors, including economic distribution, government regulations, and social and cultural issues. This literature review provides a quick summary of the main themes and disputes in this field. It emphasises the need for additional study to completely comprehend the relationship between technological innovation and inequality. Moreover, studying the impact of technological innovation on income inequality can also provide insights into how different socioeconomic groups are affected differently by technological change. This knowledge can help prioritise social policies and interventions to alleviate inequality and promote more inclusive growth. Based on the existing literature, we can design the following hypotheses.H2 Technological innovation reduces economic inequality by offering new work opportunities and increasing productivity.    2.2.3 Nexus between infrastructure and inequality Infrastructure development has been accepted as an important aspect of facilitating economic growth and social progress. Roads, bridges, ports, airports, water supply systems, and telephone networks are all examples of infrastructure. Infrastructure is necessary for economic activity and plays an important role in increasing people's quality of life and well-being. However, there is growing concern over unequal infrastructure distribution and its influence on inequality. This literature review aims to investigate the relationship between infrastructure development and inequality and assess the empirical evidence on this topic. The relationship between infrastructure development and inequality is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, infrastructure development can help to reduce inequality by improving access to services and opportunities for marginalised and underprivileged people. On the other hand, unequal access to infrastructure can worsen existing disparities and generate new ones. As a result, the distribution of infrastructure can either encourage or inhibit inclusive development and social equity. Economic development and infrastructural development are closely intertwined. The availability and quality of infrastructure determine a country's economic growth. Infrastructure development may help firms grow, attract investments, and stimulate economic activity. According to a study by Ref. [48 ]; infrastructure development has a major impact on employment growth, income distribution, and poverty reduction in developing nations. In addition, improved access to infrastructure can lower regional differences and raise general living standards, resulting in a more equitable distribution of resources. Similarly [49 ], studied the role of infrastructure in connecting rural and urban populations and concluded that infrastructure improvements could generate employment and economic opportunities, lowering income inequality. [50 ] argues that for infrastructure investments to benefit all members of society, investments must be increased, project planning and management improved, and public engagement included in decision-making processes. Furthermore [51 ], examined how the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) affected infrastructure integration, inequality, and poverty in developing nations. The author found that transportation infrastructure is essential in BRI countries and that successfully implementing infrastructure policies can help alleviate poverty and result in economic development. Another study by Ref. [49 ] discovered that infrastructure growth can reduce income inequality [52 ]. examined the influence of urban greening on well-being disparities. They concluded that urban greening could improve access to nature, air quality, and noise reduction while assisting in eradicating social, economic, and health disparities. However, infrastructure distribution is frequently uneven, with rural and remote areas having far less appropriate infrastructure than urban ones. This unequal infrastructure distribution can potentially worsen disparities between urban and rural areas. Rural communities, for example, may have restricted access to transportation networks, safe drinking water, and power, limiting economic prospects and social mobility [53 ]. discovered that inadequate infrastructure in rural regions can imprison people in poverty and hinder them from realising their full potential. The availability and quality of infrastructure also influence access to important social services like education, healthcare, and sanitation. Inadequate infrastructure makes it difficult for underprivileged groups to obtain education and healthcare, reinforcing socioeconomic disparities. According to Moneva (2017), a lack of infrastructure hurts the quality of education, leading to uneven access to school and growing the education gap between the rich and the poor.H3 The relationship between digital financial inclusion and income inequality is stronger with better infrastructure.   According to the literature studied, infrastructure development is critical to facilitating economic growth and social advancement. However, unequal infrastructure distribution can exacerbate wealth inequality in countries. As a result, a study on the influence of infrastructure development on income disparity in the BRICS countries is necessary, as these are significant growing economies where infrastructure investment is a key priority. This research will provide important insights into the relationship between infrastructure development and economic inequality and help shape policies to promote fair and sustainable development in these nations. After evaluating the literature on the relationship between digital finance, technical innovation, infrastructure development, and income inequality, it is obvious that there is a research gap in the available studies. While there are abundant studies on the influence of digital finance and technological innovation on income inequality, there is little research on the combined effect of these variables and the moderating role of infrastructural development. Furthermore, most study in this area has been conducted in developed countries, with little research on developing economies, particularly in the BRICS. These countries have significant income inequality and are undergoing tremendous digital and technological breakthroughs. As a result, there is a major research gap in these countries regarding the specific impact of digital financial inclusion and technological innovation on income inequality. Table 1  shows mixed research findings on the association between digital financial inclusions and income inequality. While some studies demonstrate a positive influence, others show a negative impact. This highlights the need for additional research into the variables contributing to this association. Furthermore, the literature suggests that the impact of technical innovation on income disparity can be either positive or negative, depending on a variety of factors such as government policies and institutions. This highlights the need for a more detailed understanding of the interaction between these two variables and the moderating role of infrastructure development and technological innovation.    3 Data, methodology and econometric strategy 3.1 Data Based on the preceding debate, this study aims to find the effects of digital financial inclusion on income inequality and how technological innovation and infrastructure development moderates the relationship between digital financial inclusion and income inequality. Data for the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) were collected from four main sources from 2000 to 2019: the World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) for the income inequality measure, the global financial inclusion database (Findex) for our digital financial inclusion variable, the world development indicators for the control variables, and the OECD Statistics for infrastructure data and technological innovation.  3.2 Theoratical model and econometric strategy In this study, panel data will be used to analyse the effects of digital financial inclusion on income inequality and the role of technology innovation and infrastructure development in moderating this effect. According to Baltagi's classification, the panel data will be regarded as macro as the time dimension of the variables covers more than 20 periods [60 ]. It is crucial to assess cross-sectional dependence before proceeding with the analysis because it can impact the outcomes. The Breusch-Pagan CDLM1, CDLM2, and CDLM tests will be employed. Additionally, unit root tests will be performed to evaluate the key assumption of stationarity in panel data analysis. As a second-generation panel unit root test created for data with cross-sectional dependence, Pesaran's Cross-sectionally Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test will be utilised for this investigation. When analysing panel data, multicollinearity can be problematic since it can produce inaccurate coefficient estimates. Inference from the panel data may be biased in cross-sectional dependence, heteroscedasticity, or serial correlation cases. As a result, diagnostic tests will be performed to evaluate the issues and ascertain the model's viability. We will test for autocorrelation using the Durbin-Watson and Baltagi-Wu LBI and heteroscedasticity using the Modified Wald tests. The Breusch-Pagan LM, Pesaran Scaled LM, and Pesaran CD tests will be used to find cross-sectional dependence. Robust estimators like those proposed by Refs. [61 ,62 ] can be utilised to resolve these problems. The Driscoll and Kraay estimator will be preferred for this study as it offers solid empirical evidence and more effectively handles the issues of cross-sectional dependency, autocorrelation, and heteroscedasticity. The research model employed in this study intends to investigate the impact of digital financial inclusion (DFI) on income inequality, as well as the potential moderating influence of technological innovation (TI) and infrastructure development (ID) in this relationship. Furthermore, the study will investigate the potential interaction effects of DFI and TI, as well as DFI and ID, on income inequality in the BRICS countries. In the first model, the influence of DFI on income inequality will be investigated using the following econometric equation:(1) G I N I  c , t   = β 0  + β 1  ( D F I  )  c , t   + β 2  ( T R  )  c , t   + β 3  ( INF )  c , t   + β 4  ( G D P P C  )  c , t   + ε c , t       Where: GINI measures income inequality in BRICS countries at a specific time (c , t   ). TR, INF and GDPPC represent control variables, β 0    is the intercept β 1    is the coefficient of independent and control variables, which affect the dependent variable, and ε    represents the error term. The second model will expand on the first model by including TI as a new independent variable:(2) G I N I  c , t   = β 0  + β 1 ( D F I  )  c , t   + β 2  ( T I  )  c , t   + β 3  ( T R  )  c , t   + β 4  ( INF )  c , t   + β 5  ( G D P P C  )  c , t   + ε c , t       Where TI stands for technological innovation (detail of measurement is written in Table 2  ), and the remaining variables are the same as in the first model. The third model will expand upon the second model by incorporating an interaction term between DFI and TI:(3) G I N I  c , t   = β 0  + β 1  ( D F I  )  c , t   + β 2  ( T I  )  c , t   + β 3  ( D F I  )  * ( T I  )  c , t   + β 4  ( T R  )  c , t   + β 5  ( INF )  c , t   + β 6  ( G D P P C  )  c , t   + ε c , t       Where β 3    is the interaction term coefficient, which reflects the moderating influence of TI on the relationship between DFI and GINI and remaining variables are the same as in the second model. The fourth model will take the same technique as the third but use ID instead of TI as the moderating variable.(6) G I N I  c , t   = β 0  + β 1  ( D F I  )  c , t   + β 2  ( I D  )  c , t   + β 3  ( T R  )  c , t   + β 4  ( INF )  c , t   + β 5  ( G D P P C  )  c , t   + ε c , t       Where, ID reflect infrastructure development (detail of measurement is given in Table 2 ). The remaining variables are identical to those in the third model.(7) G I N I  c , t   = β 0  + β 1  ( D F I  )  c , t   + β 2  ( I D  )  c , t   + β 3  ( I D  )  * ( D F I  )  c , t   + β 4  ( T R  )  c , t   + β 5  ( INF )  c , t   + β 6  ( G D P P C  )  c , t   + ε c , t       Where β 3    is the interaction term coefficient, which reflects the moderating influence of ID on the relationship between DFI and GINI, and the remaining variables are the same as in the second model (see Fig. 1 ).   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Graphical trend of digital financial inclusion and income inequality Fig. 2    illustrates a significant association between digital financial inclusion and income inequality in BRICS countries. Countries with greater degrees of digital financial inclusion, such as Kenya and China, tend to have lower levels of income inequality. This might be attributed to digital financial services offering previously deprived communities access to financial services, potentially lowering economic gaps.  4.2 Results of baseline analysis The outcomes of our cross-sectional dependency tests, illustrated in Table 3  , suggest a significant degree of dependency among the variables in our data. This suggests that the variables are not independent of one another and may be influenced by common factors or underlying linkages. The GINI, DFI, and INF variables all have high values in the Breusch-Pagan test, which indicates that the data strongly reveal heteroscedasticity. The Pesaran scaled LM test also confirms this assessment, with high results for all variables demonstrating a cross-sectional correlation between the variables. The weight CD test also confirms a significant level of dependence among the variables, with high values for all of them. The Second-Genration panel unit root tests make different assumptions about cross-sectional dependence. The first generation assumes cross-sectional independence for each panel unit. In contrast, the second generation accounts for cross-sectional dependence by allowing for panel heterogeneity and not assuming a common autoregressive structure. These tests, like Bai & Ng (2005) and Bond et al. (2005), assume the data has a unit root. The benefit of second-generation tests is their capacity to estimate parameters accurately in the presence of cross-sectional dependence [63 ]. We employed data from five countries and used the second-generation unit root test in our investigation. The results in Table 4   show that all series are non-stationary at order I and become stationary at the first difference (1). This enables us to conduct cointegration and regression analysis. The descriptive statistics in Table 5   highlight some key characteristics of the variables employed in this investigation. The average result for GINI, our measure of income inequality, is −0.668, with a standard deviation of 0.569. This suggests that the countries in our sample have different degrees of income inequality, with some having very low levels and others having significant levels. The minimum and maximum GINI values are −1.229 and 1.171, indicating a wide range of degrees of inequality within our sample. The variable for digital financial inclusion (DFI) has a mean value of 0.759 and a standard deviation of 1, indicating that, on average, countries in our sample have relatively low levels of digital financial inclusion, with some countries having much higher levels than others. The mean values for technological innovation (TI) and infrastructure development (ID) are relatively high, at 6.709 and 22.058, with standard deviations of 1.769 and 2.095, respectively. This implies that most countries in our study have highly advanced levels of technology and infrastructure. The mean score for trade (Trade) is 3.751, indicating that trade is vital to the economies of these countries. Inflation (INF) has a mean value of 1.643 and a standard deviation of 0.679, demonstrating that inflation levels differ among our sample countries. Overall, the descriptive data reveal variability in income inequality, digital financial inclusion, technology and infrastructure levels, and linkages across all countries in our sample. This lays a solid framework for future research into the effects of digital financial inclusion on income inequality and the role of technology and infrastructure in this relationship. The pairwise correlations in Table 6   show a negative link between digital financial inclusion (DFI) and income inequality, with a coefficient of −0.232. This shows that increasing DFI levels might result in decreased income inequality. Technology innovation (TI) and GINI have a negative connection, with a value of −0.272. This implies that countries with greater levels of technological innovation may also have lower levels of income disparity. Infrastructure development (ID) and GINI also have a negative connection, with a coefficient of −0.137. It demonstrates yet again how money spent on infrastructure can help to reduce the wealth gap. Trade and GINI do not significantly correlate, indicating that there may not be a direct relationship between the two. Furthermore, a weak positive correlation between inflation (INF) and GINI suggests that greater inflation rates may be linked to higher GINI levels. The link between GDP per capita (GDPPC) and GINI is also negative, with a value of −0.393. The relevant variables are unstable at the level but stable at the first difference with cross-country dependency, as shown in Table 2 . We used Westerlund's (2007) cointegration tests to examine the long-term relationship between the variables because all the variables at levels have unit roots and cross-country dependencies. Table 7   presents the outcomes of cointegration among the selected variables. Unstipulated findings show that VIF is still less than 10 in all models, showing no multicollinearity issues with the data. The Westerlund test outcomes for cointegration (Table 7 ) reveal statistically significant test results, thereby rejecting the null hypothesis of no cointegration at different significance levels. This indicates the presence of cointegration between the variables. The Westerlund and Pedroni tests also indicate a long-run relationship among DFI, TI, ID, TR, INF, GDPPC and GINI. These results are consistent with other recent cross-country studies [3 ,19 ,54 ,64 ]. Additionally, our findings align with evidence from single-country studies indicating inequality in emerging countries (income or consumption) [19 ,65 ]. Table 8   displays the outcomes of three critical tests in establishing the effectiveness of fixed effects regression as an analytical technique. These tests, which include the Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg heteroskedasticity test, the [66 ] specification test, and the Modified Wald test for groupwise heteroskedasticity, are designed to detect the presence of heteroskedasticity in regression models, which violates the assumption of constant error term variance. Heteroskedasticity can lead to biased estimation of regression coefficients and standard errors, thereby affecting the accuracy and validity of the results [66–69 ]. Table 8  demonstrates heteroskedasticity in the data, as evidenced by p-values less than 0.05 in all three tests. This requires using fixed effects to handle unobserved individual-specific effects and increase outcome reliability.  4.3 Estimation results of Driscoll-Kraay standard error Table 9   displays the results of the Driscoll-Kraay Standard Error, examining the effect of digital financial inclusion (DFI) on income inequality in BRICS countries, along with the potential moderating impact of technological innovation (TI) and infrastructure development (ID) on this interaction. The analysis results in Table 8  reveal that digital financial inclusion (DFI) has a positive but statistically insignificant influence on income inequality in BRICS nations. This finding is similar to previous studies, such as the World Bank study (2018), which revealed that while DFI helps boost access to financial services and promote financial inclusion, it does not always significantly reduce income disparity. Control variables with varied degrees of significance include trade (TR), inflation (INF), and GDP per capita (GDPPC). In the second model (Eq. (2) ), the value of the coefficient for TI is negative and statistically significant and negative at the 5 % level, demonstrating that technological innovation has a moderating influence on the link between DFI and income inequality. This finding implies that as technological innovation develops, the positive association between DFI and income inequality declines, probably due to the increased availability of other sources of income. As a result, TI can help mitigate DFI's negative consequences. This finding is consistent with that of [70 ,71 ]; who revealed that factors such as technological advancement and infrastructural development have a role in influencing the impact of DFI on income inequality. The third model (Eq. (3) ) includes a DFI-TI interaction term. This interaction term has a negative coefficient that is statistically significant at the 5 % level, demonstrating that TI significantly moderates the link between DFI and income inequality. This finding adds to the evidence that TI can be used to mitigate the potential adverse impacts of DFI on income inequality [72 ]. Instead of TI, the fourth model (Eq.4) uses ID as the moderating variable. At the 5 % level, the ID coefficient is negative and statistically significant, demonstrating that infrastructure development moderates the relationship between DFI and income inequality. This finding implies that the positive link between DFI and income inequality weakens as infrastructure development expands. This finding is consistent with other research emphasising the role of infrastructure in supporting financial inclusion and lowering income inequality. The results presented here accord with the outcomes of [48 ]; who found that transportation infrastructure has the potential to reduce income inequality. The fifth model (Eq.5) includes a DFI−ID interaction term. The coefficient for this interaction term is statistically significant, showing that ID moderates the link between DFI and income inequality. This finding implies that while ID may moderate the association between DFI and income inequality, the two factors significantly weaken this effect. This result is consistent with the outcomes of research by Refs. [73 ,74 ]; which propose that other developments in infrastructure and technology may mitigate the impact of DFI on income inequality. Overall, the findings imply that, while DFI may positively affect income inequality, technological innovation and infrastructure development can function as moderating variables. This emphasises the significance of TI and ID in developing a more inclusive and equal society, particularly in terms of financial inclusion, similar results found by Refs. [75–77 ].  4.4 Robustness test results Table 10   exhibits the Fixed Effect estimation results, which were used to assess the robustness of our findings in Table 9 . The research reveals that the results are consistent with the Driscoll-Kraay standard error results, although with some differences in the significant level. The findings demonstrate that DFI positively affects GINI; however, only in model 1 is the coefficient statistically significant at the 5 % level. The findings also show that TI and ID negatively and significantly affect GINI. The interaction term between DFI and TI is negative and statistically significant at the 5 % level, suggesting TI moderating influence in the relationship between DFI and GINI. However, the interaction term between DFI and ID is not statistically significant, implying that ID may not have the same moderating effect as TI. The control factors have varying degrees of importance in influencing GINI, consistent with the findings in Table 9 . The results in Table 11   demonstrate the robustness of our results when multiple imputation approaches are used to account for missing data. The findings are consistent with the preceding two tables in that DFI has a positive and statistically significant impact on GINI, among other control factors. The findings also show that TI and ID negatively and significantly impact GINI. The interaction term between DFI and TI is negative and statistically significant, suggesting the moderating impact of TI in the link between DFI and GINI. The interaction term between DFI and ID is also negative and significant, suggesting a moderating role of ID. The results presented here show the robustness of our findings across several estimating techniques.   5 Conclusion and inferences The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between digital financial inclusion (DFI) and income inequality in BRICS countries, with an emphasis on the moderating effects of technological innovation (TI) and infrastructure development (ID). This paper examines the complex relationship using a novel methodology that combines panel data analysis, Driscoll-Kraay standard error, and fixed effects estimate. Using robust analytical approaches, this study presents solid evidence to support the potential impact of DFI in reducing GINI in BRICS countries. This research contributes to the existing literature on digital financial inclusion and income inequality, providing significant insights for policymakers and future studies. The findings of this study reveal that DFI has significant negative effects on GINI, with TI and ID contributing to boost this effect. While DFI may positively influence income, GINI, TI, and ID may be moderating variables to reduce this effect. The findings of this study indicate that TI has a significant negative effect on GINI. As TI evolves and becomes more accessible, it gives individuals more chances to create revenue and improve their financial status, thereby decreasing GINI. Furthermore, the findings show that ID plays a significant influence in reducing GINI. As infrastructure improves, access to financial services and markets improves, encouraging financial inclusion and reducing GINI. The focus on the BRICS countries makes this study distinctive, with a combined population of nearly 3 billion people and home to a significant portion of the world's depressed. Understanding the nexus between DFI and GINI in these countries is essential for reducing global poverty and achieving sustainable development goals. This study's practical implications are important for policymakers in the BRICS countries. According to the findings, prioritising technological innovation and infrastructural development may help attain sustainable development goals and encourage financial inclusion for all. This requires investing in digital infrastructure, such as reliable internet and mobile networks, and establishing an atmosphere flexible to technology innovation. This can lead to faster, more secure, and cost-effective transactions and wider access to markets and key services, which could reduce income disparity in these countries. In terms of future directions, further investigation may expand the investigation to include other developing countries and BRICS countries to acquire a more thorough knowledge of the relationship between DFI and income inequality on a global scale. Furthermore, qualitative research might be executed to understand better the mechanisms by which DFI, TI, and ID affect income inequality, which could inspire more targeted policy responses. This study has some limitations that should be addressed in future research. To begin, the sample employed in this study is limited to BRICS countries, which may not be representative of all developing countries. Future studies might include a broader range of developing nations. Furthermore, this analysis only considers the macro-level effects of DFI, TI, and ID on income inequality. Future research should investigate undertaking a comparison analysis across countries to understand better the specific effects of digital financial inclusion and technology innovation on reducing income inequality. Additionally, investigating the role of equality in entrepreneurship in these countries and its impact on income inequality could give policymakers and researchers useful insights. Furthermore, future studies could benefit from investigating the potential role of artificial intelligence in boosting financial inclusion and decreasing income disparities.
