                  Objectives
                  Food security plays a critical role in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG-2) and public health outcomes; however, its effectiveness under the impact of international sanctions remains unclear. This study examined the impact of international sanctions on achieving SDG-2 and food security.
               
                  Study design
                  This cross-country empirical analysis was based on a combined database that included data from the Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB), Food and Agriculture Organization Statistics (FAOSTAT) and United Nations (UN) Comtrade.
               
                  Methods
                  First, an instrumental variable (IV) strategy was used to deal with the endogeneity of other events in target countries’ sanctions. Second, a two-stage least square (2SLS) regression was conducted using high-dimensional fixed effects. Third, based on the Structural Gravity Model, a Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) regression on bilateral agricultural trade was performed.
               
                  Results
                  Findings from this study showed that international sanctions had a negative impact on the achievement of SDG-2 and food security, which was associated with poor public health outcomes. This was mainly evidenced by an increase in the prevalence of undernourishment and a high population of children with moderate or severe stunting. Sanctions were also shown to distort the agricultural value-added share and decrease domestic agricultural production. In addition, sanctions impeded bilateral import supply, which resulted in a lower import value and quantity, and a higher import price.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Food security and agricultural sustainability associated with hunger, nutrition and health from 1950 to 2019 were significantly associated with international sanctions. Under the uncertain shock of international sanctions, progress towards SDG-2 deteriorated, mainly for Targets 2.1, 2.2 and 2.a, and the impact was non uniform across all targets. From a sociopolitical perspective, the empirical findings of this study provide vital lessons for policymakers and public health communities to increase humanitarian outreach.

This study examined the impact of international sanctions on achieving SDG-2 and food security.  Study design This cross-country empirical analysis was based on a combined database that included data from the Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB), Food and Agriculture Organization Statistics (FAOSTAT) and United Nations (UN) Comtrade.  Methods First, an instrumental variable (IV) strategy was used to deal with the endogeneity of other events in target countries’ sanctions. Second, a two-stage least square (2SLS) regression was conducted using high-dimensional fixed effects. Third, based on the Structural Gravity Model, a Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) regression on bilateral agricultural trade was performed.  Results Findings from this study showed that international sanctions had a negative impact on the achievement of SDG-2 and food security, which was associated with poor public health outcomes. This was mainly evidenced by an increase in the prevalence of undernourishment and a high population of children with moderate or severe stunting. Sanctions were also shown to distort the agricultural value-added share and decrease domestic agricultural production. In addition, sanctions impeded bilateral import supply, which resulted in a lower import value and quantity, and a higher import price.  Conclusions Food security and agricultural sustainability associated with hunger, nutrition and health from 1950 to 2019 were significantly associated with international sanctions. Under the uncertain shock of international sanctions, progress towards SDG-2 deteriorated, mainly for Targets 2.1, 2.2 and 2.a, and the impact was non uniform across all targets. From a sociopolitical perspective, the empirical findings of this study provide vital lessons for policymakers and public health communities to increase humanitarian outreach.   Keywords Food security  SDG-2  International sanction  Nutrition & health    Introduction Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG-2) aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”. This multidimensional goal highlights the complex relations between food security, hunger, nutrition and sustainable agriculture. Food security consists of dimensions such as availability, access, utilisation, stability, agency and sustainability,1  , 2   which are key components of SDG-2 and global public health. Food insecurity (i.e. the imbalance between availability and demand) is an important risk factor for poor public health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.3   As food insecurity can be mitigated by the international trade of agricultural products, a highly globalised agricultural trade system is critical to global food security, SDG-2 and public health. However, globalised agricultural trade is facing trends of global trade politicisation, food deglobalisation and trade protectionism.4   International sanctions (e.g. trade and financial sanctions) have served as a prominent and purposive tool for coercive negotiation5  , 6   and conveyed a signal of political instability, prompting target countries to cease engaging in unacceptable conduct. According to the Global Sanctions Data Base (GSDB), 1325 sanction cases (1950–2022) have been used to achieve different objectives (e.g. democracy, human rights and terrorism) through diverse types (e.g. military, financial, trade or multiple). The overall number of imposed sanctions increased from 20 cases (1950) to 408 cases (2022). However, most countries with food insecurity have experienced long periods of international sanctions.7   In 2022, >700 million people worldwide were deemed hungry, and food insecurity increased from 25.3% in 2019 to 29.6% in 2022.8   Therefore, most food and agriculture-related SDG targets remain far from being achieved, particularly under the uncertain shock of international sanctions. This study considered food security as a public health priority. It aimed to assess the impact of international sanctions on SGD-2 and the relationship between food security and agricultural trade using a broad range of factors for >200 countries from 1990 to 2019.  Methods Study design Owing to the endogeneity problem of international sanctions, a wide range of convincing identification strategies have already been used in the literature (e.g. interest group model9   and endogeneous treatment model).10   Based on the discussion of the endogeneity challenges and the validity of the instrumental variable (IV) strategy,11   this study used the IV strategy in three stages. First, at Stage 0, the following econometric equation using the probit estimator was estimated: Stage 0:(1) S i j t   = β A  A G G R E S S  i t   + γ G E O G R  i j t   + δ H I S T O R Y  i j   + Ψ t  + ε i j t        Here, S i j t      is an indicator variable when the sender country i  imposes a sanction on the target country j  in year t . A G G R E S S  i t      is a novel index of the sender's aggressiveness and the main instrument. It is constructed by summing the sanction cases that were imposed by sender i  in each year t . G E O G R  i j t      is an indicator variable for contiguity and a continuous variable for the bilateral distance between i  and j . H I S T O R Y  i j      is an indicator variable for the common official language and the presence of a colonial relationship between i  and j . φ t     is the year-fixed effects, and ϵ i j t      is the error term. Second, this study summed the predicted bilateral probabilities from the probit regression to construct a sender-specific instrument S ˆ  j t     :(2) S ˆ  j t   = ∑ i  S ˆ  i j t        Third, the instrument was used to implement a conventional two-staged least squares (2SLS) estimation. In Stage 1, the endogenous variable S j t      was regressed on the instrument S ˆ  j t     , along with other covariates from Stage 2. Stage 1:(3) S j t   = β S 1 s t   S ˆ  j t   + ∑ n = 1  N  β n  Z j t   + μ j  + μ t  + ϵ j t        Here,  S  j t      is an indicator variable when any sender country imposes a sanction on target country j  in year t. Z j t      is a vector of target country-specific control variables. μ j     is a set of country-fixed effects, and μ t     is a set of year-fixed effects. ϵ jt     is the error term. S ˆ  j t      is the indicator obtained from Equation (Eq. (2) ), which was levied on j  by all individual sender countries i  in year t : Stage 2:(4) ln ( P j t   )  = α 0  S j t   + ∑ n = 1  N  β n  Z j t   + μ j  + μ t  + ϵ j t        Here, P j t      is the dependent variable measured by the different indicators of SDG-2.  Data source and definition of variables To perform the three stages of empirical analysis, three unbalanced panel datasets were constructed; one-bilateral sanction dataset at the country-pair level for Stage 0, and one-country-specific sanction for Stage 1 involving 212 senders and 181 targets. Both datasets covered the period from 1950 to 2022. The third one-bilateral sanctions, which included food, SDG-2 and trade at the country-pair level, covered the period from 1990 to 2019, from 2000 to 2020 and from 1990 to 2019, respectively. Table 1   shows the standard data sources for the first two stages. Data sources for Stage 2 are presented in the Results and Discussion sections.  Statistical analyses Based on Formulas (Eqs. (1) and (3) ), the first two-stage regressions were performed. Table 2   summarises the results of the four methods. Column (1) reports the IV_Probit results, including country and year-fixed effects. Column (2) includes fixed effects and other control variables. In addition, to test the robustness, Column (3) reports the result of IV_OLS and Column (4) reports the result of IV_lag, which takes the l a g _ A G G R E S S  i t − 1      as the IV. Comparing Column (2) with Column (1) and (4), the R2  of Column (2) is the highest, which includes country and year-fixed effects and controls for other variables at the country-year level. Comparing Column (2) with Column (3) shows that the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression underestimates the result, and the IV regression can deal with the endogeneity problem. Therefore, the regression of Stage 2 was performed based on the results in Column (2).   Results Table 3   shows the results of international sanctions on eight targets and indicators of SGD-2. The impact of international sanctions was not uniform across all targets and was shown to mainly affect Target 2.1, 2.2 and 2.a. First, international sanctions decreased the prevalence of severe (moderate or severe) food insecurity slightly, but increased the population with severe (moderate or severe) food insecurity heavily. This paradoxical outcome is attributed to the fact that the growth rate of the food-insecure population has lagged behind the overall growth of the global population. In addition, sanctions increased the prevalence of undernourishment. This means that, under the shock of international sanctions, greater population in food insecurity and higher prevalence in undernourishment resulted in overall poor health. Second, in terms of the impact of international sanctions on the health of women and children, sanctions slightly reduced the proportion of pregnant women aged 15–49 years with anaemia; however, diet structure has a greater influence on anaemia than food availability. Conversely, sanctions lead to a significant increase in the population of children who were moderately or severely stunted, which has a strong relationship with decreasing domestic food availability. Finally, with the development of urbanisation and optimisation of the industrial structure, and although the agricultural value-added share of gross domestic product (GDP) was relatively decreasing, sanctions still impeded the agricultural value-added share of GDP. Therefore, international sanctions were not significant in improving the agricultural value added per worker.  Discussion Many countries link the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development but not the interplay with the social (health and well-being) dimension,12  , 13   particularly the association between sociopolitical aspects and SDG-2. From a sociopolitical perspective, studies have reflected the primary and secondary effects of international sanctions. There is a broad consensus on the negative association between the global economy and the implementation of sanctions. The primary damaging effects are mainly seen in foreign direct investment,14  , 15   bilateral trade,16–18   economic growth,19  , 11   capital flows20   and employment.21   Although most sanctions are designed to avoid targeting health outcomes and often provide explicit humanitarian, medical and food exceptions, most sanctions have failed16  , 22  , 23   and have secondary effects on international agricultural trade22   and global public health. Secondary unintended damaging effects are mainly observed in non-targeted areas, such as humanitarian aid,25  , 26   starvation and food insecurity,6  , 24   poverty and income inequality,27  , 28   life expectancy,29–31   infant mortality,32   public health33  , 34   and the spread of disease.35  , 36   In addition, the secondary effects on non-target areas often have a greater negative impact on civilians and the poorer sections of the population than on the wealthy, and are therefore detrimental to human rights protection and democracy.28   Fig. 1   summarises the main pathways that international sanctions influence food security and SDGs. On the one hand, international sanctions can crowd out the endowments (labour, government expenditure, research & development and land) from the agri-food sector to other sectors37   or increase the food circulation cost;38   on the other hand, direct (export and import restriction and prohibition) and indirect effects (club effect, extraordinary effect, etc.) of sanctions can destroy bilateral or global trade.11  , 24  , 39   In addition, to deal with the negative effect of sanctions on food security, target countries may adopt a non-sustainable production pattern, which will go against the achievement of SDG-2. Table 4   shows the estimates of the impact of international sanctions on target countries' food security. This study shows that, first, from the domestic side, international sanctions impede domestic agricultural production in the target country. However, the negative impact on crop production (e.g. corn, wheat and rice) is not significant, which means the crop is not the main target of international sanctions because of international ethics.40   For example, as the largest sanction-sender country, the US ended unilateral agricultural and medical sanctions in 2000 in the ‘Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act’. Second, international sanctions increase global food aid for target countries and worsen the domestic food market of the target country by decreasing food supply availability and increasing food consumer price indices (CPI) and food price inflation. Third, based on the impact of international sanctions on the ‘sender-target’ bilateral trade,41   this study found that a one-case increase in international sanction on the target country leads to a 2.17% decrease in the target's agricultural import value, inhibits the target's import quantity by 3.25% and increases the import price by 1.01% (see Appendix A  in the supplementary material). Strengths and limitations This evaluation used a broad dataset, including three unbalanced panel datasets and more than 200 countries, and conducted three stages of empirical analysis by dealing with the endogeneity problem of international sanctions. This study not only discussed the negative impact of sanctions on SDG-2 and public health from a macro perspective, but also empirically examined the impact mechanism of the target's agricultural domestic production and import supply. This study has some limitations. First, because of data limitations, this evaluation could not conduct an empirical analysis from a micro-public health perspective (e.g. numerous chronic conditions, iron deficiency anaemia or poor dietary intake). Second, regression analysis in the Discussion section could not be performed for the SDG-2 targets in low- and middle-income countries. Future studies should focus on specific cases of sanctions, particularly those concerning developing countries. It is also important to assess the impact of international sanctions on the health of women and children, and the global public health equity in future studies.  Conclusions This study indicated that the deterioration of progress towards SDG-2 and food insecurity from 1950 to 2019 was significantly associated with international sanctions. Under the uncertain shock of international sanctions (1) progress towards SDG-2 deteriorated on Targets 2.1, 2.2 and 2.a; and (2) food insecurity was caused by lower food supplies owing to decreased agricultural production and trade, higher food CPI and inflation, and the lack of international aid. The current study findings revealed that the termination of trade and foreign aid, blockades and partial embargoes on international sanctions have damaging impacts on mortality. There is an urgent need to rebuild the functions of the World Trade Organisation and encourage gentle diplomacy and negotiations on international differences and disputes instead of implementing international sanctions. In addition, public health communities should focus on the impact of sanctions on food insecurity and SDG-2, and the resultant poor health of populations.
