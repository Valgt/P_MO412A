                  The crucial link between agricultural growth and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations Development Programme is established through efficient use of nitrogen in the cereal production systems. Nitrogen, mostly in its reactive form as fertilizer or synthetic N, governs the food production, and reconciles the productivity with economic and environmental considerations. However, N flows in the production system involves a large N leaking to the environment resulting in abysmally low nitrogen use efficiencies and environmental adversity. Agricultural system with sub-optimal N application is characterized with low crop productivity, spiraling into the vicious cycle of poverty, malnutrition and poor economy, a case most common in the sub-Saharan Africa. These essentially relate to SDG 1 (no-poverty), 2 (zero-hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 15 (life on land). Excess or imbalanced fertilizer N in most of China and parts of India led to serious environmental hazards, degradation of land and economic loss. Balancing the amount of N input in these regions will contribute in achieving the SDG 13 (climate action). Meeting some of the SDGs (5, gender equality; 6, clean water and sanitation; 10: reduced inequalities; etc.) requires optimum N application, which will also ensure “responsible consumption and production” (SDG 12). The quest for an appropriate N management needs accounting for the N surplus in a production system, and evolving strategies for increasing the nitrogen use efficiency. Much effort has been made to this effect with varying success. Cutting-edge technological options are although available on the horizon, the success lies in improved awareness among the policy makers, stakeholders and farmers, and better research to quantify the linkage between N management and the SDGs, taking collectively.

The crucial link between agricultural growth and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations Development Programme is established through efficient use of nitrogen in the cereal production systems. Nitrogen, mostly in its reactive form as fertilizer or synthetic N, governs the food production, and reconciles the productivity with economic and environmental considerations. However, N flows in the production system involves a large N leaking to the environment resulting in abysmally low nitrogen use efficiencies and environmental adversity. Agricultural system with sub-optimal N application is characterized with low crop productivity, spiraling into the vicious cycle of poverty, malnutrition and poor economy, a case most common in the sub-Saharan Africa. These essentially relate to SDG 1 (no-poverty), 2 (zero-hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 15 (life on land). Excess or imbalanced fertilizer N in most of China and parts of India led to serious environmental hazards, degradation of land and economic loss. Balancing the amount of N input in these regions will contribute in achieving the SDG 13 (climate action). Meeting some of the SDGs (5, gender equality; 6, clean water and sanitation; 10: reduced inequalities; etc.) requires optimum N application, which will also ensure “responsible consumption and production” (SDG 12). The quest for an appropriate N management needs accounting for the N surplus in a production system, and evolving strategies for increasing the nitrogen use efficiency. Much effort has been made to this effect with varying success. Cutting-edge technological options are although available on the horizon, the success lies in improved awareness among the policy makers, stakeholders and farmers, and better research to quantify the linkage between N management and the SDGs, taking collectively.   Keywords Nitrogen balance  Nitrogen surplus  Nitrogen use efficiency  Reactive nitrogen  Cereal  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction Nitrogen (N) plays a central role in maintaining the health of the biosphere. Optimizing flows of N through terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is linked with many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), set by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in January, 2016. While the majority of N (78%) is present in the atmosphere as inert molecular N2  gas, approximately 425 Tg of reactive forms of N (NR ) is produced every year globally by natural processes in oceans, on the land and by human activities (Bodirsky et al., 2014 ). About half of the NR  is linked in some way to agriculture. A notable increase in NR  can be traced back to the Haber-Bosch process invented in early 1900 to convert inert gaseous N2  to reactive forms that could be easily transformed for use in synthetic fertilizers. Today, the Haber-Bosch process adds an additional 120 Tg N year− 1  into the environment with the goal of increasing crop production (IFA, 2016 ). In addition, biological N fixation (BNF) by leguminous and non-leguminous crops has added another 30–51 Tg of reactive N to the atmosphere (Herridge et al., 2008 ; Ladha et al., 2016a ). Nitrogen is the most essential nutrient in crop production. In addition to synthetic fertilizers and BNF, N is made available through organic sources and atmospheric deposition. In the subsistence agriculture of the pre-Haber-Bosch era, BNF and manures were the primary sources of NR . In today's intensive agricultural systems, synthetic N has become increasingly crucial. Although NR  has helped in contributing to human dietary needs, there are still large areas in the world that are short of available N to achieve food and nutritional security (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012 ; Ciceri and Allanore, 2019 ; Pradhan et al., 2015 ). This, together with increasing and changing dietary demands, indicates that the future demand for NR  will substantially grow to meet the anticipated population of 9.7 billion people by the middle of the century (FAO, 2018 ; Rivas and Nonhebel, 2017 ). The other side of N cycling is that nearly half of the fertilizer N applied in agriculture is leaked into the environment resulting in various negative environmental externalities (Canfield et al., 2010 ; Galloway et al., 2008 ; Phoenix et al., 2006 ; Schlesinger, 2009 ; Vitousek et al., 2009 ), with the possibility that we have transgressed the sustainable planetary “boundary” for N (Steffen et al., 2015 ). When applied in excess, reactive forms of N (ammonia, nitrate, nitrogen oxides) are lost to the environment through volatilization, leaching or emissions (Battye et al., 2017 ; Sutton et al., 2013 ) causing multiple adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic systems and on human health (Table 1  ). Fertilizer N is held responsible for a nearly 20% increase in atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2 O) since the industrial revolution (Park et al., 2012 ). Notably, more anthropogenic N has been released to the environment than CO2  during recent decades (Fig. 1  ), leading Battye et al. (2017)  to ask whether “nitrogen is the next carbon?” The challenge of N management globally is to provide enough NR  to meet global food security while minimizing the flow of unused N to the environment. One of the key approaches to address such challenges is to improve the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) which not only enhances crop productivity but also minimizes environmental losses through careful agronomic management, and measures to improve soil quality over time. Recognizing the importance of N, proposals have been made to include NUE as an indicator for measuring the progress toward the SDGs (Zhang et al., 2015 ). Also, recently the General Assembly of the UN Environment Programme has passed a resolution toward development of a globally coherent approach of sustainable N management (United Nations, 2019 ). NUE is however a complex term involving more than one component. There are also multiple quantification methods and measurements. NUE is commonly regarded as the ratio of N output (e.g., crop biomass at harvest, or economic yield as dry biomass, or N content) to inputs (N supply as synthetic N, or synthetic plus other sources of N such as manure, BNF, deposition) (see Section 5  for details). In addition, the term of N surplus, which is the difference between N input and N output, can be used to estimate N losses to the environment. Since soil organic N can reach a near steady state with long-term cropping (Allison, 1955 ; Stevenson, 1982 ), N surplus can be considered as an index of N loss (EU Nitrogen Expert Panel, 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Nitrogen management is among the most widely and intensively studied topics in contemporary agronomy because of its crucial importance in food production and environment. The topic has resulted in several major reviews to develop synthesis and various global scenarios at micro- to macro-levels (Cassman et al., 2003 ; Dobermann and Cassman, 2004 ; Ladha et al., 2005, 2016b ; Raun et al., 1999 ; Sylvester-Bradley and Kindred, 2009 ). In comparison to other crops, the major cereals (maize, rice, and wheat) that provide the bulk of food calories and protein consumed by humans either directly as grain or indirectly through livestock products, are produced using about 50% of synthetic fertilizer N produced today (Heffer and Prud'homme, 2016 ). Here, we review the latest available information and make the case that sustainable management of N is requisite to achieving most of the SDGs. We attempt to update more recent works and present four regional case studies with sub-optimal to optimal and excess use of synthetic N. We consider an aggregated N budgeting approach to quantify all sources of N other than the synthetic N only, as key components of NUE and discuss strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of NR  on the environment. We also updated methods used for the projection of N requirements for cereal production in 2050 that could be useful for policy makers and development planners to ensure sufficient global food production while significantly reducing the environmental impact.  2 Sustainable development goals and fertilizer N The United Nation's 2030 Agenda for sustainable development includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that address poverty, hunger, health, hygiene, climate, and resource consumption to ensure global economic, social and environmental well-being. Considering the interdependency and multidimensional nature of these issues, which can be both synergistic and antagonistic, a holistic and integrated approach is needed to mitigate trade-offs to achieve the SDGs (Pradhan, 2019 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Agriculture is one of the key sectors contributing to the SDGs. Investing in agriculture is considered crucial to reduce poverty (SDG 1: End Poverty in all its forms everywhere ), eliminate hunger (SDG 2: Zero Hunger ) and improve health (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being ). Given that NR  plays a critical role not only in increasing food production to meet the growing demand, but also in contributing to an excess of NR  resulting in terrestrial, atmospheric and aquatic pollution, the challenge in achieving appropriate N management is closely related to most SDGs. The flow of NR  through agricultural production processes, consumption and food waste management is directly or indirectly linked with numerous SDGs, positively or negatively. In this section, we map how different components of NR  flows relate to various SDGs (Fig. 2  ) based on existing literature (Dobermann, 2016 ; Kanter et al., 2006 ). For simplifying the diagram, we do not provide the directionality and strength of the linkages. In Section 7 , we provide a detailed account of regional differences in N management and steps necessary to improve the management of N to contribute to the SDGs. The crucial link between food security and nutrient management, particularly N has been widely recognized. Over the past century, application of N fertilizer has been identified as one of the most important interventions contributing to the crop production. Appropriate N management also enhances yield and can contribute to long-term improvements in soil fertility. Apart from affecting crop biomass production through the photosynthetic process, N also influences the cereal nutritional quality through its effect on the grain protein content (Kaizzi et al., 2012 ). Over the past century, N fertilizer has been described as a crucial input for attaining maximum yield potential and contributor to the nourishment of 46% of today's global population by enhancing grain production (Erisman et al., 2007 ). Increases in global cereal production and food supply show strong linear relationships with nitrogenous fertilizer use (Fig. 3  ). However, synthesis of N to produce N fertilizer requires a considerable amount of energy and industrial infrastructure (Ramírez and Worrell, 2006 ). Adequate transport infrastructure well developed markets, and often-additional incentives are also required so that farmers can have access to the synthetic fertilizer. As such, this component of NR  is linked with SDG 7 (Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy ) and SDG 9 (Industry Innovation and resilient Infrastructure ). In developing countries, around two billion people live and work as small and marginal farmers with an income less than USD $2 a day (WDR, 2008 ). Economic growth focusing on agriculture and closing yield gaps is an effective option to reduce poverty, and to ensure food security to small and marginal farmers. In conventional production systems, application of N fertilizer is crucial to increase crop productivity and closing the yield gaps (Mueller et al., 2012 ; Pradhan et al., 2015 ). These outcomes are directly connected with SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3 and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Sustainable Economic Growth ). For example, the link between low fertilizer N use and poor food grain production is prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) whose share in world N consumption is only 1.5%. Too little N use in food grain production in these countries (cultivated soils in 80% of SSA have negative N balance) has been identified as one of the major factors behind low crop productivity that leads to food insecurity and malnutrition (Masso et al., 2017 ). Indirectly, increased yield could be an incentive to limit agricultural expansion that in some cases could release degraded land for nature (Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011 ), which links to SDG 15 (Life on Land ). Increased production resulting from N fertilizer can also support livestock feeding and productivity (Pradhan et al., 2013 ), linking to the SDG 1, SDG 8, and SDG 15. Enhancing agricultural production, however, could also have negative impacts on other SDGs. Excess application of N fertilizer is a major contributor of NR  flow to environment (Bodirsky et al., 2014 ). Townsend et al. (2003)  has reported that excessive NR  in air and water are linked to problems associated with human health mainly, respiratory ailments, cardiac disease, and several cancers. Therefore, NR  flow can also negatively influence progress toward SDG 3. Studies from United States show that people can be exposed to NR  in drinking water due to intensive agriculture (Ward, 2009 ) which compromises SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation ). Use of excess N fertilizer is one of major contributors of elevated emissions of N2 O contributing to air pollution in urban areas and climate change (Townsend et al., 2003 ). Therefore, enhancing NUE through improved N management is crucial not only for food and nutritional security (Garnett et al., 2013 ) thus contributing to SDGs 1, 2 and 3, but also to sustainable environment (Sapkota et al., 2017 ; Wollenberg et al., 2016 ) thus enabling SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities ) and SDG 13 (Climate Action ). Leakage of NR  to aquatic ecosystem not only contaminates drinking water supplies but also contribute to eutrophication, resulting in harmful algal blooms and dead zones in marine ecosystems (Conley et al., 2009 ). This nutrient pollution is a challenge for attaining SDG 14 (Life below Water ). Terrestrial ecosystems, whose productivity is mostly constrained due to N limitations, are also disturbed by anthropogenic NR  deposition (LeBauer and Treseder, 2008 ), directly connecting NR  flow with SDG 15. Indirectly, emissions of N2 O from livestock farm, food waste, landfill and sewage, contributing to climate change (SDG 13), are linked with N fertilizer. On the other hand, proper management of NR  flow during production, consumption and waste management is directly related to SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption ).  3 Nitrogen budget in global agriculture Since there is a continual loss of some amount of reactive N from all agroecosystems, an important question arises as to whether the system is reaching an N disequilibrium. An agroecosystem would be in N equilibrium if the sum of N inputs equalled the sum of N outputs meaning that the soil is neither a net sink nor a net source of N. Major  N inputs include synthetic fertilizer, manures, crop residue recycling, BNF and deposition. Whereas the N outputs are through crop (grain and/or biomass) harvest and losses in various forms. Constructing N budgets is the key to (i) improving our understanding of N transformation and N transfers, and (ii) quantify the size of various N reservoirs that are ultimately needed to conserve N from transformations and biological processes, which may accelerate the losses and the pollution (Legg and Meisinger, 1982 ). Numerous efforts have been made to construct N budgets, but most have been limited to pots, greenhouse, lysimeter, and small-scale field studies. Far fewer studies integrate the loss and gain processes, and attempt to estimate N budgets at the landscape, food production system or at global scale. A few researchers have attempted to quantify global N budgets although there were several limitations in the methodologies used (Oenema et al., 2003 ). Among them Allison (1955) , Greenland and Watanabe (1982) , Hauck and Tanji (1982) , and Legg and Meisinger (1982)  are important in the past, and Bouwman et al. (2011) , Liu et al. (2010) , Meisinger et al. (2008) , and Smil (1999)  are in the recent past. More than 50 years ago, Allison (1955)  highlighted the lack of data to construct accurate budgets and referred to “the failure of a N budget to balance” as an enigma. Greenland and Watanabe (1982)  identified three difficulties associated with the origin of the enigma: difficulty in measuring (1) the change in total N content of a given mass of soil, (2) the amount of N added to the soil-plant system by BNF, and (3) losses of N from a soil-plant system. Since then, major progress has been made in all three areas identified by Greenland and Watanabe (1982) , and relatively accurate numbers of various components of N gains and N losses have been generated to construct N budgets in agricultural systems (Bouwman et al., 2011 ; Galloway et al., 2003 ; Herridge et al., 2008 ; Ladha et al., 2005, 2011, 2016a ; Lassaletta et al., 2014 ; Liu et al., 2010 ; Smil, 1999 ). Table 2   summarizes N budget (input and outputs) estimations carried out for (a) all arable crops (Liu et al., 2010 ; Smil, 1999 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ), and (b) three globally important cereals (maize, rice and wheat; Ladha et al., 2011 ). Excepting synthetic N as an input and crop harvest as an output both of which have relatively more accurate estimations, uncertainties remain in the estimations of other N flows. Given the different approaches of N budgeting used by various studies, a useful comparison of absolute amounts of inputs and outputs among studies is not appropriate. Nevertheless, the trends are reasonably similar. Synthetic N has been the major source of N applied to meet 50–57% of total N requirement of cropland and pasture lands globally (Table 2 ). Of the 43–50% of N coming from other sources, BNF contributed approximately 43–44%, whereas deposition 36%, manure 34%, and crop residue 30% are the rest. Among the outputs, crop harvest ranged from 36% to 42% and losses from 57% to 64%. Recently, Ladha et al. (2016a)  constructed a top-down global N budget for maize, rice, and wheat. Of the 100 Tg of synthetic N, approximately 50% is currently used in the cultivation of three major cereals (maize, 16%; rice, 16%; and wheat, 18%) globally. The N budget sheet for maize, rice, and wheat was developed for a 50-year period (1961–2010) by integrating global quantities of various sources and sinks of N, which were easier to estimate, rather than assessing N losses, which are highly location and management specific. A total of 1551 Tg of N were harvested by these cereals during the period, of which 48% was derived from fertilizer N source. Around 4% was contributed through net soil depletion (Fig. 4  ). The major source of this N is apparently derived from the ecosystem service of non-symbiotic biological N2  fixation by free-living bacteria and cyanobacteria, contributing 25% of total N in the crop, which is equal to 13, 22, and 13 kg N ha− 1  year− 1  for maize, rice, and wheat, respectively (Ladha et al., 2016a ). Other non-fertilizer and non-soil sources include manure (14%) and atmospheric deposition (6%), while crop residues and seed contribute marginally (2% and 1%, respectively) to crop N supply. These finding highlight the need to consider all sources of N [synthetic, manure/residue, deposition, symbiotic and non-symbiotic BNF and indigenous soil organic nitrogen (SON)] when designing strategies to improve the NUE.  4 Role of fertilizer N in maintaining N balance in cultivated soils Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key indicator of soil fertility. It represents an energy source for heterotrophs, and is an important source of plant nutrients, particularly but not exclusively for N in the form of SON. However, SON changes with cultivation and fertilizer N inputs; normally, it decreases with cultivation without N fertilization and may increase with N fertilizer amendment (Brye et al., 2003 ). Careful management to increase SOM is therefore crucial in the management of soluble plant nutrients, which are in turn linked to carbon and N cycles (Drinkwater and Snapp, 2007 ). Potentially, there can be two mechanisms whereby N fertilizer affects SON: (i) N fertilizer may augment SON (Campbell et al., 2000 ; Glendining and Powlson, 1995 ) by promoting plant growth, and thereby increasing the amount of litter added to the soil through root and stubble compared with the soil not receiving N, and (ii) N fertilizer may lead to enhanced loss of SON by accelerating its rate of oxidation or decay of litter and indigenous organic materials (Khan et al., 2007 ; Mulvaney et al., 2009 ; Powlson et al., 2010 ). There has been debate whether synthetic N fertilizer leads to enhanced loss of SOM and subsequent reduction in SON by accelerating its rate of oxidation, or decay of litter and indigenous organic materials (Khan et al., 2007 ; Mulvaney et al., 2009 ; Powlson et al., 2010 ). The answer is not simple, and requires consideration of the soil type and cropping system. Where synthetic fertilizer N does encourage a decrease SON, a spiral of decline in soil ecosystem functioning and crop productivity would be expected. It is, therefore, important to determine whether the long-term use of synthetic fertilizer N does indeed lead to a general decline in SON. These issues prompted Drinkwater and Snapp (2007) , to suggest an ecosystem-based approach to nutrient management in which both organic nutrients and mineral reserves are built-up and maintained over time to provide slow and sustained release in addition to pulses of soluble, fertilizer-based N sources. Using data from 135 studies of 114 cereal-based long-term experiments, located at 100 sites throughout the world over time scales of decades under a range of land-management and climate regimes, Ladha et al. (2011)  quantified changes in total soil N with continuous cultivation and fertilization. Published data of a total of 580 observations for soil N, from control (unfertilized or zero-N) and synthetic N-fertilized treatments, were analyzed using the SAS mixed model and by meta-analysis. Under zero-N input conditions, soil N declined by 11%, but when synthetic N was applied, soil N decreased by only 4%. It is of importance to consider the time N ratio, which is based on changes in the paired comparisons (Ladha et al., 2011 ). Based on overall average, SON was 10% higher with synthetic fertilizer N than with zero-N. In general, SON declined over time with cultivation from the initial to final sampling period with or without the application of synthetic N. However, the decline in SON was less with synthetic N fertilization. Based on these findings, it could be concluded that the long-term use of synthetic fertilizer N leads to a slower rate of decline in SON content compared with no use of synthetic N. As the use of synthetic N leads to an increase in crop growth (Cassman et al., 2002 ), an increase in C and N input in the soil is expected, a key driver for increased SOM and SON (Glendining and Powlson, 1995 ). These findings concur with the conclusions of Powlson et al. (2010) , who argued that the long-term use of synthetic fertilizer N led to a slower decrease, and possible increase, in SOM content compared with zero input of synthetic fertilizer N. At the macro or global scale, there are a few estimates of the changes in soil N with continuous cultivation and N fertilization. Smil (1999)  in his estimation during the mid-1990, reported N accumulation of 4 Tg in arable soils globally. On the contrary, Liu et al. (2010)  reported a negative soil N balance of 11.53 Tg (equivalent to ~ 11 kg of N ha− 1  year− 1 ) in the year 2000. However, a large variability in soil N change (depletion or accumulation) has been reported across regions (Liu et al., 2010 ). On the other hand, Ladha et al. (2016a)  based on a meta-analysis of large number of global long-term experiments, estimated a negative N balance of 32 and 62 Tg in maize and wheat, respectively, and a positive N balance of 26 Tg in rice over 50 years (1960–2010). Since the soil N changes, on annual basis, were rather small in these N balance studies, it appears that major cereal production agroecosystems are largely at N equilibrium or at near steady state.  5 Nitrogen use indicators and framework to assess N use efficiency and N surplus Budgeting of N is a not only a useful book-keeping exercise considering all inputs/outputs and change in soil N but also reflects and quantifies N cycling in a crop/soil system. However, N budgeting may not always serve the purpose of evaluating N management strategies aiming to improve N use and reduce N leakage. An “umbrella” metric NUE is very commonly used to broadly compare agronomic, physiological and environmental consequences of N use in an agroecosystem. Although NUE is estimated using N budget components, it is a complex term involving more than one component with several ways that efficiency can be measured and expressed (Ladha et al., 2005 ). It is commonly regarded as a ratio that considers an output variable (biological or economic yield as dry biomass or their N content) as the numerator, and an input variable (N supply from synthetic fertilizer or from all the sources such as synthetic fertilizer, manure/residue N, deposition and BNF) as the denominator. Three efficiency ratios are most widely used to quantify NUE (Table 3  ): (1) agronomic efficiency [AEN ], defined as the ratio of yield to N supply, (2) recovery efficiency [REN ], defined as the ratio of plant N to N supply, and (3) physiological or internal efficiency [PEN ], defined as the ratio of yield to plant N (Cassman et al., 2002 ; Craswell and Godwin, 1984 ; Dobermann, 2007 ; Fixen et al., 2015 ; Hirel et al., 2007 ; Novoa and Loomis, 1981 ). Under these three broad parameters, Ladha et al. (2005)  derived 18 possible NUE terms which included all ways in which NUE can be expressed in the literature. However, these three NUE terms are most frequently used and often considered N output (crop yield or crop N) and N input from added synthetic N. The crop yield and crop N are the differences between a synthetic N-fertilized plot and a control non N-fertilized plot. Recently, Martinez-Feria et al. (2018)  proposed an additional index referred to as system NUE (sNUE) aimed to link crop- and soil-based efficiencies. The sNUE is a ratio of NUEcrop  [crop N harvest as output/all N inputs (synthetic and others) to NUEsoil  [(crop N harvest + N loss)/all N inputs]. Therefore, sNUE is a ratio of output/output [crop N harvest/(crop N harvest + N loss)] and interpreted as the fraction of system N outputs that are captured as N yield rather than lost to the environment. Based on this framework, an ideal cropping system would be net neutral with respect to N supply-removal (i.e., NUEcrop  = 1) and a soil N in equilibrium (i.e., NUEsoil  = 1) and therefore a tight N cycling (i.e., sNUE = 1). This proposed framework is essentially constructed using the basics of N budgeting and considers N recovery efficiency ratios (NUEcrop  and NUEsoil ) (Table 3 ).The term N surplus, which is the difference of N input and N output, has been suggested to estimate N loss to the environment. N surplus estimates assume that soil N has reached equilibrium (Zhang et al., 2015 ). N surplus, also termed as the N balance approach, is attractive because it is simple to calculate, easily understood, and is based on easily available farm data (McLellan et al., 2018 ). They examined relationship between N surplus (synthetic N applied minus N removed in harvested grain) and yield-scaled N losses (either N2 O or NO3 ) based on published field studies, and total losses (NH3 , N2 , N2 O, NOx, and NO3  leaching) based on a model simulations. The relationship between N surplus and yield-scaled N losses indicates when N supply exceeds crop uptake requirements, excess N becomes vulnerable to loss, and N loss rates can increase with higher amounts of excess fertilizer. McLellan et al. (2018)  concluded that N surplus is a robust indicator of potential environmental N losses associated with N inputs applied in crop production. The index of sNUE proposed by Martinez-Feria et al. (2018)  is on the other hand inversely related to the yield-scaled N losses metric used by McLellan et al. (2018) . The EU N Expert Panel (2015)  conceptualized a NUE framework which is also based on an N output-to-input ratio. The framework may be useful for policy makers to examine differences in NUE between farms, between specific systems, and between countries. The panel proposed a two-dimensional input and output diagram to show system performance in relation to NUE, N output in harvested produce and N surplus (or loss), together with possible target and reference values (Fig. 5  ). While including all the sources of N inputs is considered important, direct measurements of some of the sources such as BNF and deposition are often not possible due to methodological constraints and are commonly omitted from NUE estimates. We used 50-year global N budget datasets developed for maize, rice and wheat (Ladha et al., 2016a ) to examine the NUE framework proposed by EU N Expert Panel. Our results show large differences in the input/output analysis when considering synthetic fertilizer N vis-à-vis  all potential sources of N (Fig. 6  ). When considering only synthetic N, the outputs were close to 90% NUE (Fig. 6 A); however, when considering all potential sources of N (synthetic fertilizer, manure, residue, deposition, BNF, SON), outputs declined to 50% NUE (Fig. 6 B). In addition, the thresholds of N output target and that of surplus N target were different for major cereals. Our estimates of N outputs were 112, 82 and 78 kg ha− 1  for maize, rice and wheat, respectively. Conversely, N surplus estimates were 51, 73 and 49 kg N ha− 1  when considered only synthetic N, and 98, 111 and 81 kg N ha− 1  for maize, rice and wheat, respectively, when considered all the sources of N (Ladha et al., 2016a ).This suggests that the specific crop-wise NUE target and reference values should be considered to avoid misleading the planning. One difficulty inherent in N budget-based indices is the challenge of precisely measuring changes in total soil N (Vallis, 1972 ) to establish that the soil is in equilibrium and not a net sink or a net source. Also, there are difficulties in measuring outputs from losses and inputs from BNF and both wet and dry deposition. Although simulation models have been used to estimate some of the inputs and N losses, they are likely to have errors. Another problem often overlooked is the multiplication of errors associated with the summation of the N inputs and outputs in an estimated N balance (square root of the sum of squares of each error) when analyzed using parametric statistics.  6 Global N recovery efficiencies and release of surplus N to the environment Trials conducted globally in a wide diversity of maize, rice and wheat agroecosystems show NUE (synthetic fertilizer N recoveries or REN  calculated as kg crop N harvest in N-fertilized plot minus kg crop N in non N-fertilized plot divided by kg fertilizer N applied) ranging between 0.20 and 0.90 (Ladha et al., 2005 ). As expected, many of the studies that obtained large values of REN  used relatively lower N rates in a cropping season. The review of globally published data during last decades showed that the average REN  across all regions and crops was 7% lower when estimated by the nitrogen-15 (15 N) dilution method than by the N-difference method (Krupnik et al., 2004 ; Ladha et al., 2005 ). Additionally, 6.5% of applied N (residual N) was made available to subsequent crops during five growing seasons as determined by 15 N fertilizer recovery (IAEA, 2003 ). With an average 15 N fertilizer recovery (RE15 N) of 0.44 in the first growing season (Ladha et al., 2005 ), the total crop recovery of 15 N fertilizer, including the recovery by the five subsequent crops, is approximately 0.50. Since the reported recovery efficiency data or estimates in the above studies largely came from researchers' trials where crop management is usually optimal and efficiencies tend to be higher than compared with those in farmers' fields where crop management is often economically constrained and agronomically sub-optimal (Ladha et al., 2005 ). Rarely has REN  been measured in fields that are fully managed by farmers themselves, except by a few attempts in fully irrigated and well-managed on-farm rice fields in Asia (Dobermann et al., 2004 ). The REN  estimates of 0.31 kg N harvest derived from kg− 1  fertilizer N applied in on-farm assessments were smaller by 25% than the average REN  values of 0.41 determined in researcher-managed plots in farmers' fields (Dobermann et al., 2004 ). Ladha et al. (2016a)  also suggested efficiency in farmers' fields to be 25% lower than researchers' trials, indicative of substantial N losses. They used global average of 0.47 of three cereals (0.56 maize, 0.36 rice and 0.48 wheat) after including the fraction of N allocated to roots and stubbles. The global REN  averages of cereals (maize, rice and wheat) of 0.55 based on the N-difference method and 0.50 based on the 15 N-dilution method reported by Krupnik et al. (2004)  and Ladha et al. (2005)  compared well with the other published NUE (calculated as kg crop N harvest in fertilized plot divided by kg sum of all sources of N inputs) in all food crops: 0.50 by Smil (1999) , 0.57 by Sheldrick et al. (2002) , and 0.59 by Liu et al. (2010)  at a global scale, and 0.52 and 0.56 by Howarth et al. (2002)  and Janzen et al. (2003)  for the United States and Canada, respectively. However, Bouwman et al. (2005)  reported a value of 0.43. Ladha and Chakraborty (2016)  estimated N surplus (fertilizer N input minus crop N derived from fertilizer) of 848 Tg of fertilizer N for 50 years (1961–2010) in maize, rice and wheat crops. For 2010, N surplus (Tg) for maize, rice and wheat were 7.7, 10.0 and 9.8, respectively. Fertilizer nitrogen surplus when expressed as kg N ha− 1  showed curvilinear trends over 50 years, but with two apparently different phases (Fig. 7  ). The rate of N surplus (kg ha− 1 ) increased steadily until around 1990s then the rate of increase was smaller thereafter. Until 1990, maize and rice had faster rates of increase in N surplus from an average of 8.0 to 43.1 kg N ha− 1  in maize (average slope, 1.37 kg ha− 1  year− 1 ) and 10.4 to 54.2 kg N ha− 1  in rice (average slope, 1.72 kg N ha− 1  year− 1 ), than surplus in wheat which increased from 5.3 to 31.3 kg N ha− 1  (average slope of 1.0 kg ha− 1  year− 1 ). During last two decades, N surplus from the three cereal systems appears to have reduced a little, and the rate of increase was 0.5, 1.0 and 0.9 kg ha− 1  year− 1  with an average of 44.5, 59.1and 37.4 kg N ha− 1  in maize, rice and wheat, respectively. This could be because of adoption of better N management resulting in improvements in crop NUE. On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2015)  estimated global averages of NUE (calculated as kg crop N harvest in fertilized plot divided by kg sum of all sources of N inputs) of 0.46 for maize, 0.38 for rice and 0.43 for wheat. Their estimates of N surplus (inputs minus outputs) were 15, 18 and 17 Tg year− 1 . It is important to note that Zhang et al. (2015)  used the sum of all N removed in harvest crop biomass as outputs and the sum of all N sources as inputs in their NUE expression.  7 Regional differences in N use and the sustainable development goals With the conflicting dual role of N on agricultural systems and the environment—both positive and negative—the N challenge is highly relevant across most SDGs as described in Section 2  (Fig. 2 ). The human use of NR  has profound beneficial and detrimental impacts. Its beneficial impacts result in food production and industrial applications. Detrimental impacts occur because most of the NR  used in food production and the entire amount of NR  formed during fossil fuel combustion are lost to the environment where it causes a cascade of environmental changes that can adversely affect both the people and the planet. Nitrogen influences the SDGs via a complex array of interactions that operate through climate systems, food production, human and ecosystem health, the provision of ecosystem services. Whereas in some cases these interactions involve trade-offs—the most obvious being the need to increase N (in regions with currently too little or sub-optimal use of N) to meet SDGs 1, 2, 3, 8, and 15 while reducing N in regions with current excess use to support SDG 13 and others (SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, 14 and 15) (Fig. 8  , Table 4  ). Additionally, meeting some of SDGs can also enable optimum N application (Kanter et al., 2006 ). For example, quality education, women's empowerment, reduction in social inequalities, resolution of conflicts, and global partnerships can encourage farmers to move from too little or imbalanced fertilizer to a more agronomically optimum and economically sound rate. We provide an elaborated discussion about these SDGs in Section 7.3 . Increasing agricultural production through better access to fertilizers and sustainable intensification practices can help to alleviate poverty (SDG 1) and inequality (SDG 10). There are many regions in the world where more nutrients are needed to arrest land degradation and increase crop productivity. Where fertilizer is added to a degraded land, it has an enormous trickle-down effect for poverty reduction and health improvement (SDG 1 and SDG 3). In the early stages of development, the most consistently effective methods to reduce poverty and improve equality involve the agricultural sector, particularly through methods that raise smallholder farm productivity (Deininger and Byerlee, 2011 ). Nitrogen is clearly instrumental here. In agricultural systems with too little use of N, there tends to be a continual loss of soil productivity and consequent land degradation (SDG 15). Because it is small farmers that often lack access to N, exempting unique farming systems such as continually flooded rice (Greenland, 1997 ), their yields decline year after year, reducing annual income and thus exacerbating inequality within the global food system. This pushes farmers down into a poverty trap (SDG 2). In extreme cases, degraded and unproductive land will result in a situation in which farmers have little other choice than to go in search of new, more fertile land on which crops can be more reliably raised. Consequential land clearing can have important impacts on GHG emissions in addition to biodiversity (Neldner, 2018 ). We propose that the driving link between N and the SDGs is through optimal N use and efficiency, closely aligned with SDG 12, “responsible consumption and production .” By supporting SDG 12 through sustainable N management, pathways toward positive feedback affecting the other SDGs that are currently comprised by too little or imbalanced N use may be realized. 7.1 Too little or sub-optimal use of N Wide variation exists globally in fertilizer N use. For example, SSA accounts for only 1.5% of world fertilizer consumption applied at an average rate of 13 kg N ha− 1 . This contrasts with China that consumes ca. 30% of annual global fertilizer, applied at a rate of 242 kg N ha− 1  (FAOSTAT, 2018 ). There are also some regions of Latin America and Asia where inadequate N levels have been observed as well. Across much of SSA, sub-optimal use of fertilizer results in low N harvest (yield) leading to poor human nutrition (Ciceri and Allanore, 2019 ). Because N inputs are low, N surplus is also low (Table 4 ). Since NUE is expressed as an output-input ratio of N, the resulting value for SSA is high, indicating a situation in which already infertile soils are further mined of their nutrients. In these regions, improved access to fertilizer N, together with improved crop and soil resource (organic matter) management will be critical to ending poverty (SDG 1), eliminating hunger (SDG 2), improving health and well-being (SDG 3), fostering economic growth (SDG 8) and reducing land degradation (SDG 15).  7.2 Imbalanced or excess use of N The flip side of the low rates of fertilizer used in much of SSA is that of its excess use in countries like China and some cropping systems in parts of India. While these locations are generally associated with higher productivity (N harvest), farming systems often result in large N surplus (Table 4 ). This surplus N leads to losses through leaching/runoff, denitrification and volatilization, and through contributions to groundwater contamination, eutrophication of freshwater and estuarine ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, soil acidification and degradation. Excessive leakage of reactive nitrogen to environment has direct and potentially severe consequences on SDGs related to public health (SDG 3), drinking water (SDG 6), urban air quality (SDG 11), climate (SDG 13), and aquatic (SDG 14) and terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15). N lost to environment is also linked with inefficient use of energy consumed during production of N fertilizer. Thus, surplus N also indirectly undermines SDG 7. Fertilizer N is responsible for more than 30% of agriculturally-related N2 O emissions—a potent GHG with a global warming potential 265–298 times that of CO2  for a 100-year timescale (IPCC, 2014 ). When considered in terms of global N2 O emissions, agriculture in turn contributes around 60% of all emissions (Foley et al., 2011 ). Approximately 70% of fertilizer-related N2 O emissions derive from countries with rapidly developing economies such as China and India, where fertilizer consumption rates have grown rapidly for reasons including heavy fertilizer N subsidies, while crop yield responses to N have declined with large losses to the environment (Foley et al., 2011 ; Lassaletta et al., 2014 ). Although India has a total surplus N of nearly half of that of China (18 vis-à-vis 38 Tg N ha− 1  year− 1 ), total inputs are also about half of that of China (25 vis-à-vis 51 Tg N ha− 1  year− 1 ) suggesting nearly similar NUE (Table 4 ).  7.3 Balanced use of N Effectively targeted policies have resulted in a decline or reversal of growth in fertilizer N use in Europe and North America (USA and Canada), while crop N harvests—primarily for cereals—have continued to improve (Table 4 ). This has resulted in an increasing trend of NUE and thereby lower N surpluses (Table 4 ). The Netherlands provides a good example of policy makers acknowledging problems of N excess, and thereby collectively acting to improve the effectiveness of well-targeted policies to implement better N management practices. Since the adoption of policies aimed at increasing NUE, fertilizer use in the Netherlands declined to the same level as in the 1960s, while yields have doubled in the same period (Lassaletta et al., 2014 ). Avoiding unnecessarily high N rates is important to reduce N2 O emissions given the exponential or hyperbolic N2 O response to fertilizer N application rates (Kim et al., 2013 ; Shcherbak et al., 2014 ; Van Groenigen et al., 2010 ), although others have found the relationship to be linear (Hoben et al., 2010 ; Lebender et al., 2014 ; Liu et al., 2010 ; Ma et al., 2010 ) and even asymptotic, depending on the crops, soil types and locations considered (Albanito et al., 2017 ). While at some point saturation could be reached, differences in relationships are partially an artifact of the equation used to fit the data, in addition to the large variability in the available data. Some SDGs could also provide enabling conditions for optimum application of N. SDG 4 (Quality Education ), covering formal, non-formal and adult education systems, is a key component that is positively related to efficient use of N. For example, Huffman (1974)  highlighted positive association between farmers' education and increasingly optimal N application rates. Non-formal education and vocational trainings in formats such as field days and farmer field schools, which encourage farmers to experiment with new crop management practices (Waddington et al., 2014 ), can assist farmers in moving toward N sustainability. However, additional efforts and supportive policy are needed to assist farmers in transitioning into new management regimes. Similarly, empowering women, by providing them the access to resources, and agency to make agricultural decisions, can play a pivotal role in sustainable agricultural intensification (Farnworth et al., 2017 ), which is connected to SDG 5 (Gender Equality ). If able to access similar resources as men, studies show that yields on farms managed by women in developing nations could increase by 20–30% (Dobermann et al., 2013 ). This productivity gain comes partly from the efficient use of N, including other management factors. In regions with inadequate application of nutrients, adequate infrastructure including transport and industry is required to enhance access and encourage farmers to manage their fertilizer application rate at more optimum levels (Ciceri and Allanore, 2019 ; Pradhan et al., 2015 ). Moreover, clean energy is also essential to limit the environmental footprint of N fertilizer production. Thus, SDGs 7 and 9 can also enable optimum application of N. Another reason under application of N by farmers in some regions includes social inequalities. For example, Gilbert (2012)  comments that African farmers often pay twice as much for fertilizer as European farmers, leading to a lower application of N in resource-constrained farming systems and where soil quality is typically poor. Therefore, addressing SDG 10 to improve social equity and justice in development efforts can also contribute to efficient use of N. Additionally, poor agricultural practices, low levels of resource and N management can also contribute to poverty traps in which violence and conflicts may result (Taeb, 2004 ). Addressing SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions ) with emphasis on agriculture could benefit by working to achieve optimal N application, that when combined with other improved management and supportive policies and markets, could help to reduce conflict. Overall, SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals ) is very important to address unbalanced N management. For example, efforts to popularize best agronomic management practices and use of appropriate technologies can contribute to SDG 17’s knowledge and technology transfer component (Kanter et al., 2006 ).   8 Case studies 8.1 A case of too little: Sub-Saharan Africa 8.1.1 Regional context Agriculture continues to be an essential instrument for sustainable development, rural poverty reduction and food and nutrition security in SSA (AGRA, 2014, 2016 ). Thus, too little N use means low agricultural productivity, poor human nutrition and soil degradation which all impact negatively on poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SGD 2) and human nutrition (SDG 3). About 80% of food production in SSA comes from smallholders whose productivity remains below that required to achieve the SDGs for food security and poverty reduction and lags behind that of other regions of the world (AGRA, 2016 ). On average, a farmer in SSA produces a cereal yield of only 1 t ha− 1 , which is less than one-half, one-fourth and one-fifth of that produced by an Indian, a Chinese and an American farmer, respectively (AGRA, 2014 ; Morris et al., 2007 ). The average fertilizer application rate for croplands in SSA increased to almost 13 kg ha− 1  in the 2008–12 period showing a 74% increase from 1968 to 1972 (AGRA, 2014 ). Disaggregation at the country level shows that most countries fall far short of the 2015 target of 50 kg N ha− 1  set in the 2006 Abuja Declaration with large variations among countries (Sheahan and Barrett, 2017 ). For example, average N application rates of 7.6, 11.5, 23.0, 32.0, 53.1 and 93.9 kg ha− 1  were reported for Niger, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria, respectively (Sheahan and Barrett, 2017 ) (Fig. 9  ). The low rates of fertilizer use results in a vicious cycle of soil nutrient mining, degradation and erosion, low crop yields and reduced resilience to climate variability and change. Over the past 30 years, croplands in SSA have lost an average of 22 kg of N, 2.5 kg of P, and 15 kg of K ha− 1  annually—equivalent to about USD 4 billion worth of fertilizer. Over 80% of the agricultural land is N deficient and most countries now have a negative average N balance ranging between minus 2 kg N ha− 1  in Botswana to minus 67 kg N ha− 1  in Malawi (Masso et al., 2017 ). Additionally, it is important to note that most soils in SSA are deficient in other nutrients especially P. There are environments in SSA where the benefit of more fertilizer N would be small or negligible without an investment in the use of P and potentially even other nutrients besides N, in addition to strong efforts to restore degraded soil quality, particularly organic matter (Buresh et al., 1997 ; Sanchez, 2010 ). Extremely low N and unbalanced nutrient applications to soils led to excessive yield gaps in SSA compared with other parts of the world (FAO, 2017 ). Yields obtained by farmers in SSA are mostly lower than 30% of the rain-fed potential yield of most staple crops (Van Ittersum et al., 2016 ). Soil nutrient mining and resultant soil degradation not only undermine progress with SDGs 1, 2 and 3 but also lead to a cascade of negative impacts on other goals, including health (SDG 3) and gender aspects (SDG 5) (Campbell et al., 2018 ). One example of this relates to the Lake Victoria watershed where the success of the fishing industry has led to an increase in population and associated agricultural activities around the lake including more intensive maize cropping using few inputs and no ground cover (Farnworth et al., 2017 ). This has led to soil degradation and erosion and the release of soil nutrients (N and P), together with increased excreta from livestock and humans, into the lake causing a fivefold increase in algae growth in recent decades (Kolding et al., 2008 ). The loss of biodiversity caused by human-induced eutrophication has impacted on the fishing economy with a decline in fish catch (Kayombo and Jorgensen, 2005 ; Lowe et al., 2000 ) pushing the almost exclusively male fishers to travel further for an ever-smaller catch (Kayombo and Jorgensen, 2005 ; Mojola, 2011 ). An increasing body of research (Béné and Merten, 2008 ; Fiorella et al., 2015 ; Mojola, 2011 ) has shown causal links between the changing ecology of Lake Victoria due to eutrophication, the gendered nature of the fish economy, and human health whereby the transformed ecological environment is reshaping social structures and reorganizing sexual, domestic and economic partnerships in ways that significantly increase their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS (Mojola, 2011 ). Moreover, low yields and poor protein content in food crops due to low available soil N, linked to phosphorus deficiency, may explain the high prevalence of undernourishment in SSA and sub-regions (Fig. 10  ). Although there was a decline between 2000 and 2010, the malnourished population since remained constant (FAO, 2017 ).  8.1.2 From “too little” to “sustainable” N use in SSA Enriching African soils through the sustainable management of organic and inorganic nutrient sources is the key to achieving food and nutritional security, poverty alleviation, economic growth and climate resilient rural livelihoods and associated SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 8 (Fig. 8 ). Sustainable N management in SSA will require an increase in access to and efficiency of use of quality-controlled fertilizer to improve productivity without corresponding increases in GHG intensities and loss of N to the environment. While poor agronomic practices including blanket fertilizer recommendations and unbalanced fertilization are common, there are instances in some countries of efforts to increase NUE by applying the 4R nutrient stewardship principles of (1) the right source of N fertilizer, (2) the right rate, (3) the right timing of application, and (4) the right placement (Majumdar et al., 2016 ). Good, context-specific, agronomic practice such as 4Rs and integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) which highlights, among others, the use of improved seeds, balanced fertilizers, organic inputs and liming, have been shown to double the NUE in SSA (Vanlauwe et al., 2010 ). Socially equitable capacity building and adoption of good agronomic practices that prioritize maintaining soil quality can assist in to improving NUE and attaining the positive impacts needed to achieve many of the SDGs including gender equality (Farnworth et al., 2017 ). Other innovations can then be introduced including the slow release fertilizer technologies (e.g., inhibitors and N coating) although relatively higher costs present a major challenge for resource-poor smallholder farmers in SSA (Masso et al., 2017 ). Diversified cropping systems can also assist in improving soluble fertilizer supplied by farmers in SSA. Deploying large-scale, farmer-managed experiments, Snapp et al. (2010)  for example demonstrated that modest investments in N fertilizer can double maize yields in Malawi. Incorporation of semi-perennial legumes (Cajanus cajan  and Mucuna pruriens ) in rotation with maize however led to similar yield outcomes, but with half of the fertilizer N requirement. These strategies provide a potential avenue to intensify agricultural productivity by marrying biodiversity with rational and affordable fertilizer N application rates, and are likely to be crucial in situations where farmers lack an access to liquid cash to invest in synthetic N. Recently, Ciceri and Allanore (2019)  in a comprehensive review advocated the need for developing a new generation of local and affordable soil-tailored fertilizer materials with a supply chain centered on African conditions. They highlight the need of material-science research on fertilizers which includes (a) agro-minerals, including zeolites, (b) organic fertilizers, and (c) nano-scale micronutrient fertilizers. The authors indicate that developing new generation of local and affordable fertilizers in Africa supported by appropriate fertilizer policy and trade will lead to food self-sufficiency and a considerable progress toward achieving food and nutrition security in the region. Tailoring of fertilizer application based on past manure applications has reportedly increased the fertilizer use efficiency in smallholding farmers' fields in Kenya (Njoroge et al., 2019 ).  8.1.3 Institution and policies influencing Fertilizer N consumption If SSA is to feed an estimated additional 1.3 billion people between 2015 and 2050 (UN ESA, 2015 ), the fundamental issue of low soil N and other nutrients must be addressed, and solutions brought to scale across the continent. With the current level of fertilizer N use in SSA, it will be difficult to achieve at least the first three SDGs in the region. Therefore, there is an urgent need to (a) improve input and output markets, (b) provide access to credit services, and (c) effective extension services to make N fertilizer inputs accessible and profitable to smallholder farmers in SSA, in addition to supporting large-scale efforts to restore degraded soil quality and improve organic matter management (Akpan et al., 2012 ; Masso et al., 2017 ). Moreover, significant N losses still occur in SSA due mainly to deteriorating soil quality including erosion, nutrient leaching, runoff, and poor recovery of nutrients from agricultural residues despite the low N use in food production (Masso et al., 2017 ). Competition between livestock and crop agriculture also presents challenges to the use of residues as a soil amendment or mulch (Valbuena et al., 2012 ). Thus, there is a need to improve the NUE through agronomic and technological innovations, identifying hotspots of N losses to the environment, and informing policy decisions to incentivize good N management. African Governments have brought agriculture back to the top of their development agenda over the last decade, and are investing an increased proportion of their budgets from a growing national revenue base (AGRA, 2016 ). Recently, several Governments have reinstated or revitalized agricultural input subsidy schemes aimed at promoting access to synthetic fertilizers and improved seeds but with variable success (Sheahan and Barrett, 2017 ). Accordingly, efforts to stimulate intelligent use of inputs such as fertilizers and stress tolerant seeds are experiencing some success in maize crop in several countries (Sheahan and Barrett, 2017 ). However, farming in SSA is mainly practiced by resource-poor smallholder farmers and hence barriers such as scarcity and high costs of inputs, poor economic returns on input use, weak output markets, limited financial capacity, and insufficient extension services, among others, have drastically slowed the use of N fertilizers (Akpan et al., 2012 ; Masso et al., 2017 ). Recent studies indicate that country-level factors such as policy differences, explain far more of the predictable variation in agricultural input use decisions than do biophysical, market, farm, or household socioeconomic characteristics across 10 countries in SSA (Sheahan and Barrett, 2017 ). Most countries also do not have clear policies on agricultural use of recycled organic wastes from cities, nutrients recovered from wastewater, and municipal sewage sludge that are much needed to close the loop in relation to N flows (Masso et al., 2017 ).   8.2 A case of imbalance: China 8.2.1 Regional context Imbalanced use of N in China has undermined her environments, as well as the SDGs of 3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15. Synthetic fertilizer N inputs in China has increased about 50-fold from 1961 to 2015 (IFA, 2017 ). Much of the agriculture land of China receives N exceeding 200 kg ha− 1  (Fig. 11  ). Though 45.3% of the total fertilizer has been used for cereal production (Li et al., 2013 ), the cereal production has only increased fivefold, and yields have stagnated over 79%, 56% and 31% of the land area under rice, wheat and maize, respectively (Ray et al., 2012 ). This indicates a dramatic decline in NUE and a soaring increase in loss of N to the environment. China's synthetic fertilizer consumption, increased rapidly after the 1980s. Particularly from 1990s to 2010s, massive government subsidies, encouraging fertilizer policies and low fertilizer prices have led to the widespread over-application of N fertilizers in China (Jiao et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2013 ). During 2000 to 2010, almost 60% of the annual increase in global fertilizer production was in China (IFA, 2012 ). Today the overall consumption of N, P, and K stand at 27.34, 6.05 and 7.25 Tg, which account for 26.3%, 32.3% and 25.9% of the global fertilizer consumption, respectably (IFA, 2017 ). The N fertilizer use in multiple crops in China ranges from 256 to 652 kg ha− 1  year− 1  (Kahrl et al., 2010 ), which far exceeds the internationally recognized standard rate (225 kg ha− 1 ) (Jin and Fang, 2018 ). It was estimated that more than 70% of the double cereal-based crop land in the North China Plain (Taihu region) received two to three times more N than the crop needs (Ju et al., 2009 ). Crop NUE in China declined from 32% in 1980 to 26% in 2005 (Ma et al., 2012 ), which is quite lower than the world average values (40–60%) (Ladha et al., 2005 ). Excessive use of synthetic N in China is associated with a series of environmental issues, such as soil acidification, eutrophication of surface waters, pollution of aquifers, and increased emission of ammonia (NH3 ) and greenhouse gases (notably N2 O, CO2 , and CH4 ) to the atmosphere (Guo et al., 2010 ; Ju et al., 2009 ; Liu et al., 2011 ). It is estimated that the total N losses has been tripled and N2 O emissions has doubled from 1980 to 2005 (Ma et al., 2010 ). By far China is the world's largest emitter of gaseous ammonia (NH3 ), which is mostly attributed to excessive fertilizer N application (Behera et al., 2013 ; Gu et al., 2012 ). During 2001–10, almost 564 Tg CO2  and 10 Tg NR  have been released every year, which caused the total damage costs of 325 billion Chinese Yuan (47 billion US$), equivalent to 1.44% of the GDP of China (Xia et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, total NR  emissions in 2008 related health damage in China was estimated to be 19–62 billion US$ (Gu et al., 2012 ).  8.2.2 From “imbalanced” to “sustainable” N use in China To conserve natural resources and minimize environmental impacts, improvement of NUE will be crucial in grain production in the future decades in China (Zhang et al., 2012 ). Two key strategies have been identified, which are necessary to address these “Imbalanced” challenges (Jiao et al., 2018 ) (Fig. 12  )—(1) enhancing NUE with a zero increase in chemical fertilizer input before 2020, and (2) increasing grain yield and NUE simultaneously for sustainable intensification with integrated nutrient management after 2020. Surveys and several studies suggest that due to many years of over-application of fertilizer, crops can use the soil nutrient pool without any losses in yield (Ju et al., 2009 ). For example, use of N was reduced by 30–60% without influencing grain yield in wheat-maize rotation in North China Plain and wheat-rice rotation in the Tanhu Lake region in the 2000s (Ju et al., 2009 ; Peng et al., 2010 ). The high soil nutrients concentration due to excessive fertilization could even sustain crop growth for several years without further applications because of plants' natural responding mechanism (Bender et al., 2016 ). For reversing the environmental degradation, it is high priority to reduce the application rate of N fertilizer in China (Zhang et al., 2012 ). By the year 2030, China's population is expected to stabilize, but changes in diet, economic development, and increasing concerns for environment pose greater challenges to the future development of agriculture in China. To increase crop production while decreasing fertilizer inputs by implementing more efficient nutrient se strategies is one of the few key solutions in China's agricultural development (Zhang et al., 2013 ). Compared to EU and USA, China's grain yields are low, but excessive applications of chemical fertilizer have left abnormally high amounts of nitrogen in croplands and environments. These challenges call for innovative farming practices and policy reforms to build a more comprehensive agricultural system in achieving the target of “produce more with less.” There is a need to integrate a wide range of methods and practices with a finer level of precision in large farms fields, including but not limiting to: improving crop and planting date decisions to optimize crop rotation management (Chen et al., 2014 ). Some approaches such as the Integrated Soil-crop System Management (ISSM) developed by China Agricultural University (CAU) have shown encouraging results in increasing productivity, reducing N fertilizer inputs, and decreasing N losses and GHG emissions (Chen et al., 2011 ). However, because most croplands are cultivated by smallholders, the adoption of the ISSM Program by the farmers has been a challenge. In China, there are 230 million small householders in rural areas and the average farm size is < 1 ha− 1 , which is nearly 40% of the world's average size of small farms (Huang and Ding, 2016 ). Many farmers across China are unable to obtain updated agricultural information due to the lack of effective extension services (Jiao et al., 2018 ). Integrating knowledge of nutrient management strategies within various social-economic contexts is a key to achieve sustainable intensification for millions of farmers. For example, innovative practices such as Science and Technology Backyard (STB) platforms developed by the CAU in 2009 and tested in several villages in North China Plain have shown success in empowering the small holder famers to close yield gaps while reducing environment footprints (Zhang et al., 2016 ). Surveys showed the importance of farmers' education and training and effective public extension in reducing unnecessary use of N fertilizer in rice, maize and wheat crops (Jia et al., 2013, 2015 ). Recognizing that the current N rates and N management for rice often placed rice yields at a position in the quadratic response function that was beyond the highest yield and in the portion of diminishing yield with added N, the Three Control Technology (TCT) has been developed (Wang et al., 2017a ). The aim is to achieve higher yields through precise N applications in improving the canopy development and reducing disease pressure in rice.  8.2.3 Institutions and policies influencing fertilizer N consumption From 2005, agricultural environmental concerns have been incorporated into China's agricultural policy agenda. The National first policy document issued by the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2005 explicitly mentioned that agricultural productivity should be improved by enhancing soil fertility and environment quality. Concrete policy measures include implementation of Soil Testing and Fertilization Recommendations (STFR) with an aim to enhance soil organic matters. In 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture introduced an action plan to halt the growth in the use of synthetic N fertilizer referred as the “Action to Achieve Zero Growth of Chemical Fertiliser Use by 2020” (Jin and Fang, 2018 ). This campaign's objective was to limit the use of synthetic N below 1% of fertilizer use in 2015 until 2019, with no further increase slated for 2020 without yield losses (Liu et al., 2015 ). The Action has raised three specific targets: (1) optimize the structure of fertilization; (2) improve fertilizer application methods; and (3) enhance the utilization rate of fertilizer. Results from thousands of field experiments conducted by China Agricultural University from 2005 to 2015 gave strong support for the “Zero Growth Action Plan” Program (Ju et al., 2009 ). The Chinese Government allocated a total of US$ 800 million to support the implementation of the N fertilizer “Zero Growth Action Plan” in different regions and for various crops across country. With the progress of the action, additional amendments including subsidies for building manure storages and manure management have been made (Zhang et al., 2012 ). There is a huge opportunity for China to improve the NUE impacting positively on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15. If there is zero growth in fertilizer use starting from 2020, the N losses would still be higher than the baseline of 2013. However, with adoption of improved management practices, the NUE is likely to increase 33% and N losses decrease 47% by 2050 compared to that in 2013 (Wang et al., 2017b ). Furthermore, in 2050 combining reasonable changes in diet, N use efficiency, and N recycling, the total N loss could reduce to 52% of the 2010 levels (Gu et al., 2015 ). However, technology scaling needs integrating knowledge of nutrient management strategy within various social-economic contexts, as well as significant investment on extensions.   8.3 A case of imbalance: India 8.3.1 Regional context Over the period 1970–2010, fertilizer N inputs in India increased ca. 11-fold while crop N harvest increased only threefold implying a dramatic decline in NUE and a fourfold increase in loss of NR  to the environment. The largest percentage of fertilizer N is applied to cereals (57%) in India, but the yields have stagnated over 36% and 70% of the land area under rice and wheat, respectively (Ray et al., 2012 ). Fertilizer N consumption increased rapidly with the introduction of fertilizer-responsive high yielding varieties (HYVs) of rice and wheat in the mid-1960s. Favorable fertilizer policies then followed in the 1970s and 1980s leading to an almost fivefold increase in consumption of fertilizer N from 8.9 to 43.1 kg ha− 1  over the same period. Today total fertilizer N consumption is 17.4 mt with an average application of 89.7 kg ha− 1  (FAO, 2015 ) accounting for around 16% of global production and 17% of global consumption (IFA, 2016 ). While India's use of fertilizer N increased by an average of 6% year− 1  over the last five decades, associated losses/emissions (NOx, NH3 , N2 O) increased in unison. Emissions of NOx (from combustion sources such as industries, vehicles, cooking, and residue burning) represent another source of new NR  for India. It is estimated that India currently loses NR  worth US$10 billion year− 1  as fertilizer value, while costs of NR  to health, ecosystems, and climate are estimated at US$75 (US$38–151) billion year− 1  (M. Sutton, Personal Communication). Wide variation in fertilizer N use exists between Indian states with the highest application rates in the North Western states of Punjab (171.8 kg ha− 1 ), Haryana (158.9 kg ha− 1 ) and the southern state of Telangana (145.39 kg ha− 1 ) (Fig. 13  ). There are, however, many states that use little fertilizer N with the result that overall India's fertilizer N consumption is not significantly different from that based on recommended rates (Chand and Pavithra, 2015 ). The N challenge in India is therefore to increase NUE of agriculture in high-use regions rather than reduce total fertilizer N use per se, particularly considering that India needs to increase her food production by 25% in 2050. Crop NUE in India has declined from around 55% in 1960 to 30–35% in 2010 (Bijay-Singh, 2017 ). Over the same period, the N balance, calculated as the difference between N input and N output in crop yield, has increased from 3.7 to 92.5 kg N ha− 1  year− 1  A small portion of this surplus N might have contributed to SON, given the generally low SOM status of Indian soils. Since SOM does not increase indefinitely but reaches equilibrium, it could be safe to assume that at least 50% of the total N applied is lost to the environment. Not only does this scale of N loss harm the human and ecosystem health (with associated hidden costs), but it also represents an enormous cost to the Government of India (GoI) in the form of wasted subsidies (see below). Overuse, or rather imbalanced use of fertilizer, is largely due to the low cost of urea relative to other nutrients (e.g., P, K).  8.3.2 From “imbalanced” to sustainable N use in India India with its diverse agro-ecologies perfectly illustrates the examples of N use ranging from low to high, with some of the N management approaches applicable to SSA also relevant to India. These include (a) optimal time, rate, and methods of application for matching N supply with crop demand, (b) use of more efficient forms of fertilizer including slow and controlled release fertilizers (c) use of urease and nitrification inhibitors, (d) integrated use of synthetic N, manures, and/or crop residues, and (e) optimizing irrigation management. Best management practices including the appropriate use of conservation agriculture (CA)-based techniques of zero tillage, residue and/or manure retention and crop rotation improve soil health and so help maximize the benefits achieved from precision N management tools (Sapkota et al., 2014 ). Interventions such as coating of urea with neem oil can also improve NUE and reduce N2 O emissions (Bijay-Singh, 2016 ), but substantial improvements can only be achieved by the balanced use of all the nutrients. In addition, some modern tools such as precision farming technologies, and simulation modeling-supported decision support systems, also help to improve NUE. A range of precision nutrient management tools (e.g., the Greenseeker and the Nutrient Expert decision support software, Leaf Color Chart), and techniques (e.g., drilling/banding of fertilizer, split application and fertigation) are now available to support the best fertilizer management system on farms in India (Bijay-Singh, 2017 ). These precision nutrient tools and techniques provide a means of fine-tuning of the N management decisions. For example, chlorophyll meter, the leaf color chart or optical sensors (e.g., GreenSeeker) can be used to guide in-season N management. Similarly, computer/android phone-based decision support software (e.g., Nutrient Expert, Crop Manager) are being used to refine the N management practices in farmers' fields in India, and such tools are becoming increasingly important in smallholder-dominated geographies where blanket fertilizer recommendations are the norm. While some of these specific techniques will continue to be useful to improve NUE in Indian agriculture, holistic approaches will maximize the crop N uptake, minimize surplus N and optimize indigenous soil N supply including non-symbiotic N fixation by maintaining soil health. A high crop N demand linked to maximal genetic yield potential and harvest index of a crop will ensure high NUE provided they are supported by sound agronomic management practices (Ladha et al., 2005, 2016b ). The principles of CA (residue mulch without tillage) are becoming attractive, which not only increase the NUE but also recycle crop residues which otherwise are burnt. Crop residue burning, which is widespread specially in Northwest India where roughly 2.5 million farmers burn 23 million tonnes of rice residue every year, adversely affects soil fertility, results in substantial air pollution with serious human health consequences (Chakrabarti et al., 2019 ), in addition to the release of greenhouse gases (Tallis et al., 2017 ). Recently, CIMMYT with the Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA) has developed a novel technique of sub-surface irrigation with fertigation for conservation agriculture-based wheat-rice system and wheat-maize system resulting in high NUE and substantial water savings and a small increase in crop yields (Sidhu et al., 2019 ). Further refinement of sub-surface irrigation with crop residue cover on soil surface provides exciting future opportunities to address multiples goals of SDGs. In addition, use of innovative agricultural machinery, such as the so-called Happy Seeder designed to drill seed without tillage into fields with very high residue loads, could also help to arrest the problem of residue burning in South Asia's rice-wheat cropping systems (Sidhu et al., 2015 ).  8.3.3 Institutions and policies influencing fertilizer N consumption The GoI currently provides large subsidies on fertilizers. In the case of urea, this amounts to 75% of the total cost (Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, 2016 ) with a cash subsidy equivalent to around US$7 billion per year. Smaller subsidies of 34% and 37%, respectively, are provided on phosphorus- and potassium-based fertilizers but the prices of these fertilizers, unlike urea that is under GoI control, are pegged to international markets and so are relatively expensive. Because of price differences, farmers tend to use more urea (N) than other nutrients resulting in a distortion in the N:P:K ratio which has widened from 4.7:2.3:1.0 in 2010–11 (i.e., closer to the ideal of 4.0:2.0:1.0) to 7.3:2.9:1.0 in 2015–16 (Tewatia et al., 2017 ). This is the country average, whereas in many Indian states, the ratio is highly skewed, for example, in Haryana (52.6:14.8:1.0), Rajasthan (58.2:24.1:1.0), Punjab (18.6:5.4:1.0) and Uttar Pradesh (14.5:5.4:1.0). This imbalance has impacted negatively on crop yields and soil health as well as wider impacts beyond the farm gate in terms of air, surface and ground water pollution. The GoI's decision to make it mandatory for all imported and domestically manufactured urea to be 100% neem-coated may help to improve NUE to some extent, but overall fertilizer use efficiency can only be optimized by balanced use of all the nutrients and this needs to be incentivized through correction in pricing policies (Bijay-Singh, 2016 ). It is noteworthy to mention that the GoI recently launched the ambitious Soil Health Card Scheme (https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in/ ) under which nearly 110 million health cards were supplied to the farmers. Each card carried status of soil with respect of 12 parameters and crop-wise recommendations of soil amendment and fertilizer including N fertilizer to improve productivity through judicious use of inputs. Linking the soil health card initiative with N management tools will further help meet the N challenge. There is a huge opportunity for India to address the low NUE of agriculture and with this impact positively on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15. With the support of enabling government policies around 30% of the emission of N2 O can be reduced as against the business-as-usual by 2030 from agriculture sector itself with implementation of current technologies at scale (Sapkota et al., 2019 ). This will translate into emission saving of about 17.5 mt CO2 e year− 1  without compromising the yield. Supportive policies and well-equipped extension systems are however required to implement the large-scale use of these generally knowledge-intensive practices.   8.4 A case of optimal: USA 8.4.1 Regional context Total world N fertilizer consumption in 2013/14 was estimated at 110.4 Tg N, of which the USA consumed 11% (FAI, 2017 ). North America is the world's largest producer and exporter of commercial fertilizers and is third only to China and India as the largest consumer. These countries have an aggregate market share of 57% for all N fertilizer consumption. Changing diets and demand for consistent food supply increased demands on North American farmers to produce more food, which resulted in increasing use of synthetic N fertilizer. Nitrogen use in the USA increased about 10-fold from 1900 to 2000. There was an exponential increase in synthetic N use from 1960 to around 1980s followed by leveling at around 10–12 Tg N year− 1 . A slowdown in the increase of synthetic fertilizer inputs from the 1980s has resulted, although better agronomic practice has improved the efficiency of N use leading to a corresponding increase in yields of the most important crops (Alston et al., 2010 ; Howarth et al., 2002 ). About 40% of the land in the United States is used for agriculture of some form, which includes about 175 million hectares (mha) of croplands and 200 mha of pasture. The largest single crop is maize with a 2016 production of 385 million tons (mt), followed by soybeans with 117 mt, and wheat with 63 mt. Other major crops include sugarcane, sugar beets, potatoes, and bananas. Much of the synthetic N fertilizer is used in areas where maize and wheat are grown (Fig. 14  ). The Midwestern states—Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio—are the principal areas for cultivation of corn and are frequently referred to as the Corn Belt. Wheat is grown in the broad, open lands of the Great Plains, in Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Considering yield and economic returns, farmers in the United States are among the most productive in the world because of continuing improvements in genetics and agronomy that, with highly supportive policies, make adoption of improved technologies relatively easy. The United States produces about half of the world's maize and 10% of its wheat (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products.aspx ). In North America, agriculture is highly mechanized and heavily dependent upon an integrated system of supporting agribusinesses, extension services, and accommodating governmental policies and safety nets. Although farmers represented less than 2% of the U.S. population, they successfully fed the country at a high standard of living, produced grain and other products for export, and still maintained a surplus carryover of 2% of the total production. Although N fertilizer use in the USA has increased more slowly in the past two decades (Fig. 15  ), yields of all major crops have continued to increase. Because crop yields are closely related to N uptake (Cassman et al., 2002 ), these trends imply a steady increase in NUE and reduced N losses to the environment. Cassman et al. (2002)  suggested that greater NUE has resulted from two factors: (1) steady improvement in the stress tolerance of maize hybrids that increases crop growth rates and allows sowing at higher plant densities, which together accelerate the establishment of a vigorous root system to intercept and acquire available N in the soil profile, and (2) development and adoption of technologies that may improve the synchrony between crop N demand and N supply. In addition to efforts to sustain soil quality, technologies comprising good agronomy include (a) fertilizer N application based on integrated management programs that incorporate soil test-based evidence, (b) split N fertilizer applications, (c) fertigation (the application of nitrogen and other nutrients through irrigation), (d) site-specific N management, and (e) new fertilizer formulations such as controlled release and nitrification inhibitors. Available data suggest that maize receiving the largest share of total N fertilizer in the U.S. (44% in 2005), had remarkably low NUE in the 1960s but resulted in impressive improvements of 50% NUE from the mid-1970s to early 2000s (Fig. 16  ). For example, average NUE in the U.S. required 1.0 kg of applied N to produce 43 kg of grain yield during 1974–76, whereas that same amount of N produced 65 kg of grain during 2003–05 (USEPA, 2011 ). Such improvement in NUE resulted not only from improved crop varieties and good fertilizer management but also due to good policies and larger investment in research and education. Although considerable progress has been made in reducing N surplus and associated environmental problems, significant efforts are still needed to address the secondary N pollution problems (Bricker et al., 2008 ; USEPA, 2009, 2016 ).  8.4.2 From “improved” to “maximal” N use efficiency in USA Cassman et al. (2002)  observed that despite a steady improvement in NUE in maize, current levels of N fertilizer uptake efficiency appear to be relatively low, although data from production-scale studies are few. Despite increasing interest and strong cost-saving incentives, most farmers do not use all the best agronomic and N management practices regarding nitrogen fertilizer management. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) Agricultural Resources and Environmental Indicators (AREI) report indicated that a majority of farmers still apply N in the fall, which leaves N vulnerable to losses during the winter, and gives the lowest fertilizer uptake efficiency and highest NR  losses compared to application in spring or during the summer crop growth period (USDA-ERS, 2006 ). In a recent study, Swaney et al. (2018)  investigated regional crop production and NUE of major U.S. crops over 1987–2012 by considering all the inputs of N (synthetic N, manure, BNF and atmospheric deposition). Significant regional differences in the relationships between N inputs and crop production were observed. Regions with the steepest slopes and highest asymptotes were those dominated by high yielding and biomass producing crops (such as maize, soybeans, alfalfa hay) in Heartland, Northern Crescent and Mississippi Portal. Nevertheless, there was a small but significant overall decrease in NUE (grain yield per unit of N input) on a decadal scale, averaging about 49% in 1987–97 and 45% in 2002–12. This may be because crop production is not increasing as fast as is the rising proportion of synthetic fertilizer N in most regions (Swaney et al., 2018 ). These findings suggest that even in agricultural systems of the United States, where many advances in efficient N use have been made, the need to move toward maximizing NUE remains. The USEPA (2011)  contemplated several potential strategies to maximize NUE: (a) use of controlled release fertilizers, (b) comprehensive updates to nutrient rate and application recommendations, (c) use of real-time, in-season, decision-making tools, (d) development of new, alternative crop production systems with greater integration of legume cover crops, biologically diverse crop rotations, and livestock production.  8.4.3 Institutions and policies influencing fertilizer N consumption In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with managing and conducting research on reactive N through the offices of (a) Air and Radiation, (b) Water, and (c) Research and Development. Related to reactive N, there are three important acts in place: Clean Air Act (1970), Clean Water Act (1972), and Safe Drinking Water Act (1974), each of which stipulates thresholds for dangerous levels of NOx and NO3  (USEPA, 2011 ). Other legislations such as the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), and the 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) contain provisions that could result in regulatory actions that affect N management on farmlands—particularly those within sensitive watersheds or adjacent to nature reserves or crucial habitat. There are also regional policies such as the Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan to reduce N pollution of the Mexican Gulf marine ecosystem through adoption of agricultural N best management practices (Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force, 2008). These acts and policies have been amended as and when required. The EPA develops criteria and sets various standards for emissions/pollutants but has at times been critiqued for not sufficiently addressing these issues. The EPA's Office of Research and Development provides scientific basis for the development of standards, identify and quantify the positive and negative impacts on ecosystem services resulting from the N loadings. Among various other functions, the EPA organizes communication and education and intergovernmental and international cooperation.    9 Desired NUE targets and strategies for achieving the sustainable development goals 9.1 Global NUE targets and projected N demand for 2050 The projections show that feeding a world population of 9.7 billion people in 2050 would require raising overall food production by some 70% between 2010 and 2050 (FAO, 2018 ). The demand for N input would increase to meet the growing future food demand if the efficiencies of N use remains low. Zhang et al. (2015)  proposed NUE (outputs or N yield/sum of all N inputs) targets to increase from 42% (2010) to 67% to meet 2050 global food demand while meeting the SDGs relating to agriculture. If NUE of 67% is achieved, the 2050 global food demand will require 160 Tg input of N year− 1  which is about 8% lower than that of 2010 estimate. This target enforces surplus N (sum of N inputs minus N outputs) to not exceed 50 Tg N ha− 1  year− 1  (decrease of 50% of 2010) assessed for acceptable air and water quality (Bodirsky et al., 2014 ). Their projections show that globally NUE should increase from 42% to 67% whereas the increases in the regions with current excess use of N (i.e., China and India) will be from 25% to 60%. The regions (i.e., U.S./Canada and Europe), which already have high NUE may further increase it to 75%, and the regions with sub-optimal use of N (i.e., sub-Saharan Africa) should continue to maintain the same around 75%. It should be noted that the N input estimates of Zhang et al. (2015)  includes sum of all the sources of N (synthetic, manure, BNF and deposition). Therefore, the estimates of demand of synthetic N alone for 2050 would be much lower. Additionally, it appears that the NUE target of 67% assumes same efficiency of all the sources of N which however may not be the case (Ladha and Chakraborty (2016) ). Another exercise using crop-based approach by Integer and LMC (2013)  projected the global synthetic N demand to increase by 1.3% annually from 101 Tg N in 2010 to 132 Tg N in 2030. Cereals may account for 46% of the increase in world synthetic N demand. The demand for cereals is projected at 3 billion tonnes (Bt) by 2050, up by 43% of today's use, (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012 ) to feed an additional 2.3 billion mouths. The likely change in land area under three globally important cereals (maize, rice and wheat) until 2050 is projected to increase by about 7% from today's total of 542 mha. Using these projections of changes in food demand and harvested land area, we evaluated three NUE/REN  scenarios of global synthetic fertilizer N requirements by maize, rice and wheat to 2050 (Table 5  ). The scenarios we used included current-2010 (average REN  = 0.47), 15% higher REN  than 2010 (average REN  = 0.54) and 15% lower than 2010 (average REN  = 0.40). Since cereal grain demand and harvested area are fixed, N harvested through crop uptake remains the same for all the three scenarios. Compared to 2010, total N harvest by three cereals would increase by 45% with an increase in global cereal production from 2.20 to 3.15 Bt in 2050. To achieve this, an additional 22.6 Tg of N will be required, making it a total of 85.4 Tg of synthetic N application. The average N application would therefore be 166 kg ha− 1  for maize, 151 kg ha− 1  for rice and 129 kg ha− 1  for wheat. It is noteworthy that the release of reactive N into the environment from synthetic N alone in 2050 is estimated at 22% to 114% higher compared to 2010 in the three REN  scenarios. Earlier Cassman et al. (2003)  estimated synthetic N requirement in 2025 by the three major cereals keeping 2000 as the base year. Their projections ranged from 52 to 72 Tg under various scenarios of projected yields, harvested areas and NUE. The NUE scenarios were similar to our analysis, but instead of REN , authors used PFP-N (kg grain per kg of applied fertilizer N). Wood et al. (2004)  reviewed published reports on global scale projections of synthetic N requirement and provided their own two contemporary sets of projections. Their 2050 projections for all the cereals ranged from 112 to 171 Tg synthetic N, which were based on trend analysis and future food needs. A much higher projection of 171 Tg synthetic N assumed constant NUE and the need of soil rehabilitation. Achieving these targets of improving NUE is ambitious but technically feasible. It is also important to remember that there are also biological limits to achieve very high NUE. Nitrogen is highly dynamic and goes through numerous biochemical processes restricting our ability to reduce or eliminate losses completely. Climatic and other agronomic conditions which are sub-optimal to crop production are also responsible for poor NUEs. Due to poor agronomy, many soils have reached to lowest levels of SOM losing abilities to hold and regulate the supply of N to crops when it needs the most. On the other hand, reasons of excess (or misuse) use of N also include poor knowledge and heavy price subsidy. Therefore, a combination of approaches of improved system management, right policies and good campaign/education is needed to improve NUE to meet the SDGs. It should be mentioned here that maize, rice and wheat obtain only 48% of their N from synthetic fertilizer and remaining 52% come from other sources (soil organic N, manure, crop residue, deposition and non-symbiotic BNF) (Ladha et al., 2016a ). Unlike synthetic N, it is hard to project the supply of N from other sources on a global basis. Soil N supply may not change because most cultivated soils have reached a near steady state. Manure N supply may be affected because of labor shortage but residue recycling may increase if CA becomes more popular among farmers (Tallis et al., 2017 ). Inputs from deposition may increase in proportion to increase in synthetic fertilizer N but would also depend on the future improvements in REN . Non-symbiotic BNF, a widespread process largely depends on the availability of C substrate, which may increase with crop productivity and improved management including CA practices.  9.2 Synchronizing crop N demand with N supply Our goal should be to synchronize N supply with crop demand in order to maximize the NUE and minimize N losses. Synchronization implies that the rate at which N becomes available to the plant is closely related to the rate at which the growing crop needs it. High crop N demand linked to maximal genetic yield potential and harvest index of a crop will ensure high synchrony and thereby high NUE, which can be achieved through sound agronomic management practices including the deployment of biodiversity in the form of cover crops, and with genetic crop improvements. From the N supply side, it is essential to adopt more efficient sources of fertilizer, agronomic practices to synchronize N supply with demand, and soil, water and crop management (e.g., CA practices) to ensure a better and favorable production condition. Holistic management approaches will maximize crop N uptake, minimize N losses and optimize indigenous soil N supply including non-symbiotic N fixation by maintaining soil biodiversity and health. Although crop N recovery efficiencies of less than 50% are most common, efficiency levels as high as 70% to 90% have been obtained in well-managed irrigated cereal systems where fertilizer N is precisely supplied to meet crop demand (Chen et al., 2014 ; Grassini and Cassman, 2012 ; Ladha et al., 2005 ; Peng and Cassman, 1998 ; Pittelkow et al., 2017 ). Nutrients are used most efficiently when their availability is synchronized with crop demand. There are many management approaches available for increasing NUE through matching N supply with crop demand and thereby mitigating loss of N from agroecosystems. Some of the approaches have relatively higher relevance and impact in some regions and to some of SDGs (Table 6  ). Managing the right source at the right rate, right time and in the right place is best accomplished with the right tools and best management practices (see Section 8.3.2 ). A range of precision N tools (e.g., Green Seeker™ and the Nutrient Expert® decision support software) and techniques (e.g., direct drilling of fertilizer and fertigation) are now available to support best fertilizer management (Sapkota et al., 2014 ). These tools and techniques provide a means of fine-tuning N management decisions. For example, chlorophyll meter, the leaf color chart or optical sensors (e.g., the GreenSeeker that provides normalized differential vegetation index measurements) can be used to guide in-season N management (Sapkota et al., 2014 ). Similarly, computer/android phone-based decision support software (e.g., Nutrient Expert, Crop Manager) are being used to refine N management practices in farmers' fields in India, Mexico, and the United States. Such tools have become increasingly important in geographies where blanket fertilizer recommendations are the norm. Research by CIMMYT demonstrates that in a rice-wheat system, fertilizer efficiency can be increased by 10–15% due to better placement of fertilizer mechanized seed and fertilizer drilling compared with broadcasting in the conventional system (M.L. Jat, Personal Communication). In the Indo-Gangetic plains of India, both the Nutrient Expert® and GreenSeeker™-based nutrient management have increased the partial factor productivity of nitrogen in wheat compared with state-recommended and farmers' fertilizer practice (Sapkota et al., 2014 ) (Fig. 17  ). Through on-farm comparison in over 4000 farmers' field across Indo-Gangetic plains of India, CIMMYT found that the “nutrient expert”-based nutrient management reduced the GHG intensity of rice, wheat and maize production by 5–35% (average 13%). Similarly, Bijay-Singh (2016)  showed significant improvement in rice yield, agronomic efficiency and recovery efficiency of N through GreenSeeker™ optical sensor based N application in rice in Punjab, India. Likewise, the International Rice Research Institute in collaboration with national partners across Asia developed an internet-based decision support tool named “Nutrient Manager for Rice” (Buresh et al., 2014 ; Sharma et al., 2019 ), which uses the principles of site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), refined through years of research (Buresh et al., 2010 ; Dobermann et al., 2004 ), to calculate field-specific fertilizer N, P, and K recommendations. As discussed earlier, an important cause for low NUE is the application of excess N but equally important is the application of insufficient N causing an optimal crop production. Undoubtedly there are opportunities but also challenges to estimating optimal N rates in environments with huge spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, SSNM based Nutrient Manger which is now upgraded to “Rice Crop Manager” (RCM) (http://cropmanager.irri.org ) enables extension professionals to provide the farmers with personalized field-specific crop and nutrient management recommendations designed to help in increasing yield, nutrient use efficiency, and net economic returns. The RCM calculates fertilizer N rates based on a target yield (Buresh, 2015 ), and distributes its application through several doses matching with the critical growth stages of the crop (Peng and Cassman, 1998 ; Witt et al., 2007 ). The RCM has been released and used by national programs in several Asian countries (http://cropmanager.irri.org ). Its use is greatest in the Philippines where it has been shown in researcher-managed trials to increase yield and net income for rice farmers (Banayo et al., 2018 ). National programs in the Philippines used RCM to provide more than 1.8 million personalized field-specific recommendations, including for N fertilizer, to rice farmers between its release in November 2013 and April 2019 (https://phapps.irri.org/ph/rasstat ). The RCM in the Philippines has since 2016 been part of an advisory service (https://phapps.irri.org/ph/rcm ), which enables staff within the national rice program to collect, monitor, and use information on farmer's practice to further improve and target information for rice farmers, including field and farmer specific N fertilizer management. This includes the automatic delivery to farmers' phones of text (SMS) messages informing farmers of the date to apply a specific quantity of fertilizer to each of their rice fields with a predetermined size, planting date, and variety. Soil, through its biological, chemical and physical characteristics plays an essential role in sustaining and regulating N supply. Hence a “healthy” soil with optimal quantity and quality of organic carbon is crucial for achieving a greater synchrony between crop demand and supply. Irrespective of source, N first enters the soil N pool and is released in mineral form after which it becomes available to the crop. Unlike synthetic N, plant residues or manure undergo a microbially mediated mineralization process, resulting in the slow release of nitrogen that, unlike the pulses of N available with synthetic fertilizer, will slowly supply the crop over the season (Becker et al., 1994 ).  9.3 Ecosystem-based approaches to improving NUE Drinkwater and Snapp (2007)  argued that many N management techniques aiming to resolve the temporal lack of synchronicity between synthetic N application and crop retrieval were developed before the ecosystem concept was widely understood in the context of agricultural systems. As a result, most efforts to improve NUE have focussed on timing (application to match crop phenology and nutrient demand), and on the placement of fertilizer within the root zone (e.g., through fertigation, knifing, banding, deep placement, etc.), rather than through methods aimed at increasing ecosystem functioning to sustain C and N reservoirs that facilitate N mineralization and supply over time. Key to this approach is the development of cropping systems inclusive of cover crops and improved fallows that approach a balanced steady state, in which N exports through harvests are matched by resident soil N reservoirs of approximately equal proportions. Within this context, Drinkwater and Snapp (2007)  also argued that in addition to increasing yield, synthetic fertilizer N should be thought of as a management tool to increase plant uptake, decomposition and C supply, and as a supplementary energy source for heterotrophs that assimilate of N into soil storage reservoirs. Over time, these reservoirs provide slow but potentially consistent release of N to the crop. Synthetic N can also be used to prime soil microbial communities to more rapidly mineralize recalcitrant pools allowing slow but steady release N to the crop. Viable methods to couple agronomic management with mechanisms to increase desirable microbial diversity to mediate N transformations, including decomposition and soil N supply, biologically mediated weathering, and soil aggregation processes, are under researched but nonetheless crucial (Benckiser et al., 2016 ). The restoration of ecosystem functioning by deliberately encouraging crop-associated N-fixing organisms and N-mycorrhizal interactions through microbiome manipulation can also be valuable (Ladha and Reddy, 2019 ). Marschner and Dell (1994)  for example showed that on degraded soils, increasing interactions with mycorrhizae can increase crop uptake of NO3 −  and NH4 + , thereby contributing to improved N supply to the crop. To quantitatively understand that the transformation processes of residues and/or manure-derived N and the factors controlling their entry into different pools within agroecosystems, it is important to develop robust estimates of soil N and C reservoirs under a diversity of cropping systems and soil types. Transformation of organic matter into plant-available N is partially dependent on the lignin to N ratio (L/N), which determines the pattern of N release from organic material (Becker et al., 1994 ; Palm and Sanchez, 1991 ; Singh et al., 2001 ). Deliberate selection of cover or accessory crops species that can contribute to soil ecosystem functioning and N regulation therefore becomes an important consideration in the application of ecosystem-based approaches to improving the crop N economy. For example, in place of bare fallows, cover crops can be chosen that have (a) low L/N ratios, (b) high rates of leaf litter, (c) high rates of root exudation and root mass turnover, and (d) N fixation characteristics. Each of these characteristics will influence soil C and N cycling leading to slow release of N (Connor et al., 2011 ). Soils that have consistent cover crops or application of manure are more likely to be richer in SOM. This in turn increases their ability to retain fertilizer N not used by heterotrophs or taken up by the crop, thereby limiting the losses and pollution. Since crops and particularly cereals receive a significant of their N requirement from non-symbiotic BNF (Ladha et al., 2016a ), creating a conducive soil environment for BNF is also important to improve NUE. Our goal should be to ensure soil conditions which promote biological inputs of N and overall efficient use of all the sources of N (Kundu and Ladha, 1995 ). As global yields have increased, the production of crop residue has also increased. Residues are burnt in many parts of world and can be a valuable organic resource to contribute to soil C and N reservoirs, if managed wisely (Singh and Sidhu, 2014 ; Tallis et al., 2017 ). Farmers making use of the CA can avoid tillage and leave crop residue on the soil surface. This approach can help improve soil quality and influences the regulation of C and N supply to match crop demand (Sapkota et al., 2014, 2017 ). In flooded soils, mixing of cereal crop residues of high L/N with that of legume residue of low L/N has shown to improve synchrony between N supply and rice N demand. This can result in lower N losses and a larger soil N reservoir that can benefit the succeeding rice crop (Becker et al., 1994 ). Bouldin (1988)  inferred that the “fast N fraction” determines the potential supply of N to the current crop. The remaining fraction decomposes more slowly and influences residual and multi-crop effects. Consequently, increasing the “slow N fraction” may have long-term residual effects on N supply and the potential productivity of crop soils. The crucial role of crop residues, manures, and soils rich in decomposer organisms in influencing N mineralization and optimizing the synchrony of N supply and crop N demand deserves further attention to improve NUE. Maintaining and managing crop residues in agriculture can be economically beneficial to many farmers and more importantly to the society (Tallis et al., 2017 ).  9.4 Genetic improvement to increase NUE Genetic improvement of NUE through plant selection, breeding and genetic engineering has also been considered (Bogard et al., 2010 ; Ciampitti and Vyn, 2012 ; Haegele et al., 2013 ; Han et al., 2015 ; Hirel et al., 2007 ; Ladha et al., 1998 ; Lafitte and Edmeades, 1995 ; Lammerts van Bueren and Struik, 2017 ; Martin et al., 2006 ; McAllister et al., 2012 ; Sylvester-Bradley and Kindred, 2009 ). However, to our knowledge, there has been no breeding effort per se  which aimed directly at improving fertilizer recovery efficiency. Instead studies focussed characterizing NUE related traits in diverse crop germplasm differing in grain yield potential. Broadly, two plant traits related to NUE are involved: N acquisition from soil and fertilizer N, and internal efficiency with which N is used to produce plant biomass and grains (Fig. 18  ). Differences in the efficiency of N acquisition may arise from differences in the (a) efficiency of absorption and assimilation of NH4 +  and other N species; (b) root-induced changes in the rhizosphere affecting N mineralization, transformation and transport; and (c) root- and rhizosphere-associated BNF. Variations in the efficiency of internal use may arise from variances in (a) internal N requirements for growth, biomass production, and organ formation, (b) ability to translocate, distribute and remobilize absorbed N in various organs, (c) flag leaf N import/export and leaf senescence patterns, and (d) the efficiency of N use in converting CO2  to carbohydrates. The N acquisition trait of NUE appears to be important when N supply is limiting, which may exist in an unfavorable environment (Anzoua et al., 2010 ; Lafitte and Edmeades, 1995 ; Moll et al., 1982 ; Ortiz-Monasterio et al., 1997 ; Rao et al., 2018 ). However, both N acquisition and internal N efficiency traits in a favorable environment with non-limiting N supply appear to have already been taken care of in the high yielding varieties with high harvest indices (Peng and Cassman, 1998 ). Crop varieties with similar harvest indices may have slightly improved NUE through lower N concentrations in grain and straw, which however may not be acceptable to the consumers because this would reduce the protein contents in the produce (Ladha et al., 1998 ; Singh et al., 1998 ; Sylvester-Bradley and Kindred, 2009 ). In maize, more recent varieties have substantial improvement in internal N efficiency resulting in a lower grain N concentration (Ciampitti and Vyn, 2012 ; Scott et al., 2006 ; Singh et al., 1998 ), which again suggests that the improvement in NUE may have resulted from overall breeding for high grain yields. The selection and breeding efforts to improve crop NUE is also challenged from the fact that there are huge genotype environment and management (G × E × M) interactions. From a comprehensive review, Ciampitti and Vyn (2012)  concluded that the future improvements in grain yield can increase the N recovery efficiency as concomitant effect of the strong linkages between grain, harvest index and N harvest index, and consequently promote further gains in total plant N uptake. The authors further suggest that higher NUE will need combined efforts into (a) determination of appropriate N rates for the specific G × E × M interaction environments, (b) improving plant N uptake (related to processes at soil- and plant-levels), and (c) augmenting the sink demand with sustainable source (i.e., functional photosynthesis-stay green). However, it is noteworthy that in case of rice, Peng and Cassman (1998)  showed that N uptake capacity is not a constraint in modern cultivars with high yield potential provided an optimal N supply exists at times of high crop N demand. Improving the NUE of crop through gene manipulation has also been proposed. Numerous genes involved in N uptake, translocation, and remobilization; amino acid biosynthesis; C and N storage and metabolism; signaling targets; and regulatory elements are being explored (McAllister et al., 2012 ). Some of the genes linked to ammonium assimilation are believed to improve NUE even though they are yet to show any positive effect in engineered plants. On the other hand, over expressing alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT), a gene not related to N metabolism has resulted in improved biomass, yield and N content in rice grown under N-limiting condition (Shrawat et al., 2008 ). It will be interesting to investigate if AlaAT or other genes hypothesized to affect NUE would result in additional gains in improved crop genotypes which breeders have already developed for high yield potential, harvest index and REN  (Fischer and Edmeades, 2010 ).  9.5 Engineering cereals to fix their own N There is an inverse relationship between N loss and N synchrony. An almost absolute synchrony between N supply and N demand would result in no or negligible loss of N, similar to N2 -fixing legume-rhizobium symbiosis where demand and supply are tightly linked. Absolute synchrony like that of a legume will not be attainable in fertilizer-dependent cereal production systems unless symbiotic N2  fixation ability is assembled in the cereals. Endowing crops, particularly cereals with the capacity to produce their own N has been an ambitious goal of plant biologists (Beatty and Good, 2011 ; Ladha and Reddy, 1995 ; Rogers and Oldroyd, 2014 ). Although over last half a century, there have been ups and downs in the research efforts to assemble the N fixation mechanisms in cereals such as in rice and maize, ambitions have remained alive. Here, we briefly discuss various potential approaches and highlight most recent advances. Three major approaches, namely, (a) improving the endophytic bacteria that associate with plants to develop nodule-independent N2 -fixing systems, (b) developing root-nodule symbiosis in cereals, and (c) transferring the nitrogenase genes into cereal plants, are now being actively considered for realizing this target (Beatty and Good, 2011 ; Ladha and Reddy, 1995, 2003 ). Work on these three options has been discussed, and preliminary research was conducted in rice under the umbrella of global research project on Assessing Opportunities for Nitrogen Fixation in Rice during 1994–2001 (Ladha and Reddy, 2003 ). More recently, major breakthroughs in the genomics of diazotrophs and the genetics of nitrogen fixation, as well as the processes involved in legume-rhizobia symbioses, have opened new avenues to tackle this problem much more systematically. The first approach is to enhance the capabilities of root-colonizing bacteria to develop nitrogen-fixing microbes suitable for fertilizing the cereals. Recently, Setten et al. (2013)  engineered a root-colonizing non-diazotrophic endophyte, Pseudomonas protegens  Pf-5, by transferring a stretch of DNA with 52 genes, including a nif  gene cluster from Pseudomonas stutzeri  A1501, to develop a strain having the capability to fix the N constitutively, even in the presence of combined N, and able to release significant quantities of ammonium into the surrounding medium. Subsequently, in 2016, in greenhouse tests, Fox et al. (2017)  demonstrated increased yields in maize and wheat inoculated with this engineered strain and using 15 N isotope dilution analysis confirming that this beneficial effect is positively associated with N fixation in roots. The second approach considers the development of root-nodule symbiosis in non-legume crops such as rice and maize (Reddy et al., 2013 ; Rogers and Oldroyd, 2014 ). Researchers showed that rhizobia readily colonize the rhizosphere of rice, and can frequently enter in the roots to form endophytic associations (Reddy et al., 1997 ), and many of the elements that support nodular symbioses in legumes are also present in rice (Reddy et al., 2000a,b ; Sreevidya et al., 2006 ). Reddy et al. (1999)  showed that several legume ENOD  genes hybridized to DNA from a variety of rice genotypes, which was confirmed by isolating rice cDNAs showing considerable sequence homology to legume ENOD93  (Reddy et al., 1998 ) and ENOD40  (Kouchi et al., 1999 ). Interestingly, legumes with ability to establish N2  fixation symbiosis are also able to establish root endosymbioses with endomycorrhizal fungi (AMS), to acquire phosphorus. Recent studies showed that genetic elements required for two symbioses are common (Markmann et al., 2008 ; Reddy et al., 2013 ) suggesting that many of the components that require for rhizobial symbiosis may be conserved in rice and other plants. This common symbiotic signaling pathway provides an opportunity to investigate the possibilities for extending the mycorrhizal symbiotic genetic network of rice to accommodate rhizobial symbiosis for N fixation (Markmann et al., 2008 ; Reddy et al., 2013 ; Rogers and Oldroyd, 2014 ). The third approach for developing nitrogen-fixing crops considers the direct transfer of N-fixing (nif ) genes to synthesize and assemble functional nitrogenase in plants (Allen et al., 2017 ; Ivleva et al., 2016 ; López-Torrejón et al., 2016 ). Since N fixation is a high energy demanding process, and so chloroplasts (Merrick and Dixon, 1984 ) and mitochondria (Curatti and Rubio, 2014 ) are proposed to be the most appropriate sites for N fixation since they can meet the energy requirements for nitrogenase in plant cells. However, nitrogenase is extremely sensitive to oxygen and irreversibly inactivated in air, and so the oxygen evolved by chloroplasts during photosynthesis may be detrimental to the maintenance of the integrity of nitrogenase enzyme. Thus, expressing nitrogenase in chloroplasts may require temporal separation of N fixation and photosynthesis by restricting nif  gene expression to dark periods or, alternatively, by spatially restricting nif  gene expression to non-photosynthetic tissues such as root systems. Recently it has been shown that the eukaryotic electron-transport system (FNR–ferredoxin module) operating in plant chloroplasts and root plastids, rather than that operating in mitochondria, is able to support efficient functioning of nitrogenase, indicating suitability of plastids as a location for expressing this enzyme (Yang et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, strictly from the view of protection against oxygen, it has been suggested that localization/expression of nitrogenase in mitochondria, rather than in chloroplasts, may support efficient functioning of nitrogenase because of the near anoxic environment created in the mitochondrial matrix due to the respiratory activity of membranes (Curatti and Rubio, 2014 ). Not only a non-leguminous host plant is able to provide reducing power and energy needed to sustain nitrogenase catalysis, it should be able to demonstrate that a minimum set of genes can be transferred to a host to produce active nitrogenase components (Vicente and Dean, 2017 ). Undoubtedly, these recent advances in the field of nif  gene expression in eukaryotic systems allow us to be optimistic about achieving the goal of nitrogen-fixing cereal crops sooner than anticipated.  9.6 Enhancing NUE at field, farm and regional levels The need to optimize agricultural N use is fast emerging as a key global challenge. The overall goal of the new researches on N, therefore, should be to enhance NUE with a combination of agronomic and biological improvements aimed to raising NUE at field, farm and regional scales, and to demonstrate as to what extent these improvements will reduce the N losses to the environment, thereby contributing to the enhanced resilience of agriculture. Yet to achieve multi-scale improvements in NUE, a trans-disciplinary program linking complementary science areas and scales is required. On the genetic side, both the exploitation of natural variation and genetically modified (GM) crops offer opportunities to improve the plant NUE. On the agronomic side, a major thrust is the experimental demonstration of extent to which improving NUE simultaneously decreases different components of N losses. This is important, as different agronomic strategies will not affect all N pollution in the same way. Strategies may be identified, specifically aimed at reducing NH3  emissions (with additional benefits due to decreased particulate matter in the atmosphere and N deposition to nature), at reducing NO3 −  lost to groundwater (with a focus on better drinking water and less coastal pollution) or at reducing denitrification (reducing impacts on climate from N2 O emissions, while saving energy costs associated with N fertilizer manufacture by reducing N2  emissions). This integrated approach of optimizing the NUE will offer a “win-win-win” situation for the environment, food production and energy saving. Sutton et al. (2013)  developed the idea of “full chain nitrogen use efficiency” (NUEfc ), showing that a 20% increase in NUEfc  would lead to estimated global benefits worth US $170 billion per year, including $23 billion in N fertilizer-saving. They identified 10 “Key Actions” for improving NUE, including raising agronomic and biological NUE. Raising NUE will have major economic consequences. Till now the contributions of non-fertilizer sources have received less attention. Scientific efforts to improve agronomic NUE and biological NUE have too often been considered in isolation. However, genetic and biotechnological development should be considered in their wider agronomic context, and then consider the implications at field, farm and national scales. By taking such an integrative approach, the rationale should be to incorporate all relevant contributions to improving NUEfc . In this way, more N-efficient genetic stock and novel fertilizer practices will provide the foundation to show as to what can be done at the farm scale and for country as whole. This requires consideration of all potential N sources (including organic manures, BNF and atmospheric deposition), while exploring improved spatial and temporal strategies that can help optimize the N-resource use. The NUE should be addressed at a range of scales, from the plant, through the field, farm and national scales. This will allow us to assess as to what could be achieved by different NUE improvement strategies.   10 Conclusions In this paper, we established links between N fertilizer use in agricultural production systems and various SDGs set by the UNDP to end poverty, protect the Earth and ensure peace and prosperity. Nitrogen is perhaps the most essential nutrient in driving food production to meet human dietary needs. In the subsistence agriculture of the pre-industrial era, BNF and use of organic matter including manures were the primary sources of NR . But in today's more intensive agricultural systems, synthetic N has become a crucial addition to drive and sustain productivity. When applied in excess and without an ecosystem-based approach to N management, the NR  (ammonia, nitrate, nitrogen oxides) can cause significant ecological consequence as they are leaked to the environment through various processes causing multiple adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic systems, in addition to human health. With the conflicting dual role of N—both positive and negative—the challenge is highly relevant across most of the SDGs. Globally, wide variation exists in the use of NR  ranging from insufficient use to maintain agroecosystem nutrient balances sustainably, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, to excess use as in China and India, among other countries. On the other hand, Europe and North America, with effective policies, have tended to more successfully reduce fertilizer N use without compromising crop productivity, although second generation environmental challenges still remain. We have dual challenge—(a) to encourage farming practices that improve soil health through the balanced use of organic matter, encouragement of supportive ecosystem services such as BNF, and intelligent use of fertilizer N in areas where widespread poverty, hunger and malnutrition warrant increasing crop production and economic growth, relating to SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 8. At the same time, there is a need to (b) optimize N use and minimize negative impacts in areas where crop productivity have peaked but also resulted in excess or misuse of N. Excess use of N can have severe consequences to public health, water bodies, energy use, cities, climate, and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, which are associated with SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, and 15. Therefore, supporting SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption) through sustainable N management is likely to have a positive feeding forward effect on other SDGs that are currently comprised by either too little or imbalanced N use. Moreover, progress in some of the goals related to education, equalities, infrastructure and investment, peace, and global partnerships. (e.g., SDGs 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 16 and 17) can also create enabling conditions for more sustainable soils and N management. Recently, good methodological progress has been made in N budgeting and developing N use efficiency indices notably surplus N (sum of all N inputs minus N outputs or N yield). N budgeting in cereals has shown that globally cereals receive significant amounts of their N requirement from sources other than synthetic N which include non-symbiotic BNF, recycling through deposition, and crop residue/manure return. Each of these sources is biologically and climactically mediated and can be deliberately managed by farmers to improve N reserves in the soil and N supplies to the crop. Further research is needed to determine how these sources can be most effectively leveraged to support comprehensive N management strategies, including in the systems that are currently deficient in and can benefit from synthetic N application. The surplus N, which specifies N loss to the environment, is attractive because it is simple to calculate, readily understood, and based on easily available farm data. However, measurements of sources other than synthetic N pose challenge and the efficiency of use of other sources is yet to be determined. Globally, average NUE does not exceed 50%. Zhang et al. (2015)  estimated an NUE of 67% (an increase from 42%) to meet the global food demand in 2050 while keeping surplus N within the limits for maintaining acceptable air and water qualities to meet the SDGs. Achieving these targets of NUE look ambitious but appears to be technically feasible. There are also biological limits to achieve a very high NUE. Climatic and other agronomic conditions which are sub-optimal to crop production are just two of many complex reasons contributing to poor NUE. Most agricultural soils have considerably depleted levels of SOM. This is a central problem that results in agroecosystems losing their functionality and ability to retain and regulate the supply of N to crops. Poor knowledge and heavy price subsidies are also reasoning for the excess or misuse of N. Therefore, a combination of approaches of improved system management, right policies and good campaign/education are needed to improve NUE and to meet the SDGs. Nevertheless, there are successes as well as active efforts in pipeline to improve NUE and SOM management. Europe and North America are good examples where targeted policies and sustainable N management have reduced fertilizer N use but crop N harvest (or yields), and NUE have continued to improve. Recently, Several African Governments have brought agriculture back to the top of their development agenda and have reinstated input subsidy schemes aimed at promoting access to fertilizers, often alongside programs that emphasize organic matter and ecosystem-based management. China on the other hand has launched programs to improve soil fertility and the implementation of soil testing-based fertilization recommendations (STFR). In 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture introduced the campaign “Action to Achieve Zero Growth of Chemical Fertiliser Use by 2020.” Likewise, the GoI launched the Soil Health Card Scheme (https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in/ ) to encourage the farmers to apply the soil test-based fertilizers and soil amendments. More than 100 million soil cards were provided to the farmers carrying crop-wise recommendations of nutrients including N fertilizer to improve productivity through judicious use. Similarly, the GoI has mandated all urea (primary source of N fertilizer in India) to be neem-coated for slow N release and improve NUE. Combined with advances in digital soil mapping and new tools to enable rapid diagnostics of nutrient variability at large spatial scales, increasingly appropriate recommendations can be generated to assist farmers in making balanced use of nutrients. Undoubtedly, much progress has been made in developing technologies for an efficient N management, which along with good agronomy are proven to enhance crop N harvest and NUE with lower surplus N. While there are numerous technologies that have been developed and may be appropriate for use by farmers, delivery mechanisms and methods to encourage spontaneous adaptation and adoption need to be strengthened. An equally or perhaps more importantly, approach is needed to create awareness and educate senior officials, policy makers, extension personnel, and farmers on the impact of appropriate soil management and intelligent use of N fertilizer, in conjunction with biologically integrated strategies for soil fertility maintenance. An effective and aggressive campaign against misuse of N will be effective where excess N is used. On the other hand, improved accessibility of N fertilizer and policies to move farmers toward soil quality improvement in regions where N use is sub-optimal are urgently needed. Additionally, further research is needed to quantify strength of linkages between sustainable N management and the system SDGs, going beyond identification of connections between individual goals and NR  flows.
