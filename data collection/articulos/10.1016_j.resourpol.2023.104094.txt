Different developments in technology, alterations in the dynamics of the global economy, and the rising significance of sustainable development objectives have all contributed to this progression. The shift from economies reliant on natural resources to those driven by commerce has given nations new chances to pursue sustainable development and meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the China. This essay explores the transition from natural resources to trade dynamics and its potential to pave the way for the accomplishment of sustainable development objectives(Pan et al., 2023 ). National economies have historically been greatly influenced by the availability of natural resources. Natural resource-rich nations have historically depended on their extraction and export for economic growth and development. However, this approach has often been linked to problems including economic instability, resource scarcity, and environmental deterioration. Growingly more people are becoming aware of the need of switching to inclusive, sustainable economic models that foster long-term growth while protecting the environment. Global trade dynamics have been completely transformed by technological advances, notably in the areas of transportation, communication, and information technology (F. Liu et al., 2023 ). Through the efficient cross-border movement of commodities, services, and money made possible by these developments, nations may now access international markets and diversify their economies. Global business and consumer connections have been expedited by the development of digital platforms and e-commerce. With less reliance on natural resources as the only source of economic development, nations today have more opportunities to take part in global value chains and profit from knowledge-based enterprises (Umair and Dilanchiev, 2022 ). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations provide nations a comprehensive framework for pursuing sustainable development across different dimensions, such as economic, social, and environmental considerations. The SDGs place a strong emphasis on the value of responsible consumption, sustainable production, and environmental preservation. Several SDGs, including SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Li and Umair, 2023 ), are aligned with the movement from natural resources to trade dynamics. For nations aiming to achieve sustainable development, the shift from natural resources to trade dynamics brings both opportunities and problems. One the one hand, trade presents chances for diversifying the economy, creating jobs, and advancing technology. Additionally, commerce may encourage the transmission of sustainable practices and eco-friendly technology, assisting in the achievement of environmental objectives (Wu et al., 2022 ). However, in order to maintain sustained growth, there are issues related to trade dynamics that must be resolved. Increased commerce may result in environmental externalities that threaten the viability of the ecosystem, such as pollution, deforestation, and carbon emissions. Additionally, trade liberalization may exacerbate wealth disparities within and across nations by producing winners and losers. Adopting laws and policies that support ethical business activities, guarantee social equality, and protect the environment is essential for nations. This study centres on the time-based span from 1990 to 2020, scrutinizes the interplay between natural resources and trade dynamics, and places particular emphasis on China's geographical area of focus. China has experienced notable economic changes during this period, shifting from an economy reliant on resources to one propelled by trade and global integration. As mentioned above, the transition holds significant implications for China's objectives in sustainable development and the more comprehensive global agenda aimed at attaining environmental sustainability and inclusive economic growth. First and foremost, this statement illuminates the progressive transformation of China's economic framework, transitioning from a dependence on natural resources to a more trade-centric economy. This transition represents a deliberate shift towards the pursuit of sustainable development, as it mitigates the environmental burdens linked to the extraction of resources and fosters the expansion of economic activities. Additionally, the research emphasizes the pivotal significance of trade dynamics in propelling China's economic expansion, promoting innovation, and tackling environmental issues. By examining and interpreting trade patterns and trends, this study offers significant and insightful perspectives on the potential role of trade in fostering sustainable development. The research utilizes a panel data model to examine the progression of natural resource utilization to trade dynamics in China. The utilization of panel data analysis enables the investigation of variations in both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions, facilitating a comprehensive comprehension of the interplay between natural resources and trade over an extended duration. The study seeks to comprehensively examine the various economic, environmental, and social indicators to effectively analyze the complex nature of sustainable development and its interconnectedness with trade dynamics.  2 Literature review The move from natural resources to trade dynamics marks a fundamental change in the approaches used by nations throughout the globe to economic growth. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate the body of knowledge that already exists about the transition from natural resources to trade dynamics and its ramifications for attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It highlights the potential, problems, and policy implications connected with this transformation by examining important themes and results from pertinent research (Ullah et al., 2020 ). Natural resources have historically played a significant role in the economic development of many nations, serving as the main engine of their economic expansion. The availability of natural resources, such as oil, minerals, and agricultural goods, was considered a competitive advantage that might support economic growth. The “resource curse,” which is marked by economic turbulence, corruption, and environmental degradation, is a result of over-reliance on natural resources (Xiuzhen et al., 2022 ). Technological developments have significantly changed the nature of international commerce. The development of effective communication networks, transportation networks, and information technology has made it easier to transfer money, services, and products across international boundaries. Consequently, nations have embraced trade more and more as a way to diversify their economies, lessen their reliance on natural resources, and advance sustainable development (Mohsin, Ullah, et al., 2021 ). The possibility for economic diversification is one of the main advantages of switching from natural resource dynamics to trade dynamics. By participating in international commerce, nations may access new markets, increase the amount of goods they export, and create businesses apart from resource exploitation. In addition to fostering innovation and job opportunities, diversification may improve economic resilience (Mohsin et al., 2022 ). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide nations a thorough framework for pursuing sustainable development along a number of aspects. SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) are just a few of the SDGs that may be significantly advanced via trade. Countries may stimulate economic development, sustainable industrialization, and responsible consumption habits by embracing trade dynamics (Mohsin, Taghizadeh-Hesary, et al., 2021 ). There are many potentials for sustainable development provided by the shift from natural resources to trade dynamics, but there are also issues that need to be resolved. Since increased commerce may result in environmental externalities like carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, environmental sustainability is a crucial issue. To reduce the negative environmental effect, policies encouraging sustainable trading practices are required, including the use of cleaner technology and the application of environmental legislation (Mohsin et al., 2019 ) inclusive trade policies are essential to ensure that the advantages of trade are distributed fairly across all societal groups. Trade liberalization is not supported by social safety nets and safeguards for disadvantaged individuals, it may worsen economic disparities within and between nations. Trade should make an effort to reduce poverty, create jobs, and promote social inclusion (Mohsin, Nurunnabi, et al., 2020 )., sustainable trade must include technology transfer and capacity-building. Particularly developing nations often struggle to obtain and use cutting-edge technology. Promoting efforts for technology transfer, information exchange, (Agyekum et al., 2021 ). 2.1 Green finance and natural resources development Developments in green technologies might accelerate green growth rates. Natural resources and capabilities significantly determine how well green technology advancements allow economic and social progress (Willett et al., 1985 ). The relationship between endowed natural resources and green interest rates using “innovation” and “introduction,” the two fundamental forces behind technological advancement. According to one school of thinking, abundant natural resources act as a “crowding out” phenomenon, slowing the development of renewable energy technology (Hu et al., 1999 ). The “crowding out” phenomenon may take four distinct forms. Since the economy in these regions is built on exploiting natural resources, the extraction industries are more likely to “crowd out” the industrialization process (Wolf et al., 1994 ). The steel industry, which generally has a higher technical level and more frequent new technologies and R&D activities, limits the development potential of the industries that exploit renewable resources (Q. Yang et al., 2012 ). Local economies may need additional expertise in renewable technologies due to the natural resource industry's dominance as the principal product sector, low efficiency, and the diversion of potentially creative human capital to the central business sector. Thirdly, mineral resource locations impede technical advancements to increase resource and industrial efficiency since there are fewer resource limitations and fewer opportunities for such benefits in financial growth. Although previous research has explored the general patterns and possible advantages of this change, there needs to be more thorough empirical investigations that examine the detailed mechanisms and causal connections that drive this transition. There needs to be more comprehensive research that has specifically investigated the direct influence of trade dynamics on economic growth, diversification, and environmental sustainability in the evolving economic landscape of China. This gap in the literature highlights the necessity for a comprehensive and rigorous empirical study that verifies the conceptual debates and reveals the intricate mechanisms by which trade can successfully promote sustainable development goals. The potential to bridge this divide offers a potential avenue for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to utilize trade as a driver for China's enduring economic development.   3 Research methodology 3.1 Theoretical framework Numerous academic studies have examined the complex interactions that influence the relationship between economic growth, resource utilization, and environmental well-being (S. D. Zhang et al., 2021 ) .emphasize the significant importance of market capitalization in funding environmentally conscious technologies, emphasizing its potential to promote ecological sustainability. Moreover (Xing et al., 2023 ),highlights the apparent correlation between heightened financial support from investors and a company's propensity to allocate resources toward developing and implementing environmentally friendly technology. The present study examines the intricate relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Natural Resources (NR), and Renewable Energy (RE) in the specific context of China's economic environment. This study investigates the potential effects of stock market capitalization and the shift towards renewable energy sources on environmental considerations. According to (Zhou et al., 2022 )market capitalization is crucial in providing financial resources for investments in environmentally sustainable technologies and initiatives promoting environmental conservation. Businesses are motivated to allocate their resources towards environmentally friendly technologies when they receive additional funding from investors (Simar and Wilson, 1998 ). Increased market capitalization can result in heightened shareholder confidence, which may lead to cost reductions and decreased emissions. By increasing market capitalization, the financial obstacles to implementing environmentally friendly practise will likely diminish, thus helping to reduce the carbon footprint. The equation represents the relationship between the variables.(1) C O  2  e m i s s i o n s  i t   ∫ G D P , N R , X *      Where CO2  emissionsit , economic growth (GDP), and natural resources (NR) are the variables under consideration. With the emergence of new ecological challenges, efforts to combat climate change face complexities. Technological advancements contribute to improvements in urban sanitation, air quality, and overall human well-being. These perspectives, when aligned with development theory, shed light on the evolving connection between current ecological concerns and their future trajectory. Crucially, the framework acknowledges the pivotal role of global trade in the larger context of battling global warming and ensuring ecological preservation. The study recognizes the intricate interplay of economic and environmental factors in shaping China's sustainable development trajectory.  3.2 Economic modeling and data This article examines the consequences of share sector valuation and the energy transition on the environment between 1990 and 2020 while considering the roles of financial development, foreign direct investment, renewable energy and natural resources efficiency.(2) C O  2  e m i s s i o n s  i t   = β 0  + β 1  G D P  i t   + β 2  R E  i t   + β 3  N R  i t   + β 4  F D I  i t   + μ i t        CO2 emissions are expressed as tons per person. Total rents from natural resources are expressed as a fraction of GDP. GDP per person in constant US dollars is used to track economic development. The market value of publicly traded domestic enterprises is sometimes expressed as a percentage of GDP. The proportion of GDP that comes from foreign commerce may be estimated (Gouveia et al., 2019 ) However, the rate of the energy transition is determined by dividing the percentage of total energy consumption that comes from renewable sources by the percentage of total energy consumption that comes from electricity generated using fossil fuels. Information on these factors may be found in the World Development Indicators.  3.3 Cross-section dependence tests We first test for cross-sectional dependency in the data before moving on to the panel data examination proper. Variables diffuse in time and space according to cross-sectional patterns. Strong and weak types of cross-sectional dependency are distinguished, and a connection is established between these ideas and spatial models. Long-term panels with a large cross-section may benefit from a scaled LM test. When the cross-sectional units are significant, but the temporal dimension is tiny, the size distortion results from unobserved individual-specific effects (Pesaran, 2004).recognized this limitation of the scaled LM test; thus, they created the CD test to compensate.(3) C D  ρ  = 2 N ( N − 1  )     ∑ i = 1  N − 1   ∑ j = i + 1  N  T i j   ρ ˆ  i j      → N ( 0,1 )        3.4 Slope heterogeneity In panel models, assuming that slope coefficients are similar across units may lead to erroneous parameter estimations since it ignores individual variability in actual assessments. The number of average effects, their implications, and the accuracy of predictions may all be skewed by pooling when slope heterogeneity is present (Bartiaux et al., 2021 ). Estimating average effects in a random factor model may be done reliably using pooled analysts with strictly exogenous regressors. A generalized version of test for slope homogeneity is needed for large data panels.(4) Δ ˜  = 1 N   ( ∑ i = 1  N  d ˜  i  − k 2   2 k  2    )        3.5 Unit root tests A valid unit root test must be performed to analyze panel data or time series properly. Non-stationary factors are efficient in the estimate if panel data are cointegrated (X. Yang et al., 2021 ). This analysis uses two-panel unit root tests—enhanced cross-sectional ISPs (CIPS) and augmented cross-sectional autoregressive distribution functions (CADF) that assume heterogeneity and similar autoregressive structures.(5) Δ C A  i t   = φ i t   + φ i t   Z i t − 1   + φ i t   C A  ‾  t − 1   + ∑ l − 0  p  φ i t   Δ C A  ‾   t − 1     + ∑ l − 0  p  φ i l   Δ C A  i t − 1     + μ i t       (6) C I P S  ˆ  = 1 N  ∑ i = l  n  C D F  i         3.6 Westerlund cointegration tests When the time series is moving linearly together, they stabilize. If two series are both unit-root non-stationary, then there is a linear combination that is unit-root stationary (Shaktawat and Vadhera, 2022 ). Using Wester Lund's panel cointegration tests of the second generation, we examine the long-run cointegration connection between underlying variables. Standard Westerlund shape is:(7) a i  ( L )  Δ y  i t   = δ l t   + δ 2 i   t + a i  ( y i t − 1   − β i ′  x i t − 1   + λ i  ( L )  ′  v i t   + e i t    )        3.7 Long-run estimators Two iterative processes jointly estimate the slope variables and stochastic trends. This means that both CupBC and CupFM are continuous-update estimators; the former is biased-corrected while the latter is fully-modified. We develop and determine the limiting distributions for these distributions. Both models are asymptotically unbiased and (mixed) regular. Hence a common test statistic may be used to conclude them. (Song et al., 2019 ). The analysts may be used when some variables are stationary, and others are not, as well as when all the elements are stationary. Countries need to take the long view if they want to implement measures that help economies comply with ecological commitments. CupFM, on the other hand, adjusts the information such that irrelevant characteristics do not affect the bounds. Both ‘always-updated’ processes need iteration (Bouzarovski et al., 2012 ). provided the following definition of a continuously updated estimator:(8) ( β ˆ  C u p   , F ˆ  C u p    )  = argmin 1 n T 2    ∑ i = 1   ( y i  − x i  β  )  ′  M F  ( y i  − x i  β  )    .     (9) β ˆ  = ( ∑ i − 1  n  x i ′  M F ˆ   x i    )  − 1   ∑ i = 1  n  x i ′  M F ˆ   y i  .       (10) F ˆ  V  n T   = [ 1 n T 2    ∑ i = 1  n  ( y i  − x i  β ˆ   )  ( y i  − x i  β ˆ   )  ′     ]  F ˆ  .      The research encompasses a temporal span from 1990 to 2020 and employs the methodology of panel data analysis. The data sources utilized in this study comprise the China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs), the National Bureau of Statistics of China, and China statistical yearbook is presented in Table 1  .   4 Results and discussion The variable CO2 exhibits a mean value of 0.529 and a standard deviation of 0.540. The minimum value is 0.000, while the maximum value is 1.000. The control variable, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exhibits a mean value of 0.040 and a standard deviation of 0.042. The lower bound of the observed values is 0.000, while the upper bound is 0.460. The control variable, NR, exhibits a mean value of 1.351 and a standard deviation of 0.482. The minimum value observed is 1.000, while the maximum value recorded is 2.000. The control variable, foreign direct investment (FDI), exhibits a mean value of 0.704 and a standard deviation of 0.460. The minimum value is 0.000, while the maximum value is 1.000. Finally, the variable RE exhibits a mean value of 4.529 and a standard deviation of 3.047. The lower bound of the observed values is 4.040, while the upper bound is 6.088. The average clean energy expenditure for technology is around 0.031, and the proportion of businesses actively innovating is about 39.3 percent. Businesses with lower energy use tend to be more innovative. In addition, companies that have run into cash flow issues have a wide range of values for the NR and RE indices is presented in Table 2  . The results of the cross-sectional dependency test on the variables CO2, GDP, NR, FDI, and RE are shown in Table 3  . The test determines if these variables are cross-sectionally dependent and outputs matching p-values and correlation coefficients (Chang, Saydaliev, et al., 2022 ). As shown by the low p-values for all examined variables, the findings show a strong cross-sectional dependency among the variables. Additionally, demonstrating the existence of cross-sectional dependency, the CD-test statistics are much higher than the crucial levels. The correlation coefficients show the degree and direction of the correlations between the variables. The association between GDP, FDI, and CO2 emissions is positive and somewhat significant (correlation coefficient = 0.430 and 0.370, respectively). This shows a tendency for CO2 emissions to rise along with GDP and FDI. This result is consistent with other studies showing a connection between economic development, FDI, and environmental deterioration. Additionally, while at a lower level, GDP and NR show a positive link (correlation coefficient = 0.160). This suggests that nations with larger GDPs rely more heavily on natural resources. This result is in line with the idea that natural resources are essential for economic growth, especially in resource-rich nations (Chang et al., 2023 ). The variable RE, which can stand for renewable energy, has an interestingly high correlation value of 0.944 with the other variables. This implies a close relationship between renewable energy and the other variables the investigation looked at. The strong association coefficient suggests that nations with high GDP, NR, FDI, and CO2 emissions also often embrace renewable energy sources at a greater rate. According to this study (Lv et al., 2022 ), nations actively look into renewable energy solutions to address environmental issues and advance sustainable development. Overall, the cross-sectional dependency test findings show how closely linked CO2 emissions, GDP, NR, FDI, and RE. These variables exhibit strong cross-sectional dependency but are not entirely independent. The results highlight the significance of considering these components' interdependencies and linkages when creating policies and strategies to achieve sustainable development objectives, especially in environmental sustainability, economic growth, and energy transition. The results of the test for slope heterogeneity are shown in Table 3 . The test aims to determine if there is a significant difference between groups or categories in the slopes of the regression model. The calculated delta values and associated p-values are shown in Table 4  . The data's substantial delta values and very low p-values strongly suggest slope heterogeneity. The slopes between the various groups or categories under study vary significantly, according to the delta estimates and p-values. Understanding the correlation between the independent and dependent variables in the regression model is significantly impacted by this fact. It implies that there is not a constant or uniform connection between these variables across all groups. Instead, there are notable variations in how the independent variable affects the dependent variable among various categories or subgroups. The results of unit root analyses performed on the variables CO2, GDP, NR, FDI, and RE are shown in Table 4 . The test statistics and corresponding p-values for several unit root test techniques, such as CIPS and CADF, are shown in the table (Iqbal et al., 2019 ). According to the findings' negative test statistics and significant p-values, all variables show signs of stationarity. The results of the test show that the variables do not follow a random walk but rather a stationary process. For instance, the CO2 variable exhibits significant p-values for the CIPS test statistic of −3.280 and the CADF test statistic of −3.739. This suggests that CO2 emissions are stable and lack systematic outliers or long-term trends. Similar trends are shown for GDP, NR, FDI, and RE, and significant test statistics and p-values indicate stationarity. These discoveries are significant in the context of time series analysis and econometric modeling. Regression model variables should have stationarity property since it assures that the relationships between the variables are stable throughout time. The existence of stationary variables enables precise coefficient estimates and result interpretation. According to earlier studies (Xia et al., 2020 ) (D. S. Zhang et al., 2021 ), the results of the unit root test support evidence of stationarity in variables including CO2 emissions, GDP, natural resources, foreign direct investment, and renewable energy (Ikram et al., 2019 ). This suggests that these variables follow a stationary process rather than a stochastic trend. These results underline the consistency of the correlations between the variables across time and have implications for the effective modeling and analysis of these variables in empirical investigations. The findings of the Cup-FM (Cross-Sectionally Augmented Panel Fisher-type) and Cup-BC (Cross-Sectionally Augmented Panel Breusch-Cochran) tests are displayed in Table 5  . These tests evaluate the soundness of the fixed-effects model employed in this research. The tests aim to assess the existence of cross-sectional dependence within the panel data. The findings demonstrate statistically significant coefficients for the variables that were examined. The variable CO2, representing carbon dioxide emissions, exhibits a negative and statistically significant coefficient of −0.00477*** in the Cup-FM model and −0.00405*** in the Cup-BC model. Likewise, the variable representing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exhibits a negative and statistically significant coefficient of −0.00581*** in the Cup-FM model and −0.00495*** in the Cup-BC model. The coefficient for natural resources (NR) exhibits a negative and statistically significant relationship, with values of −0.0514*** in Cup-FM and −0.04705*** in Cup-BC. This implies that the presence and utilization of natural resources significantly influence the resulting carbon emissions. Regarding foreign direct investment (FDI), it is worth noting that the coefficient exhibits a positive and highly significant relationship. Precisely, in the Cup-FM model, the coefficient is estimated to be 0.86451***, while in the Cup-BC model, it is estimated to be 0.89145***. This underscores the significant impact of international investments within the carbon emissions framework. Regarding the renewable energy variable (RE), it is noteworthy that the coefficient exhibits a positive and statistically significant relationship. Specifically, the coefficient values are 0.07944*** in Cup-FM and 0.08175*** in Cup-BC. This statement highlights the significant role of adopting renewable energy in reducing carbon emissions. In general, the findings derived from the Cup-FM and Cup-BC examinations provide validation for the durability of the fixed-effects model and emphasize the importance of several factors, such as GDP, natural resources, foreign direct investment, and renewable energy, in influencing carbon emissions outcomes within the analyzed panel data. Negative coefficients for CO2, GDP, and NR, along with positive coefficients for FDI and RE, offer valuable insights into the complex interplay between carbon emissions, economic indicators, and environmental factors. In addition, there is a substantial negative correlation between RE and FDI over the long term. Consequently, more patent recognition for clean and green energy across China nations helps minimize natural footprints, leading to more sustainable outcomes. For example, a t-score of 6.518 indicates a significant difference in the relative change in RE due to FDI. The positive effect of RE on ecological sustainability arises from the fact that a technology advancement is an effective tool for preventing ecological deterioration and promoting long-term economic growth. The robustness check, which looks at the correlations between the variables CO2, GDP, NR, FDI, and RE and their coefficients, is summarized in Table 6  . The robust regression model estimates the coefficients and the t-statistics show that they are statistically significant. In both models, the CO2 coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% level, demonstrating a substantial correlation between CO2 emissions and the other variables. The coefficient's negative sign implies that a rise in CO2 emissions is correlated with a fall in the other variables, including GDP, NR, FDI, and RE. The GDP coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% level in both models. The coefficient's negative sign shows that GDP and the other variables have an inverse connection. This suggests that the other factors, such as CO2 emissions, NR, FDI, and RE, tend to decline as GDP rises. In both models, the coefficient for NR is statistically significant at the 1% level. The coefficient's negative sign shows that a rise in NR is correlated with a fall in the other factors, including CO2 emissions, GDP, FDI, and RE. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that resource-rich nations may struggle to achieve sustainable development because of possible resource reliance and environmental deterioration (Chang, Taghizadeh-Hesary, et al., 2022 ). In both models, the coefficient for FDI is statistically significant at the 1% level. The coefficient's positive sign suggests that a rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) is correlated with increases in CO2 emissions, GDP, NR, and RE. Although FDI may support economic development if not backed by sensible environmental laws and sustainable practices, it might also result in environmental pressures (Y. Zhang and Dilanchiev, 2022 ). In both models, the coefficient for RE is statistically significant at the 1% level. The coefficient's positive sign shows that rising levels of renewable energy (RE) are correlated with rising levels of other factors, including CO2 emissions, GDP, NR, and FDI. According to this research, resource consumption and increasing economic activity may be associated with using renewable energy sources, which may help mitigate climate change. Overall, the robustness check's findings show the importance of the connections between CO2 emissions, GDP, NR, FDI, and RE. These results show how crucial it is to consider these factors and how they interact when pursuing sustainable development objectives (Y. Liu et al., 2022 ). In contrast to our findings, the theoretical underpinnings of the STIRPAT model suggest that energy patents do not reliably prevent ecological contamination. On the other hand, patents from research facilities and businesses demonstrate a constructive contribution to limiting ecological degradation. The RE gained from university study amplifies this beneficial impact. In addition (Kabir and Morgan, 2021 ), also state that technological advancements' value in combating climate change while achieving energy goals is generally acknowledged. When controlling for other variables, the findings demonstrate that a one percentage point shift in RE and NRR leads to a 0.171% and 0.158% shift in FDI across China (Yoshino et al., 2021 ) Therefore, the link between the environment and GCF varies from one economy to another depending on its degree of growth and its process.  5 Conclusions and policy implications This study investigated the transition from reliance on natural resources to the dynamics of trade in China between the years 1990 and 2020, employing a panel data model. The findings provide valuable insights into the correlation between trade dynamics and achieving sustainable development goals. The findings suggest a significant transformation in China's economic composition, characterized by a shift away from a predominant dependence on natural resources towards a more trade-centric economic model. As mentioned earlier, the transition demonstrates a positive trajectory towards achieving sustainable development objectives, as it facilitates the expansion of economic activities, mitigates the adverse environmental impacts linked to resource extraction, and cultivates the ability to adapt and withstand global challenges. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the pivotal significance of trade dynamics in propelling China's economic expansion and making substantial contributions to preserving the environment. The analysis presents evidence of a direct relationship between trade openness and various sustainable development measures, including environmental performance and social well-being. This implies that trade can catalyze attaining sustainable development goals through its facilitation of economic growth, transfer of knowledge, and advancement of technology. The findings of the analysis indicated a significant correlation between trade liberalization and the progress of technology. The research revealed that heightened levels of trade integration played a significant role in enabling the exchange of knowledge and technology, fostering innovation and enhancing productivity. This statement underscores the significance of trade in propelling technological advancement and cultivating economic expansion. The study's findings indicate that trade dynamics exert a substantial influence on employment patterns. The research revealed a positive correlation between trade openness and employment generation, particularly in industries that exhibit a higher reliance on international trade. This implies that trade has the potential to foster inclusive economic growth, generate employment prospects, and thereby contribute to social progress and the alleviation of poverty. The research has successfully identified the significance of institutional support and policy frameworks in effectively utilizing the advantages of trade for sustainable development. Effective governance, robust regulatory frameworks, and supportive institutions have been identified as crucial factors in ensuring that trade contributes to sustainable outcomes, including the protection of the environment, social inclusivity, and the fair distribution of benefits. The findings of this study have two policy implications. To begin with, policymakers must accord priority to policies that foster trade liberalization and the incorporation of sustainable development principles into trade strategies. This encompasses promoting environmentally friendly trade practices, providing support to industries that exhibit significant potential for sustainable growth, and cultivating innovation and research in sustainable technologies. Furthermore, it is imperative to enhance policy coherence and coordination across diverse sectors to ensure that trade policies align with the goals of sustainable development. This entails incorporating environmental, social, and economic factors into trade agreements, establishing and implementing stringent environmental regulations, and advocating for responsible business conduct across global value chains. It would be advantageous to undertake comprehensive investigations focused on particular sectors or industries to advance future research. These studies would deepen our understanding of the mechanisms and factors contributing to the shift from reliance on natural resources to trade dynamics. Furthermore, a thorough examination of the societal and distributive consequences of this transition, including the effects on income inequality and employment patterns, would contribute to a more comprehensive comprehension of its ramifications. In addition, future scholarly investigations may focus on assessing the efficacy of different policy measures and interventions designed to foster sustainable trade and tackle environmental issues. This would provide policymakers with the means to evaluate the efficacy and consequences of various policy strategies and discern optimal methods for attaining sustainable development via trade. In summary, this research underscores the importance of transitioning from reliance on natural resources to establishing trade dynamics in China's efforts to achieve sustainable development objectives. The findings highlight the beneficial impact of trade on fostering economic growth, diversification, and environmental sustainability. The policy implications underscore the necessity of implementing integrated and cohesive policies that precede sustainable trade practices. Future research should prioritize exploring and refining our comprehension regarding this transition, thereby facilitating policymakers in making well-informed decisions and promoting the advancement of sustainable development agendas.
