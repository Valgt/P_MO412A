                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been adopted by countries and corporates across the world, including the major mining companies. This study contributes to the operationalisation of the SDGs in the mining industry by defining and measuring a set of SDG indicators for mining host communities. It identifies 15 dimensions in 13 SDGs and measures 11 socio-economic indicators (income, household goods, health, education, gender equality, water, sanitation, electricity, employment, housing, and internet access) for 95 mining host communities across South Africa. These communities are located near 198 large-scale mines and are home to over 5.6 million people. Data for the 11 indicators were visualised in ‘barometers of well-being’ for different commodities and types of communities. The results provide the first comparison of living standards of all mining host communities in South Africa, with notable differences highlighting the impact of South Africa's past policies of racial segregation and discrimination. In line with the SDG vision to leave no-one behind, this novel SDG barometer for the mining industry focuses on communities rather than companies. It highlights the importance of data disaggregation and sectoral reporting, and the opportunity the SDGs present for improved monitoring of the minerals industry to promote inclusive socio-economic development.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been adopted by countries and corporates across the world, including the major mining companies. This study contributes to the operationalisation of the SDGs in the mining industry by defining and measuring a set of SDG indicators for mining host communities. It identifies 15 dimensions in 13 SDGs and measures 11 socio-economic indicators (income, household goods, health, education, gender equality, water, sanitation, electricity, employment, housing, and internet access) for 95 mining host communities across South Africa. These communities are located near 198 large-scale mines and are home to over 5.6 million people. Data for the 11 indicators were visualised in ‘barometers of well-being’ for different commodities and types of communities. The results provide the first comparison of living standards of all mining host communities in South Africa, with notable differences highlighting the impact of South Africa's past policies of racial segregation and discrimination. In line with the SDG vision to leave no-one behind, this novel SDG barometer for the mining industry focuses on communities rather than companies. It highlights the importance of data disaggregation and sectoral reporting, and the opportunity the SDGs present for improved monitoring of the minerals industry to promote inclusive socio-economic development.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Mineral resources  Community well-being  South Africa  Data disaggregation    1 Introduction The global ‘Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development’ and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were developed through a three-year international process that engaged stakeholders from national governments, multilateral organisations, academia, civil society, and the private sector. They were adopted by the 193 countries of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015 and represent an unprecedented global commitment to poverty alleviation, environmental protection, equality, peace and justice (UN General Assembly 2015 ). The SDGs build upon the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and on existing international treaties but have put equity at the core, the aim is to ‘leave no-one behind’. The 17 SDGs are wide-ranging and address environmental, social and economic challenges through 169 targets and 251 global indicators (UN Statistical Commission 2020 ), which are defined as Tier I or Tier II indicators based on availability of data (IAEG-SDGs 2020 ). In addition, the SDG indicators should be disaggregated, where relevant, by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other nationally relevant characteristics. All signatory countries have committed to operationalising the SDGs by defining, monitoring and annually reporting on national and sub-national indicators and targets until 2030. This is a huge task, particularly for poorer countries, and financial, technical and academic support is needed (SDSN 2015 ). Whilst overall responsibility lies with national governments, the SDGs cannot be achieved without a concerted effort by business and other organisations (Adams 2017 ). When the SDGs were adopted in 2015, 71% of surveyed business leaders were planning to engage with the goals, however, only 13% felt they had the tools to do so (PWC 2015 ). The majority of companies use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines or standards for their sustainability reports (WBCSD 2017 ). Since 2015, the GRI has partnered with the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to develop the SDG Compass (GRI et al. 2015 ), a SDG analysis report and a practical guide to defining priorities and reporting on the SDGs for business (GRI and UN Global Compact 2017 ; GRI and UN Global Compact 2018 ). This includes a list of GRI indicators that could be used to report on various SDG targets (GRI 2020 ), with the aim being to create a harmonised indicator set and methodology for companies to report on their contributions to the SDGs. Since the inception of the Mining and Metals for Sustainable Development (MMSD) initiative in the late 1990s, there has been a proliferation of sustainability initiatives in the mining industry, and the SDGs provide a useful focal point for company level impacts and broader societal aspects of sustainable development (Sturman et al., 2018 ). The SDGs are also a potential avenue for mining companies to build trust with their host communities and make progress towards achieving their ‘social licence to operate’ (Fraser 2019 ). As the need for minerals and metal continues to grow globally (Dunbar et al., 2020 ), the mining industry has significant potential to contribute to achieving the SDGs by providing raw materials for technological progress, economic growth and human development (Vidal et al., 2013 ; Elshkaki et al., 2016 ), royalties and taxes (which in turn support national government efforts), employment, infrastructure and corporate social investment, and also by operating sustainably (avoiding negative social, environmental and governance impacts) (Sturman et al., 2018 ). Mine sites and associated processing plants often operate for long periods of time and can have significant positive and negative impacts on local communities, economies and ecosystems. The SDGs require collective, collaborative and coordinated efforts by public and private parties (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ) and mining companies are well-placed to do so given their experience working with governments, civil society, and development agencies to obtain their licence to operate (ICMM 2018 ). There are many examples of mining companies creating shared value for themselves and their host communities, such as education and health facilities and programmes, water supply and wastewater treatment plants, which all contribute to achieving the SDGs (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ; Broadhurst 2019 ; Kumi et al., 2020 ). All the major mining companies have committed to supporting the SDGs, though this ranges from simple SDG mapping to embedding the SDGs in business strategy (Chicksen et al., 2018 ). Although companies are increasingly aligning their sustainability reporting with the SDGs, they often highlight the positive contributions while omitting any negative impacts that would hinder progress towards the SDGs (Responsible Mining Foundation 2020 ). The Responsible Mining Index 2020 showed a disconnect between company-wide policies and standards versus on-the-ground actions at mining sites, and there is little or no evidence of sharing mine-site-level information on issues of strong public interest for neighbouring communities, workers, governments and investors (Responsible Mining Foundation 2020 ). The white paper ‘Mapping Mining to the Sustainable Development Goals: An Atlas’ (CCSI et al. 2016 ) illustrated how large-scale mining companies could contribute to achieving the SDGs, while Mancini and Sala (2018)  mapped the social impacts of mining to SDG targets, GRI indicators and EU policy. The positive and negative contributions of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) on the SDGs have also been discussed (Hilson and Maconachie 2020 ; Hirons 2020 ), with the recent comprehensive assessment from PACT filling the gap left by the Atlas (De Haan et al. 2020 ). Whilst these studies indicate that the operationalisation of the SDGs could assist the mining industry to play a transformative role in economic and social development, there is currently a lack of relevant SDG indicators and databases to support such endeavours (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ; Hirons 2020 ). South Africa has a long history of mining which has played a fundamental role in its economic development. While mining companies in South Africa subscribe to voluntary sustainability reporting, they are also required by law to contribute to the socio-economic development of their host communities and labour sending areas. The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) of 2002 eliminated private ownership of mineral rights and vested it in the people of South Africa under the custodianship of the State (Government of South Africa 2002 ). The MPRDA focuses on redressing historical inequalities and ensuring the mining industry contributes to socio-economic development. The MPRDA is effected through the ‘Broad-Based Black Socio-Economic Empowerment Charter for the Mining and Minerals Industry’, commonly known as the Mining Charter (DMR 2018a ), the Guideline for Implementation of a Social and Labour Plan (DMR 2010a ) and the Housing and Living Conditions Standard (DMR 2019 ). Together with the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) and the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA), the MPRDA and its regulations and guidelines address all of the SDGs (see Table 1  ), although not all of the SDG targets. South Africa is therefore well placed to pioneer work on reporting on the SDGs in the mining industry. This paper seeks to contribute to the operationalisation of the SDGs in mineral resource-rich countries by identifying and measuring relevant socio-economic SDG indicators in mining host communities across South Africa. Section 2  provides a background on the mining industry and mining communities in South Africa. Section 3  describes the methods used, while Section 4  summarises and visualises the results. Section 5  discusses the results in light of SDG monitoring and reporting, the role of mining in community development, and future research.  2 Background – mining in South Africa 2.1 Mineral resources and development South Africa has a remarkable number of world class mineral deposits – gold in the Witwatersrand Basin, platinum group metals (PGMs), chromium, vanadium-bearing titanium ores and industrial minerals (fluorspar and andalusite) in the Bushveld Complex, manganese and iron ore in the Transvaal Supergroup, coal and anthracite in the Karoo Basin, copper and phosphate in the Palabora Igneous Complex, diamonds in kimberlite pipes and alluvial deposits, and ilmenite, rutile and zircon in heavy minerals sands (DMR 2018b ). South Africa is the world's biggest producer of PGMs (48%), chrome (44%) and manganese ore (31%); it also contributes significantly to global production of gold, coal, iron ore, diamonds, vanadium and titanium minerals. As a result, mining has played a significant role in the socio-economic development of South Africa. In 2017, the mining industry contributed R335 billion (USD19.5 billion) to GDP (6.8%) and R126 billion was paid to 464,667 employees (4.8% of national non-agricultural labour force), supporting roughly 4.5 million dependents (MCSA 2018 ). The industry paid R26.6 billion in taxes and royalties and spent R300 billion on goods and services and R9 billion on skills development and community development (MCSA 2018 ). However, South Africa's mining industry has seen declining production, exploration expenditure and employment in recent years, due to rising operating costs and declining capital investment amidst an uncertain regulatory framework (DMR 2018b ). Despite the huge mineral wealth in South Africa and progressive pro-poor legislation promulgated since the first democratic elections in 1994, more than 55% of the population live below the national poverty line (DPME 2017 ) and 30% of the labour force (excluding discouraged jobseekers) are unemployed (StatsSA 2020 ). South Africa is an extremely unequal country with one of the world's highest Gini coefficients (a measure of income inequality) at 0.64 (DPME 2017 ). This inequality is evident across provinces, districts, municipalities and wards, which have varying standards of living that reflect the legacy of Apartheid spatial planning (Cole et al., 2018 ).  2.2 Mining host communities in South Africa In South Africa, a Social and Labour Plan (SLP) is required for a company to be granted a mining right. The SLP sets out how the company intends sharing the benefits of mining with the mine communities (CALS 2016 ), which include host communities as well as labour sending areas which are defined as areas from which a majority of mineworkers, both historical and current are or have been sourced (DMR 2010a ). To develop the SLP, mining companies are expected to consult the mine communities, and the SLP should provide socio-economic baseline information and the needs of the community (DMR 2010a ). This is often done at the municipality level rather than the individual community level, and most SLPs do not define the mine communities and seldom describe any community engagement (CALS 2016 ). In addition, the Housing and Living Conditions Standard, 2019, requires mining companies to ensure that their employees have adequate housing with access to electricity, piped water, sanitation and roads, as well as healthcare services and sufficient, balanced nutrition (DMR 2019 ). To contribute to assessing the well-being of mine communities across South Africa, the authors previously outlined South Africa's mining history and identified and mapped all mining host communities (cities, towns, townships and mine villages) across South Africa, based on where large-scale mining of the major commodities takes place (Cole and Broadhurst 2020 ). This map has been updated with a few additional communities (Fig. 1  ). The 95 communities are close to 198 operating mines run by 73 mining companies and producing 17 main commodities – coal, gold, diamonds, PGMs, chrome, nickel, copper, iron ore, manganese, vanadium, heavy minerals (ilmenite, rutile, zirconium), lead, zinc, silver and fluorspar. The communities host a total population of 5648,137 (10.9% of South Africa's total in 2011) and cover an area of 9193 km2  (0.75% of South Africa). The biggest populations are found in coal (42%), gold (27%), platinum (16%) and diamond (8%) mining areas. These mining host communities were classified based on their origins, their population size and the level of influence of mining on the community (based on duration of mining, remoteness, proximity to the mine, number of mines, and years the community preceded mining), and they take four different forms (Cole and Broadhurst 2020 ). First, there are seven ‘co-established cities ’ that grew and developed alongside mining operations and are no longer dependant on mining. These communities (Vereeniging, Rustenburg, Newcastle, eMalahleni/Witbank, Klerksdorp, Kimberley, Welkom) have been close to mining operations for an average of 120 years and are home to over 2.3 million people. Second, there are nine ‘large mining towns ’ (population greater than 50,000 and less than 200,000) where mining led to the development of the town and mining still dominates, although other sectors and/or industries exist. They have seen at least 60 years of mining, are less than a kilometre from a mining operation and are home to almost one million people. Third, there are 42 ‘small mining towns ’ or mine villages that exist mainly for the mining operations and more than half of them are in remote locations. These communities are usually adjacent to the mine and home to over 800,000 people. Fourth, there are 37 diverse ‘pre-existing communities ’ that existed before mining operations began in the area but are now located nearby mine operations and are impacted by mining to varying degrees. They are home to over 1.5 million people and include one city (Mahikeng), 10 large towns, 21 small towns and five rural villages or townships. Four of the large mining towns (Phalaborwa, Sasolburg, Secunda and Stilfontein) and 13 of the small mining towns (Indwe; Aggeneys; Lime Acres; iron ore mining towns Kathu, Ellisras and Thabazimbi; PGM/chrome mining villages Amandelbult, Swartklip and Ruighoek; and gold mining villages Doornfontein, Driefontein, Elandsrand and Western Deep Levels) could be described as ‘open company towns’ where the company built and managed the town to house mine workers – the only ‘closed company towns’ are no longer operational (Littlewood 2014 ). Although mining companies played a significant role in the development of other towns, they were not owned or managed by the companies (van Eeden 1997 ; Cairncross 2004 ; Marais and Nel 2016 ; Van Eeden and Khaba 2016 ). In addition, the complexities of racial segregation in South Africa mean that many of these towns have associated townships established for black mine workers, which were not given the same level of services as the white-only mining towns. The early development of urban mining areas in South Africa was shaped by a race-based, institutionalised migrant labour system designed to control rural black labour and channel it to particular sectors (Mabin 1991 ; Bundy and Cobbing 2019 ). Thus the black workforce commuted long distances from rural areas and were accommodated in mine-owned compounds or hostels, while the white workforce lived in purpose-built mining towns (Marais et al., 2018 ). Racial segregation was enforced in all urban areas in South Africa, with white people living in suburbs - ‘places of aspiration, consumption and modern order based on urban planning and state regulation’ and black people living in townships - typically designed as labour dormitories, with ‘matchbox houses’ and grid-like dusty streets (Bezuidenhout and Buhlungu 2015 ). When the government gave up influx control in the mid-1980s, informal settlements grew up on the outskirts of the townships. The legacy of these racist policies are still very evident today in many areas of social and economic development included to the SDGs, such as access to basic services (Nnadozie 2011 ; Cole et al., 2018 ).   3 Methods 3.1 Delineation of mining host communities The 95 mining host communities (cities, towns and townships, mine villages) in this study were identified based on where large-scale mining of South Africa's major commodities currently takes place, as shown in Fig. 1 . They were identified through a literature review of Minerals Council South Africa (MCSA) commodity summaries (MCSA 2019a ; MCSA 2019b ; MCSA 2019c ; MCSA 2019d ), the national Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) list of operating mines (DMR 2018c ), DMR commodity reports (DMR 2008 ; DMR 2009 ; DMR 2010c ; DMR 2010b ; DMR 2012 ; DMR 2013a ; DMR 2013b ; DMR 2014b ; DMR 2014c ; DMR 2014a ; DMR 2016 ), numerous academic papers, mining company websites, and media reports for more recent information. Mines that are currently operating or were operational in the past ten years were included. Information collected for each community included the names of the operating mines (limited to the past 10 years) and their mining companies, the commodity mined, the mining method/s, the year operations began, their population and the number of households in 2011. The mining host community boundaries were defined by the ‘main place’ boundaries drawn by Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) for the 2011 national census. Main places are small towns, rural villages, and townships and suburbs in large towns and cities. They are often subdivided into ‘sub places’, which can be specific areas like mines, compounds and nature reserves. Some mines and mine villages are located in the ‘non-urban’ (NU) main places that are defined for each local municipality (South Africa has 226 local municipalities and eight metropolitan municipalities). The mine sub places and affected rural villages (and not the whole NU main place which can extend beyond the mine zone of influence) were included in the mining community. Overall, 84% of the population in the mining host communities was defined as urban. The choice of which main places to include was based on the distance from the mine, distance from the main town or city, knowledge of the community, and assessment of the community and area in Google Earth.  3.2 Indicator selection and data collection Indicator selection was based on a review of the SDG Indicators Baseline Report for South Africa (StatsSA 2017 ), the South African Index of Multiple Deprivation, SAIMD (Noble et al., 2009 ), the official South African Multidimensional Poverty Index, SAMPI (StatsSA 2014 ), the latest Development Indicators Report published by the Department for Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) in the Presidency (DPME 2017 ), the Housing and Living Conditions Standard for the Minerals Industry, 2019 (DMR 2019 ), and the data available at the community level i.e. in the national census. Fifteen dimensions were identified within 13 SDGs - household income (SDG 1), household goods (SDG 1), food security (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), water access (SDG 6), sanitation (SDG 6), electricity access (SDG 7), employment (SDG 8), access to transport (SDG 9), income inequality (SDG 10), housing (SDG 11), safety (SDG 16) and internet access (SDG 17), and 11 indicators were defined, shown in Table 2  . Although there is no SDG indicator for household goods, it is included in the SAIMD and the SAMPI as they are considered good proxies for income. They are particularly useful SDG 1 indicators at the local level as the income indicator is limited to income brackets used in the Census rather than the national poverty lines used in national assessments. Unfortunately, there is insufficient community level data available for food security (SDG 2), access to transport (SDG 9), income inequality (SDG 10), and safety (SDG 16), although annual national household surveys are conducted by StatsSA on these domains. Details on the reviewed reports and indicator selection are provided in the Supplementary Information with SAIMD and SAMPI indicators compared in Table S1 and SDG indicators given in Table S2. Main place and sub place data in StatsSA's SuperCross Census 2011 Community Profile Database were obtained from DataFirst at the University of Cape Town, which provides online access to household survey data in South Africa and Africa (DataFirst 2018 ). In total, data were collected for 66 sub places, 361 main places, 57 local municipalities, two metropolitan municipalities and 27 district municipalities spread across all nine provinces of South Africa. The municipality level data on female representation in local government were obtained from the non-financial municipal census of 2011/12 (StatsSA 2013 ). A limitation on the study was that the census does not include data on education, health, employment and income for collective living quarters and industrial areas (such as mine compounds and some mine villages) because a different census questionnaire is used for ‘institutions’. When aggregating data for main places, the institutional population is assigned the ‘not applicable’ category despite it being relevant. In the communities in this study, 144,122 people lived in collective living quarters and 41,411 people lived in industrial areas, together constituting 3.2% of the total. When calculating percentages, the ‘not applicable’ category was excluded from the total to avoid underestimating the results.  3.3 Data analysis A score out of 10 was calculated for each community simply as the sum of all 11 indicators divided by 110, with equal weighting given to each indicator. This was used to rank the communities from the highest level of well-being to the lowest level of well-being, and to perform correlation analysis for the different indicators and parameters used in classifying the communities. Correlation analysis was also done on the SDG indicators and the overall score. The results for the mining host communities were compared to the same data for the local and district municipalities that they were situated in, and the national figures, which is the typical reporting level for the SDGs. The data were plotted on radar plots to create ‘barometers of well-being’ that both communicate the results more easily and facilitate comparison between communities and commodities. The comparison is as useful or more so than the individual barometers as it gives relative well-being and reduces the influence of the national circumstances on the analysis. These barometers measure progress from the centre towards an acceptable target or social floor, on the outer ring of the plot. In plotting the data on barometers, the actual percentages were used for all but gender equality, as the target is 50% female representation in local government, not 100%. The gender equality value was therefore doubled for the barometer plot.   4 Results The results for all 95 mining communities are summarised in Table 3  , which shows the descriptive statistics for the whole dataset, as well as the overall values for the main commodities and the four community types. It also gives the results for the local municipalities that the mining host communities are located in, and the figures for South Africa as a whole. The individual indicator results are summarised and visualised in radar plots or ‘barometers of wellbeing’; Fig. 2   compares the all 95 mining host communities to South Africa, Fig. 3   compares the community with the highest well-being score (Aggeneys in Northern Cape) and lowest well-being score (Bekkersdal in Gauteng), and Fig. 4   compares the main commodities, coal, gold, PGMs and chromium, and diamonds. The well-being score of each community is plotted in Figs. 5  , 6 and 7    to show the range in the overall results and how the different community type, commodity and mining methods compare. The full list of mining host communities, their main places, local municipalities and all associated data are given in the Supplementary Tables S3, S4 and S5. The results show that there are very low levels of internet access (34.3%) and secondary education (42.2%) across mining host communities, although this can vary significantly, ranging from 17.4% to 78.9%. Unlike most of the other indicators, these are lower than the local municipality the community is situated in. The highest levels of well-being are found in electricity access (88.5%), piped water access in dwelling or yard (86.6%), formal housing (82.4%) and adequate sanitation (76.5%) but there is even greater variation between communities (e.g. 93.6% for sanitation, access to a toilet), and over 700,000 people are living without these basic services and living standards. These indicators are all higher than the host local municipality, which in turn are higher than South African figures. Despite their location near a large-scale mine, 36.3% of the labour force is unemployed, although this is slightly lower than the surrounding local municipalities and South Africa as a whole. The health indicator (SDG 3) shows 30.6% of the mining host community population have a disability, although this is only 2% lower than the value for the local municipality and 1% lower than the country. For SDG 1, an average of 59.1% of mining host community households have an annual household income greater than R19,600 and 66.1% own a refrigerator. While there is a similar range in these indicators, the former is higher than the local municipality while the latter is lower. The significant range in indicators of community well-being is best illustrated in Fig. 4 , which compares the small mining town of Aggeneys, which has the highest overall score (8.2), with the large township of Bekkersdal, which has the lowest overall score (4.0). Aggeneys is a very remote mining town (a company town) in the Northern Cape province with a small population of 2272. It was built to support mining at Black Mountain base metals mine which has been operating since 1980 and currently employs 1804 people. Bekkersdal on the other hand is a large township of 47,213 people in 2011 in Gauteng province between the city of Johannesburg and the gold mining town of Westonaria. It was established in 1945 to provide accommodation for black Africans working at the nearby gold mines (van Eeden 2017) and has been affected by the steady decline in gold mining in the region. So, despite both communities being close to operating mines for decades, their origins and politics have had a much bigger impact on their well-being. Other communities at the top end of the range are Mtunzini and Richards Bay (KwaZulu-Natal heavy minerals), Carletonville and Welverdiend (West Wits gold), Alexander Bay (west coast diamonds), Hotazel (Northern Cape manganese) and Swartklip (North West platinum). The other communities at the lower end are the Khutsong (West Wits gold), Hlobane (KwaZulu-Natal coal), Mabeleleng, Marikana, Northam, Bapong and Modderspruit (North West platinum and chrome). As most South African towns have associated townships with poorer living conditions, the well-being score is generally an average of quite unequal areas within the same community. The inequality is evident when viewing the main places on their own, as evident in the SI Table S4, where the overall well-being ranges from 1.9 (a township near Rustenburg) to 9.4 (a suburb in Sasolburg) out of 10. The communities at the top and bottom end of the range are either townships on their own, or small mining towns with no township. There was no significant correlation between overall well-being score and population or the five quantifiable parameters used in the mining host community classification (duration of mining, remoteness, proximity to the mine, number of mines, and years the community preceded mining), as shown in Supplementary Figures S1 to S6. The strongest correlation with the indicators that make up the overall well-being score was piped water access and adequate sanitation (R2  = 0.5416), followed by formal housing (R2  = 0.4967), ownership of a refrigerator (R2  = 0.4807), secondary education (R2  = 0.4807) and internet access (R2  = 0.4766), as shown in Supplementary Figures S7 to S16.  5 Discussion 5.1 Achieving the SDGs in mining host communities in South Africa This study has provided a unique insight into the different aspects of community well-being and progress towards the SDGs in mining host communities in South Africa. Given the extreme income inequality (DPME 2017 ) and non-income inequality (Bhorat et al., 2015 ; Cole et al., 2018 ) in the country, the significant range in levels of well-being are not surprising. The comparison between the best and the worst off communities highlights the continuing influence of oppressive government policies of racial segregation and discrimination in the 20th century. The very low levels of internet access (SDG 17) and secondary education (SDG 4) across communities are concerning as these are both enablers for achieving other SDGs, most notably decent jobs (SDG 8) and eliminating poverty (SDG 1). The results show that despite being located close to large-scale mining operations, 36% of the labour force in mining host communities are unemployed. As the mining industry in South Africa is a significant employer, this speaks to the significant national challenge of unemployment, which has reached its highest levels in over a decade (StatsSA 2020 ). The lack of universal service delivery, access to piped water (SDG 6.1), adequate sanitation (SDG 6.2) and electricity (SDG 7), also hinders progress on other SDGs, particularly health (SDG 3), food security (SDG 2), education (SDG 4) and gender equality (SDG 5) (UN Water 2016 ; World Bank 2017 ). This is partly due to in-migration and population growth that exceeds the government's ability to deliver services (Nnadozie 2011 ). These are all areas where mining companies could support local government in improving the lives of their host communities, and this is reflected in many SLPs (CALS 2017 ). The results and barometers enable a rapid comparison of communities hosting different commodities and of different types. The six iron ore and manganese communities have the highest levels of well-being, probably because they are all fairly small and located in remote locations in the Northern Cape and Limpopo, and do not attract as many jobseekers as the other mining regions. This is followed by the 12 diamond communities, which are also generally smaller and quite isolated, apart from Kimberley and Musina. The 22 gold communities and 18 PGM communities are the worst off overall, but have quite different reasons - the downscaling and closure of gold mines has resulted in significant job losses and economic decline (Marais 2013a ) while the recent rapid expansion in the PGM and chrome mining in Limpopo has taken place in largely rural areas which were neglected during the Apartheid era. The four different community types – co-established cities, large mining towns, small mining towns, and pre-existing communities – show a smaller variation in overall score, though small mining towns have the lowest score and co-established cities have the highest score. This may be surprising given many small mining towns have received significant investment from mining companies, however, the mines can only directly employ a limited number of people and without other sectors to provide employment, any growth in population may not be sustainable and often results in informal settlements (SAHRC 2016 ). Cities on the other hand have diversified economies and are probably less impacted by mine downscaling and closure, or boom and bust cycles common in the mining industry. Combining these results for commodities and community types provides insight into the importance of context when assessing SDGs and well-being in mining communities. The community baseline for the start of mining has a large impact on its later well-being, as well as its geographical location – being remotely located results in higher levels of well-being if the mining town is developed at the same time, but lower levels if poor rural communities become the host communities to a new mine. The stage in mine development is also important – a decline in commodity prices or reaching the end of life of mine can lead to economic decline and well-being if the community cannot absorb or support the retrenched mine workers (Marais 2013b ).  5.2 SDG monitoring and reporting in mining This study is the first of its kind, showing that it is possible to measure at least 11 SDG indicators at the community level to assess the well-being of mining host communities. However, the data used are now nine years out of date, as the national census is the only comprehensive local level dataset in the country. Five other SDG indicators were identified but not measured due to lack of any nation-wide data at the community level. To address this gap, mining companies could partner with the national statistical agency, StatsSA, to regularly survey their host communities between national censuses. StatsSA could perform the surveys and report the data while the mining companies provide financial assistance. This data would be useful to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) in assessing progress on implementation of SLPs and the Housing and Living Conditions Plans required of mining companies. It would also benefit StatsSA in improving the accuracy of the mid-year population estimates and the annual general household survey. This approach could be taken in any country with a significant mining industry and where local level data is not routinely collected. During the indicator selection process, it became clear that indicator selection has a big impact on the results. Indicator selection by national governments is linked to its view of the acceptable social floor in the country, and a realistic rather than an idealistic approach. The SDG targets are set for the year 2030, and thus must be achievable in that timeframe. With only 10 years to go, some SDG indicators set a lower ambition than many would like to see. Indicators with high ambition (e.g. piped water in dwelling) give a different picture to indicators with low ambition (e.g. piped water within 200 m of the dwelling), with the latter highlighting the most deprived populations (Cole et al., 2018 ). Multiple indicators for the same domain could be used together to show both the most and least deprived areas (Cole et al., 2018 ). This could help mining companies focus their efforts where they can have the most positive impact. While company sustainability reporting, such as the GRI and the Responsible Mining Index, generally measure processes and policies, the SDG indicators provide a view into how the community and environment hosting large-scale mines are actually doing – partly as a result of the implementation (or lack thereof) of mining company plans and policies. This is beneficial as there is a disconnect between mining company-wide policies and standards versus on-the-ground actions at mining sites, and companies often show little or no evidence of sharing mine-site-level information on issues of strong public interest for neighbouring communities (Responsible Mining Foundation 2020 ). The risk for mining companies in reporting on community-related SDG indicators is that they have limited ability to bring about change in the host communities and are reliant on local and national government for basic service delivery and a functioning, growing economy. The definition and boundary of the host community is also uncertain, and if mining companies were to take responsibility for the well-being of these communities, they would probably find them expanding in the eyes of the communities and the state. Large-scale mines usually attract migrants looking for work, both from within and outside national borders (SAHRC 2016 ). This increases the population of the mining host community while also bringing down its overall well-being, as the migrants are usually poor and live in informal settlements (SAHRC 2016 ). These migration dynamics need to be understood in SDG monitoring in general, but for mining host communities in particular. Mining may be having a greater beneficial effect on communities than is evident from the data presented here, as the overall measures of well-being could be reduced by in-migration.  5.3 Mining for development The results in this study show a significant range between individual communities and between different parts of the communities, such as townships and suburbs. However, aggregating the communities by commodity and type of community (co-established cities, large mining towns, small mining towns, and pre-existing communities) has an averaging effect and shows much smaller differences. In addition, the analysis showed no correlation between the overall well-being score and the rating for level of influence of mining on host communities or its five individual parameters (duration of mining, remoteness, proximity to mine, number of mines, years town preceded mining). This indicates that the social-spatial categories within a city or town are more important than its location, and highlights the overwhelming legacy of South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation and systemic inequality in levels of education and health care, job opportunities and service provision. After democratic change in 1994, the national government fundamentally changed the mining industry with the MPRDA of 2002 and the subsequent Mining Charter, SLP Guideline and Housing Standard. This suite of regulations should have resulted in significant improvement in the living standards and job prospects for mine communities. However, this study has shown that thousands of people living in mining host communities are still deprived of basic services, secondary education and decent jobs. According to CALS (2016) , who have done the most comprehensive review of SLPs, the SLPs do not actually define the host communities and generally do not mention a process of consultation with communities. Most SLPs lack targets, timeframes and monitoring tools, and the overall regulatory environment does not adequately evaluate the impacts of the SLP (CALS 2016 ). Bezuidenhout and Buhlungu (2015)  argue that the state does not have the capability to enforce the regulations and there has been inadequate planning for the rapid growth of mining activities; as a result ‘the employment relationship is over-determined and has to carry social, market and state failures’. The operationalisation of the SDGs in the mining industry is an opportunity to improve the monitoring and reporting on SLP implementation in South Africa, and on the role of mining in community development around the world.  5.4 Future research This study has provided a first attempt at measuring the SDGs in mining host communities, in South Africa but also globally. While 15 dimensions were identified, only 11 indicators could be measured due to the lack of community level data. This is not unique to South Africa and highlights the common problem of constraints to data disaggregation of the SDGs (SDSN 2015 ), which needs to be addressed by national governments around the world. This study has focused on social and economic factors in 13 SDGs rather than the environmental impacts of mining on communities, and this would be a useful and important addition that addresses the remaining four SDGs. As processing plants have significant environmental impacts (e.g. water pollution, air pollution), it would be important to specifically include them in the research, noting whether they are on the mine licence areas or not and whether they are owned by a third party or not. It would also be important to include labour sending areas, which are seen as part of the mine community in South Africa, in future research. This would require access to the SLPs for the mines, most of which are not publicly available. It became evident during the research, that there is significant inequality within mining host communities and an assessment of socio-spatial categories (mine compounds, suburbs, townships, informal settlements) would be beneficial. This could include data disaggregation by gender, race, and age (as described in the SDG global indicator framework) as the census captures these data. There is also the question over the changes over time of the community population as mining activities draw people (particularly the rural unemployed) and analysis of well-being over time (using the 1996 census and 2001 census) and rural-urban migration would help understand the communities better. Finally, mine closure is an increasing global and national concern, due to its negative environmental and socio-economic impacts (McCullough 2016 ). The authors plan to adapt their mining community classification to develop a mine closure risk classification for South Africa to highlight high risk areas and support policy interventions to minimise the impacts.   6 Conclusion This paper has described the development and application of a set of SDG indicators for the mining industry, focusing on mining host communities rather than companies. It has identified 15 domains within 13 SDGs that are relevant to mining communities, and, based on available data, reported on 11 socio-economic SDG indicators for 95 mining host communities in South Africa. These communities are home to over 5.6 million people with the majority living in coal (42%), gold (27%), platinum (16%) and diamond (8%) mining areas. The results show that despite vast mineral wealth, a long history of mining and progressive legislation in South Africa, hundreds of thousands of people living in mining host communities live in deprivation and have a long way to go to achieve the SDGs. There is a significant range in the well-being of communities, and also within communities, which is largely due to the unique national context and history, rather than the current direct influence of mining. The SDGs can be incorporated into existing national policies and regulations for the minerals industry but monitoring and reporting is essential to see them implemented. As the expectations that mining should make a greater contribution to the long-term sustainability of host communities increases (Dunbar et al., 2020 ), the SDGs provide an opportunity to build trust with communities and governments (Fraser 2019 ). Achieving the SDGs require collective, collaborative and coordinated efforts by public and private parties (Yakovleva et al., 2017 ). Measuring and reporting on individual SDG indicators in mining host communities requires additional data collection at the community level, which would be an ideal area for partnership between government and mining companies that could highlight priority areas for community development and creating shared value. As evident in this novel study, the mining industry has significant potential to improve the lives of millions of people living in host communities, and make a national and global contribution to sustainable development.
