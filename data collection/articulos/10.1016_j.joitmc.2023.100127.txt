                  Innovation in a country should have an impact on different indicators of a country. Thus, it can be expected to have an impact on the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and, finally, on the country's competitiveness. This study analyzes the effect that innovation, in its human and financial resources components, has on the fulfillment of the SDGs and, likewise, how this fulfillment has an effect on the competitiveness of the countries of the European Union. The information used for innovation was reported on the European Commission's website; in the case of the SDGs, information from the SDG Index 2022 report was used. Finally, information on competitiveness was obtained from the World Competitiveness Ranking. The information from the 25 countries that had results in the sources was analyzed. The data collected were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. It was evidenced that innovation based on human resources and finance have a positive and significant effect on SDG compliance; furthermore, it is shown that SDG compliance has a positive and significant effect on the competitiveness of European Union countries. These results show the great importance of monitoring global indicators to generate better positioning and alternatives for development and welfare for countries.

Its definition has been enriched over time due to its multifaceted meaning and its incessant evolution in the modern era. In essence, innovation refers to the process of developing and applying new ideas, methods, products or services, which generate differential value and contribute to the progress and improvement of societies. Academic literature has approached the notion of innovation from various perspectives. According to Schumpeter (1942) , one of the pioneers in the study of innovation, it is presented as a driving force for economic growth, since through the "creative destruction" of old ways of doing things, it opens the way to the generation of new opportunities and markets. Innovation is a key driver of economic and social development in European countries. Through innovation, they can enhance efficiency, productivity, quality of life, sustainability, and maintain competitiveness in a globalized and technological world. Various countries in Europe have undertaken specific initiatives to foster innovation in sectors like industry, mobility, renewable energy, and fashion. There are several reasons why Europe needs to generate more innovation: Global competitiveness generates greater pressure to succeed in winning new markets and, at the same time, to have products that can compete with new products arriving from other countries, with lower prices or unique characteristics in the market; technology is changing faster and faster, forcing companies to adapt very quickly to survive in the market. In order to continue to compete with companies from countries with high technology implementation, technological innovation is crucial. Innovation is urgently needed to increase the efficiency of production and transformation processes in Europe as there is an aging population, which means fewer people of working age. The commitment of European Union countries, which is seen in a dissimilar way in the SDG Index report, requires innovation to find sustainable solutions for their business activities and to achieve at the same time the reduction of environmental impact, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Since the SDGs were proposed, various countries have generated strategies to meet them, albeit with varying results. Thus, according to the 2022 SDG Index, in relation to SDG 15, Austria is in a stationary state and considered as significant challenges remain while Poland reports achieving the goal and on track. It is thus evident that each European country is prioritizing different SDGs and logically achieving its own results that lead them to take on individual challenges. It has been possible to recognize the impact that SDG compliance has on countries' economic and social development (Shahbaz et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the concept of intellectual capital has gained significant relevance in business and academia in recent decades. As the global economy evolves towards an increasingly knowledge-based approach, the recognition and management of intellectual capital have become key factors for the success of organizations and countries. The term was first introduced by Kenneth Galbraith in 1969 (Bontis, 1998 ) who think that intellectual capital was more than pure intellect but included intellectual action. The presence of ample intellectual capital in a nation fosters innovation and the development of new technologies, products and services. Highly skilled workers, advanced technological infrastructure and quality educational institutions are factors that contribute to this dynamic (Buenechea-Elberdin, 2017; Örnek and Ayas, 2015 ). On the other hand, innovation in a country also drives the growth of intellectual capital. Investments in research and development, collaboration between the public and private sectors, and the promotion of an innovative entrepreneurial culture generate a virtuous circle that increases the nation's intellectual wealth (Chew et al., 2014; Li et al., 2021 ). In today's rapidly changing global landscape, innovation is an absolutely essential driver of progress and development for European countries. It must be utilized to shape and guide these nations towards a sustainable future that is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is imperative that we examine the relationship between innovation, SDGs compliance, and overall competitiveness in greater detail. Without this understanding, effective policymaking and the full utilization of innovation's potential as a catalyst for sustainable growth will be impossible. This article aims to investigate the effects of innovation on SDG compliance, both in terms of financial and human resources, across European Union countries. Additionally, it seeks to assess how achieving SDGs through innovation contributes to the overall competitiveness of these nations. The central argument of this article is that innovation plays a vital role in enabling European countries to meet Sustainable Development Goals. By exploring the relationship between innovation, SDG compliance, and competitiveness, this study seeks to highlight the significance of innovation efforts for the economic and social development of Europe. Understanding the relationship between innovation, SDGs, and competitiveness is of paramount importance for policymakers, business leaders, and researchers in Europe. This knowledge can guide strategic decision-making to prioritize innovation initiatives that align with specific SDGs, leading to more targeted and effective efforts in sustainable development and improved global competitiveness. The findings of this study can contribute to shaping a more innovative and sustainable future for European nations.  2 Theoretical framework and hypothesis The search for development in countries is based on different governmental and business activities. In this sense, one element that is very important is innovation, both based on human resources and financial innovation, so it is important to know if this innovation has an effect on the fulfillment of the SDGs and can ultimately impact the competitiveness of a country. 2.1 Compliance with SDG SDG compliance is based on the SDG Index 2022, which details the contents of two modes. On the one hand, it reports whether the country has achieved the SDG, whether there are pending challenges, whether there are several pending challenges, and whether there are major pending challenges. The trend of the efforts for each SDG is also reported; it is reported as on track, moderately increasing, stagnating and decreasing. It can be recognized that there are countries in the European Union that have managed to report that they have achieved a specific SEG and that it is also on track, such as SDG 1 in Austria, SDG 4 in Estonia, SDG 5 in Norway, SDG 7 in Finland, SDG 8, among others.  2.2 Innovation based in human resources Following the theory of diffusion of innovation (Rogers, 1962 ), innovation based on human resources means that, to the extent that there are more people with more academic and professional training, innovations can be generated at the individual and organizational level. Thus, the EU Innovation Indicators contemplates in this human resource-based innovation section the total number of new PhDs in STEM x 1000 (25–34 years); it measures the population involved in lifelong learning and evaluates the production of this qualified human resource measured by scientific publications between the 10% most cited. The intra-structure is considered so that the human resource can develop successfully, thus broadband penetration. These indicators are linked to the open innovation model, since crowdsourcing increases the collective knowledge that helps to find innovations in less time and with greater impact. The theory of innovation diffusion to explain the fulfillment of the SDGs (Botchway and Bradley, 2023; Peshin et al., 2019 ).  2.3 Innovation based in finance and support A key aspect that is evaluated is a country's expenditure on research and development, which makes it possible to generate transcendental changes in the actions of the States. These disruptive improvements that can be generated because of R&D are those that provide transformative innovation so that a state can support its efforts to meet the SDGs. For example, optimizing environmental water assessment processes will contribute to meeting SDG 6. Also, is considered direct and indirect government support of business R&D based in the sum of government tax relief for R&D expenditures (GTARD), direct funding of business enterprise R&D (BERD) and gross domestic product (GDP) (percentage of GDP). This case recognizes the state's investment as well as the taxes that allow the support of R&D actions. Another factor considered is R&D expenditure in the business area (% of GDP) calculated using All R&D expenditures in the business area (BERD) and GDP. It was considered innovation expenditures per person employed based in total innovation expenditure by enterprises in purchasing power standards (PPS) and total employment in innovative enterprises in all size classes. It is recognized the efforts from the governments to promote the innovation. In this way, some examples are shown. In Germany, on 1 January 2020, the Research Allowance Act, also known as the Act on Tax Benefits for Research and Development or Forschungszulagengesetz, was passed by the Federal Government. It is projected that businesses will receive approximately 5.6 billion euros from the research allowance within the next five years; also, German companies invested €72.1 billion in research and development in 2018. The total investment in new innovations from development to launch is €172.6 billion (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, 2023 ). In Netherlands, the Top Sector Alliance for Knowledge and Innovation (TKI) is a collaboration between the government, private sector, universities, and research centers aimed at strengthening top sectors. The alliance seeks ways to bring innovative products and services to the market (Government of the Netherlands, 2023 ). One program based in the efforts of innovation is focused in renewable energy (SDG 7); this program has already reached its goal of 2 million people, three years ahead of schedule (Netherlands Enterprise Agency, 2023 ). In Italy, it is recognized the initiative called inclusive digital innovation. Digital inclusion addresses inequalities by providing citizens with digital skills and access to technologies necessary for participation in society, communication, work, and use of digital services offered by the Public Administration (Dipartimento della Funzione Pubblica, 2022 ). One dashboard for monitoring this innovation, detailing the indicators and level of advancement (Dipartimento della Funzione Pubblica, 2023 ). France has a Ministry of higher education, research and innovation and some advances were reports lastly (Fleming, 2022 ). United Kingdom has many efforts and outcomes in innovation guided by the government (Government of United Kingdom, 2023 ); some outcomes includes £13 million for 22 AI for health research projects, £14 m innovation funding unveiled in Farming Innovation Programme and delivering £1 m innovation scale-up for UK SME battery developers (UK Research and Innovation, 2023 ). Innovation is crucial to the economic and social development of European countries (Ferreira et al., 2020; Hewitt et al., 2019; Hysa et al., 2020 ). The ability to innovate enables them to improve efficiency (Sun et al., 2021 ), productivity (Audretsch and Belitski, 2020; Naveed and Wang, 2023 ), quality of life (Antipina et al., 2022 ) and sustainability (Skare and Porada-Rochon, 2022 ), and to maintain their competitiveness in an increasingly globalized and technological world. Moreover, innovation is an important driver for job creation (Chege and Wang, 2020 ), attracting investment (Paramati et al., 2021 ) and improving the well-being of society at large (Aldieri et al., 2019 ). Different countries in Europe have developed initiatives of innovation as Germany in Industry 4.0 (https://www.bmbf.de/en/industrie-4–0–492.html ), Spain in electric mobility (https://www.idae.es ), Denmark in offshore wind energy (https://stateofgreen.com/en/sectors/offshore-wind ), Francia in renewable energies (https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/politiques/energies-renouvelables-et-recuperation ), and Italy sustainable fashion (https://www.fashionrevolution.org/europe/ital ).  2.4 Country competitiveness A country's competitiveness implies the capacity to produce goods and services that can satisfy the needs of international markets and, at the same time, maintain or increase the real income of its citizens in the long term. Competitiveness is a complex concept influenced by a variety of factors, so measuring it requires several specific indicators. Competitiveness affects your ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade with other nations. A highly competitive country is likely to have an economy with greater diversification and economic growth, and countries with higher competitiveness scores tend to be more attractive to international companies seeking to expand their operations into new markets. IMD is an independent university institute which has been a pioneer in developing leaders who transform organizations and contribute to society. Since 2012, it has been in the top three of the FT Executive Education rankings and in the top four for 18 consecutive years. The IMD first published the World Competitiveness Ranking in 1989, which analyzes and ranks countries based on how they manage their competencies to achieve long-term value creation. The IMD World Digital Competitiveness ranking 2022 considered four types of criteria, including some specific indicators ( Table 1 ).  2.5 Effect of innovation based in human resources on compliance with SDG Contributing to the achievement of the SDGs requires innovative approaches and solutions as classic methods may not be able to address complex challenges. In relation to human resources, innovation can be created with more qualified human resources, as new technologies and projects will be developed that specifically address issues linked to the SDGs; thus, if the education of citizens is to be improved, innovation can have a significant impact on the achievement of the SDGs by enabling the development of new technologies and projects that specifically address issues linked to the SDGs.Hypothesis 1 Innovation based in human resources have a positive and significant effect on compliance with the SDGs.    2.6 Effect of innovation based in finance and support on compliance with SDG While human resources are improved, it is necessary to direct financing towards research and development processes, generating investments for the development of new disruptive projects and at the same time achieving tax collection that is directed to financing research and development. in a country according to its highest priorities. Thus, "work for tax" systems can be established. In some cases, tax incentives may be targeted at specific industries or types of R&D activities that are considered to be of particular importance for the country's economic development. For example, a country may grant additional tax incentives to companies that invest in R&D related to water management, recycling or renewable energy.Hypothesis 2 Innovation based in finance and support have a positive and significant effect on compliance with the SDGs.    2.7 Effect of compliance with SDG on country competitiveness Compliance with the SDGs can influence the improvement of a country's competitiveness; Thus, if you contribute to the writing of social inequality, improve education and health, you can positively impact the social and political stability of the country. In this scenario, it is possible to achieve a reputation as a country that is attractive to foreign investors, helping to increase investment and ultimately economic growth. Each country chooses a group of SDGs on which to work and have a different impact on their competitiveness.Hypothesis 3 Compliance with the SDGs have a negative and significant effect on country competitiveness.  Hypothesis 4 Compliance with the SDGs have a mediating effect between innovation based in human resources and country competitiveness.  Hypothesis 5 Compliance with the SDGs have a mediating effect between innovation based in finance and support and country competitiveness.    2.8 Research model The model looks to evaluate the effect of innovation, based in human resource and finance and support, in compliance with the SDG. Then, the effect of this compliance on country competitiveness is evaluated. Also, we seek to measure the mediating effect of compliance with the SDG between innovation and competitiveness. The model is shows in  Fig. 1 .   3 Methodology In this section, the research design and sample are presented, along with a description of the composition of the instrument used. There is an elaboration on the analysis that will be conducted with the data gathered. 3.1 Research design This is a non-experimental, quantitative, retrospective, correlational, and multivariate study. A non-experimental design is used because the study variables are not manipulated and are evaluated as they were presented (Creswell and Creswell, 2017 ). A quantitative design is appropriate when seeking to establish causal relationships as in the present study; they also allow variables to be controlled to identify cause and effect relationships between phenomena; in addition, they help to generalize results (Fowler, 2013 ). A retrospective design is used to examine past events and analyze their effects or relationships. This type of design is useful when it is not possible or ethical to conduct a controlled experiment or study in real-time, and instead relies on historical data (Talari and Goyal, 2020 ). A correlational design is used to examine the relationship between variables. This type of design is useful when the objective is to determine if there is a statistical relationship between variables without directly manipulating any of them. Instead of establishing cause-and-effect relationships, as in experimental designs, correlational designs seek to identify patterns of covariation between variables (Trochim and Donnelly, 2001 ). A multivariate design is used when multiple interrelated variables are to be analyzed simultaneously in the same study, the variables under study are interrelated in a complex manner and cannot be fully understood if analyzed individually, and when the variables are interdependent and may affect each other. A multivariate design allows these interactions to be considered, which can lead to a more accurate understanding of the phenomenon under study (Hair et al., 2014 ).  3.2 Collection of data The data was collected from European Innovation Scoreboard 2022 (https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/statistics/performance-indicators/european-innovation-scoreboard/eis# ), SDG Index (https://dashboards.sdgindex.org ) and World Competitiveness Ranking (https://www.imd.org/centers/wcc/world-competitiveness-center/rankings/world-competitiveness-ranking ). The data from each source was for 25 countries: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.  3.3 Data analysis SmartPLS version 3.3.3 was utilized to assess the collected data. In this study, Variance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through PLS was chosen as it is an exploratory approach, suitable for a theory that is currently being developed. PLS-SEM was preferred for this study due to the non-normal distribution of the samples, requiring a non-parametric analysis. Moreover, PLS-SEM provides R2 values, significance of variable relationships, and handles numerous independent variables simultaneously (Hair et al., 2011 ). The study chose PLS-SEM for various reasons, such as assessing the internal consistency, construct and discriminant validity, and internal consistency (Ringle et al., 2015 ). To evaluate the reliability of each indicator, the indicator loads were measured. The AVE was utilized to analyze the model fit, and the Fornell–Larcker criterion (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Lopez-Odar et al., 2020 ).  3.4 Ethical approval Requesting ethical approval is no applicable because the study has not taken data from humans or animals. The study is based in public data available.   4 Results 4.1 Measurement model assessment The study's consistency was evaluated through Composite reliability (CR) and Cronbach's alpha to test internal consistency and reliability. The findings exceeded the recommended threshold of 0.6 for descriptive research, indicating that the study is consistent. The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) was used to assess Convergence Validity. Each variable exceeded 0.5 in  Table 2 . This result allows us to be certain that the measurement of each variable is reliable and that at the same time, the simultaneous measurement of these variables in the model can be reliable. The Fornell–Larcker criteria were used to verify and examine the validity of identification. It is worth emphasizing that all split variances in  Table 3  are more significant than their corresponding AVEs. This suggests that the variables might be measuring the same concepts, indicating the absence of discriminant validity. In other words, it is not possible to differentiate between the variables, and they cannot be regarded as distinct constructs. It is very important to see that there is a difference between the IBHR and IBFS variables, expressed in the discriminant validity data, which shows that these are two different aspects.  4.2 Structural model assessment The variance inflation factor (VIF), as shown in  Table 4 , was analyzed to assess the collinearity. VIF values range from 1000 to 2545 without any value that exceeds the critical value of 5 (Hair et al., 2019 ). It is essential to address collinearity to avoid drawing inaccurate or unreliable conclusions. The ultimate step of the analysis comprises assessing statistical significance and relevance through 5000 iterations of Bootstrapping. The outcomes indicated that all relationships were significant, given that the p-values were lower than 0.05. The complete results of this last stage are presented in  Table 5 . It can be seen that each innovation variable has a different effect on the fulfillment of the SDGs, although in both cases the hypothesis is fulfilled.  Table 6  is presented the specific indirect effects. All of them are significant. It was corroborated the economic factor mediator between competitiveness, environmental factors, and entrepreneurship. It is very important that it has been possible to demonstrate the mediating effect of SDG compliance, as this would show that the efforts made by governments to invest resources and generate plans for SDG compliance have a concrete effect on a country's competitiveness, which can encourage greater investment.  Fig. 2  shows the model tested. The values that had loading fewer than 0.5 were deleted.   5 Discussion The results have shown that there is an effect from the two types of innovation evaluated, both from the one based on human resources and the one associated with financial support. These results at the level of different countries in Europe initially show the importance of investment and innovation policies on the achievement of the SDGs, which serves as evidence to support the rationale for greater investment in innovation in schools, universities and companies. In this sense, it is valuable that at different levels think tanks can be created to stimulate the generation of practical innovation that can be materialized in governmental and business actions that contribute at the same time to the achievement of the SDGs. It can be seen how more research is being done on innovation in Europe (Kroll and Gabriel, 2020; Prokop et al., 2022 ), reported in firms (Cainelli et al., 2020; Demirel and Danisman, 2019; Graafland and Noorderhaven, 2020 ), detailing policies (Asheim, 2019; Silva et al., 2021 ), government efforts (Navío-Marco et al., 2019; Stober et al., 2021 ), reviewing independently the innovation scorecard 2020 (EU, 2020 ), human resources for innovation (Diebolt and Hippe, 2019 ), venture capital expenditures (Leogrande et al., 2021 ), linking innovation with sustainability (Sempere-Ripoll et al., 2020 ), innovation goals linked to carbon dioxide emissions (Töbelmann and Wendler, 2020 ), and different initiatives appear that seek to further boost the results of states and companies (Leceta and Könnölä, 2021 ). Being able to carry out a detailed mapping of the actors in the innovation processes can help countries generate successful plans since financial support can be allocated to achieve a traceable result. The actors of innovation can be in the universities where new professionals are expected to be trained, taking as a central axis the need for disruption to generate new, more efficient processes. Less polluting and profitable. Research from universities on innovation issues can also be monitored so that the results that have been obtained and that future research will show are oriented towards solving problems in the business world. Companies are a second relevant actor in a country since the daily activity they carry out forces them to permanently adapt against new competitors who will always have innovative offers to achieve a greater market share. In this sense, it is also necessary to promote this innovation because the production, distribution and sale processes will be optimized, as is the case with the different forms of payment that are being launched on the market every day (Al-Okaily et al., 2022; Bojjagani et al., 2023; Chin et al., 2022; Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2022 ). Along with the actors are the processes which must be known in detail since a system is not only made up of the actors and processes but also the articulation between them, the microprocesses involved, their indicators and faults found. Innovation takes these aspects into account in order to have better products and services on the market. The advantage of the European Union to generate innovation between its countries is that there are different agreements and regulations already established as well as the trust of joint work, pending the customization of innovation measures in each country. Likewise, the fact that everything that is reported is always published on the official web pages of the European Union allows crowdsourcing, which allows constant learning from the experience of other countries (Cricelli et al., 2022; De Coninck et al., 2023 ). The challenge for innovation in each institution lies in ensuring that the general approach can be adaptable in the day to day of the institution. In this way, for example, in a university that seeks innovation in student training, the university will have to clearly have innovation processes in teaching so that the student not only sees the drive towards innovation but also lives innovation in his study center personally. If you want innovative processes in teaching from hybrid classes then you need to go beyond having synchronous and asynchronous classes alternately. When companies begin to increase the offer of quick commerce (Paché, 2022 ) there is the challenge of achieving deliveries in different cities with complex levels of traffic. Citizen science is a trend of citizen participation that is getting better results every time. Based on crowdsourcing, citizen science has been involved in various investigations that give rise to further innovations. In this way, there is evidence of the citizen science to reach SDG (Fraisl et al., 2020; Fritz et al., 2019; Sauermann et al., 2020 ), improvement of the education (Roche et al., 2020 ), social dynamics (Tauginienė et al., 2020 ), management of energy (Cappa et al., 2020 ), mapping to prevent natural disasters (Hicks et al., 2019 ), even in artificial intelligence (Green et al., 2020 ). Although Horizon Europe marks a course of action, it is necessary to dynamically generate innovations that adapt to changes in each country, based on new technologies such as the great boom in artificial intelligence and the necessary changes to be implemented in different sectors. The analysis of the data individually is a task for each country so that beyond the value obtained, the economic, social and environmental achievements obtained by the innovation they lead can be reflexively evaluated. The benefits of innovation in a country and in companies are usually known, but it has not been possible to demonstrate that innovation has a specific effect on the achievement of the SDGs, which can serve as a starting point for scaling up innovation programs. On the other hand, among the factors that explain a country's competitiveness, compliance with the SDGs is not described, so this study shows initial evidence that will have to continue to be evaluated in other studies, since it is very valuable that all these efforts made by governments to promote innovation and commit to sustainability through support for SDG compliance have an impact on competitiveness.  6 Conclusions The study has shown that innovation is vitally important in meeting the SDGs. It is useful to have differentiated that both innovation based on human resources and innovation based on financial support manage to have an effect on the fulfillment of the SDGs. Many institutions still have doubts about the effect that contributing to the fulfillment of the SDGs has on their commercial options and business development as well as the conditions of the country. When it is shown that compliance manages to have an impact on the country's competitiveness, it is undoubtedly the companies that should be more interested in contributing since their businesses will be supported and they will be able to conquer new markets, even more so in the current process of nearshoring (Camacho-Vallejo et al., 2023; Fernández-Miguel et al., 2022; van Hassel et al., 2022 ). Future research should seek to incorporate other variables that may influence the country's competitiveness, such as logistics efficiency in ports, since it directly influences import/export activities. When innovation activities are carried out, future research should also be evaluated in a qualitative way, specifically what are the efforts that are developed from the innovation policies as well as the national programs that are developed in each country to compare them from the strategies and find parallelism with their results. Companies must promote among their workers (Lee et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020 ), customers (Lorenzo-Romero and Constantinides, 2019 ) and suppliers (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhong and Wang, 2022 ), always following the crowdsourcing scheme, the development of innovative proposals that propose. Future studies should evaluate more specifically the effect of innovation on different SDGs in order to know at what level it generates a greater impact and allocate more resources for it. On the other hand, it is important to investigate other regions that are less homogeneous, such as Latin America or Asia, to see how well the model tested in this study is fulfilled. Regional policies that drive innovation should be evaluated, comparing the KPIs used.  Funding This research received no external funding.
