                  This study emphasizes a crucial consideration for policymakers working towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as social welfare, environmental sustainability, democratic governance, fair income distribution, and other related goals. Policymakers need to account for the characteristics of series associated with these goals, specifically their stationarity or the presence of unit roots; the reason is that these characteristics have a significant impact on the success of the policies. Notably, policies relying on unit root series may result in costly and time-consuming efforts to achieve the targeted SDGs. This study investigates interactions between seventeen SDGs for the USA with a holistic approach between 1960–2022. This investigation employs the FWADF, FWKSS, and Bai-Perron tests for seventeen selected representative variables (series) of the SDGs. Finally, it presents and discusses the main policy implications of the empirical findings for seven series (variables) containing unit roots. The findings of this study have necessary implications for policymakers and the achievement of the USA’s SDGs. One of the empirical findings of this study is that the Energy Policy Act enacted in 2003 encouraged more significant development and use of clean and renewable energy, denoting SDG7 in the USA. Another finding is that contrary to expectations, there was no significant increase in the number of patents denoting SDG9 after the America Invents Act came into force in 2013.

Handling Editor: A. Menegaki Graphical abstract       This study emphasizes a crucial consideration for policymakers working towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as social welfare, environmental sustainability, democratic governance, fair income distribution, and other related goals. Policymakers need to account for the characteristics of series associated with these goals, specifically their stationarity or the presence of unit roots; the reason is that these characteristics have a significant impact on the success of the policies. Notably, policies relying on unit root series may result in costly and time-consuming efforts to achieve the targeted SDGs. This study investigates interactions between seventeen SDGs for the USA with a holistic approach between 1960–2022. This investigation employs the FWADF, FWKSS, and Bai-Perron tests for seventeen selected representative variables (series) of the SDGs. Finally, it presents and discusses the main policy implications of the empirical findings for seven series (variables) containing unit roots. The findings of this study have necessary implications for policymakers and the achievement of the USA’s SDGs. One of the empirical findings of this study is that the Energy Policy Act enacted in 2003 encouraged more significant development and use of clean and renewable energy, denoting SDG7 in the USA. Another finding is that contrary to expectations, there was no significant increase in the number of patents denoting SDG9 after the America Invents Act came into force in 2013.   Keywords SDGs  United Nations  Sustainability  Efficiency of SDG policies  Energy Policy Act  America Invents Act   Jel Codes Q01  Q56    1 Introduction Sustainable development is recognized as a major challenge for the economies (UN, 2008). Unlike traditional economic development goals, sustainable development goals (SDGs) focus on economic growth from a broader development targets perspective, including social equity, environmental sustainability, and global cooperation. SDGs cover all countries and societies and focus on fundamental principles such as protecting the environment and caring for disadvantaged groups (Işık et al., 2024a, 2024b, 2024c ). For this reason, SDGs differ from traditional development goals and offer a sustainable and inclusive development roadmap. In this respect, they can also be considered globally coordinated development model targets. The reason why the term SDG, which has become a cliché, is used so frequently and widely accepted may be attributed to its comprehensiveness and coordinated approach. The SDGs proposed by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 are key to guiding global efforts to achieve t the above fundamental objectives. It consists of 17 SDGs (see Section 3 ) and 169 targets (Jan et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2021 ). These goals address a wide range of areas, including poverty alleviation, clean water and energy, education, and gender equality, to promote sustainable development on a global scale (UN, 2023). This study investigates the impact of the sustainable development goals for the USA. This country implemented the Rural Electrification Act, which can be seen as one of the initial examples of sustainable development goals. This is because it brings together rural areas through electrification (Kitchens and Fishback, 2015 ). With its substantial economic size, innovation potential, and cultural diversity, the USA emerges as a crucial stakeholder in realizing sustainable development goals. Although the US economy and national development are prosperous, there are several potential drawbacks. The USA still suffers from high unemployment, a gradual increase in the gap between rich and poor, and a gradual decline in the real economy (Cornia, 2013; Forsythe et al., 2020 ). Specifically, the growth momentum of the US economy weakened significantly after the 2008 financial crisis. The economy's average growth rate from 2008 to 2018 was only 1. 6 %, which is much lower than the 3 % growth rate during the sustained boom (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008 ). Polarization within the USA is occurring in all areas, with increasing divisions between social classes. At the same time, driven by deindustrialization, the outward migration of real businesses has reduced internal investment and a significant loss of jobs abroad (Rodrik, 2016; Audirac et al., 2012 ). The emergence of low investment rates and high unemployment has further exacerbated the internal gap between rich and poor. These problems are not conducive to realizing sustainable development goals in the US and the world. In summary, it is necessary to examine the SDGs for the USA. Moreover, the USA is a unique sample country that helps scholars comprehensively assess the impact of these policies on a large scale. This study differs from empirical studies in the relevant literature, which generally examine only one or a few of the SDGs (Işık et al., 2024d; 2024e; Parmentola, 2022; Rashid, 2019 ). This is because this study takes a holistic approach, covering 17 goals. Because each goal will interact with the other, the results obtained from a single goal-based empirical study cannot be evaluated as a whole and cannot give a clear picture. Hence, this multi-SDGs-based holistic approach of this study will enable us to assess the interactions of all the goals with each other as a whole. This implies that this approach will allow us to generate a significant number of policy implication-oriented analyses based on the empirical results of this study. Previous studies usually involve associating the results obtained from economic models with various independent variables (such as an Environmental Kuznets Curve model) with the lens of SDGs and making evaluations accordingly (Amin et al., 2023; Dam et al., 2023; Ekonomou and Menegaki, 2023; Lorente et al., 2023; Shahzad et al., 2023a, 2023b; Yu et al., 2023; Agozie et al., 2022; Bulut et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2022; Amin and Dogan, 2021; Bulut and Apergis, 2021; Yousaf et al., 2021; Arminen and Menegaki, 2019; Işık et al., 2018, 2020, 2023a, 2023b; Bilgili et al., 2019, 2016; Menegaki and Tugcu, 2017; Tiwari and Kyophilavong, 2014; Menegaki, 2011 ). Another point that differentiates this study from these previous works is that in this study, the designated SDG criteria themselves have been individually and thoroughly analyzed. This approach allows us to directly analyze the criteria (series) of the SDGs and thus the SDGs themselves. It further allows us to identify structural changes in these criteria (series) not indirectly but directly.  2 Literature review In the literature of SDGs, a relatively new concept, few studies are available; however, an increasing number of research papers are being conducted on different economic and social variables. For example, Alkire et al. (2015)  used the Foster–Greer–Thorbecke (FGT) approach and examined poverty through education and health and linked these two SDG4 (quality education) and SDG2 (zero hunger), respectively. Alexio et al. (2020)  used content analysis and examined public higher education in Portugal. They linked Portuguese public higher education to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 15 (life on land). Aust et al. (2020)  used multivariate analysis and an ordered probit model to investigate the effects of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for 44 African countries. They found that the FDIs contribute to SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 14 (life below water). Boar et al. (2020) and Ziolo et al. (2021)  used the standardized sum method and examined the non-environmental deregulation and non-inequality caused financial sustainability for European countries. They linked financial sustainability to SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG17 (partnerships for the goals). Balsalobre-Lorente et al. (2021)  used the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model to examine the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain. They found that the forthcoming shifts in renewable price trends are expected to be more influenced by SDG12 (responsible consumption and production). Similarly, Akadiri et al. (2021)  used the panel analysis and tested the EKC hypothesis for BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) economies. They concluded that addressing climate change will provide pertinent policy measures for achieving the targets of SDGs. Fei et al. (2021)  used the mixed-method approach and examined the construction industry linking SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG15 (life on land). Shulla et al. (2021)  used qualitative analysis to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. They highlighted that SDG5 (gender equality) and SDG10 (reduced inequalities) are significantly impacted by their interdependence, not only as an immediate consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic but also due to the strategies and outcomes of crisis management. Agrawal et al. (2022)  applied the contents and bibliometric-network analyses to examine the supply chain practices. They found that the advancements during the product design phase contributed to SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG15 (life on land). Nugent et al. (2023)  examined the role of investment in non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention by network analysis. They found that productivity gains from preventing and managing NCDs will contribute to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). Perez-Martinez et al. (2023)  applied the country-based cross-section analysis to investigate the effects of digitalization on economies. They found strong ties between digitalization and SDG1 (no poverty), SDG3 (good health), SDG4 (quality education), and SDG6 (clean water and sanitation). Mohammed et al. (2023)  used the panel quantile autoregressive distributed lags (QARDL) model and examined the EKC hypothesis for the USA, China, Japan, the UK, Taiwan, and South Korea. They concluded that SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG13 (climate action) must be part of CO2  emission-related policies. Using the Pearson correlation test statistic, Ozili (2023)  examined the correlation between non-performing loans in the banking sector and SDGs for African and European countries. The author found negative relationships between non-performing loans with SDG3 and SDG7. Estevao and Lopes (2024)  used the panel data analysis and the Driscoll-Kraay technique to examine the relationships between renewable energy consumption and GDP to achieve SDG7. The authors found negative relationships between these two parameters for Eurozone countries. Sun et al. (2024)  utilized the panel cointegration test for G7 countries and found that geopolitical risks negatively influence renewable energy consumption in supporting SDG7. Gershon et al. (2024)  focused on SDG7 and used a static panel estimation technique for seventeen African countries. The authors found that energy consumption positively affects economic growth and negatively affects carbon emissions.  3 Empirical methodology The empirical methodology of this study is based on the premise that stationary series can be interpreted as resistant to shocks, thus making them less sensitive to policy effects. In contrast, series containing unit roots may exhibit long-term responses to shocks. This situation implies that government policies implemented through variables based on series with unit roots could lead to costly and time-consuming outcomes in achieving the targeted SDGs. This result indicates that governments need to develop more effective and efficient policies to achieve SDGs. On the other hand, while other factors might impact variables with linear series are usually more resilient to shocks due to their regular and predictable trend, making them less sensitive to abrupt changes. In this section of the study, we will pursue the following steps. Firstly, whether the series is linear will be determined, and then unit-roots will be examined based on this distinction. Secondly, the Fourier Wavelet ADF (FWADF) test will be conducted for linear series, while the Fourier Wavelet KSS (FWKSS) test will be applied for non-linear series. The FWADF t-statistic tests whether the series suits the Fourier test. If it is not suitable, WADF is performed. Similarly, in the FWKSS test, the t-statistic indicates whether the series is suitable for the Fourier test. If it is not appropriate, WKSS is conducted. Thirdly, the presence of structural breaks in stationery and trending models for series containing unit roots and the significance of these breaks have been tested using the Bai-Perron Test by Bai and Perron (1998) . Finally, Bai-Perron's (1998) test graphs for series containing unit-roots will be drawn. 3.1 FWADF- FWKSS tests Aydin (2019)  initially employed the Haar filter and discrete wavelet transform to decompose the series into low and high-frequency components for the wavelet-based KSS (WKSS) unit root test:(1) W 1 , t   = ∑ l = 0  L - 1   h l  x 2 t + 1 - l m o d N       V 1 , t   = ∑ l = 0  L - 1   g l  x 2 t + 1 - l m o d N       t = 0,1,2,….N, / 2–1 (1) Here, w 1 , t      and v 1 , t   ,    respectively, represent the high and low-frequency components. At this stage, using the obtained low-frequency coefficients, the wavelet-based KSS unit root test model is defined as follows (Aydin, 2019 ).(2) Δ V  1 , t   = ∑ j = 1  p  p j  Δ V  1 , t - j   + δ V 1 , t - 1  3  + ε t       The test statistic used for the WKSS unit root test is calculated as shown below:(3) W K S S  = δ ^  / s . h . ( δ ^  )       Here, s.h. denotes the standard deviation. The null hypothesis of the WKSS test represents the unit root with δ ̂=0, while the alternative hypothesis δ < 0 indicates stationarity. In the study by Aydin (2019) , following the work of Yazgan and Özkan (2015) , the Fourier WKSS (FWKSS) unit root test is also proposed. The deterministic term used for this test is as follows:(4) μ ( t )  ≅ a ∑ i = 1  n  ( 2 i - 1 )  - 1   s i n 2 π 2 i - 1    k t  T             This expression is expanded with n = 1 and inserted into the WKSS equation. Accordingly, the model used for the FWKSS test is as follows (Aydin, 2019 ):(5) Δ V  1 , t   = ∑ j = 1  p  p j  Δ V  1 , t - j   + δ V 1 , t - 1  3  + β sin 2 π k t  T     + ε t       The FWKSS unit root test is conducted following the methodology of Enders and Lee (2012) . In the first step, equation (5)  is estimated for the range 1 ≤ k  ≤ 5, and the model with the lowest sum of squared residuals is selected as the appropriate model for testing. In the second step, the significance of the Fourier term is tested using a t -test. However, instead of using classical t-table values, the table values calculated by Aydin (2019)  are employed. when the Fourier term is found to be significant, the FWKSS test can be utilized; otherwise, if it is not significant, it is recommended to use the WKSS unit root test (Aydin, 2019 ): Aydin and Pata (2020)  have transformed the ADF test methodology into a wavelet-based form that allows for smooth breaks using a similar process. The proposed model for the Fourier WADF (FWADF) unit root test is as follows (Aydin and Pata, 2020 ):(6) Δ V  1 , t   = ∑ j = 1  p  p j  Δ V  1 , t - j   + δ V 1 , t - j   + β sin 2 π k t  T     + ε t       The process of the FWADF test is the same as the FWKSS test. However, in cases where the FWADF test cannot be used, the recommended alternative test is the WADF test instead of the WKSS test. Finally, in the study by Aydin and Pata (2020) , they introduced the linear model FWADF unit root test to the literature by combining the Fourier ADF unit root test methodology by Christopoulos and Ledesma (2010)  with the wavelet theorem. In this study, the stationarity of agricultural commodity prices, determined linearly, has been examined using the linear model FWADF unit root test. Following the FWADF-FWKSS tests, the Bai-Perron Test is applied.  3.2 Bai-Perron test Bai and Perron (1998, 2003a, 2003b ) employ the sequential testing approach to determine m breakpoints and, consequently, m + 1 regimes. This approach deals with the multiple linear regression model in the following Equation (7) :(7) y t  = x t  ′  β + z t  ′  δ j  + u t  , t = T j - 1   + 1 , ⋯ , T j  , j = 1 , ⋯ , m + 1      In Equation (7) , y t      represents the time series, x t  ′      p × 1 dimensional vector of independent variables, z t  ′      q × 1 is the dimensional vector of independent variables related to regimes (breaks), β is the coefficient vector (containing the intercept and coefficients for linear trend variables), and δ j     is the coefficient vector related to regimes (j = 1, …, m + 1). The term u t     denotes the error term. Here, (T1 , …, Tm ) represents the unknown breakpoints. The primary objective here is to estimate the unknown β and δ j     coefficients (j = 1, …, m + 1) along with the breakpoint times (T1 , …, Tm ) using the (T1 , …, Tm ) data points of (y t  , x t  , z t    ) where T observations are available. Bai and Perron (1998)  have proposed various testing strategies for significant breakpoints and, in general, have developed the supF type test statistic as given in Equation (8) :(8) F T  λ 1  , ⋯ , λ k  ; q    = 1 T  T - k + 1    q - p  kq      δ ^   ′  R  ′  ( R V ^  δ ^     R  ′  )  - 1   R δ ^       In Equation (8) , where k is the number of breakpoints, T i  = T λ i  , i = 1 , ⋯ , k   , and ( R δ )  ′  = δ 1  ′  - δ 2  ′  , ⋯ , δ k  ′  - δ k + 1  ′  )    are defined (Bai and Perron, 2003a, 2003b). Here, V ^  δ ^     , δ ^        is the robust variance–covariance matrix (the heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation consistent estimator of the covariance matrix) of the coefficients based on serial correlation and varying variances, given by V ^  δ ^     = p l i m T ( Z  ¯    ′  M x  Z  ¯   )  - 1   Z  ¯    ′  M x  Ω M x  ( Z  ¯    ′  M x  Z  ¯   )  - 1     . The asymptotic distribution of the F statistic depends on a trimming parameter ε that determines the number of observations (h) in each regime and is formulated as ε  = h⁄T. The Bai and Perron approach should begin by testing the null hypothesis of no structural breaks in the series against the alternative hypothesis of at most M breakpoints (Bai and Perron, 2003b). If the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, it is concluded that there are no significant breaks in the series. For testing this hypothesis, double maximum tests have been proposed, and two different test statistics have been developed, namely λ j  ^  = T ^  j  / T ,    (j = 1,…,m) (Bai and Perron, 2003a). One of them is the UDMax  1 ≤ m ≤ M   F T  λ 1  , ⋯ , λ m  ; q       statistic, and the other is the WDMax F T  M , q       statistic, which follows an individual strategy for each regime. Critical values have been generated for these statistics for various numbers of maximum breaks and trimming values (Bai and Perron, 2003b). If the null hypothesis is rejected based on double maximum tests, it indicates the presence of significant structural breaks in the series. Different Bai and Perron test strategies are proposed based on whether the error distributions are homogeneous or heterogeneous across regimes. The approach that allows for heterogeneous error distributions across regimes is the sequential Bai-Perron approach (Bai and Perron, 2003a ). This test strategy begins by testing the null hypothesis of no breaks (ℓ  = 0) against the alternative hypothesis of one break (ℓ  + 1 = 1). If the null hypothesis is rejected, the null hypothesis of one break (ℓ  = 1) is tested against the alternative hypothesis of two breaks (ℓ  + 1 = 2). The test statistic of the sequential BP test, based on the hypothesis testing strategy, is denoted as supFT (ℓ |ℓ  + 1). The hypothesis test is conducted based on whether each added breakpoint significantly minimizes the sum of squared residuals of the model. This leads to the conclusion of no break or ℓ  breaks until the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Bai and Perron (2003b)  provided critical values for this test in their work.   4 Empirical results Before starting the analyses, the definitions of the selected representative variables (series) for each SDG and the periods and sources from which these variables (series) were obtained are presented in Table 1  . Following Table 1 , descriptive statistics of the SDG representative variables are reported in Table 2  . For the SDG1 indicator, the percentage of people living on less than an average of $2.15 per day between 1980 and 2020 is 0.758 %. Based on the data, before 2003, this figure was in the range of 0.5 % to 0.7 %, but after 2003, it increased to a range between 1 % and 1.2 % in the United States. In conclusion, poverty rates have increased since 2003. Regarding the SDG2 indicator, the average daily per capita calorie was 3,488 between 1961 and 2020. According to the SDG3 indicator, based on UNICEF data, the under-five mortality rate averaged 39,545 deaths between 1972 and 2021. However, while the highest value was 71,162 deaths in 1972, it decreased to the lowest value of 23,162 deaths in 2021, indicating an improvement in this indicator. For the SDG4 indicator, the average % of the population with higher education degrees in the 25–34 age group between 1981 and 2021 is 36 %. As of 2020, it is noted that the highest value for this percentage was 51 %, and the lowest value was 23.3 %, which occurred in 1981. For SDG 5, the employment-to-population ratio for females aged 15 and above has averaged 54 % between 1991 and 2021. The ratio has varied within the range of 51 % to 56 %. For SDG 6, the death rate from unsafe water sources averages 0.07 %. The period with the highest rate was between 2002 and 2008, when the rate was 0.1 %. Subsequently, the death rate from unsafe water sources decreased in the following years. For SDG7, in the indicator “Renewable energy Total, % of primary energy supply,” the average percentage of total renewable energy within the primary energy supply has been 5.67 % between 1990 and 2021. It is known that this percentage has been increasing in recent years, with the highest value of 8.43 % occurring in the year 2021. In the context of SDG 8, the indicator measuring “GDP per capita growth (annual %)” reveals that the average annual per capita growth rate between 1961 and 2021 was 1.62 %. However, within the U.S. economy, several periods witnessed negative growth rates in this indicator. These downturns occurred during the 1970–1974 oil crisis, the year 1975, the economic challenges of 1980–1982, the economic conditions of 1991, the aftermath of the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, and the economic impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. These negative growth periods reflect significant economic challenges and recessions experienced during those years. In the context of SDG 9, the total patent applications are an essential indicator that reflects a country's activities and potential in science and technology. Patent applications represent an official request for the protection and ownership rights of a new and original invention or discovery. Between 1980 and 2020, the average number of patent applications (Patent applications total) amounted to 327,536. This figure reached its lowest point at 103,703 in 1983 and its highest (max) at 621,453 in 2019. Within the framework of SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequalities, the Gini coefficient has been used as an indicator. Between 1970 and 2021, the average Gini coefficient was 35.57. Calculated on a scale from 0 to 100, the Gini coefficient reached its lowest point at 31 in the 1970 s and its highest value of 38.8 in 2021. Over the years, the Gini coefficient has increased, indicating a rise in income inequality. For SDG11, the urbanization rate, which measures the percentage of the population living in urban areas, averaged 76.57 % between 1960 and 2021. In 1960, the country with the lowest urbanization rate (69.99 %) reached the highest rate (82.87 %) by 2021. For SDG12, the average per capita municipal waste generated was 755.85 kg between 1990 and 2018. In 2018, the highest value reached was 811.5 kg. For SDG13, the total greenhouse gas emissions in terms of CO2  equivalent (Total GHG in CO2  eq) averaged 6,354 million tons between 1970 and 2021. GHG emissions are expressed in Mton CO2  eq. GHG emissions include C02  (fossil only), CH4, N20 and F-gases. For SDG14, the selected indicator “Fishing Grounds” is a component of the ecological footprint. Fishing grounds refer to areas related to the harvesting and cultivating of fish and other aquatic products in water sources such as seas, oceans, lakes, and rivers. These areas are crucial for the sustainable management of marine resources and the conservation of ecosystems. Between 1961 and 2018, the average per capita fishing grounds (gha per person) amounted to 0.1114 gha. For SDG15, the indicator “Grazing Land” is another component of the ecological footprint. Grazing land plays a critical role in the preservation of natural ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, maintaining soil quality, and combating climate change. Between 1961 and 2018, the average per capita grazing land was 0.42 gha (global hectares) per person. For SDG16, the Egalitarian Democracy Index averaged 0.67 between 1970 and 2022. This index, which ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a more democratic state and values closer to 0 indicating a less democratic state, experienced its lowest value of 0.55 in 1970 and its highest value of 0.74 in 2013. This index, based on expert assessments and provided by V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy), combines various factors to assess the level of democracy. It considers elements such as voting rights, the freedom and fairness of elections, freedoms of association and expression, and the extent to which the protection of rights, access to power, and the distribution of resources are equal. The index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a higher level of democracy, while lower values indicate a lower level of democracy. It provides a comprehensive measure of democracy in each country. Additionally, by examining the Jarque–Bera test results, it is understood that all variables exhibit a normal distribution at the 5 % significance level. The linearity properties of the series were determined through the test developed by Harvey et al. (2008) . The results of this test are reported in Table 3   of the study. According to the results of Harvey et al. (2008) , it can be observed that the series for SDG7, SDG8, and SDG11 are non-linear. On the other hand, the other series appear to exhibit linear characteristics. Linear series underwent the FWADF test, while non-linear series underwent the FWKSS test. The results of the linear unit root test are reported in Table 4  . In Table 4 , the t-statistics of the linear series for SDG1, SDG2, SDG5, SDG9, SDG13, and SDG15 indicate suitability for the Fourier test. For the suitable series, stationarity is shown based on examining the test statistics against critical values. However, for SDG3, SDG4, SDG6, SDG10, SDG12, SDG14, and SDG16, the t-statistics of the acquired series are unsuitable for the Fourier test, so WADF is applied. According to the WADF results, it is observed that the variables for SDG4, SDG6, and SDG12 are also stationary. This suggests that these indicators exhibit resistance to shocks; consequently, the applied policies do not have a lasting impact on the series. It is observed that the variables for SDG3, SDG10, SDG14, and SDG16 are unit roots. The results of the nonlinear unit root test are reported in Table 5  . It is observed that the nonlinear variables of SDG7 and SDG8 exhibit unit roots. The series containing unit roots, indicating the persistence of shocks, are SDG3, SDG7, SDG8, SDG9, SDG10, SDG14, SDG15, and SDG16. Breaks in these series under both stationary and trended models and the significance of these breaks have been tested using the Bai-Perron Test. Since breaks in the SDG8 (see also Supplementary Data 1 ) series are not statistically significant, this is presented in the Appendix. After conducting all tests, Table 6   presents the SDG representative variables with either stationarity or containing unit roots. The empirical methodology of this study is founded on the idea that stationary series can be perceived as resilient to shocks, making them less prone to the effects of policy changes. On the other hand, series with unit roots can be seen as experiencing long-lasting impacts from shocks and policy interventions. Consequently, government policies involving variables with unit roots could lead to more expensive and time-consuming outcomes in achieving the desired SDGs. This finding highlights the need for governments to formulate more effective and efficient policies to achieve SDGs. Based on this premise, the Bai-Perron test results, corresponding graphs, and policy implications will be provided only for the SDGs containing unit roots. According to the results of Table 7   from the Bai-Perron Test, the UDMax and WDMax values are greater than the critical values. Furthermore, in the Sequential Bai-Perron Test, there is evidence of a significant structural break in the time series. Therefore, two different regimes have been identified. The first regime spans from 1972 to 1978, consisting of 7 years, while the second regime covers the period from 1979 to 2021, totaling 43 years, and the trend term is found to be statistically significant. A significant structural break occurred in 1979. Fig. 1   above reveals a structural break in the “Under-five deaths” series, representing SDG3, in 1979. The following developments could potentially explain this structural break. In 1979, Edward M. Kennedy put forth a bipartisan universal national health insurance bill, suggesting the availability of federally regulated private health insurance plans without cost sharing, funded through income-based premiums via employer and individual mandates. This proposal also entailed the substitution of Medicaid with government-funded premiums for private insurers and improvements to Medicare, including prescription drug coverage and removing premiums and cost-sharing (Paul, 2011 ). In the same year, President Jimmy Carter introduced a more constrained health insurance reform, encompassing an employer mandate for catastrophic private health insurance, cost-free coverage for pregnant women and infants, federalization of Medicaid extension for people with low incomes without dependent minor children, and an enhanced Medicare plan featuring catastrophic coverage (Marie, 2000 ). According to the results of Table 8   from the Bai-Perron Test, the UDMax and WDMax values are greater than the critical values. Therefore, the Sequential Bai-Perron Test has two significant structural breaks in the time series. Consequently, three different regimes have been identified. The first regime spans from 1990 to 1995, consisting of 6 observations. The second regime covers the period from 1996 to 2002, totaling seven observations. The third regime spans from 2003 to 2021, comprising 19 observations. In the first regime, except for the trend coefficient, both the constant and trend terms are statistically significant. The structural breaks in 1996 and 2003 are significant (see Tables 9–13      ). Fig. 2   above reveals structural breaks in the “renewable energy total, % of primary energy supply ” series, representing SDG7, in 1996 and 2003. In 1996, a negative impact (break) was caused by a shock in the renewable energy sector, whereas a positive impact (break) made in 2003 supported renewable energy policies. The structural break in 2003 could be explained by the following Energy Policy Act of 2003. This act provided new incentives for the increased development and use of clean and renewable energy. It mandated a federal renewable energy resources assessment to assist in the long-term planning to expand renewable energy production (USSC, 2023 ). According to the results of the Bai-Perron Test for SDG 9, it is observed that the UDMax and WDMax values are greater than the critical values. Consequently, when the Sequential Bai-Perron Test is conducted, three significant structural breaks (1986, 1996, 2013) are identified within the time series. Therefore, four different regimes have been established. The first regime covers the period from the beginning of the series to the first break in 1980–1985. The second regime spanned from 1986 to 1995. The third regime covers the period from 1996 to 2012. The fourth regime encompasses the period from 2013 to 2020. The trend coefficient in the first regime is statistically insignificant, so that no specific interpretation can be made for this period. In the other regimes, both the constant and trend terms are statistically significant. A positive trend coefficient for the relevant periods implies an increase in the total number of patent applications over time. Notably, the trend coefficient in 1996–2012 is higher than in other periods. This is attributed to companies like Google (established in 1998), SpaceX (established in 2002), Tesla (established in 2003), Facebook (established in 2004), Instagram (established in 2010), and others applying for and receiving patents during this time frame. Fig. 3   above reveals structural breaks in the “Patent applications total (residents + nonresidents)” series, representing SDG9, in 1986, 1996, and 2013. While there was a notable surge in the number of patent applications, particularly during the period from 1986 to 2013, it was observed that this growth rate declined after 2013. The following developments could explain the structural break in 2013. Under the AIA (America Invents Act), specific patent fees were reduced, but the most significant expense remained to hire an attorney. Since most applicants opted for legal assistance, the process didn't necessarily become more affordable under the AIA. Both individual inventors and small businesses faced challenges in filing patent applications. The Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB) oversaw trials and post-grant examinations, although not all were open to the public, reducing transparency in the process. This lack of transparency significantly impacted small inventors more than larger entities. According to the Bai-Perron Test results for SDG 10, it is observed that the UDMax and WDMax values are greater than the critical values. Consequently, two significant structural breaks (1982, 1993) are identified within the time series when the Sequential Bai-Perron Test is conducted. Therefore, three different regimes have been established. The first regime covers the period from the beginning of the series to the first break in 1970–1981. The second regime spans from 1982 to 1992. The third regime encompasses the period from 1993 to 2021. In all regimes, both the constant and trend terms are statistically significant. A positive trend coefficient for the relevant periods implies increased income inequality over time. Fig. 4   above reveals structural breaks in the “Gini Coefficient” series, representing SDG10, in 1982 and 1993. The following developments could explain the structural breaks in 1982 and 1993. The decline in the real value of the minimum wage during the 1980 s, influenced by the high inflation rates, could have contributed to the disruption of income equality. This circumstance also increased income inequality (Gordon, 1996; Galbraith, 1998 ). One of the potential reasons for the negative break in 1993 can be explained by the 1990–1991 recession (Thomas and Emmanuel, 2006 ). Plotnick (1993)  also argues that within the framework of fiscal policies, President Ronald Reagan's tax policy (cuts) in the 1980 s contributed to increased income inequality in the USA. According to the Bai-Perron Test results for SDG 14, it is observed that the UDMax and WDMax values are greater than the critical values. Consequently, when the Sequential Bai-Perron Test is conducted, four significant structural breaks (1970, 1987, 2000, and 2008) are identified within the time series. Therefore, five different regimes have been established. The first regime covers the period from the beginning of the series to the first break in 1961–1969. The second regime spanned from 1970 to 1986. The third regime covers the period from 1987 to 1999. The fourth regime encompasses the period from 2000 to 2007. The fifth regime covers the period from 2008 to 2018. The constant and trend terms are statistically significant in all regimes except the third one. This suggests that income inequality increased during the periods represented by these regimes. For the Fishing Grounds series in Fig. 5  , a subcomponent of the ecological footprint representing Life Below Water (SDG14), a total of 4 structural breaks occurred in 1970, 1987, 2000, and 2008. Fishing Grounds assesses the comprehensive context of marine fisheries management, considering legal, social, economic, and biological aspects. Differing interests among fishermen, coastal communities, governments, and environmental organizations can lead to conflicts. The trend shows a decreased from 1961 to 1969, attributed to technological limitations and unsustainable practices. The 1987–1999 period exhibits an insignificant trend. In other sections, an increasing trend suggests improvements and the creation of new production areas within food resources. According to the Bai-Perron Test results for SDG 15, it is observed that the UDMax and WDMax values are greater than the critical values. Consequently, when the Sequential Bai-Perron Test is conducted, one significant structural break in 1974 is identified within the time series. Therefore, two different regimes have been established. The first regime covers the period from the beginning of the series to the first break in 1961–1973. The second regime encompasses the period from 1974 to 2018. In both regimes, both the constant and trend terms are statistically significant. The negative trend coefficient for the relevant periods suggests a decrease in terrestrial life between these periods. Despite a little structural break in 1974 in Fig. 6  , the Grazing Land, which pertains to areas suitable for or utilized for livestock grazing, has experienced a continuous decline over an extended period. This prolonged decline could be attributed to agricultural expansion, urbanization, climate change, economic changes, land degradation, and conservation efforts. According to the Bai-Perron Test results for SDG 16, it is observed that the UDMax and WDMax values are greater than the critical values. Consequently, when the Sequential Bai-Perron Test is conducted, two significant structural breaks in 1974 are identified within the time series. Therefore, three different regimes have been established. The first regime covers the period from the beginning of the series to the first break in 1970–1981. The second regime spans from 1982 to 2015. The third regime encompasses the period from 2016 to 2022. In all three regimes, both the constant and trend terms are statistically significant. This suggests significant structural changes within these periods, but the underlying variables were statistically significant. The Egalitarian democracy index, published by V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy), is based on the concept that inequalities impede the full realization of individuals' formal rights and freedoms, as well as constrain the political involvement of citizens from various social contexts (V-Dem, 2023 ). It also combines the fairness of elections and the extent to which the protection of rights, access to power, and distribution of resources are equal. It ranges from 0 to 1 (most democratic). Fig. 7   above reveals structural breaks in the “Egalitarian democracy index” series, representing SDG16, in 1982 and 1993. Vormann and Weinman (2021)  associate these declines with the inner long-term balances of the policy and argue that after the 2016 elections, the democratic crisis transformed into a constitutional crisis. In conclusion, the examination of SDG3, SDG7, SDG9, SDG10, SDG14, SDG15, and SDG16 provides a holistic approach to sustainability for the USA, covering environmental aspects, democracy, economic growth innovation, and poverty reduction.  5 Policy implications for SDGs containing unit roots In this section, policy implications will be generated for each analyzed SDG. These implications will provide insights and recommendations for policymakers aiming to address the specific challenges associated with each goal. SDG3 (  Under-five deaths) : The structural break observed in under-five deaths in 1979, possibly influenced by significant healthcare policy changes, necessitates a professional and focused approach to tackle this pressing issue. To decrease under-five deaths, US policymakers must prioritize the assessment and expansion of healthcare policies that directly impact children's well-being. This entails a comprehensive evaluation of policy effectiveness, including provisions for cost-free coverage of pregnant women and infants and interventions to enhance maternal and child health. Additionally, the government must explore avenues for further enhancing Medicaid support for families with dependent minor children, ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to adequate healthcare. Furthermore, public health education campaigns should target parents and caregivers to promote preventive care, vaccinations, and early childhood interventions. Continuous data monitoring and analysis will be essential to track progress in reducing under-five deaths facilitating evidence-based adjustments to healthcare policies. Lastly, bipartisan collaboration is necessary to establish and sustain policies that prioritize the well-being and survival of young children, working towards a significant reduction in under-five mortality rates in the US. SDG7 (renewable energy total, % of primary energy supply) : The structural breaks identified in the “renewable energy total, % of primary energy supply” dataset in 1996 and 2003 underscore the critical role of government policy in advancing sustainable energy goals, particularly in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7). The 2003 structural break, which was influenced by the Energy Policy Act of 2003, presents a convincing argument for US policymakers to continue reinforcing their dedication to renewable energy. To maximize the positive effects of this break, policymakers should prioritize a comprehensive strategy. This encompasses sustaining and expanding incentives to promote clean and renewable energy development, fostering a favorable regulatory environment, and promoting long-term planning through periodic federal assessments of renewable energy resources. Infrastructure enhancements, including grid integration and energy storage, are crucial to ensuring the dependability and resilience of renewable energy sources. Additionally, investments in research and development are vital for enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of renewable technologies, enabling them to compete with traditional fossil fuels. By establishing ambitious targets for clean energy adoption and emissions reduction, supported by public awareness campaigns and initiatives for workforce development, the transition to sustainable energy sources can be accelerated while fostering economic growth. Augmenting environmental regulations and international collaboration can further solidify the US's commitment to decreasing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. Continuous monitoring and reporting mechanisms will offer the necessary transparency to track progress, make well-informed policy adjustments, and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable and resilient energy future for the nation. SDG9 (  Patent applications total (residents + nonresidents) : The structural breaks observed in the “Patent applications total (residents + nonresidents)” series (SDG9) in 1986, 1996, and 2013 carry significant policy implications for US policymakers. The surge in patent applications witnessed between 1986 and 2013 necessitates policy adjustments considering the decline in growth rates after 2013. The 2013 structural break can be traced back to changes implemented under the America Invents Act (AIA), which aimed to decrease patent fees. However, the high cost of hiring an attorney remains an obstacle to affordability, ultimately limiting its impact on accessibility. To tackle this issue, the government could explore measures to enhance the affordability of the patent application process for individual inventors and small businesses, such as reducing legal costs or introducing support mechanisms. Moreover, ensuring enhanced transparency within the patent system, especially concerning trials and examinations overseen by the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB), is paramount. By addressing these challenges and fostering equal access to patents, the objectives of SDG9 are upheld while simultaneously promoting innovation across all sectors. SDG10 (Gini Coefficient) : The significant structural breaks observed in the series of the “Gini Coefficient,” which reflect SDG10 in 1982 and 1993, underscore the urgent necessity for a comprehensive policy response from the US government to combat the persistent problem of income inequality. To effectively address these crucial turning points, policymakers should adopt a holistic approach encompassing a wide range of policy measures to promote economic fairness, reduce income disparities, and foster a more equitable and just society. This approach should include raising the federal minimum wage to ensure fair compensation for all workers mitigating income disparities at the lower end of the wage spectrum. Implementing progressive tax reforms can help redistribute wealth more equitably by imposing a heavier tax burden on high-income earners while providing relief to those with lower incomes. Strengthening social safety nets, such as unemployment benefits and food assistance programs, is crucial to protect vulnerable populations from economic hardship, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Investing in accessible and high-quality education, from early childhood to higher education, and ensuring affordable healthcare for all can promote economic mobility, break the cycle of poverty, and decrease income disparities. Enforcing labor market reforms, including measures to secure equitable wages and safeguard workers' rights, can contribute to narrowing income gaps and creating fairer workplaces. Addressing gender and racial disparities in income and wealth through targeted policies and anti-discrimination measures is essential for rectifying systemic injustices. Supporting small businesses and implementing job training initiatives can create opportunities for economic advancement, especially among underserved communities. Expanding the availability of affordable housing is pivotal in addressing income disparities related to housing, ensuring everyone has access to safe and stable housing. Emphasizing inclusive economic growth policies that prioritize the well-being of all citizens, regardless of their income level, is crucial for reducing income inequality. Furthermore, promoting transparent trade practices, encouraging efforts towards financial inclusion to provide banking and credit access to marginalized populations, offering accessible childcare services to working parents, and providing targeted assistance to marginalized communities can collectively contribute significantly to narrowing income disparities and aligning with the objectives of SDG10. Through implementing these multifaceted policy implications, US policymakers can strive to achieve a more equitable and just society where income disparities are diminished, and economic opportunities are accessible to all, aligning with the goals of SDG10. SDG14 (  Fishing Grounds) : The occurrence of four structural breaks in the Fishing Grounds series, a critical subcomponent of the ecological footprint associated with Life Below Water (SDG14), underscores the imperative for comprehensive policy actions by US policymakers. Achieving the sustainability of marine fisheries and addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by varying interests and historically unsustainable practices demand a multidimensional approach. US policymakers should prioritize implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management, which considers the catch quotas and the broader ecological context of marine ecosystems, thereby safeguarding marine biodiversity while ensuring sustainable fisheries practices. Engaging coastal communities, fishermen, and other stakeholders in decision-making processes can be instrumental in resolving conflicts of interest, fostering shared responsibility for marine resource conservation, and promoting sustainable practices. Investment in research and monitoring programs is crucial to assessing marine fisheries' health and sustainability, providing valuable data for informed decision-making. Adopting sustainable fishing practices through incentives, education, and capacity building is imperative for reducing bycatch, minimizing habitat damage, and optimizing resource utilization. Addressing harmful fisheries subsidies and reforming these financial incentives to redirect support towards conservation and sustainable management efforts is essential to curbing overfishing and promoting responsible practices. Policymakers should also strategize to tackle the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and fisheries, with adaptation measures and mitigation efforts aimed at addressing warming waters and ocean acidification. International collaboration, including enforcing international agreements, is pivotal in promoting sustainable fisheries management on a global scale. Expansion of the network of marine protected areas, bolstering their capacity to safeguard critical habitats and breeding grounds, can provide vital conservation tools to support sustainable fisheries. Additionally, raising public awareness about the significance of marine conservation and sustainable fishing practices through educational campaigns and stakeholder engagement can help consumers make informed choices that positively impact marine ecosystems. By implementing these multifaceted policy implications, US policymakers can contribute substantively to achieving SDG14′s objectives of preserving marine life, ensuring sustainable fisheries, and safeguarding the future of our oceans. SDG15 (  Grazing Land) : The decline observed in Grazing Land, sustained and significant, with a minor structural break in 1974 (as depicted in Fig. 6 ), presents a complex and pressing challenge that requires comprehensive policy responses from US policymakers. To effectively address this multifaceted issue, policymakers should adopt a holistic approach encompassing several vital dimensions. Firstly, robust land use planning and zoning regulations are essential to designate specific areas for agriculture and urban development while safeguarding critical grazing lands for livestock. Strengthening conservation programs with financial incentives for landowners to protect and restore grazing lands is pivotal for preserving these critical landscapes. Smart urban planning that minimizes urban sprawl and protects agricultural and grazing areas should be a priority. Erosion control, soil conservation, and responsible water resource management are vital to combat land degradation and ensure adequate water availability for livestock and agriculture. Research and data collection efforts are necessary to understand the dynamics of grazing land decline. A robust monitoring and reporting system will help track grazing land quality and quantity changes, facilitating data-driven policymaking and adaptive interventions. Through these comprehensive measures, US policymakers can work towards reversing the decline in Grazing Land, ensuring the sustainability of livestock agriculture, and achieving a balanced and resilient landscape for future generations. SDG16 (Egalitarian democracy index) : The breaks in the series of the “Egalitarian democracy index” in 1982 and 2016 emphasize the urgent need for policymakers in the United States to address the interconnected issues of inequality and democracy, particularly those related to elections. To address these complex challenges effectively, policymakers should prioritize reducing income and wealth disparities by implementing progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market reforms. Moreover, promoting social cohesion and bridging societal divisions is vital in mitigating polarization and enhancing inclusivity within the democratic framework, ultimately leading to more equitable elections. US policymakers should also consider potential constitutional reforms to strengthen democratic institutions and ensure their resilience in the face of evolving challenges, such as election integrity and campaign finance. International cooperation and data-driven governance can further support these efforts, as long-term commitment and public engagement remain central to achieving a more equitable and resilient democracy that aligns with the objectives of SDG16.  6 Concluding remarks In conclusion, this study highlights the crucial significance of considering the inherent characteristics of data series associated with the United Nations' SDGs during the policymaking process. The presence of unit roots in data can significantly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of policies to achieve the SDGs. Policymakers must exercise caution regarding the potential for costly and time-consuming outcomes when relying on such data for policy development. It is imperative to develop flexible and adaptive policy strategies to navigate the complexities of these data series effectively. Continuous refinement and innovation of policies will be essential to align with the ever-evolving challenges and opportunities presented by non-stationary data. Pursuing the UN’s SDGs requires a commitment to resilient and data-driven governance prioritizing equity, sustainability, and societal well-being. Policymakers must remain vigilant to ensure that policies are well-informed and capable of withstanding shocks while fostering long-term responses to pursue a better and more sustainable future. Evaluations related to the stationary series are presented below. The observation that stationary series are resistant to change implies that policies implemented have not effectively improved these indicators. For instance, the eradication of SDG1 (Poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population) has not been achieved. Poverty rates are measured at $3.65 and $6.85 per day. Despite our focus on the lowest income group, more than the implemented policies are needed to improve this indicator. A significant decrease in 2020 could be attributed to direct income support during the pandemic. Nevertheless, due to the series' persistent nature, it has maintained its resilience. In the case of SDG2 (Food supply in kcal per capita per day), it might appear higher than other countries because the indicator is calculated as an average. However, high levels of inequality exist, with some people living on less than $2.15 per day and others engaging in excessive consumption. This inequality in food supply is evident in countries with high obesity rates, such as the United States. In such countries, the indicator remains resistant to change, indicating that the policies implemented may have yet to successfully address the issue. SDG4 (Population with tertiary education) is stationary; therefore, no active policy and structural breaks have been implemented. For SDG5 (Employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%), it is known that in many developed countries, the employment rates for women are 60 %, and in countries like Sweden, Norway, and Finland, it can even reach the 70 s. In the United States, the rate has fluctuated between 52 % and 60 % during the current data period, and active policies implemented have not been able to change the direction of the series. SDG6 (Death rate from unsafe water sources) series has shallow values, at one per thousand. SDG11 (Urban Population (% of total population) rate has increased over time, but there is no sharp policy change. SDG12 (Municipal Waste Generated Per Capita): per capita municipal waste generation is above the global average compared to other countries, increasing over time. It can be said that there has been no active policy implemented to reduce this, or such policies have not been influential on the series. However, this indicator is crucial for sustainability as it relates to excessive consumption and its negative environmental impacts when waste is not adequately managed, recycled, or repurposed within a circular economy framework. The indicator continues to rise with its resistance. SDG13 (Total GHG in CO2  eq (AR5). Similarly, the total greenhouse gas emissions series is resistant to policies, and tackling it is difficult. There have been some reductions after 2008, but they are small. After 2021, emissions have started to increase again. It is evident that these indicators pose significant challenges for sustainability. In the study, the SDGs in the USA are comprehensively and holistically examined, and the interactions between goals and each other are evaluated. Regarding the research gap, more research is needed on how this approach translates into practical policy implications and how the United States can achieve these goals. This study may enable future researchers and policymakers to examine policy implications based on sustainable development goals in more detail and conduct further research on how these goals can be translated into practical applications proactively. Similarly, this study's findings will allow the US policymakers to see the whole picture within the framework of the essential structural breaking dates and events that we have identified in the research and that they closely observed, and it will help them implement the suggested policy implications. For example, the effects of the Energy Policy Act in 2003 on US renewal energy production and consumption. This study investigates the impact of sustainable development goals for the USA on a country basis. However, the US states can differ significantly in population, economic size, social structure, and laws. These differences may naturally reveal the need to consider the SDGs on a state basis. More precisely, state-based analyses can give more detailed and accurate results. However, the lack of state-based data does not allow such an analysis to be possible. This should be considered as a limitation of our study. It should be noted that the SDG17 (partnerships for the goals) appears to be a unifying and facilitating joint action function in implementing the other 16 Sustainable Development Goals. Hence, SDG 17 contributes to effectively achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. As a result, in line with the results obtained from the study, existing national plans for SDG3, SDG7, SDG9, SDG10, SDG14, SDG15, and SDG16 should continue to be supported. On the other hand, sustainable goals should be pursued with policy changes that will create an appropriate financial, technological, and economic ecosystem for SDG1, SDG2, SDG4, SDG5, SDG6, SDG11, SDG12, and SDG13.
