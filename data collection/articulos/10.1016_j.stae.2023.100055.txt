The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become the leading international reference for achieving a more inclusive and sustainable model of development. Businesses play an important role in changing the existing model. Analysis of the engagement of businesses with the SDGs first requires knowledge of how managers perceive advances toward achieving these goals. This knowledge is missing from the academic literature. This paper proposes a synthetic indicator that captures company managers’ ratings of how well their companies are meeting the 17 SDGs. To create the synthetic indicator, the DP2 distance method was applied. Companies that most positively rate the degree of achievement of the SDGs belong to the agrifood sector.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Sustainable business  Perceptions  Cooperatives  Synthetic indicator  2030 agenda    Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 carefully designed aims proposed as part of the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda in 2015. These goals are subdivided into 169 targets for global development that should be achieved by 2030. Besides highlighting problems and setting priorities, the UN's aim is to address global challenges such as world health, climate change, living conditions, and inequality (Desa, 2016 ). Through these 17 goals and 169 targets, the 2030 Agenda seeks to advance social, economic, and environmental development worldwide. It adopts a comprehensive perspective of development, building on the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals, whose deadline for completion ended in 2015 (Rodríguez et al ., 2018a , 2018b ). The success of the 2030 Agenda requires the involvement of private companies through their environmental and social sustainability strategies (Botchway & Bradley, 2023 ). Such involvement can increase the likelihood of achieving the SDGs, contributing to the common good while helping companies themselves. Moreover, sustainability can make good business sense, as long as customers perceive that it offers differential value. Therefore, understanding company managers’ attitudes toward the SDGs is of interest. These attitudes are reflected in companies’ progress in creating policies aligned with the SDGs, trust in and knowledge of the 2030 Agenda, and model of reporting sustainability-related actions to society (Adams, 2017 ; Adams et al ., 2020 ; Adams & Judd, 2016 ; Bebbington & Unerman, 2018 ; Xu et al ., 2020 ). The 2030 Agenda explicitly calls for collaboration from businesses to develop sustainable and innovative business models against a background of public scrutiny (Busco et al ., 2017 ; Puertas et al ., 2022 ; Guaita et al., 2019 ). This scrutiny stems from the strict sustainability-related demands that society places on companies (de Castro et al ., 2020 , 2019 ; Guaita et al ., 2022 ). Even though the SDG literature is extensive, it does not fully address the SDG-related challenges faced by companies (Bebbington & Unerman, 2020 ). One aspect that is missing from the SDG literature is company managers’ perceptions of the SDGs. These perceptions may refer to several areas, such as the perceived relevance of SDG-oriented innovation in order to make real changes to meet the SDGs (Schramade, 2017 ). Another topic that is missing from the literature relates to company managers’ perceptions of meeting the SDGs. This issue, which is the focus of the present paper, may condition company strategies or the speed at which changes occur. The private sector has a duty to meet the SDGs (Pedersen, 2018 ). Therefore, the gap in the knowledge of these perceptions makes this topic important, and in-depth analyses are required to respond to calls from scholars (Bebbington & Unerman, 2018 , 2020 ). Studies have explored how business characteristics affect companies’ engagement with the SDGs (Rosati & Faria, 2019 ), how sustainability standards are met (Mio et al ., 2020 ), and how superficial approaches known as SDG-washing can prove dangerous (Nishitani et al ., 2021 ). Despite the scope and importance of the SDGs worldwide, studies of the potential advantages for firms and managers’ perceptions of the SDGs have mostly been theoretical (Soonsiripanichkul & Ngamcharoenmongkol, 2019 ). In light of this background, the current paper is part of a series of studies aimed at analyzing the characteristics of the companies that are most committed to meeting the SDGs (Nishitani et al ., 2021 ; Rosati & Faria, 2019 ). Specifically, this paper presents analysis of the perceived degree of achievement of the SDGs of cooperative managers in the Spanish region of Valencia (Comunidad Valenciana ). These companies belong to the social economy, so one of their defining features is their focus on social aims. They are therefore closely aligned with the achievement of the SDGs. The aim is to compare the ratings of managers of these social economy enterprises on the extent to which the SDGs are being met at the halfway point of the 2030 deadline established by the UN. A synthetic indicator is proposed to analyze possible differences in cooperative managers’ perceptions of the degree of achievement of the SDGs according to factors such as sector, size, and age. The paper also explores the aspects that explain differences in ratings between cooperatives. The aspects with the greatest discriminatory capacity are highlighted as those that are subject to a wide range of opinions of the cooperative managers. To create the synthetic indicator, the DP2 distance methodology was applied. This approach was proposed by Pena (1977) . It has several advantages. For instance, it avoids including redundant information in the data aggregation process. Instead, it assigns objective weights to the partial indicators (Ribeiro-Navarrete et al., 2021 ; Rodríguez et al., 2016 , 2017 ). This study is exploratory in nature. It seeks to provide empirical evidence that can reinforce or refute existing theories on companies’ acknowledgement of the importance of the SDGs. This approach is justified given that research on this topic is still at an early stage. Hence, exploratory studies are appropriate. The proposed analysis is based on fieldwork from 2022. Data on a sample of cooperatives located in the region of Valencia, Spain, were provided by managers. The responses cover 67 aspects of the 17 SDGs. These responses reflect managers’ perceptions of the cooperatives’ achievement of the SDGs. They thus provide a comprehensive overview of this situation. The method could be replicated in other contexts to provide knowledge of the degree of involvement of businesses in the achievement of the SDGs.  A major challenge, a major commitment The 2030 Agenda 2030 is a fundamental tool in the search for sustainable, equitable, overall development. However, its broad scope makes the use of indicators difficult (De Moura and Rodrigues, 2023 ). In such situations, synthetic indicators, such as the one presented in this paper, are useful, given that they synthesize the complex information that describes a phenomenon (Guaita et al ., 2021 ), in this case the SDGs. The 2030 Agenda has environmental, social, and economic pillars. Achieving the SDGs requires steady progress in strengthening all three (United Nations, 2015 ). This progress must involve commitment on the part of companies. They must therefore perceive these goals as their own. These three pillars provide a benchmark for sustainable development around the world and describe a common approach to sustainable development initiatives (Gericke et al ., 2019 ; Nishitani et al ., 2021 ). The importance of having businesses with a sustainable development model was noted prior to the implementation of the SDGs. The relevance of the private sector was acknowledged in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (Rodriguez et al ., 2018a ). The private sector must harness investment capital and channel it toward social and environmental ends (Lucci, 2012 ; Porter & Kramer, 2011 ; Sharma et al ., 2022 ; Zuazua et al ., 2023 ). The growing demand for a more socially and environmentally responsible production model, especially among younger generations (Severo et al ., 2019 ; Martín & Salinas, 2022 ), amplifies the call to adopt practices aligned with the SDGs. This call encourages organizations to address sustainability more actively and visibly and to pursue their own aims to achieve the SDGs, protect the environment, and improve well-being (Jiang et al ., 2022 ; Nishitani et al ., 2021 ). The SDGs offer a vehicle for companies to communicate how they create sustainable value for stakeholders (Adams et al ., 2020 ). In the corporate sector, the practice of publishing social and environmental responsibility reports has become widespread (Fifka & Drabble, 2012 ; Qamri et al ., 2022 ; Zhou et al ., 2022 ). These reports are beginning to show signs of links to the SDGs (Botchway & Bradley, 2023 ). The SDGs can thus be considered an innovation within sustainable development practices, or at least an innovation in sustainable development reporting, because this idea is perceived as new by individuals or organizations (Rogers, 2003 ). Studies have shown that companies’ implementation of the SDGs, or at least linking their strategies to the SDGs, encourages customer loyalty (Keh & Xie, 2009 ; Heffernan et al ., 2018 ). This cause-effect relationship is built on three pathways: a change in the perceived reputation of the company, greater trust in the company, and customers’ identification with the company's values. Reputation, trust, and identification between customer and company forge links between marketing and consumer behavior in corporate environments (Keh & Xie, 2009 ; Heffernan et al ., 2018 ; Fernández-Olit et al ., 2020 ). Some theories also predict that linking the SDGs to corporate actions can positively influence corporate image or customer identification with the organization (Soonsiripanichkul & Ngamcharoenmongkol, 2019 ). This line of argument makes sense in a context where consumers behave in a more sustainable manner. Epstein (2008)  defined sustainable consumer behavior as behavior based on the recognition of long-term effects on the natural and social environment. Hosta and Zabkar (2020, p. 275)  added the concept of social responsibility to their definition of a responsible consumer as “someone who carefully weighs what s/he truly needs and also considers how this will affect others (nature, society).” Finally, Lee et al. (2016, p. 79)  defined sustainable consumer behavior as “a consumer's wise balance of financial responsibility, environmental stewardship, social equity and sustenance of personal health.” When analyzing sustainable consumer behavior, young adults are especially important, given their attitudes toward sustainable practices. Post-Millennials (Generation Z) prefer brands that show an interest in environmental and social sustainability (Pencarelli et al., 2019 ). Young consumers are attracted to sustainable and green products and services. Although they have less purchasing power than older consumers, they can influence the behavior of family members (Kuzniar, 2021 ). Mishra et al. (2022)  defined young consumers as sustainability lovers, or people who look for sustainable, ethical, durable, repairable, and handcrafted products. In SDG 12, the 2030 Agenda underscores the need to move toward more responsible consumption and production patterns.  Method Data collection This study is based on data collected in the second half of 2022. This data collection process focused on a sample of cooperatives in the region of Valencia, Spain. This region has a long tradition of social economy enterprises. The sample was randomly selected by contacting cooperatives by email and requesting collaboration. Managers were provided with a link to a questionnaire where they indicated their perceptions of meeting the SDGs on a 7-point Likert scale. All necessary measures were taken to ensure data confidentiality and the anonymity of participants. The questionnaire items referred to perceptions on 67 issues linked to the SDGs. Each item was associated with one of the 17 SDGs. Respondents were ranked in terms of their perceptions of the how well each goal was being met.  Creation of a synthetic indicator This paper proposes a synthetic indicator to assess cooperative managers’ perceptions of how well the SDGs are being met. The P2 distance described by Pena (1977)  provided the basis for the method used to aggregate the data. Data for 67 variables (or partial indicators) were thus synthesized. These variables were associated with the 17 SDGs. The data consisted of cooperative managers’ responses. The responses reflected their perceptions of the degree of achievement of each SDG. Pena (1977)  devised the DP2 method by building on the Ivanovic distance (Ivanovic, 1974 ) and then modifying the way weights were assigned to simple variables. In modifying the weighting system, the coefficient of determination replaced the correlation coefficient as a correction factor (Ribeiro-Navarrete et al ., 2021 ). The DP2 outperforms other synthetic indicator methodologies such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) and principal component analysis (PCA). For example, it does not arbitrarily assign weights to partial indicators. Moreover, it prevents repeated information from being included during creation of the synthetic indicator. Finally, it overcomes issues associated with the use of variables in different units (Somarriba & Pena, 2009 ). This method ensures that synthetic indicators meet all necessary mathematical properties (Pena, 2009 ). Guaita et al . (2019) , Martín et al. (2019) , and Rodríguez et al . (2016 , 2018b ) provide further details. In the present study, DP2 offered a suitable method to create a synthetic indicator based on cooperative managers’ perceptions of achievement of the SDGs. This method measures differences in perceptions depending on the deviation from the minimum. The participating cooperatives were compared with a hypothetical reference company that took the lowest possible value for all variables (Ribeiro-Navarrete et al ., 2021 ). As explained earlier, the DP2 method overcomes the problems that arise when using variables that are given in different units. The solution is to use the standard deviation. Thus, variables are presented in unitless form (Somarriba & Zarzosa, 2016 ). Interestingly, in this study, all variables in fact had the same unit (a Likert-based rating of managers’ perceptions of achievement of the SDGs). The procedure described by Pena (1977)  was followed. Hence, the formula used to calculate the DP2 synthetic indicator for companies in the j th  group was:D P 2  =  ∑ i = 1  n  d i j   σ i    ( 1 − R i ,  i − 1 , … . , 1  2   )  c o n  i = 1 ,  … . , n ; j = 1 , 2 , … , m       The symbol Xij   refers to the value of the i th  dimension of the j th  group. The symbol dij   = |x ij  – x i* | represents the absolute value when the lowest possible value of the indicator for the i th  dimension across all groups is subtracted from the value of the indicator for the i th  dimension of the j th  group. The symbol n  represents the number of partial indicators. For the i th  partial indicator, σ1  represents the standard deviation. Finally, when partial indicator xi   is regressed against dimensions xi-1 ,  xi-2 ,…..,x1  , which have already been added to the synthetic indicator, then R i , i − 1 . i − 2 , … 1  2    represents the coefficient of determination. It has the property that R 1 2  = 0   . The symbol R i , i − 1 . i − 2 , … 1  2    captures the percentage of overall variance of xi   that can be explained by the linear regression in terms of xi-1 ,  xi-2 ,…..,x1  . Pena (1977)  also proposed a correction factor ( 1 − R i , i − 1 . i − 2 , … 1  2    ). This correction factor prevents repeated information from previous partial indicators being added. Crucially, therefore, the DP2 indicator only accepts new information from each additional variable (Somarriba et al., 2015 ). Weights are objectively assigned to variables using the score for the correction factor (Ribeiro-Navarrete et al ., 2021 ). The DP2 indicator is calculated iteratively. The variables are ordered by quantity of information contributed, which, for each variable, is based on the absolute correlation. The process starts with the simple variable with the highest correlation. The process is then iterated until there is convergence in the synthetic indicator values. Zarzosa (1996 , 2005 ) described this iterative process in detail.  The relative amount of information added to the DP2 indicator by each variable and its discriminatory power The DP2 method reveals the indicators that contribute the most information to the synthetic indicator. The key dimensions in explaining variability of the synthetic indicator can thus be identified. The discriminatory power of each variable quantifies how much information it contributes to the synthetic indicator. The discriminatory power of each variable is calculated using the Ivanovic discrimination coefficient (1974). It indicates how much the distribution of the values of each variable differs in the set of groups of companies. It is defined as:D C = 2 m ( m − 1  )     ∑ j , l > j  k i   m j i   m l i   | x j i   −  x l i    X i   ‾   |       The symbol m  represents the number of groups of companies in P . The symbol xji   is the value of variable Xi   in the j th  group of companies. The symbol xli   is the lowest possible value of variable Xi   in the l th  group of companies. The symbol mji   represents the number of groups of companies where Xi   is equal to xji  . The symbol X ¯  i    represents the mean of Xi  . Finally, ki   reflects how many different values Xi   attains over the set P. The Ivanovic–Pena global information coefficient offers an estimation of how much information the variables contribute to the DP2 synthetic indicator. The formula for this coefficient is derived from the combination of the Pena correction factor (1977)  and the Ivanovic discrimination coefficient (1974) . The Ivanovic discrimination coefficient (1974)  provides a statistical measure of the capacity of the partial indicators to distinguish between different levels of performance or achievement. The Pena correction factor (1977)  corrects the distorting effects of the partial indicators in the calculation of the synthetic DP2 indicator.C I P = ∑ i = 1  n  D C ( 1 − R i , i − 1 , i − 2 , … 1  2   )       The symbol n  captures the number of partial indicators. The expression ( 1 − R i , i − 1 , i − 2 , ⋯ , 1  2   )    corresponds to the Pena correction factor. Finally, DCi   is the Ivanovic discrimination coefficient. Another valuable measure is the individual relative information coefficient, which Zarzosa (1996)  defined as:α i  = D C i  ( 1 − R i , i − 1 , i − 2 , … 1  2   )   C I P        This coefficient gives a measure of how important each partial indicator is in relation to the DP2 synthetic indicator. The coefficient is based on how much valuable information each partial variable contributes and how high its discriminatory capacity is. The value of this coefficient falls in the range 0 to 1. This coefficient is intuitive and explains differences between different groups of companies in the ranking of degree of SDG achievement.   Results The previous section describes a method to calculate a DP2 synthetic indicator. This method was applied in this study to calculate a synthetic indicator of cooperative managers’ perceptions of the extent to which the SDGs have been achieved. It was estimated based on the ratings for each of the 17 SDGs. Data on 67 items were collected for this purpose. The Appendix  displays the 17 SDGs and the items used to measure the degree of achievement of the SDGs. Table 1   shows the absolute correlation coefficients. The order of inclusion of each indicator is reflected by these coefficients. The correction factors indicate the amount of new information each partial indicator added to the synthetic indicator. “SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities” was included first in the synthetic indicator, so its correction factor was 1. This value means that 100% of the information that it contributed was added to the DP2 synthetic indicator. The other variables provided less new information. However, in all cases, it was greater than or equal to 31%. In addition to “SDG 10″, the indicators that contributed the most information were “SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals” (58.61%), “SDG 4: Quality Education” (57.33%), and “SDG 5: Gender Equality” (57.27%). This first step assessed the synthetic indicator structure. Next, the partial indicators explaining most of the differences in ratings between groups of firms were identified using the relative individual information coefficient (Zarzosa, 1996 ). By bringing together the valuable information contributed by each variable (in terms of the correction factor) and its discriminatory power (Ivanovic discrimination coefficient), the relative individual information coefficient was calculated. Table 1  shows that three of the 17 indicators had a combined individual relative contribution of 32%. These indicators were “SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities”, “SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals”, and “SDG 15: Life on Land”. The remaining 14 indicators provided 68% of the information. Therefore, these three indicators had the greatest capacity to explain differences in the perceptions of different groups of firms regarding the achievement of the SDGs. The ranking of the DP2 perception indicator is shown in Table 2  . The subsector of companies whose managers perceived the greatest achievement of the SDGs was “Production and marketing of fruit and vegetables” (22.44). The next two subsectors were “Education services” (20.89) and “Agrifood” (20.31). In general, the agroindustry sectors had the most positive perceptions regarding the level of achievement of the SDGs. The overall score was 20.77, compared to 17.99 for the services sector and 19.20 as an overall average for all sectors. Table 3   shows the values of the DP2 indicator for the reference variables of company age and size. Companies with the most positive assessment of achievement of the SDGs were started 10 to 29 years ago (20.77). The lowest assessment was in younger companies less than 10 years old (14.87). The ratings were also lowest among small companies with fewer than 10 employees (16.28) and highest among companies with 10 to 49 employees (21.58).  Discussion and conclusions The SDGs of the UN 2030 Agenda offer a global reference for building a fairer world. In addition to ethical and social justice connotations, the pursuit of the SDGs increasingly affects businesses. As consumers, citizens are demanding greater respect for the planet and inclusive development. As already occurs with environmental sustainability, companies will be able to use their commitment to the SDGs for marketing and communication purposes. The application of business strategies based on the SDGs depends on companies’ recognition of the value of the SDGs. Company managers’ perceptions of the degree of achievement of the SDGs are crucial. Studies of these perceptions are scarce. The present paper attempts to fill this research gap by defining a synthetic indicator of company managers’ perceptions of the achievement of the 17 SDGs. The managers of agrifood companies have the most positive perceptions of the achievement of the SDGs. Therefore, these companies may be the most likely to develop policies aligned with the SDGs. This finding makes sense in that these companies are in direct contact with nature in their day-to-day business. Therefore, they are arguably more likely to be aware of the effects of an unsustainable development model. Likewise, managers of mid-size and mid-age companies also seem to have the most positive perceptions of SDG achievement. Differences between the perceptions of managers of different types of companies can be largely explained by perceptions toward three indicators: “SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities”, “SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals”, and “SDG 15: Life on Land”. This study takes a first step toward enriching knowledge of perceptions about the SDGs in the business world. This study should be complemented by others that extend the scope to cover countries with different characteristics. For policymakers, this study can help reveal what type of information campaigns are needed. These campaigns should be aimed at mobilizing companies to work toward the SDGs. Much work is still needed to trigger a change in moving toward a more sustainable and inclusive production model.
