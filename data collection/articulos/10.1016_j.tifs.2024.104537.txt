                  Background
                  A spiking risk of food security and scarcity has been witnessed over the past decade, mainly due to excessive agricultural activities, climatic actions, and the escalating global population. Hence, effective food waste management (FWM) strategies are essential to alleviate food wastage for a hunger-free and secure future. Accordingly, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 aims to establish sustainable consumption and production patterns, especially by reducing global food wastage and greenhouse gas emissions.
               
                  Scope and approach
                  
                     Spirulina emerged as a superfood owing to its exceptional protein content of 60–70%, while serving as a commercial source of natural blue pigment, c-phycocyanin, recognized as the food colorant E18, inheriting numerous bioactive properties. Thus, this review explores the potential of upcycling wastes from food processing industries in Spirulina cultivation as a promising and sustainable FWM strategy contributing to the advancement of SDG 12. The nutrient-rich Spirulina biomass and protein and c-phycocyanin extracts would be potential novel food ingredients in food industry.
               
                  Key findings and conclusions
                  Global food wastage would be substantially reduced by upcycling food processing industrial waste resources in Spirulina cultivation, facilitating the progression of SDG 12. Simultaneously, this leads to pronounced reductions in carbon, freshwater, and material footprints per capita associated with Spirulina cultivation. Nevertheless, real-time integration of Spirulina cultivation for resource recovery from food processing industrial wastes is challenging, mainly in the aspects of economic feasibility, process sustainability, and public and consumer acceptance.

Scope and approach Spirulina  emerged as a superfood owing to its exceptional protein content of 60–70%, while serving as a commercial source of natural blue pigment, c-phycocyanin, recognized as the food colorant E18, inheriting numerous bioactive properties. Thus, this review explores the potential of upcycling wastes from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation as a promising and sustainable FWM strategy contributing to the advancement of SDG 12. The nutrient-rich Spirulina  biomass and protein and c-phycocyanin extracts would be potential novel food ingredients in food industry.  Key findings and conclusions Global food wastage would be substantially reduced by upcycling food processing industrial waste resources in Spirulina  cultivation, facilitating the progression of SDG 12. Simultaneously, this leads to pronounced reductions in carbon, freshwater, and material footprints per capita associated with Spirulina  cultivation. Nevertheless, real-time integration of Spirulina  cultivation for resource recovery from food processing industrial wastes is challenging, mainly in the aspects of economic feasibility, process sustainability, and public and consumer acceptance.

Concurrently, the global population growth projected at 8.6 billion by mid-2030 would further increase the demand for food production, which would increase food waste while risking global food security (Mok et al., 2020 ; Moyer, 2023 ). Despite the increasing global population facing severe poverty and food insecurity, the total cost of global food waste has reached $ 2.5 trillion per annum (Walker, 2021 ). Meanwhile, 828 million of the human population was affected by hunger in 2021, while more than 600 million people, i.e., 8% of the world population, are projected to face hunger by 2030, as reported by the United Nations (UN) (Ali & Bhattacharjee, 2023 ). Hence, implementations of effective mitigatory actions with coordinated global efforts are essential to alleviate food losses and wastage, in ensuring food security. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 12, “Responsible Consumption and Production”, targets developing sustainable consumption and production patterns to reduce the environmental impact of industrial and commercial activities and promoting responsible resource management by 2030 (Arora & Mishra, 2023 ). One of the key targets of SDG 12 is to halve the global food waste per capita at the retail and consumer levels, while reducing the food losses along the production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses. The traditional linear model of production and consumption involves extensive resource depletion, excessive food waste, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Moreover, the food processing industry requires larger freshwater footprints, mainly due to substantial water utility, while producing significantly large volumes of wastewater rich in nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus, and other organic compounds (Fig. 1  ). For instance, 13.7 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 -eq) are produced by the food supply chain system, which is 26% of the overall anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, minimizing excess utilization of natural resources, GHG emissions, and food waste is necessary to enhance the sustainability of the food processing industry and attain the targets of SDG 12 by 2030. In this context, microalgae cultivation is a widely explored area of research for effective carbon capturing and resource recovery with the simultaneous generation of valuable biomass utilized as potential feedstocks in many industries, namely food, feed, pharmaceutical, energy production, and agriculture (Chen et al., 2022 ; Nishshanka et al., 2021 ; Premaratne et al., 2022 ). Notably, waste streams produced by the food processing industry would consist of the least toxic substances, facilitating the application of the microalgal biomass generated from waste-based cultivation for human consumption (Nishshanka et al., 2021 ). Spirulina  is a blue-green microalga, that has gained widespread attention as a superfood owing to its exceptional nutritional contents and is considered a promising protein source, which is commercially produced for over 40 years (Lafarga et al., 2020 , 2021 ; Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). Notably, Spirulina  biomass is available in the commercial market mainly in the form of dry powder, capsules, and tablets, and as biomass-incorporated food products, such as noodles, pasta, cookies, and smoothies. Protein content in Spirulina  accounts for 60–70% (w/w) which is higher than the conventional protein sources, such as egg (12.6% protein), meat (43% protein), whole milk powder (26% protein), soy (37% protein) and yeast (39% protein) (Bertsch et al., 2021 ; Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). In addition, 47% of the total protein of Spirulina  contains essential amino acids, including threonine, valine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, lysine, histidine, and tryptophan, making it as a promising vegan dietary protein supplement. For instance, bioactive peptides derived from Spirulina  protein extracts exhibited the potential to act as a natural Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (Anekthanakul et al., 2019 ). Moreover, Spirulina  synthesizes a blue pigment protein, c-phycocyanin (C-PC), which is commercially used as a natural blue food colorant (i.e., food additive E18) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Landim et al., 2021 ; Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). C-PC showcases numerous therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective activities, broadening its application in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries (Fratelli et al., 2021 ; Nakamoto et al., 2023 ; Thevarajah et al., 2023 ). The commercial price of food-grade C-PC is accounted at ∼$ 130 g−1 , whereas the global market size is expected to reach $ 409.8 million by 2030 (Thevarajah et al., 2024 ). Furthermore, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, polyphenols, carotenoids (mainly β-carotene), vitamins (including B1 and B3) and minerals are available in Spirulina . In particular, the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) initiated the Intergovernmental Institution for the use of Microalgae Spirulina Against Malnutrition (IIMSAM), an Inter-Governmental Organization (IGO) to support SDG 2 of eradicating hunger and malnutrition by using Spirulina . Hence, Spirulina  is a promising and sustainable global solution for food security and alleviating hunger and malnutrition, with financial benefits resulting from the high market demands of whole biomass and extracts. Mixotrophic cultivation of Spirulina  has been extensively exploited in recent years to minimize the cultivation costs, while enhancing the economic viability of cultivation to produce biomass at affordable market prices. Simultaneous assimilation of organic and inorganic carbons in the presence of light for photosynthesis during Spirulina  cultivation aids in mixotrophic mode, which is achieved through the integration of waste streams. Thus, the integration of food processing industrial waste, namely wastewater, solid waste, and flue gas, in Spirulina  cultivation would be a prospective and innovative solution for the sustainable upcycling of food waste into novel food ingredients. Besides, Spirulina  cultivation in food processing industrial wastes for the production of novel food ingredients, including nutrient-rich Spirulina  biomass and extracts of proteins and C-PC, is a promising, sustainable, and innovative action plan for effective food waste management (FWM) and food security. Meanwhile, the utilization of food processing industrial wastes in Spirulina  cultivation aids in the reduction of carbon, freshwater, and material footprints per capita through effective resource recovery. Hence, converting food processing industrial wastes into nutrient-rich Spirulina  biomass would effectively facilitate in progressing towards the achievement of SDG 12, while maintaining a circular bioeconomy. Numerous studies are available on waste resources-based microalgae cultivation for value-added bioproduction, however, upcycling wastes generated from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation for the advancing of UN SDG 12 has not yet been comprehensively reviewed. Hence, the current review aims to address this gap in the literature by holistically scrutinizing the prospects of upcycling food processing industrial waste in Spirulina  cultivation for the bioproduction of novel food ingredients, namely nutrient-rich biomass, proteins, and C-PC. Moreover, an insight into the challenges and perspectives of accomplishing SDG 12 by 2030 through Spirulina  cultivation in waste resources from the food processing industries will be discussed, while highlighting the prospects of maintaining a sustainable circular bioeconomy.  2  Spirulina  cultivation in food processing industrial wastewater as alternative culture media Wastewater generated from the food processing industry is a potential source of macro- and micronutrients required for Spirulina  cultivation, mainly due to the presence of N, P, and organic matters. Thus, many studies have focused on utilizing food processing industrial wastewater as a promising alternative for culture media in Spirulina  cultivation with a considerable reduction in freshwater footprints. Notably, wastewater-based Spirulina  cultivation showcased promising biomass productivities, along with enhanced yields of proteins and C-PC which are high-demand novel ingredients used in the food processing industry. Remarkably, the effective advancement of SDG 12 would be aided through the upcycling of food processing industrial wastewater in Spirulina  cultivation. Hence, this section holistically scrutinizes the literature studies based on Spirulina  cultivation in different types of food processing industrial wastewater for the production of biomass, proteins, and C-PC, while simultaneously achieving bioremediation (Table 1  ). 2.1 Soybean-based industry The soybean industry, valued at $ 185.16 billion in 2023, primarily includes the production of soy sauce, tofu, and soy milk. The derivatives from soybeans, such as soybean meal, soyabean oil, soya lecithin, and soy protein isolates, are also extensively used in food and beverages. In an environmental impact assessment conducted by Han et al. (2021) the production of 1000 kg of soy sauce generated 8000 kg of wastewater consisting of 992.0 mg L−1 , 173.53 mg L−1 , 168.44 mg L−1 , and 10.21 mg L−1 , of organic carbon, total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4 + -N) and phosphate (PO4 3− ), respectively. Similarly, wastewater generated from tofu production contained 190–950 mg L−1  of TN and 45.6–120 mg L−1  of TP, along with metal elements (such as sodium, copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese, cobalt, iron, and calcium), oligosaccharides, proteins, oligopeptides, and phytochemicals (including isoflavones, saponins, and phytic acid) (Wang et al., 2020 ). Spirulina maxima  cultivation in 100% soy sauce wastewater produced 1.984 g L−1  of biomass, whereas a pH adjustment of 8.0 resulted in a high protein yield of 65.57% which was similar to the protein content (66.25 ± 1.97%) exhibited by S. maxima  in Zarrouk's medium. Moreover, Nur et al. (2023)  cultivated Spirulina platensis  in 5% tofu wastewater diluted with Zarrouk's media, which exhibited a specific growth rate of 217.82 mg L−1  day−1 , higher than the control, i.e., Zarrouk's medium (86.43 mg L−1  day−1 ). Furthermore, a C-PC content of 9.12% and productivity of 19.39 mg L−1  day−1  were showcased from S. platensis  cultivation in 5% tofu wastewater, while the control resulted in 13.21% and 11.42 mg L−1  day−1 , respectively (Nur et al., 2023 ).  2.2 Dairy industry In the dairy industry, the production of 1000 kg of processed milk produced wastewater of ∼2430 L, whereas the cheese production generated ∼3140 L, consisting of 2.22 mM TN and 0.22 mM PO4 3−  (Mercado et al., 2020 ; Stasinakis et al., 2022 ). Pereira et al. (2019) investigated S. platensis  cultivation in whey wastewater from buffalo mozzarella cheese production at 25 °C under light intensity of 238 μmol m−2  s−1  by fluorescent lamps. S. platensis  cultivation in 5% whey wastewater exhibited the maximum biomass productivity of 2.98 g L−1 , in comparison to Zarrouk's medium (1.65 g L−1 ) (Pereira et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, the protein content obtained with 5% whey wastewater-based S. platensis  cultivation was 60.62%, whereas 65.55% was from Zarrouk's medium. Meanwhile, 10% whey wastewater-based cultivation doubled the specific growth rate of S. platensis  compared to the 5% whey wastewater, achieving the highest biomass productivity of 0.5 g L−1  day−1  on the fourth day of cultivation. Moreover, Zapata et al. (2021)  investigated the utilization of cheese whey (CW) and dairy wastewater in S. platensis  cultivation, while supplementing the culture media with 0.5 g L−1  K2 HPO4  and 1.5 g L−1  urea (Zapata et al., 2021 ). A biomass productivity of 0.95 g L−1  in CW was demonstrated under high light intensity of 82 μmol m−2  s−1 , which was significantly higher than 0.2 g L−1  of DW-based S. platensis  cultivation and similar to the productivity in Zarrouk's medium (1.31 g L−1 ). Meanwhile, S. platensis  cultivation at low light intensity of 42 μmol m−2  s−1  in CW and DW demonstrated similar biomass productivities of Spirulina  in the range 0.5–0.6 g L−1 .  2.3 Beverage industry Beer production, one of the most consumed beverages globally, generates 3–20 L of wastewater per L of beer at different stages of the process, rich in P and total Kjeldahl nitrogen ranging from 10 to 15 mg L−1  and 25 to 80 mg L−1 , respectively (Amenorfenyo et al., 2019 ; Pradana et al., 2023 ). Lu et al. (2017)  explored the feasibility of Spirulina  sp. cultivation in brewery wastewater (BW) with NH4 + -N, nitrate nitrogen (NO3 − -N), TN, and TP of 129.4 mg L−1 , 0.0 mg L−1 , 207.6 mg L−1 , and 128.7 mg L−1 , respectively. Spirulina  sp. exhibited maximum biomass production of 0.925 g L−1  in 20% BW, which was higher than 0%, 10%, and 50% dilutions. Additionally, the study revealed that supplementing BW with 0.5 g L−1  NaNO3  and a 20% dilution rate resulted in maximum biomass production of 1.56 mg L−1  and protein content of 37.14%, whereas Zarrouk's medium exhibited a higher protein content of 49.85%, attributed to the absence of NO3 − -N in BW (Lu et al., 2017 ). However, following the supplementation of 2.0 g L−1  NaNO3 , the protein content increased to 50.53%, surpassing the protein content in the Zarrouk's medium. In addition, digested BW was explored as an alternative culture medium in Spirulina  sp. cultivation, in which indigestible organic compounds were converted into biodegradable forms. Notably, the biomass yield was enhanced by 24.96% in digested BW obtained from 2-day anaerobic digestion, whereas a maximum protein content of 54% was acquired from the Spirulina  sp. cultivation in 1-day anaerobic digested medium. Furthermore, Spirulina  sp. cultivation in digested BW exhibited removal efficiencies of 75.2%, 78.3%, and 97.4% of COD, TN, and TP, respectively (Lu et al., 2017 ).  2.4 Oil mill industry Olive oil production of 35,000,000 kg generates ∼200,000,000 L of oil mill wastewater which contains 7.49 mg L−1 , 1.63 mg L−1 , and >4.0 mg L−1  of TN, TP, and NH4 + , respectively (Khdair et al., 2019 ; Maaitah et al., 2020 ). Similarly, 2500 kg of effluent is generated in commercial palm oil processing industries to produce 500 kg of oil (Low et al., 2021 ). Mostafa et al. (2019)  utilized olive oil wastewater (OWW) as an alternative growth medium in S. platensis  cultivation, in which the highest biomass production of 1.72 g L−1  was generated from 50% OWW. On the other hand, S. platensis  cultivation in 100% OWW showcased biomass productivity of 1.5 g L−1  while 2.0 g L−1  was from the control (Zarrouk's medium). Moreover, S. platensis  cultivation significantly reduced the total phenolic content of the OWW by 50–80% (Mostafa et al., 2019 ). In a recent study, Palanisamy et al. (2023)  evaluated S. platensis  cultivation in palm oil mill effluent (POME) containing NH4 + -N, NO3 − -N, nitrite (NO2 − -N) and PO4 3−  of 3.9 mg L−1 , 1.1 mg L−1 , 10.3 mg L−1 , and 6.4 mg L−1 , respectively. S. platensis  cultivation in 30% POME resulted in 1.16 mg L−1  biomass yield, which was higher than other dilutions while less than that from the control (BG-11 medium), i.e., 1.27 mg L−1 . Moreover, the highest C-PC yield of 175.12 mg was obtained from the 30% POME-based S. platensis  cultivation, wherein, 163.55 mg L−1  of C-PC resulted from the control (Palanisamy et al., 2023 ).  2.5 Other food processing industries Cassava processing, which is the 5th  most important staple crop, generates around 600 L of wastewater per ton of processed root. In a study by de Carvalho et al. (2018) , Spirulina  cultivation in cassava processing wastewater exhibited a specific growth rate of 0.67 day−1 , in which the N:P of the wastewater was 150 (de Carvalho et al., 2018 ). Moreover, Jiang et al. (2023)  investigated Spirulina subsalsa  cultivation in monosodium glutamate wastewater, where 25% dilution showcased a biomass production of 2.862 g L−1 , along with 40.65%, 15.71%, and 5.66% of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, respectively (Jiang et al., 2023 ). Besides, the meat processing industry generates wastewater containing TN, TKN, NH4 + -N, TP, and PO4 3−  in the ranges of 50–840 mg L−1 , 40–700 mg L−1 , 20–300 mg L−1 , 15–200 mg L−1 , and 8–120 mg L−1 , respectively (Aziz et al., 2019 ). Similarly, the winery industry generates ∼1.3–1.5 kg of waste per liter of wine, 75% of which constitutes winery wastewater, which possesses a nutrient profile of 10–415 mg L−1  TN and 2–280 mg L−1  TP (Li et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, whiskey production produces wastewater at a rate of 24.5–32.5 per liter of grain whiskey containing 5–37 g L−1  of TN (Gunes et al., 2019 ). Nonetheless, Spirulina  cultivation in meat processing, winery, and whiskey wastewaters is not explored despite the promising availability of nutrients. This is a significant gap prevailing in the literature to explore the potential of Spirulina  cultivation for enhanced yields of biomass, proteins, and C-PC. Spirulina  cultivation in wastewater generated from food processing industries, containing significant amounts of nutrients and other resources, is a promising and innovative FWM and resource recovery strategy in the transformation of waste-to-food. Notably, significant contents of proteins and C-PC were synthesized from food processing industrial wastewater-integrated Spirulina  cultivation, mainly due to the presence of high TN and TP. Moreover, the Spirulina  biomass generated through the upcycling of food processing industrial wastewater is a promising feedstock to produce vegan proteins and blue food colorant, i.e., C-PC, as novel food ingredients in the food sector. Furthermore, the upcycling of food wastes facilitates the progression of SDG 12 with a significant reduction in the requirement of natural resources in Spirulina  cultivation while maintaining a circular bioeconomy.   3  Spirulina  cultivation in other waste resources from the food processing industry Spirulina  cultivation utilizing solid wastes and flue gas demonstrates numerous benefits of achieving effective waste treatment and resource recovery, with simultaneous production of high-value bioproducts, including proteins and C-PC, through mixotrophic cultivation. Conventional solid waste disposal techniques, which include landfilling and incineration, have significantly high environmental impacts, namely GHG emissions and groundwater pollution. On the other hand, food processing industries of developed nations emit 2.2–2.9 tons CO2 -eq of GHG per capita (Tubiello et al., 2021 ). Thus, the integration of flue gas as an inorganic carbon source and upcycling solid wastes generated from the food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation would be a sustainable and affordable strategy in FWM, along with the production of nutrient-rich biomass with high market potentials. Meanwhile, SDG 12 would be achieved via a significant reduction of GHG emissions and upcycling of solid food wastes, while shifting the food processing industries towards a circular bioeconomy. Hence, this section discusses the studies available in literature based on solid wastes- and flue gas-integrated Spirulina  cultivation to produce biomass, proteins, and C-PC. Shanthi et al. (2021)  evaluated the prospects of Spirulina  cultivation in fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) derived from solid biological wastes, namely head, trimmings, skin, viscera, scale, bone, generated by the fish processing industry. Incorporation of 0.5% (v/v) FPH in the conventional Zarrouk's medium during Spirulina  cultivation exhibited 1.003 ± 0.05 g L−1  of biomass and 0.488 g g−1  of C-PC (Shanthi et al., 2021 ). In comparison to the control, 0.5% FPH enhanced biomass productivity, protein, and C-PC contents by 39%, 15%, and 98% respectively, showcasing the FPH as a potential alternative N source. Moreover, Leca et al. (2023)  investigated S. platensis  cultivation in anaerobic digestates derived from food and agricultural wastes (FAWD), and cheese dairy (CDD), diluted in geothermal water. Biomass productivities of 33 ± 1 and 56 ± 8 g L−1  day−1  were achieved from S. platensis  cultivation in CDD and FAWD, respectively, at 5x and 40x dilutions (Leca et al., 2023 ). In addition, scaled-up cultivation in 6 L flat panel photobioreactors exhibited biomass productivities of 71 and 101 mg L−1  day−1  for CDD and FAWD cultivations, respectively, along with C-PC productivity in the range of 2.1–6.0 mg L−1  day−1 . On the other hand, the excellent CO2  biofixation property exhibited by Spirulina  benefits the integration of flue gas as an alternative C source during the upstream processing. For instance, S. platensis  showcased a C biofixation rate of ∼0.259 mgC  L−1  day−1  during the incorporation of 10% (v/v) CO2  (Zhu et al., 2019 ). Meanwhile, Costa et al. (2019)  reported a maximum daily biofixation of 14% when supplemented with 12.0% (v/v) CO2  (Costa et al., 2019 ). Moreover, Almomani et al. (2019)  evaluated the biofixation rates of S. platensis  during the supplementation of CO2  at different concentrations of 2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 15% (v/v), in which a biofixation rate of 0.360 gC  L−1  day−1  was achieved in 10% (v/v) CO2  while the elevated concentrations of the biofixation rates (Almomani et al., 2019 ). Thus, CO2  of 10% (v/v) in flue gases would be ideal for an effective biofixation in Spirulina  cultivation. Thereby, Spirulina  cultivation promisingly upcycles solid wastes and assimilates flue gas generated from the food processing industries. Nevertheless, the limited availability of literature within the scope of utilizing solid wastes and flue gas from the food processing industry showcases a potential gap in research. Thus, future studies need to focus on upcycling of various types of solid food wastes generated from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation, mainly for the production of biomass, proteins, and C-PC. Additionally, the integration of flue gas produced from industries into Spirulina  cultivation needs to be focused on depth, for the effective reduction of GHG emissions.  4 Challenges, potential solutions, and perspectives associated with achieving SDG 12 via food processing industrial wastes-based Spirulina  cultivation 4.1 Prospects of achieving SDG 12 and circular bioeconomy The UN SDG 12 aims to attain sustainable consumption and production patterns by 2030 through efficient utilization of natural resources while minimizing resource usage and wastage (United Nations, 2023 ). Most significantly, the targets of SDG 12 which could be attained through the food processing industrial waste resources-integrated Spirulina  cultivation are listed below.Target 12.2: Achieving the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources by 2030.  Target 12.3: Halving the per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reducing the food losses along the production supply chains, including post-harvest losses by 2030.  Target 12.4: Achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all waste throughout their life cycle, per agreed international frameworks, and significantly reducing their release to air, water, and soil to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment.  Target 12.5: Substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.    As discussed in Sections 2  and 3  , upcycling wastewater and solid wastes generated from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation benefits the effective reduction of global food wastage, while achieving sustainable FWM (Fig. 2  ). For instance, upcycling the food processing industrial waste resources, especially solid wastes, reduces the quantity of waste discarded through landfilling, while minimizing gas emissions (i.e., methane (CH4 ) and other biogas) and groundwater contamination (Ghosh et al., 2016 ). Hence, the target 12.3 could be achieved through upcycling the waste resources into Spirulina  cultivation to produce novel food ingredients, namely microalgae biomass, and extracts of proteins and C-PC, while significantly minimizing the food wastage per capita. Meanwhile, efficient resource recovery from food processing industrial wastes would significantly reduce the footprints of carbon, freshwater, and material per capita required for bioproduction. Thus, the progression of target 12.2 could be attained by achieving sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources required for Spirulina  cultivation. On the other hand, upcycling food wastes in Spirulina  cultivation significantly reduces the nutrient requirements as a substantial portion of the essential organic and inorganic nutrients, including C, N, and P, are recovered from the food processing industrial waste streams (Kumari et al., 2015 ; Lim et al., 2021 ). Hence, the target 12.4 is achievable through the minimized nutrient requirements for Spirulina  cultivation, promoting chemical management. Furthermore, GHG emissions (including CO2 , CH4 , nitrous oxide (N2 O)) are one of the primary concerns in mitigating global warming and climatic action. For instance, the CO2  emission has increased from 370 ppm in 2000 to 417 ppm in 2023 (Friedlingstein et al., 2022 ). As discussed in Section 3  , Spirulina  showcases high CO2  fixation rates up to 0.678 g CO2  L−1  (Singh et al. 2016 ), which is 10–50 times higher than the fixation rates exhibited by terrestrial plants (Zhu et al., 2019 ). Hence, mixotrophic cultivation of Spirulina  would aid in the reduction of the atmospheric CO2  concentration, consequently minimizing global warming and climatic action, which aligns with target 12.4. Most significantly, microalgal biorefining transforms a single feedstock into value-added bioproducts through sustainable processing routes targeting a circular bioeconomy (Nishshanka et al., 2022 ; Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). In this context, nutrient-rich Spirulina  is a potential feedstock for multi-product biorefineries, benefiting food/feed, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, agriculture, and bioenergy industries, among others, which do not lie within the framework of upcycling process. As reported by Thevarajah et al. (2022)  residual Spirulina  biomass from proteins and C-PC extractions could be promisingly valorized into numerous bioproducts, including, human food, animal feed, biofertilizers, biopolymers, and biofuels (Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). For instance, Wuang et al. (2016)  evaluated the potential of utilizing biofertilizers produced from S. platensis  cultivated in aquaculture wastewater. The experiment showcased significant enhancements in the germination of Chinese cabbage by more than 3-folds (Wuang et al., 2016 ). Additionally, Rempel et al. (2019)  aimed to produce biomethane using S. platensis  biomass had an energy potential of 16,770 kJ kg−1  (Rempel et al., 2019 ). In accordance, the valorization of residual Spirulina  biomass obtained from the proteins and C-PC extraction process significantly contributes to achieving the SDG target 12.5. Thus, upcycling wastes generated from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation, with the ease of cultivating in tropical and subtropical regions, is a sustainable and promising strategy for attaining SDG 12 by 2030, while contributing towards a circular bioeconomy (Table 2  ).  4.2 Challenges, potential solutions, and perspectives Real-time implementation of upcycling wastes generated from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation poses numerous challenges, especially for the advancement of SDG 12 and circular bioeconomy. Among these, the major challenges, including the characteristics of wastewater, solid wastes, and flue gases, upstream process controlling and cultivation, cost- and energy-effective downstream processing of Spirulina  biomass, proteins and C-PC, and public perceptions towards the waste-to-food concept, require potential solutions for a successful establishment and advancement of SDG 12 via Spirulina  cultivation (Table 3  ). 4.2.1 Characteristics of wastewater and solid waste The presence of impurities, such as heavy metals, pathogens, and suspended solid particles, in wastewater and solid waste generated from the food processing industry could hinder the growth of Spirulina  which leads to significant reduction in biomass productivity (Nishshanka et al., 2023 ). The application of pesticides for food production, livestock manures, and compost are the primary causes of the presence of common heavy metals, such as lead, chromium, nickel, zinc, and copper (Samah et al., 2020 ). Samah et al. (2020)  reported that the average concentrations of heavy metals in food waste compost were 1.0 ± 0.455 ppm, 446.2 ± 36.77 ppm, 140.0 ± 9.899 ppm, 19.0 ± 5.940 ppm, and 10.9 ± 1.438 ppm of lead, chromium, nickel, zinc, and copper, respectively (Samah et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, the presence of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, protozoans, fungi, and helminths, in food processing industrial wastes poses a significant challenge in achieving high yields of Spirulina  biomass, proteins, and C-PC (Dar et al., 2019 ). Notably, consumption of food products incorporated with Spirulina  biomass and extracts, such as C-PC and proteins, contaminated with toxic substances may have adverse effects on human health, causing gastrointestinal infections, respiratory diseases, and increased risks of cancers (Shaharoona et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, the presence of solid particles in wastewater and solid waste-derived liquid media could result in high turbidity, preventing efficient light penetration and lowering the rate of photosynthesis, which consequently reduces Spirulina  biomass productivity (Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). In this context, the incorporation of treatment techniques to reduce heavy metals, toxins, biological contaminants, and suspended solid particles in the upstream processing of Spirulina  production is important to mitigate culture failures and to ensure product safety. The treatment techniques, include physiochemical methods, such as membrane separation, adsorption, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, coagulation, and flocculation, and electrochemical methods, including electrodeposition, electro-flotation, and electrocoagulation (Bharti et al., 2022 ; Leong & Chang, 2020 ). Moreover, dilution of wastewater and solid waste-derived liquid media while maintaining the required nutrient contents could serve as a potential solution to overcome the high turbidity resulting from the presence of suspended solid particles. Nevertheless, the integration of an additional step, i.e., treating wastewater and solid waste-derived liquid media from the food processing industry, into Spirulina  cultivation would incur supplementary capital and operational costs (Qasem et al., 2021 ). This would significantly affect the economic feasibility and sustainability of Spirulina  cultivation integrated with the food processing industrial waste resources. Hence, comprehensive techno-economic assessments (TEA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) are essential for the effective identification and applicability of suitable pretreatment techniques in real-time Spirulina  cultivation.  4.2.2 Characteristics of flue gas The composition and properties of flue gas from food processing industries affect Spirulina  cultivation mainly due to the presence of particulate matter and hazardous pollutants. Although flue gas is a carbon-rich alternative source, its incorporation in Spirulina  cultivation could result in lowering of pH levels of culture media due to the elevated CO2  concentrations and presence of ammonia, nitrogen oxides (NOx ), and sulfur oxides (SOx ), whereas alkaline pH within 8.5–10.5 is optimal for high biomass productivities (Premaratne et al., 2022 ; Soni et al., 2019 ). Besides, elevated temperature ranges of the flue gas would affect the Spirulina  growth rate, leading to losses in culture viability (Premaratne et al., 2021 ). Hence, suitable pretreatment techniques, such as filtration systems and scrubbers, are essential for the removal of particulate matter and reduction of ammonia, NOx,  and SOx  contents to acceptable levels. Implementing pH control mechanisms and cooling systems to maintain optimal cultivation temperatures could also be a potential solution for the challenges related to the characteristics of the flue gas (Premaratne et al., 2022 ; Premaratne et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, TEA and LCA studies are essential for the selection of suitable pretreatment techniques for flue gas to integrate into the food processing industrial waste resources-based Spirulina  cultivation.  4.2.3 Controlling growth parameters and cultivation systems In general, open raceway ponds are extensively employed by commercial cultivators for the large-scale cultivation of Spirulina , due to the simple design, ease of operation, and low capital and operational costs (Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). Meanwhile, controlling the cultivation parameters, namely temperature and light intensity, is critical in accomplishing successful Spirulina  production at a commercial scale. In particular, Spirulina  cultivation is optimal at temperatures within the range of 30–35 °C and under the light intensities of 1.5–3.5 kLux (Soni et al., 2019 ). Deviations from the ideal ranges of temperature and light intensity detrimentally affect Spirulina  cultivation by lowering biomass productivity. Notably, open outdoor cultivation of Spirulina  predominantly depends on the geographical locations and their climatic and seasonal conditions. Thus, the selection of suitable geographical locations for Spirulina  cultivation is essential while considering factors, such as solar irradiance, rainfall, ambient temperature, and seasonal variations (Ariyadasa et al., 2023 ; Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). Tropical and sub-tropical countries and regions closer to equators are potential locations for Spirulina  cultivation, due to plentiful sunlight throughout the year with less extreme seasonal variations (Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). Nonetheless, the establishment of Spirulina  cultivation in locations with temperature and solar irradiance not within the optimal ranges requires additional temperature-controlling systems and artificial lighting. This would significantly affect the economic feasibility and viability of Spirulina  cultivation integrated with food processing industrial wastes for resource recovery and bioproduction. Thus, greenhouses, culture media cooling systems, and artificial lighting systems would aid in the effective controlling of growth parameters during Spirulina  cultivation. Nevertheless, this would incur additional costs for implementation and operation, while increasing the energy requirements, significantly reducing the economic viability and sustainability. Hence, the integration of renewable energy sources would enhance the sustainability of the overall process of upcycling food processing industrial waste resources in Spirulina  cultivation for novel food production (Ariyadasa et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, the integration of process automation and controlling would aid in monitoring and maintaining parameters within the optimal ranges ideal for high biomass productivity and enhanced yields of proteins and C-PC in Spirulina  cultivation. Moreover, labor costs associated with monitoring and maintenance of cultivation systems could contribute to the overall operational costs and impact the economics. In addition, open cultivation systems possess the risk of contamination by predators, pathogens, and pollutants from the surrounding environment. Hence, it is important to modify the designs of open systems by incorporating strategies to control the hazards of pathogens and pollutants during cultivation. Besides, the risk of contamination by predators and pollutants is primarily related to geographic locations and environmental variables. Mitigatory strategies to overcome the risk of contamination involve the selection of cultivation sites distant from industrial zones, farms, and sanctuaries, consistent sterilization of culture media and cultivation systems, and the utilization of transparent covers and nets to shield the cultivation area.  4.2.4 Downstream processing of Spirulina  biomass Harvesting of Spirulina  biomass requires cost-effective and low energy-intensive techniques for the economic feasibility of real-time novel food production based on food processing industrial wastes. Employment of harvesting techniques, such as membrane filtration and bio-flocculation, which are highly efficient and environmentally friendly, would be beneficial in advancing towards SDG 12. In addition, dewatering and drying are crucial process steps in the production of Spirulina  biomass due to the high moisture content of the biomass and the necessity to prevent spoilage and degradation from high water activity for prolonged shelf life (Stramarkou et al., 2021 ). Various drying techniques, namely atmospheric drying, freeze drying, and vacuum drying, are commonly used in Spirulina  biomass production. Nevertheless, the drying techniques are highly energy intensive accounting for 60–80% of the total energy involved in the downstream processing of Spirulina  biomass. Hence, the overall production cost of Spirulina -based food products increases, which significantly affects the market penetration and consumption. Remarkably, the utilization of renewable sources for the energy requirement would enhance the sustainability of the downstream processing. Besides, the extraction of proteins and C-PC is crucial due to the molecular structure and low stability of the compounds (Pez Jaeschke et al., 2021 ). Further studies are required in the development of proteins and C-PC extraction techniques which are high yielding while showing the least effect on the molecular structures to conserve the bioactive properties of the compounds. Moreover, the incorporation of natural polymers for the enhancement of C-PC stability requires attention in future studies (Pez Jaeschke et al., 2021 ).  4.2.5 Public perception and acceptance Insufficient awareness among the public regarding Spirulina  and its nutritional advantages stands as a potential challenge to the market penetration of its bioproducts. Particularly, the limited prevalence of Spirulina  and other microalgae-derived food products among the public is predominantly attributable to their conservative eating habits and cultural norms. Hence, Spirulina  is scarcely featured as a traditional component in the prevailing culinary practices, especially in regions, such as Asia. These constraints are significant hurdles in the realization of the targets of SDG 12 to be achieved by 2030, as the slow pace of market penetration could impede the sustainability and economic feasibility of Spirulina  cultivation. In this context, it is important to develop awareness among the public regarding the nutritional benefits of Spirulina  consumption and the potential to reduce GHG emissions, climatic actions, and other negative global challenges. This could be achieved through educational campaigns and marketing among the public, which would increase the demand for Spirulina -based food products. For example, building partnerships with local food industries and the government for effective marketing and educational campaigns regarding Spirulina -based food products and their nutritional benefits would enhance public awareness and positive perceptions (Nishshanka et al., 2022 ; Premaratne et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, conducting workshops for the young generation and utilizing social media platforms to spread awareness related to the benefits of Spirulina -based bioproduction would serve as a promising strategy to improve public perception. In addition, the incorporation of Spirulina  biomass and extracts in food products would have significant impacts on the sensory effects and aesthetic properties, hence negatively affecting the palatability (Zen et al., 2020 ). Consequently, the market penetration of Spirulina- based food products would be adversely affected, setting back economic drawbacks in the real-time establishment of food production with novel food ingredients. Strategies proposed in current literature to mitigate undesirable sensory effects include microencapsulation techniques and enrichment with complementary flavors (i.e., lemon, ginger, etc.) (Hamed et al., 2023 ; Thevarajah et al., 2022 ). For instance, Zen et al. (2020)  evaluated the impact of incorporating microencapsulated Spirulina  biomass in pasta on its sensory profile and acceptability. The study demonstrated that the microencapsulation preserved the antioxidant properties of Spirulina  with an overall acceptability index of 85.13%, providing a potential alternative for the bakery industry (Zen et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, Zamri et al. (2023)  evaluated the sensory acceptance of encapsulated Spirulina- alginate beads added into a rose syrup beverage, in which the bitterness of the beverage was minimized while the acceptability was improved (Zamri et al., 2023 ). The social acceptance of Spirulina -based food products derived through the upcycling of waste resources would be negatively impacted due to the public concerns on health and food safety resulting from the presence of contaminants and toxic substances, as discussed in Section 4.2.1 . Thus, conducting comprehensive studies on toxicology, microbial contamination and heavy metal accumulation is of paramount importance to enhance the public acceptance of the food safety and consumption of Spirulina -based food products derived through the upcycling of food processing industrial wastes (Fernando et al., 2021 ).  4.2.6 Assessment of economic feasibility and environmental impacts Although Spirulina  and its extracts have high market values, the integration of additional process steps, especially the pretreatment of the waste streams, into the microalgae cultivation, has an impact on the economic feasibility and sustainability. For instance, Chaiklahan et al. (2018)  reported that the C-PC production alone was economically feasible, with a production cost of $ 249.70 per kg, wherein the C-PC content of the biomass must not be less than 15% for a positive net present value of the investment (Chaiklahan et al., 2018 ). Moreover, Chalermthai et al. (2023)  stated that the co-production of Spirulina  powder and edible bioplastic for food packaging would aid in a payback time of 2.6 years and with 38.5% return of investment, due to the higher revenue, i.e., $ 55.6 million per year, compared to the capital and operating costs of $ 55.7 and 34.9 million per annum, respectively (Chalermthai et al., 2023 ). The authors reported that the utilization of low-cost culture media during the upstream processing of Spirulina  could reduce the overall production costs (Chalermthai et al., 2023 ). Hence, further economic feasibility studies based on the upcycling of food wastes generated from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation are essential, especially to identify critical process steps. In addition, the identification of process steps with huge environmental burdens is vital in achieving sustainability and positive environmental impact from the overall process. For example, production of 1 kg wet Spirulina  biomass required 0.0378 m2  of non-arable land and 8.36 m3  fresh water, along with −0.008 CO2 -eq GHG emissions (net zero) showcasing carbon neutrality, in comparison to conventional food production (Tzachor et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, an LCA study conducted for edible Spirulina  tablets exhibited higher environmental impacts than terrestrial crops and lower impacts than animal-based protein sources (Ye et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, the study demonstrated that the environmental impact of producing proteins along with other nutritional compositions of Spirulina  is lower compared to the combined production of carrot and tofu (Ye et al., 2018 ). Evidently, Spirulina  cultivation for proteins and C-PC extracts showcases lower environmental impacts and elevated economic feasibility. Thus, further studies on TEA and LCA are required to evaluate the economic feasibility and environmental impacts of upcycling wastes generated from food processing industries in Spirulina  cultivation, for the viability and sustainability of the overall process.    5 Conclusion Spirulina  cultivation through the upcycling of food processing industrial wastes presents a promising strategy for efficient FWM, while simultaneously producing novel food ingredients namely nutrient-rich biomass, proteins, and C-PC. Remarkably, this emphasis on responsible consumption and production, facilitating the advancement of SDG 12 along with a circular bioeconomy. However, the realization of the aforementioned benefits necessitates addressing challenges associated with the utilization of waste resources and Spirulina  cultivation, requiring technological advancements and collaboration. Pretreatment of waste streams prior to Spirulina  cultivation is essential in achieving high biomass productivity, while ensuring product safety. Moreover, the selection of suitable geographical locations ideal for Spirulina  cultivation and cost-effective downstream processing techniques are of paramount importance to enhance the economic viability and sustainability of Spirulina  cultivation in food processing industrial waste resources. In addition, comprehensive studies of TEA and LCA for the overall process of upcycling food processing industrial wastes in Spirulina  cultivation for novel food production of nutrient-rich biomass, proteins, and C-PC are crucial for sustainable and feasible real-time implementation. Notably, public perception and acceptance of waste-to-food production pose substantial challenges for the effective market penetration of Spirulina  biomass- and extracts-incorporated food products. Hence, overcoming these challenges is imperative for the successful integration of food processing industrial waste resources-based Spirulina  cultivation into a circular and sustainable food production model.
