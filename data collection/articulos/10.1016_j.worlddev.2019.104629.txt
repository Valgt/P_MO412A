                  The United Nations and its member states are currently engaged in extensive discussions about how best to support countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Recognizing the strong interrelationship between humanitarian, development, and peace efforts, they have increasingly emphasized the importance of working at the ‘triple nexus’ where these dimensions intersect. However, to date, there has been significant confusion over what the triple nexus means in both conceptual and practical terms and how this approach concretely contributes to progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper attempts to address this gap. It proposes and schematically presents a conceptual framework that identifies the range of potential nexus relationships that actions can support, including the triple nexus, double nexuses, and nexus-sensitivity. It then illustrates what each of these types of actions looks like in practice, drawing on examples from Afghanistan. Based on the framework and practical examples, it explains how the triple nexus can be used to more effectively support the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, but also highlights the very real risks associated with a simplistic application of the approach. By bringing greater clarity to the critical interrelationship between humanitarian, development and peace issues in both theory and practice, and demonstrating the opportunities and challenges of the triple nexus approach, it is hoped that this paper will support broader efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, especially in countries affected by conflict.

Keywords Triple nexus  Sustainable development goals  Humanitarian  Development  Peace  Afghanistan    1 Introduction Since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations has engaged in extensive discussions about the most effective way to support countries to achieve this ambitious agenda by 2030. One of the key proposals has been to focus on the humanitarian-development-peace nexus (Guterres, 2016, 2017, 2018; Hochschild, 2017; United Nations [UN], 2017; UN & World Bank, 2018 )1 Although some of these texts do not use specific terms such as ‘triple nexus’ or ‘humanitarian-development-peace nexus,' they all make reference to the need for more joined-up action across these areas. In some cases, it is stated explicitly that the joined-up efforts will better support the achievement of the SDGs; in others, it is implied by the context.  1  . Recognizing the strong interrelationship between humanitarian, development, and peace efforts, the ‘triple nexus’ concept suggests that actions in these areas could be better joined up to have greater and mutually reinforcing impacts. Given the challenges of achieving the SDGs in conflict-affected countries, the potential of this approach has taken on increased significance. This focus on the ‘triple nexus’ represents a coming together of several strands of discussion in recent years. In 2016, the World Humanitarian Summit proposed a New Way of Working, which put greater emphasis on diverse actors collaborating over multiple years to achieve collective outcomes (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [OCHA], 2018a ). Donors and humanitarian agencies also committed to the Grand Bargain, which explicitly called for enhanced “engagement between humanitarian and development actors” (OCHA, 2016a ). At the same time, following the release of the new ‘sustaining peace’ approach, the Secretary General has argued for the centrality of prevention and for “greater coherence and synergies across the United Nations system” (Guterres, 2018, p. 2 ). Although it might be possible to usefully focus on nexuses of different kinds, such as the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of development, the emphasis on humanitarian, development, and peace efforts is particularly relevant for several reasons. First, the 2030 Agenda (UN, 2015 ) arguably aspires to be a universal and comprehensive framework, going beyond the traditional economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development to encompass peace and humanitarian issues. (For a more detailed discussion of this view, including counter-arguments, see Section 3 .) Transforming our world: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development  (UN, 2015 ) speaks of the two-way, mutually reinforcing relationship between development (in its more narrowly defined, traditional interpretation) and peace and identifies humanitarian crises (in explicit but more often implicit terms) as setbacks to any potential gains. In other words, at least in this respect, the SDGs represent an expanded  development agenda, necessitating clarity on the integration of the peace and humanitarian dimensions. Second, as a matter of historical legacy, the United Nations has organized itself and its support to member states around the dimensions of humanitarianism, development, and peace2 Another critical dimension is human rights. The absence of this dimension from the triple nexus approach will be discussed in the section on challenges.  2   at the country level, making it critical to find ways to bridge these different domains and bring better coherence to its efforts (Hochschild, 2017 ) in order to have greater impact. Third, given the current high levels of conflict (Allansson, Melander, & Themner, 2017 ) and humanitarian crises (OCHA, 2018b ), which represent significant obstacles to the achievement of the SDGs, it is pragmatically important to understand and address the interrelationships between these three issues. While the triple nexus concept has therefore generated great interest and led to a burgeoning of discussions about the potential benefits and drawbacks (International Council of Voluntary Agencies [ICVA], 2017; World Bank, 2017; Global Peace Association, 2019 ), progress in implementing it has been hampered by a lack of clarity about what the triple nexus means both in theory and practice and how it meaningfully contributes to supporting the achievement of the SDGs. This paper attempts to fill this gap. Following this introduction, it reviews the literature that provides the foundations for this approach. It then presents a conceptual framework for the triple nexus and populates it with examples drawn from Afghanistan, a country currently in conflict but with prospects for peace, to illustrate what the approach might look like in practice. Finally, the paper explores both the potential and the real risks of using a triple nexus approach as a means to support the achievement of the SDGs, especially in conflict-affected countries, before concluding with suggestions for the way forward.  2 Review of relevant literature Although the triple nexus as a concept is a recent formulation (see Guterres, 2016, 2017, 2018; Hochschild, 2017; UN & World Bank, 2018; UN, 2017 ), it has antecedents in the literature, and an examination of these previous approaches is instructive for informing any framework to link humanitarian, development, and peace efforts. There are two broad ways to understand the relationship between these three concepts. The first is to take their ‘negative’ formulations and to view their relationships in causal terms – that is, to understand how conflict, underdevelopment and humanitarian crises interact with each other to produce negative outcomes. The second is to put the emphasis on the more positive formulations of peace, development and humanitarian efforts and to understand them as potentially mutually reinforcing areas of action. While the second is more relevant to the current discussion, it may be helpful to briefly examine the causal linkages to motivate the need to consider a nexus approach to the responses. In most cases, there is some form of a two-way relationship between these different concepts. Collier et al (2003, p. 13)  famously characterized civil war as “development in reverse” because of its broad and long-term economic, social, and political impacts. This view has been echoed and nuanced by many subsequent authors. At the macro-level, the World Bank (2011)  and others have described the diverse types of violence and their multi-faceted impact on mortality (Allansson et al., 2017 ), poverty, hunger (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], International Fund for Agricultural Development [IFAD], United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF], World Food Program [WFP], & World Health Organization [WHO], 2017 ), mental health (Miller and Rasmussen, 2009 ), the economy (Mueller & Tobias, 2016; Barrett, 2018 ), and a range of other development issues. At the micro-level, Justino et al. (2013)  have examined the complex impacts of conflict dynamics on development at a more local scale. At the same time, underdevelopment through grievance, inequality, and exclusion has been established as a principal driver of violent conflict (Cederman, Wimmer, & Min, 2010; Cederman, Weidmann, & Gleditsch, 2011; UN & World Bank, 2018 ) with diverse manifestations at the local level (Justino et al., 2013 ). In some cases, the simplistic association of groups of people with a single, unnuanced identity contributes to acts of violence (Sen, 2006 ). Although humanitarian crises and conflict also have a two-way relationship, the strength of the influence is not equal in both directions. While it is widely acknowledged that conflict is a major cause of humanitarian crises, through displacement, hunger, and disease (Macrae & Zwi, 1994; World Bank, 2011 ), there is less consensus on the role of humanitarian crises in triggering conflict. Recent studies (Bruck & d’Errico, 2019; Bruck, Justino, & Martin-Shields, 2017; FAO et al., 2017; Simmons, 2013 ) suggest that hunger, especially in the form of rising food prices and competition for resources, can exacerbate tensions and contribute to conflict. But there are limitations to our understanding of these relationships, and it has been identified as an area for further research (Bruck, Justino, & Martin-Shields, 2017 ). In terms of underdevelopment and humanitarian crises, the relationship is more strongly established. Humanitarian crises are often conceived of as a “brake” on development (Wisner, Blaikie, Cannon, & Davis, 2003, p. 5 ), setting back progress on the achievement of wider, longer-term goals. Yet, it is increasingly recognized that vulnerability through various forms of underdevelopment is what permits natural hazards to become ‘unnatural disasters’ (World Bank & UN, 2010; Wisner et al., 2003 ), with a legacy of social and economic costs. These close causal interrelations – between humanitarian crises, underdevelopment, and conflict – suggest that responses to these issues may also be mutually reinforcing and provide the justification for exploring a nexus approach. Different nexus approaches have been put forward in the past few decades. As far back as the Sahel emergencies in the 1970s, but especially in the 1990s following the end of the Cold War, there was increasing recognition of the scale of humanitarian crises, the limited financial resources available, and therefore the need for a greater focus on linking humanitarian and development efforts (Buchanan-Smith & Maxwell, 1994; Longhurst, 1994 ). Initially, the linkages were understood in terms of phases or a ‘continuum,’ with humanitarian efforts leading to early recovery and rehabilitation, which in turn lay the foundations for development. However, this linear, uni-directional understanding was criticized as simplistic in the face of complex emergencies (Mosel & Levine, 2014; Hinds, 2017; Otto & Weingartner, 2013 ), and different variations, including ‘Development Relief’ and the ‘Contiguum,’ emerged (Mosel and Levine, 2014; Hinds, 2017 ), which incorporated a greater simultaneity of action and the possibility of moving back and forth between these phases. In some ways, these ideas were precursors of the resilience concept. Borrowed from metallurgy, ecology, and a range of other disciplines, resilience speaks of the ability of a system, such as a society, to “anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of a shock or stress” (Mitchell & Harris, 2012, p. 2 ). By investing in resilience, it was possible to achieve humanitarian and development outcomes simultaneously (Barrett & Constas, 2014 ). Although sometimes understood in different ways, the resilience concept has a number of advantages, in that it places the capacities of affected populations, rather than the efforts of external stakeholders, at the center of the discussion (Mosel and Levine, 2014 ), it embraces the simultaneity of actions and the potential complexities and setbacks involved in response (Hinds, 2017 ), and it builds upon the previous continuum approaches (Mosel and Levine, 2014; Otto & Weingartner, 2013 ). Resilience activities are often cited as potential examples of the humanitarian-development nexus. However, this linking of humanitarian and development efforts has generated some concern. As Macrae (2012)  argues, the fundamental issue is that the humanitarian and development arenas represent distinct approaches and principles: humanitarians work around governments and systems, while development is focused on working through them. Her helpful resolution to this dilemma is to take a context-specific approach:“Thus, an integrated, resilience-led approach to vulnerability does not mean dumping humanitarian principles of impartiality and neutrality. Rather it means protecting them and using them when doing so is in the interests of the most vulnerable and at risk populations” (Marcae, 2012, p. 9 ).   Similarly, Hilhorst (2018)  makes a distinction between ‘classical’ and ‘resilience’ humanitarianism and suggests that these two conceptualizations give prominence to different aspects of humanitarianism and are applied in different settings, based on the circumstances and the perception of the most relevant approach for the situation. These insights point to the need to account for different contexts within any triple nexus framework. A similar evolution has occurred in the relationship between development and security. The end of the Cold War gave rise to an interest in the ‘security-development nexus’ (Chandler, 2007 ), or sometimes the peacebuilding-development nexus (Uvin, 2002 ). In situations ranging from Kosovo and Somalia to Iraq and Afghanistan, the argument was that more joined-up efforts of security and development efforts would allow for the achievement of wider goals. But there have been several strong critiques of this approach. First, it allowed the development project to be co-opted and instrumentalized by security (Duffield, 2001 ). Second, it was not effective in achieving its stated ends, with the seeming failures to ‘pacify’ populations in Iraq and Afghanistan (Sorensen and Soderbaum, 2012 ). Third, it was conceptually unclear and diffuse, encompassing a wide variety of interpretations, almost to the point of meaninglessness (Chandler, 2007; Stern & Ojendal, 2010 ). Similarly, emerging after the end of the Cold War and accelerating as part of the War on Terror, a ‘new humanitarianism’ not only sought ‘to do no harm’ (Anderson, 1999 ), but “included broader and longer-term objectives such as development and peace” (Nascimento, 2015 ). As with the security-development nexus, these joined-up efforts held out the potential for greater coherence and impact, but were widely criticized along several lines. First, humanitarians sacrificed their principles of neutrality and impartiality by taking sides with the Western-led actions (Belloni, 2007; Shannon, 2009; Williamson, 2011 ). Second, in part because of that alignment, they were unable to successfully achieve their fundamental objectives of saving lives, since they were restricted from or could not gain access to contested areas (Donini, 2011 ). Some argued that food assistance actually increased conflict (Nunn & Qian, 2014 ), though other studies (Christian & Barrett, 2017 ) have raised questions about the methodology and results, and many have demonstrated the benefits of food security interventions in conflict situations (Bruck, d’Errico, & Pietrelli, 2019; Tranchant et al., 2019 ). Since this study focuses particularly on Afghanistan, it may be helpful to briefly review how this tension – between the aspiration for greater coherence, and the concerns about principles and effectiveness – has manifested itself in the country, especially since 9/11. On the one hand, there have been calls for a more joined-up effort in line with the elected government’s priorities. Ghani and Lockhart (2008)  argue forcefully for greater alignment, especially in support of the national budget priorities (see also Bigsten & Tengstam, 2015; Morrisey, 2015 ), and the need for a double compact between the international community and the state, and the state and its people. In many ways, the UN’s efforts have, in recent decades, focused on convergence (Donini, 2011 ), including the most recent attempt to align the One UN for Afghanistan development framework (UN, 2018a ) with the Government’s Afghan National Peace and Development Framework (Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, 2017 ) and the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet echoing the wider critique, Afghanistan has been used as a case study of the dangers of embracing greater convergence. In a statement with potentially troubling resonance for nexus efforts today, Donini (2011)  cautions that “the temptation to use humanitarian action to achieve political or military objectives or, more broadly, to incorporate humanitarian action in grand political designs is a recurrent theme in Afghanistan’s recent troubled history,” but “in sum, there are good practical reasons for separating or insulating principled humanitarian action from integrated missions or stabilization activities” (pp. 155–56), including maintaining principles (Shannon, 2009 ) and achieving impact (Williamson, 2011 ). Reflecting on another nexus, Howell and Lind (2009)  point out the “convergence of military and development objectives, and the partial subordination of the latter to the former” (p. 732) has undermined the effectiveness and the potential role of NGOs in Afghan civil society. The insights from this brief literature review have informed the design of the framework. The causal linkages and the potential for mutually reinforcing impacts suggest the importance of considering nexus actions. However, at the same time, the serious concerns raised about past attempts to pursue greater coherence, including the instrumentalization of development and humanitarian assistance, the compromising of principles, and the ultimate ineffectiveness of the efforts, including in Afghanistan, must be understood and addressed in any approach.  3 The triple nexus in theory Drawing on these insights, this paper proposes a new conceptual framework for understanding the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. It starts from an assumption that the SDGs represent the universal agenda for humankind, encompassing development, peace, and humanitarian efforts. In Transforming our world: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development , the UN (2015)  makes explicit reference to the relationship between peace and development as distinct but interrelated concepts: “There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development” (p. 4). Humanitarian emergencies are mentioned as threatening “to reverse much of the development progress made in recent decades” (UN, 2015, p. 6 ). Such an understanding of the encompassing scope of the 2030 Agenda is bolstered by some of the language that has been used to characterize it:“Universal in its coverage … transformative and integrative in its design, … it is the defining agenda of our time. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will provide a better life for all, prevent crises both natural and man-made, and build a firm foundation for human rights, stability, prosperity and peace in all societies. … Critical to [our] vision is the repositioning of sustainable development at the heart of the United Nations, with the 2030 Agenda as the guiding framework” (Guterres, 2017, pp. 3–4 ).   As a result, it can be argued that the SDGs were intended to reflect and encompass these three dimensions. It is important to acknowledge, however, that there are different interpretations of the centrality and scope of the 2030 Agenda. A growing consensus suggests that the Agenda is primarily a development framework for several reasons. First, it principally refers to development issues. Transforming Our World  only makes two references to humanitarianism, and while peace is treated more fully, greater emphasis is placed on local conditions, rather than inter-state or intra-state conflict. Second, it can be argued that conceptually development, humanitarianism, and peace should be dealt with separately, since they have their own distinct approaches and guiding principles. Third, the United Nations itself often describes the 2030 Agenda as primarily a development framework. The quote above comes from a report entitled ‘Repositioning the United Nations development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda: ensuring a better future for all,’ implying that the United Nations development system – rather than the United Nations as a whole – is primarily responsible for supporting its achievement. While it is important to acknowledge this ambiguity, the ultimate interpretation is not critical for a discussion of the triple nexus approach. Even if the 2030 Agenda is primarily a development framework, its achievement inarguably depends  on work in the humanitarian and peace domains. Therefore, whether interpreted as the single universal framework or more narrowly as one of several key, inter-linked frameworks, the achievement of the 2030 Agenda requires the integration of efforts across these domains and can benefit from a triple nexus approach3 At the same time, it can be argued that the triple nexus approach is aimed at the UN system as a whole, rather than just the development part of it, since it attempts to bring greater coherence among the pillars. As a result, there may be a mismatch between the 2030 Agenda, which focuses on the development system, and the triple nexus approach, which relates to the broader UN system. While this ‘mismatch’ may exist, it does not preclude the triple nexus approach from being relevant to supporting the 2030 Agenda, since the achievement of the goals depends on efforts in the humanitarian and peace domains.  3  . For the purposes of this paper, within the 2030 Agenda, the concept of ‘peace’ is largely related to SDG 16 on ‘Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions.’ However, it is important to recognize that ‘peace’ is integrated throughout the 2030 Agenda and has targets embedded in other SDGs. Acknowledging this wider integration, but also recognizing that SDG 16 represents the main concentration of these issues within the framework, the paper will use ‘SDG 16+’ as a short-hand equivalent for ‘peace.’ Consistent with the evolving conception of the term, ‘development’ is viewed as multi-dimensional well-being (Haq, 1995; Harris, 2000; Streeten, 1994; Stiglitz, Sen, & Fitoussi, 2009 ) and is understood as representing freedoms (Sen, 1999; Sen, 2009 ) associated with a range of issues from health and education to climate action and employment. Therefore, in this paper, ‘development’ is related to all the remaining SDGs (1–15 and 17)4 While the assignment of 16 SDGs to development and only one to peace creates a kind of imbalance, it should be noted that this is a tension inherent in the framework. To an extent, the triple nexus framework rebalances this lop-sidedness in the 2030 Agenda by giving peace and development more equal weights.  4  . In line with the description in Transforming our world: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development , ‘humanitarian’ refers to efforts to address potentially life-threatening emergencies that set back progress towards any of the SDGs (1–17). One potential source of confusion is that these definitions may seem somewhat restrictive. The conception of development as freedom (Sen, 1999 ) could arguably apply to and encompass all humanitarian, development, and peace efforts described in the 2030 Agenda, not just the more limited definition of development presented here. Moreover, although it includes humanitarian, development, and peace issues, the 2030 Agenda is referred to as a framework for sustainable development , precisely because it reflects this expanded understanding of the term. These apparent inconsistencies point to the fact that it will be necessary to bear in mind that there are two types of ‘development’ discussed in this paper. Within the context of the triple nexus framework, development is defined in more limited terms and is one of three domains that also include humanitarian and peace efforts. However, when speaking of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is a broader concept that has an expanded scope and relates to all three dimensions. Acknowledging that within the framework these three concepts are distinct but nevertheless linked, the relationships can be schematically represented by placing the concepts at the different corners of a triangle. (See Fig. 1  ) Approximately midway between any two corners, there will be an area of overlap, which can be represented by a circle. This overlap can be conceived of as representing situations in which outcomes related to both concepts can be achieved. For instance, for the humanitarian-development nexus, the circle represents the situations in which actions can contribute to measurable humanitarian and development outcomes. While the discussions within the UN have recently focused on the humanitarian-development nexus, it follows, in conceptual terms, that there would also be humanitarian-peace and development-peace nexuses. Where these double nexus circles intersect is the shaded area that might be called the triple nexus, representing situations where actions can contribute to outcomes related to all three concepts – humanitarian, development, and peace. It is important to note that the triple nexus area is sub-divided into four regions. While all represent the intersection of the three concepts, they can be said to be ‘anchored’ or weighted differently. In some cases, the action is more anchored in development, humanitarian, or peace efforts, suggesting that the action may have emerged from one domain, but it contributes to measurable outcomes in the others too. For instance, the area of overlap between the humanitarian-development and development-peace circles (but not the humanitarian-peace circle) represents situations where outcomes in all three domains are achieved. The actions are anchored in development, in the sense that the project or program may have had a development-oriented origin – for instance, asset creation – but been designed in ways that achieve objectives related to humanitarianism, such as addressing seasonal food shortages, and peace, such as using a peacebuilding lens for community reconciliation. Schematically, this ‘anchoring’ is reflected by the fact that development is part of both of the intersecting double nexuses and that the area of overlap is closer to and pointing towards the ‘development’ corner of the triangle. The triangular center of the diagram is where all the dimensions – humanitarian, development, and peace – are more or less equally weighted and contribute to outcomes related to all three concepts. In this framework, nexus actions can therefore be characterized as ones that contribute to the achievement of outcomes in two or three of the nexus areas. They are strengthened when two additional conditions are met. First, the contributions to the outcomes should be deliberate – that is, efforts to support, for instance, peace and development are more effective when they are intentionally designed for that purpose. Second, and in line with the New Way of Working, the efforts should draw on the comparative advantages of multiple actors. A development intervention that wants to contribute to SDG 16+ will benefit from utilizing the expertise of peace actors. But neither of these conditions is essential: it is possible to unintentionally contribute to two or three nexus areas – for instance, when a humanitarian action has not been designed to support development or peace, but nevertheless has that effect; and a single actor could undertake a nexus action on its own – for example, an agency or ministry could be involved in both humanitarian and development work. The unshaded areas between the overlapping circles and the corners represent situations in which the humanitarian, development, or peace actions will remain distinct, but should be nexus-sensitive. There are circumstances in which it does not make sense – due to specific principles or strategic concerns (see Section 5  below) – to pursue a double or triple nexus action. However, in those cases, and in recognition of the mutually dependent relationship that exists between the elements, the actions should be nexus-sensitive – that is, they should actively take into account their potential effects on the other conceptual elements. For instance, a peace action may not seek to contribute to outcomes related to the other concepts, but it should be both humanitarian- and development-sensitive in the sense of ‘doing no harm’ and not undermining those efforts. In speaking of nexus actions, which should be developed in consultation with affected communities, it is helpful to distinguish between ‘bundles’ and ‘arrays.’ (See Fig. 2  .) A bundle is a set of actions that deliberately target a group of people in order to have a greater impact on improving conditions for them. For instance, a double nexus bundle might consist of humanitarian (e.g. food assistance, non-food items) and development (e.g. livelihood training, land allocation) support provided to people when they are internally displaced by conflict. While the action bundles will have a specific group as their focus – in this example, internally displaced persons – the way that they are designed may have benefits for wider populations. For instance, the bundle for internally displaced persons may provide cash transfers that stimulate the local economy and thereby have wider development benefits for the populations living in the areas where the displaced settle. These action bundles can be sequential, simultaneous, repeated, or integrated in nature:• Sequential bundles  refer to situations in which the actions are provided in a phased manner. For instance, echoing previous formulations of the relief to development continuum, a humanitarian response to a flood crisis might be followed by more recovery- and development-focused efforts for the same affected population. For the actions to be considered a sequential bundle, the key is for them: 1) to focus on the same population, and 2) to have been deliberately conceived of as contributing to humanitarian and development outcomes in the respective phases in a complementary manner.  • A simultaneous bundle  is one in which separate actions are deliberately undertaken at the same time for a population in order to reinforce each other and to contribute to multiple nexus outcomes. For instance, in consultation with affected communities, a school meals program designed to achieve a development outcome might be combined with civic education lessons designed to contribute to a peace outcome.  • A repeated bundle  is one in which the actions are undertaken at predictable intervals. Examples might include safety net transfers that happen on a monthly basis or an asset creation project that is undertaken during the lean season over the course of several years.  • An integrated bundle  is a single action that has the inherent quality of supporting two or more nexus outcomes (e.g. humanitarian, development, and peace). For instance, a transfer program conditional on participation in vocational skills training may address a humanitarian need (through the transfer), support development outcomes (through the vocational skills training), and contribute to reduced tensions and peace (through offering hope and livelihood opportunities).    Some bundles can be appropriately classified in two or more of these categories. For instance, an asset creation action carried out over multiple years may be a simultaneous bundle because it involves a humanitarian transfer and a development activity, and a repeated bundle because it is provided in successive periods. An array is a set of action bundles that represent the larger strategic efforts to achieve outcomes. For instance, it could be all the different bundles in a country that support the achievement of SDG 2 on zero hunger. These bundles populate different parts of the nexus framework and their positioning offers an indication of the way in which the strategy is making use of a nexus approach. If the bundles are scattered to the corners of the framework, it suggests that the array is not maximizing the potential impact of a joined-up, convergent effort, although it may be a conscious decision based on principled grounds. Alternatively, if it has a scatter across the framework, including using nexus-sensitive approaches, the array is more likely to be working in a mutually reinforcing manner to achieve the outcomes.  4 The triple nexus in practice With this overview of the theory of the triple nexus, it may be helpful to focus on examples that illustrate what these actions look like in practice. As a country engaged in a protracted civil conflict and exposed to recurrent natural hazards, but with strong aspirations for peace and development, Afghanistan offers a context that can highlight the benefits of adopting this approach. While most of these examples are drawn from work currently being carried out in the country, they were not necessarily conceived of as nexus actions and are not always being measured for those outcomes. In some cases, they simply represent situations that may lend themselves to these kinds of efforts. Nevertheless, they illustrate the kinds of actions that can be considered when a triple nexus approach is implemented in practice. While Afghanistan is used as an example, the framework has more universal relevance. It is being applied as a promising approach in a range of other countries, including Iraq (Jones & Mazzara, 2018 ), that are currently facing or emerging from conflict. While most frequently discussed in the context of protracted conflicts, the framework is also relevant to other circumstances too, including in more developed countries. For example, the United States after Hurricane Katrina experienced a confluence of factors, including a major humanitarian crisis, the need for substantial development, and heightened local tensions, which could have benefited from a triple nexus approach. Similarly, in this paper, many of the examples relate to food security and nutrition, and have a particular focus on UN efforts, but the approach applies to other thematic areas (e.g. health, education, and climate action) and entities (e.g. government, affected populations, donors, NGOs, and the private sector) as well. 4.1 Triple nexus actions Triple nexus: Return and reintegration.  Over the course of several decades of conflict, many Afghans fled to Pakistan as refugees. In recent years, for a variety of reasons, there has been political pressure for many to return. Over 600,000 returnees arrived in 2016 (OCHA, 2016b ) with smaller, but still significant numbers continuing to cross the border, including over 150,000 in 2017 (OCHA, 2017a ). In response, the government and international partners engage in a triple nexus response, anchored in humanitarian efforts but with potentially measurable benefits for development and peace and stability. As returnees cross the border and have their needs assessed, there is a ‘humanitarian moment’ when they receive food, cash, and non-food items to meet their immediate needs. Then there is a ‘development moment’5 The description of these sequential actions as ‘moments’ is borrowed from Toby Lanzer, the United Nations’ Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan.  5   when the returnees, who often settle in major cities, are supported with training on marketable livelihood skills that help them earn a living in the urban centers. Both the humanitarian and development assistance contribute to peace, in the sense that they provide hope and opportunities (which can be measured with a perception score) and therefore support stability. This sequential bundle is therefore an example of a triple nexus action. Triple nexus: Asset creation program . Another triple nexus example, anchored in the development domain, relates to food assistance-for-assets projects. Bringing together local community development committees, Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, international NGOs, and the UN, the action helps address a seasonal hunger gap, which could be characterized as a humanitarian response. However, it has development benefits both in the manner that the food is sourced and in the asset that is created through the activity. Through an agreement with the millers, the fortified wheat flour comes, in part, from local Afghan farmers. Its purchase therefore contributes to the economic gains within the country. Similarly, the wheat is fortified and milled by local companies that employ Afghans and is moved to the communities in need by local transporters. It therefore has economic development benefits all along the value chain. In the communities, the conditional assistance is used to build assets such as the 11-kilometer canal for three villages in Takhar Province, which has been transformative in helping people move from deficit to surplus production, a key development contribution (WFP, 2018 ). Both the humanitarian and development gains seem to have had an impact on local perceptions of safety and the likelihood of young men migrating for work, making a contribution to peace (WFP, 2018 ). Triple nexus: Shock-responsive safety net.  Given the recurrent natural hazards the country faces, including the recent widespread drought in 2017 and 2018, the Government, with support from the World Bank and the United Nations, is considering the development of a shock-responsive safety net, based on the principles of early warning, early financing, and early action. In its protective function of responding to emergencies, the safety net would have a humanitarian role; in its productive function of building resilience in vulnerable communities – for example, through asset creation activities – it would serve a more developmental purpose. Yet the fact that the state is able to provide this humanitarian and development assistance on a consistent and fair basis would build trust in and credibility for the current or any future elected government and therefore contributes to its legitimacy and the overall stability of the country. In this case, the action bundle would be repeated and would not be anchored particularly in any of the dimensions, placing it in the center portion of the nexus diagram.  4.2 Double nexus actions Development-peace nexus: School meals.  School meals programs can contribute to this double nexus, when deliberately designed with that intention. The program represents a development action because it attracts and retains more children in school, helping to increase their years of education and potentially improving learning outcomes (Coombs et al., 2016 ). This education, which is an important SDG 4 outcome on its own, has a range of other benefits, including strengthened livelihoods (SDG 8) and reduced stunting in the next generation (SDG 2), as parents are better able to provide for their children and are more open to nutritional messages. Yet, they can also contribute to peace and stability (SDG 16+). The provision of meals and the classes themselves create a sense of normalcy and routine for children during or after a conflict. Moreover, if the meals are combined with lessons in civics or peaceful coexistence, they can help foster a reduction in tensions in this younger generation. Humanitarian-peace nexus: Ceasefire distributions.  Although this action did not materialize, a plan to expand humanitarian responses during a ceasefire illustrates how the humanitarian-peace nexus could work in practice. The idea was that an agreed ceasefire between the government and the principal non-state armed group would provide an opportunity for a widespread humanitarian response to a drought, especially in areas where access had been problematic because of ongoing fighting. By demonstrating the value and benefits of a ceasefire, the humanitarian response would in turn create greater support and impetus for peace. For this simultaneous bundle, it might have been possible to measure both humanitarian and peace benefits (e.g. through improvements in food consumption scores and a ‘perceptions of peace’ survey, respectively). Humanitarian-development nexus: Flood resilience.  Combining efforts of government ministries, UN agencies, and NGOs, a simultaneous and repeated bundle in a village in Mazar-i-Sharif focused on community check-dams in flood-prone areas and provides an example of a humanitarian-development nexus action. The check-dams allow the community to control water flows and have better access to water year-round – a development outcome – and as a result, previously dry areas can grow fruit and nut trees, which can be a source of income – another development outcome. Yet the dams also prevent the damage and crises caused by regular flash floods – a humanitarian outcome. The bundle therefore makes both development and humanitarian contributions.  4.3 Nexus-sensitive actions Nexus-sensitive humanitarian action:  The response to the 2017–2018 drought in Afghanistan provides a clear example of a nexus-sensitive action. Although the primary focus was on the humanitarian response, these efforts were sensitive to the other aspects of the triple nexus. They were development-sensitive, because there was a conscious consideration of seasonality and a recognition that the humanitarian assistance should only be provided until the next harvest in 2019 in order to avoid undermining the recovery of rural communities. At the same time, they were peace-sensitive, by targeting and reaching areas controlled by both government and armed groups, solely on the basis of urgent humanitarian need, and therefore not exacerbating tensions between the two sides in the conflict. Nexus-sensitive development action:  The Ministry of Public Health, NGOs, and UN agencies are engaged in efforts to support the local production of nutritious food products. While fundamentally a development action in line with the SDG 2 targets, the efforts are humanitarian-sensitive in that they consider and try to develop nutritious products that can be used in emergency responses, including Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSFs) for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition. Similarly, by creating local, Afghan-owned value chains, it is sensitive to the wider political dynamics, including calls to develop Afghan industries, where possible and appropriate, rather than to rely on imports from countries with a potential stake in the ongoing conflict. Nexus-sensitive peace action:  The holding of fair, democratic elections is an important means of achieving SDG 16 on peace, justice, and inclusive societies. In Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is the UN entity charged with supporting the government in these efforts. While the primary focus is on SDG 16+, it is possible to make the elections both humanitarian- and development-sensitive. A humanitarian-sensitive approach would ensure that those affected by crises – including the internally displaced and returnees – are given opportunities to participate in the voting process where they are, rather than potentially increasing their risks and exacerbating the crises by making them return to a home area that they have fled. Likewise, providing voting arrangements that allow women to participate and ensuring that the process does not significantly disrupt education through the use of schools as voting centers are ways of not undermining larger development efforts. These are not outcomes per se, but rather attempts to ‘do no harm’ (Anderson, 1999 ).   5 The triple nexus: Supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals The humanitarian-development-peace nexus offers a potentially powerful means for supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2017 )6 To some, the triple nexus approach is primarily focused on enhancing coherence. In this paper, however, the triple nexus is also presented as a means for supporting the achievement of the SDGs for several reasons: first, this understanding has been stated  by the UN (see UN, 2017 ); second, it has been interpreted  in this way by the UN Country Teams in Afghanistan and other locations; and third, it is implied  by the frequently mentioned rationale for using the approach to bring greater coherence to the UN’s efforts, since coherence is not an end in itself, but rather a means for achieving the 2030 Agenda. However, the differing views point to the importance of gaining greater clarity on the potential of the triple nexus approach.  6  . With this greater conceptual and practical clarity, it may be possible to explain how the triple nexus functions to accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda. The approach implies four changes that make responses, at least in theory, more effective: a focus on collective outcomes; alignment of efforts across the pillars; enhanced, mutually reinforcing impacts; and more holistic measurement. 5.1 Collective outcomes Proposed in the context of the World Humanitarian Summit, and articulated as part of the agreed ‘New Way of Working,’ the original definition of a collective outcome stated that it “is a commonly agreed quantifiable and measurable result or impact in reducing people’s needs, risks and vulnerabilities and increasing their resilience, requiring the combined effort of different actors” (OCHA, 2017b, p. 7 ). This definition can be slightly modified and expanded in a nexus context to encompass three characteristics: measurability, a focus on a broader goal, and engagement of multiple actors. Given the 2030 Agenda, in most countries, it is helpful to think of the Sustainable Development Goals as the collective outcomes that multiple actors are trying to achieve. While the country as a whole may prioritize a broader range of SDGs, the international community might be able to focus on a sub-set of the government’s priorities where they have expertise and their actions would be particularly helpful. In Afghanistan, for instance, the UN might concentrate on SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Health), 4 (Education), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and 16 (Peace, Justice, and Inclusive Institutions). While the efforts would inevitably contribute to other SDGs, these would be the areas of primary focus.  5.2 Alignment With the SDGs, or their targets, established as the collective outcomes, a triple nexus approach involves aligning the efforts in the three dimensions – humanitarian, development, and peace – to support their achievement, since drawing on the comparative advantages of different actors will make the actions more effective. Where there is a United Nations political mission or peacekeeping operation, it might mean aligning the efforts outlined in the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) or its equivalent, and the mission mandate with each other in order to support these collective outcomes through an Integrated Strategic Framework or similar document. In some cases, where these documents were not originally conceived of as part of a single, overarching strategy, it may be necessary to retrofit the existing plans into a newly configured alignment. In Afghanistan, the most recent frameworks were developed largely independently, but included aspects of a wider UN reform agenda that make it more possible to align them. (See Fig. 3  .) The HRP developed for 2018 (OCHA, 2017a ) used a limited definition of humanitarianism that focused on life-saving activities, adopted for the first time a multi-year timeframe in line with the recommendations of the New Way of Working, and referenced in its assumptions the relationship to the development framework. In order to better align with the priorities articulated under the Afghan National Peace and Development Framework (ANPDF), the UN in close consultation with the Office of the President prepared the One UN for Afghanistan (2018–2021) approach, focused on six thematic areas that represent the majority of the UN’s work in the country: Food Security, Nutrition, and Livelihoods, Health, Education, Return and Reintegration, Rule of Law and Normative. It was an updating and re-envisioning of the UNDAF for the evolving context. At the same time, the Political Mission, UNAMA, had its mandate reviewed and renewed with a more explicit recognition that the country could no longer be considered as ‘post-conflict’ and an emphasis on the thematic areas of human rights, peace and reconciliation, transitional justice, and elections, among others. All three of these documents responded to a strong government desire for a more accountable and joined-up approach. Fig. 3  suggests how these frameworks can be aligned to ensure that all three pillars are working together to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals7 There is a strong argument for having SDG 5 on Gender as one of the key priorities in Afghanistan. However, this illustrative example is based on the alignment of the current main focus areas for the UN in the country. It should be noted, though, that many of the focus areas make contributions to SDG 5 as indicated by the boxes at the upper right of the SDG ovals in Fig. 3 .  7  . In the future, it has been proposed that a strategic framework encompassing all these pillars should be created and serve as the foundational document for the UN’s engagement in supporting countries to achieve the SDGs from the outset, though the dangers inherent in such a joined-up approach have been described above.  5.3 Impact relations While the collective outcomes and pillar alignment form an essential part of the triple nexus approach, its real strength is that it creates multiple, mutually reinforcing impact pathways. There are three levels of impact that need to be considered: bundles, arrays, and what might be termed ‘super-arrays’. Bundles have four distinct impact pathways, which can be either direct or indirect. It may be helpful to take the example of the triple nexus access creation program described above to illustrate these pathways (see Fig. 4  ). First, there is a magnified direct impact. In this example, by combining the humanitarian assistance (i.e. addressing the hunger gap) with development efforts (i.e. creating assets such as irrigation canals) into a single action bundle, it is possible to both address the immediate hunger need and support the community’s long-term ability to have sustainable access to food and nutrition. The bundle therefore directly and more comprehensively supports the collective outcome of SDG 2, Target 1 (access to food and nutrition all year around). Second, a nexus action contributes to other SDG outcomes. By definition, a triple nexus action must support SDG 16+ related to peace, justice, and inclusive institutions. In this example, the collaboration across communities to build jointly owned assets lowers tensions, provides opportunities, and helps reduce all forms of violence. At the same time, sourcing this assistance through local farmers, local mills, and local transporters contributes to job creation and supports the achievement of SDG 8 on employment. Third, these contributions to other SDGs have an indirect reinforcing impact on the targeted collective outcome of SDG 2 (zero hunger). In this case, increasing employment and improving security both help create an enabling environment for SDG 2, since stronger livelihoods allow the employees to better meet their food and nutrition needs and any reduction in violence permits more opportunities to address hunger issues. Fourth, the direct and indirect impacts on SDG 2, in turn, contribute to wider peace, development, and humanitarian efforts. Reduced hunger may, in itself, lead to a reduction in tensions, making it safer to walk in an area and lowering the incidents of violence. The nexus bundles therefore use multiple, reinforcing pathways to contribute to the wider collective outcomes of a country. For arrays, which represent multiple bundles contributing in a strategic manner to a single collective outcome, the possibilities are increased. The example above described the impact of a bundle. If all the bundles in an array are contributing to the main collective outcome – in this example, SDG 2 – directly from a humanitarian and development perspective and, at the same time, indirectly through peace (SDG 16+) and the wider development goals (the other SDGs aside from 2 and 16+), then the ‘circulation’ of reinforcing impacts is even greater. Of course, there may be some bundles that are double nexus or nexus-sensitive, but the fact that they are either contributing to or avoiding to undermine these efforts means that the potential is more fully harnessed. For super arrays, which can be defined as an assemblage of arrays focused on individual SDGs into a larger grouping related to all the SDGs, it is important to not only understand the impact pathways of individual bundles and arrays, but also how the collective outcomes they support – that is, the SDGs – interact with each other. For instance, progress in hunger (SDG 2) leads to improvements in education (SDG 4) and health (SDG 3), since better nourished children remain in school and learn better and stay healthier. Those educational and health gains, in turn, support the reduction of hunger in the current generation and the next, as improved education and health outcomes enable children, when they become adults, to engage in more productive livelihoods and better provide for themselves and their families. The contributions to peace (SDG 16+) help, in a small way, to create the conditions in which these other SDG interactions can take hold and flourish and to prevent conflict from causing emergencies, which are a principal source of setbacks to development. In this way, the different individual arrays with a focus on specific SDG collective outcomes interact with each other to provide additional reinforcing benefits.  5.4 Measurement and adjustment Given its aspirations and complexity, the triple nexus framework requires a more holistic approach to measurement. Instead of narrowly focusing on a specific outcome, it tries to understand the potentially wider contributions to other outcomes. But this approach requires two changes in the way that indicators are commonly identified and measured. The first change is to capture the relatively underexplored contributions that may not have been focused on in the past but that could, with more deliberate attention, demonstrate how an action bundle can support multiple nexus outcomes. Returning to the example of the asset creation program in north-eastern Afghanistan, a typical approach would be to attempt to measure the development outcomes, through a community asset score, or similar indicator. But the nexus approach would suggest that indicators should also be developed and measured for the support to the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers, mill workers, and local transporters, as an additional development contribution. It would then also make sense to measure improvements in the food consumption score as an indication of the change in the humanitarian situation during the hungry season. Finally, it might be possible to use a community tension perception score to measure the contribution to peace. But this points to the second change for measurement: the indicators need to be linked to those identified for the SDGs (UN, 2018b ). While this is true for any efforts to support the 2030 Agenda, it takes on particular relevance for a nexus approach in which claims are made for contributions to various SDG collective outcomes. For instance, it might be difficult to argue that a food security-related action contributes to the achievement of SDG 16+, which is necessary, under the proposed framework, for asserting that an action supports the triple nexus or a double nexus involving peace. Yet, the reductions in tensions in an asset creation project could contribute at a local level to these agreed SDG 16 indicators (UN, 2018b ):  16.1.3 Proportion of population subjected to (a) physical violence, (b) psychological violence and (c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months     16.1.4 Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live     By addressing hunger, offering greater hope within communities, and bringing different communities together, the action may lead to less physical or sexual violence, and allow people to feel safer walking alone. It is therefore possible to articulate how the hunger-focused humanitarian and development actions contribute to peace. Similarly, if a shock-responsive hunger safety net provided predictable, equitable, and effective assistance to populations in times of need, that success could build greater trust and confidence in a unity government, could be registered in a survey of satisfaction with government services, and contribute to measurable progress on this SDG 16 indicator:  16.6.2 Proportion of population satisfied with their last experience of public services     With this more holistic approach and linkages with the SDG collective outcomes, it becomes possible to monitor progress, make adjustments to improve impact, and more fully understand the return on investment from any bundle or array.   6 Challenges While there are many arguments to support the adoption of a triple nexus approach, it is also important to be aware of the genuine risks, which were in part highlighted in the literature on previous attempts to achieve greater coherence. There are six broad areas of concern. First, the principles that guide different domains of action can come into conflict. In the humanitarian-development nexus, humanitarian principles focus on humanity, neutrality, impartiality and operational independence, while in line with the Paris Declaration, development principles emphasize working through government and supporting their aims and strengthening their capacities. When the government is a party to a conflict, as in Afghanistan, these principles can be difficult to reconcile. As we have seen, there is perhaps an even greater danger from the linking of humanitarian and development efforts with political and security initiatives. To address this challenge, the framework clearly demarcates areas of nexus and nexus-sensitive work, and thereby permits a discussion of the circumstances in which it may be appropriate to focus on greater coherence (through nexus bundles) and when it is necessary to keep a principled separation of efforts (through merely nexus-sensitive bundles). A situation of active conflict may necessitate a more principled approach and nexus-sensitivity, while periods of peace and reconciliation may offer greater opportunities for double or triple nexus actions. Second, there may be a trade-off between efficiency and impact. While nexus actions provide the possibility for greater impact, it takes significant time and planning to maximize those benefits. In the case of the drought response in Afghanistan, it would have been hard for humanitarian actors to wait for development plans to be put in place before responding. It therefore made sense to move forward with a nexus-sensitive bundle at least at the start, while looking for ways to make the response more supportive of development and even peace outcomes later. Ideally, planning would take place in advance allowing the two or three domains to work together from the outset, even in a crisis situation. Third, the complexity of the impact pathways may make it difficult to trace out the interrelations and identify indicators, complicating efforts to develop theories of change and monitor progress. In the example from Afghanistan, it was possible to identify at least four pathways by which a triple nexus action bundle could contribute to humanitarian, development and peace outcomes in a mutually reinforcing manner. In addition, it was necessary to speak of the impact pathways for arrays and super-arrays. To address this kind of complexity, it may be worth considering moving towards a systems approach (e.g. ‘systemic theories of change’) that analyze the interrelations between bundles, arrays, and SDG-related outcomes in a less linear, more holistic manner involving feedback loops. While perhaps daunting, it seems possible to develop indicators for some of the interactions that at first glance appear challenging to measure. For instance, the local impacts on peace might be captured through community tension perception scores, changes in levels of migration, and safety perception scores, linked to SDG 16 indicators. Fourth, it could be argued that the triple nexus is yet another framework that complicates rather than harmonizes existing approaches. It can be viewed as being not fully consistent with the SDG framework. The awkwardness arises because the three concepts or pillars are superimposed on an agenda divided up into 17 goals. But it may be helpful to consider that one represents goals, the other domains of action. As a result, and as indicated in the definitions above, the two frameworks – the 2030 Agenda and the triple nexus – can be reconciled by explicitly equating SDG 16+ with ‘peace’ and the other SDGs with ‘development’ narrowly defined, and classifying humanitarian action as responses to crises that cause setbacks to any of the SDGs. Relatedly, the triple nexus could be viewed as a UN-centric approach, echoing the pillars of the organization but not necessarily the structures of governments and civil societies of its member states. Yet, most governments and civil societies, including in Afghanistan, have actors focused on these separate domains, and therefore the calls for alignment of different pillars and the engagement of multiple actors working together may be applicable beyond the UN. The framework also has the serious limitation of ignoring one of the key pillars in the UN system: human rights. Yet, in discussions on coherence, the United Nations has focused on humanitarian, development, and peace aspects, and preferred to ensure that human rights are deeply integrated across all three concepts. Fifth, the nexus approach has led to calls for more flexible, multi-year funding (ICVA, 2018; UN & World Bank, 2018 ) in Afghanistan and other countries that would permit the use of resources across humanitarian, development, and peace efforts, rather than tying them to one particular domain. But a concern has been raised that this flexibility could lead to the potential blurring of distinctions between the domains and a consequent reallocation of funding (see Guterres, 2017 ). For instance, peace and development funds could be directed towards humanitarian efforts; alternatively, humanitarian and development resources may be transferred towards peace initiatives. While the framework does not directly address funding allocations, it does point to the importance of flexible, multi-year funding to permit the types of nexus actions described and to the need to preserve funding in all areas in order to permit both joined-up nexus work, but also more distinct, nexus-sensitive efforts. Finally, there is a risk of overstating the benefits of this approach and underestimating the challenges of making a difference in complex settings such as Afghanistan. Despite all the efforts to establish reinforcing impacts, the situation is perhaps only marginally influenced by these action bundles and arrays; far more significant are the highly political external factors (e.g. troop reductions, peace overtures, intensification of fighting, climatic events) that determine the well-being of the population (cf. Sexton, 2016 ). As a result, there is a need for humility in recognizing that the triple nexus approach helps to make the greatest impact possible given the circumstances, but on its own may not determine the trajectory of a conflict and the larger aspirations for peace and development.  7 Conclusion In many ways, the triple nexus approach is a new iteration of previous attempts (see Anderson, 1999; Buchanan-Smith & Maxwell, 1994; Chandler, 2007; Donini, 2011; Mosel and Levine, 2014; Uvin, 2002 ) to bring greater coherence and impact to efforts to achieve larger goals. While it responds to a deeply felt impulse and recurrently articulated need for greater coherence and impact, the seeming failure of earlier attempts points to the importance of learning lessons from those experiences. The frequently expressed concern is that, in pressing for a more joined-up approach, key pillars, especially the humanitarian one, have compromised their principles and thereby undermined their ability to achieve their original purpose, while their contributions to the larger goals of security or development ended up being marginal and relatively ineffective. With this background, the paper has presented a framework for understanding the different relationships between actions that support humanitarian, development and peace efforts and their potential for contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, illustrated through examples drawn from Afghanistan. However, the greater conceptual clarity does not prescribe a specific application of the triple nexus approach. Instead, echoing the Secretary General’s call (Hochschild, 2017 ), it provides the basis for a more rigorous and clear-sighted discussion of the appropriate use tailored to the context. In some situations, it will be more important to maintain a principled distinction between humanitarian, development, and peace efforts; in others, they can and should be reinforcing. Broadly speaking, it could be argued that:• In situations of active and widespread conflict,  it is likely that the array will be spread across the framework, with a somewhat greater concentration at the corners. This configuration may reflect the principled decision to maintain more independent efforts, focusing on nexus-sensitive actions, rather than double or triple nexus ones. Yet, there will also likely be areas and instances where more explicitly nexus bundles should be undertaken. There may be opportunities, for instance, to support development and peace and reconciliation at a local level, in a manner that is separate and distinct from a securitization approach.  • In situations of transition where a peace agreement has been reached or conflict subsides,  it would be expected that the array would more readily converge towards the center of the framework, with a greater concentration on triple and double nexus actions, as both sides have an interest and a stake in the success of any newly formed unity government. Of course, the completion of a conflict is rarely straightforward, and pockets of instability will remain even after the conclusion of a peace agreement, necessitating nexus-sensitive approaches. But overall, the focus will be on double and triple nexus bundles.  • In situations where peace needs to be sustained amid emerging or high risks of violence,  it would be beneficial to have arrays that are more evenly scattered across the framework. While it may be necessary to focus on principled, nexus-sensitive bundles in some locations and circumstances in order to avoid the perception of taking sides in an emerging conflict, there would also be a need for double and triple nexus actions to support and sustain the current peace and make rapid progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.    In all of these situations, it is not so much a question of whether to use a triple nexus approach, but rather how it should be adapted to the particular context in order to harness, to the extent possible, the potential impact of actions. The tension between coherence and principles has been a fundamental challenge in formulating approaches to support countries to emerge from conflict and sustain peace. If it is to be effective, the triple nexus framework must acknowledge these tensions and make allowances for the complex and imperfect trade-offs that may be necessary. However, by taking a clear-sighted approach and adjusting for different and evolving contexts, it has the potential to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially in countries affected by conflict.
