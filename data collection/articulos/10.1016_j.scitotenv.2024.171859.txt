                  Environmental pollution of heavy metal(loid)s (HMs) caused adverse impacts, has become one of the emerging concerns and challenges worldwide. Metal(loid)s can pose significant threats to living organisms even when present in trace levels within environmental matrices. Extended exposure to these substances can lead to adverse health consequences in humans. Removing HM-contaminated water and moving toward sustainable development goals (SDGs) is critical. In this mission, biochar has recently gained attention in the environmental sector as a green and alternative material for wastewater removal. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the remediation of typical HMs by biochars, associated with an understanding of remediation mechanisms, and gives practical solutions for ecologically sustainable. Applying engineered biochar in various fields, especially with nanoscale biochar-aided wastewater treatment approaches, can eliminate hazardous metal(loid) contaminants, highlighting an environmentally friendly and low-cost method. Surface modification of engineered biochar with nanomaterials is a potential strategy that positively influences its sorption capacity to remove contaminants. The research findings highlighted the biochars' ability to adsorb HM ions based on increased specific surface area (SSA), heightened porosity, and forming inner-sphere complexes with oxygen-rich groups. Utilizing biochar modification emerged as a viable approach for addressing lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and chromium (Cr) pollution in aqueous environments. Most biochars investigated demonstrated a removal efficiency >90 % (Cd, As, Hg) and can reach an impressive 99 % (Pb and Cr). Furthermore, biochar and advanced engineered applications are also considered alternative solutions based on the circular economy.

Editor: Damia Barcelo Environmental pollution of heavy metal(loid)s (HMs) caused adverse impacts, has become one of the emerging concerns and challenges worldwide. Metal(loid)s can pose significant threats to living organisms even when present in trace levels within environmental matrices. Extended exposure to these substances can lead to adverse health consequences in humans. Removing HM-contaminated water and moving toward sustainable development goals (SDGs) is critical. In this mission, biochar has recently gained attention in the environmental sector as a green and alternative material for wastewater removal. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the remediation of typical HMs by biochars, associated with an understanding of remediation mechanisms, and gives practical solutions for ecologically sustainable. Applying engineered biochar in various fields, especially with nanoscale biochar-aided wastewater treatment approaches, can eliminate hazardous metal(loid) contaminants, highlighting an environmentally friendly and low-cost method. Surface modification of engineered biochar with nanomaterials is a potential strategy that positively influences its sorption capacity to remove contaminants. The research findings highlighted the biochars' ability to adsorb HM ions based on increased specific surface area (SSA), heightened porosity, and forming inner-sphere complexes with oxygen-rich groups. Utilizing biochar modification emerged as a viable approach for addressing lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and chromium (Cr) pollution in aqueous environments. Most biochars investigated demonstrated a removal efficiency >90 % (Cd, As, Hg) and can reach an impressive 99 % (Pb and Cr). Furthermore, biochar and advanced engineered applications are also considered alternative solutions based on the circular economy.

In more detail, industrial production and development affected the ecosystem through the discharge of toxic heavy metal(loid)s (HMs) in dispersed and dissolved forms (Chi-Wei et al., 2023 ; Phan et al., 2020 ). It is believed that industries and anthropogenic inputs are important sources of HM pollution in aquatic environments. For instance, HM-containing products have been used in processes of industrialization and global development, e.g., the electroplating industry, smelting and coal industry, finishing industry, electrical and photography devices manufacturing sectors, waste management, aerospace field, mining and transportation industries, households, and even agricultural sectors, etc. (Kour et al., 2021 ). As a result, mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) are the most popular HMs involved with human activities (Jaiswal et al., 2018 ; Shahjahan et al., 2022 ; Yadav et al., 2019 ) and they have negative influences on the environment, e.g., soil, water and air. HMs have predominantly utilized raw materials and by-products of different diverse industrial fields and have become a serious issue as a threat to life. For instance, aquatic food (e.g., fish) is becoming a critical source of HMs, which is associated with non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic influences on humans. Hence, HM pollution in the environmental ecosystem and its toxicological impacts can occur on human health (Briffa et al., 2020 ; Mitra et al., 2022 ). According to “the U.S. National Toxicology Program”, the occurrence of these HMs, even at an extremely low level, can cause carcinogens in humans (Hokkanen et al., 2016 ). These days, HMs pollution in aquatic ecosystems has become a global environmental issue. There has been rising attention over water pollution by HMs discharged from industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) outflows owing to the (eco)toxic influences of their metal(loid)s ions on living forms and its bio-accumulation in important biota. The distribution of these HM ions in water bodies endangers aquatic species and human health related to their occurrence/accumulation into food webs (Wang et al., 2012 ). For example, lead-related poison exposure causes brain death in children in the Dominican Republic (Wongrod et al., 2018 ). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 18–22 million people are being impacted by lead poisoning worldwide (Mahdi et al., 2018 ). Also, cadmium (Cd) is revealed as one of the seven most hazardous compounds by “the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services” (ATSDR, 2012a ). Cadmium has a detrimental impact on human health issues and induces liver damage as well as carcinogenicity (Zhou et al., 2018 ). Essential illnesses including hepatic injury, renal dysfunction, hypertension, lung damage, and teratogenic impacts could be attributed by Cd(II) presence (S. Zhang et al., 2019 ). Accordingly, it is necessary to remove this pollution in the environment, especially from wastewater, for sustainable development goals (SDGs) aided by the “circular economy” approach. In the approaches to the circular economy, this carbon dioxide (CO2 ) capture will be an excellent way for new sustainability toward WWTPs, as a critical factor in mitigating climate change effects and efforting transfer to a decarbonized economy platform (Pahunang et al., 2021 ). In order to remove toxic pollutants and deal with low-to-moderate strength WTP effluents, biological methods such as activated sludge processes (ASPs), phytoremediation, and anaerobic digestion (AD) are widely applied thanks to several advantages, e.g., efficient option and low-cost (Huynh et al., 2020 ; Tran et al., 2022b ). However, these methods still have some limitations such as the unsatisfactory treatment of some non-biodegradable contaminants, including HMs. On the other hand, biochar is an outstanding material that can remove several pollutants from aqueous solutions, considered as a potential technology for water treatment. Biochar is recognized as a solid substance with an effective specific surface area (SSA) varied from 35.4 to 151.4 m2  g−1  and even up to >520 m2  g−1 , and essential functional groups such as –OH, –COOH, C O, and C O (Hao et al., 2021 ; Minh-Ky et al., 2022 ). In addition, mineral-enriched biochar remained a cost-effective solution for HMs adsorption (Batool et al., 2022 ). Transferring crop straw to a useful biochar adsorbent contributes to carbon sinks, reduces carbon emissions, and avoids the release of HMs (Tan et al., 2022 ). Biochar materials can be applied to enhance microbial activities and their function in the detoxification and immobilization of HMs from wastewater. Also, utilizing microwave-assisted pyrolysis of rape stalks to produce biochar for the purpose of removing HMs from wastewater (Chen et al., 2023 ). The adsorption of toxic HM ions induced by agricultural wastewater by bamboo shoot shell-derived biochar has been remarked (Hu et al., 2022 ). Until now, the use of nanomaterials to modify the biochar surface can substantially enhance the sorption and removal performance of this innovative biochar for HMs (Ahuja et al., 2022 ; Cai et al., 2023 ). The critical potential to design engineered biochars containing specific physical and chemical characteristics via activation plays an important role in safe water remediation. Additionally, physicochemical treatment approaches (e.g., adsorption), especially with advanced engineered nanomaterials have been experimented with in recent years (Kamali et al., 2021 ). In this regard, the development trend of carbonaceous materials can meet sustainable requirements to be designed for full-scale application. It is critical to focus on SDGs, along with remediation aims to make a positive contribution to environmental protection. Using adsorption involving eco-friendly materials gained significant consideration. Recently, biochar has been used in wastewater treatment in bioengineering technologies (Gupta et al., 2022 ). Owing to its huge SSA and micropore structure, biochar can be utilized for several environmental applications. For instance, the SSA of biochars was pyrolyzed at temperatures 400 °C–600 °C varied from 10 m2  g−1  to 400 m2  g−1  (Brown, 2012 ). The superior removal capacity was reported by biochars produced from canola straw (Pb – 100 %), coconut shell (Cr – 99.9 %), and perilla leaf (As – 100 %) (Berslin et al., 2022 ). Generally, biochar water remediation is a low-cost, potential alternative solution, eco-friendly, and sustainable approach (Gwenzi et al., 2017 ). The biochar features are a critical key in removing the HMs from wastewater (Biswal and Balasubramanian, 2023 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). Thus, it can be seen that biosorbents are highly available and environmentally friendly. The world is currently trying to obtain sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Chi-Wei et al., 2023 ; Obaideen et al., 2022 ). To achieve SDGs, a critical investigation needs to be conducted for the particular society and environment. Regarding sustainable development, wastewater sources indicated the potential to be recycled and reused for essential purposes, e.g., providing safe drinking water and promoting hygienic conditions to support SDGs (Malik et al., 2015 ; Obaideen et al., 2022 ). Biochar, as a low-cost and green adsorbent, contributes a sustainable alternative to wastewater remediation solutions (Lalmalsawmdawngliani et al., 2024 ; Masud et al., 2023 ). This study focuses on their wide applications in wastewater remediation to remove contaminants, i.e., toxic HMs. This effort remarks on critical mechanisms for the remediation of HMs from wastewater and the environmental benefits of biochar adsorbents toward SDGs. Furthermore, the present study provides an intensive understanding of the importance and role of biochar in WWTPs. Other further applications are also carried out as alternative solutions based on the circular economy. Finally, the research gaps and suggestions for future perspectives are well discussed.  2 Sources, fate, and adverse effects of heavy metal(loid)s Environmental pollution of HMs is an emerging concern and has become a challenge worldwide. HMs are produced from anthropogenic and natural activities, e.g., industrial emissions/discharge, agrochemicals, traffic, domestic sectors, etc., as well as other improper discharges without treatment into environmental matrices, leading to severe risks to living organisms and ecosystems (Shahjahan et al., 2022 ). Fig. 1   illustrates sources, fate and transport, and adverse effects of HMs in environmental matrices. 2.1 Sources Sources of HMs pollution are categorized into anthropogenic and natural sources (Phan et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). These HMs could be detected naturally on the crust of Earth related to the formation of our planet. Natural activities contribute to increasing HMs pollution, including volcanic eruption, metal(loid)s evaporation and corrosion from the soil, sediment and water, geological weathering processes, soil erosion, etc. (Gautam et al., 2016 ; He et al., 2005 ). Especially, HMs pollution has been remarked due to anthropogenic reasons, e.g., mining metal(loid)s, industries of smelting and foundries, and other HM-based agricultural and industrial sectors, as well as their HMs leaching from waste dumps, landfills, livestock/animal manure and excretion, runoffs, and roadworks, etc. (Briffa et al., 2020 ). HMs are detected in raw sewage at high levels, and they are not degraded by sewage treatment processes. Anthropogenic activities have caused numerous HMs in contaminated sites, e.g., post-mining sites, and areas containing pesticides (Briffa et al., 2020 ). In agricultural sectors, HMs have been known as secondary sources of pollution via utilizing fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, etc. This HMs pollution (e.g., copper, arsenic, lead, and chromium) can still be found in sites where HMs containing pesticides have been used (Walker et al., 2005 ). Monitoring the extended accumulation patterns of HMs in the soil-crop systems was undertaken (Sun et al., 2023 ). The investigation focused on tracking the prolonged trends of soil copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb) in these systems over a span of 5 to 8 years, during which commercial fertilizer was consistently applied. These applications of commercial fertilizer exerted a notable influence on the accumulation of HMs in soils. Understanding the cumulative trends of HMs in soils is pivotal for assessing the potential risk of metal(loid)s pollution resulting from the introduction of these elements through fertilizer application. Critical sources of anthropogenic HMs are metal(loid)s manufacturing plants, fossil fuel power plants, and chemical plants (Liu et al., 2022 ; Phan et al., 2020 ). For instance, Pb(II) was released from electric vehicle battery manufacturing, mines, smelters, and other industrial sectors (Wongrod et al., 2018 ). Also, arsenic pollution was emitted from ores, mining processing areas, and pesticide industrial sectors. Cadmium⸻is one of the most toxic HMs and is emitted enter aquatic environmental matrices, induced by natural and anthropogenic activities (Chowdhury et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, HMs are primarily from featured industrial sectors such as electroplating, plastics, smelting operations, paint pigments, and the cadmium (Cd) - silver (Ag) and cadmium (Cd) - nickel (Ni) battery industrial sectors (Aşçı et al., 2008 ). Consequently, the discharge of untreated industrial WWTPs sources into water columns and nearby agricultural soil can cause severe problems such as land degradation, disease issues, productivity reduction, and other serious health consequences.  2.2 Fate and adverse effects With the strong development of social and economic activities, wastewater discharged from mining and industrial sectors has become a critical source of HMs-pollution in aquatic ecosystems, e.g., water bodies. Their occurrence in environmental matrices, even in trace concentration, can cause negative problems for all living organisms. Prolonged exposure to these HMs creates negative health impacts in humans. As well recognized that the abundant and diverse existence of toxical HMs, e.g., mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) in wastewater has become an essential issue and serious risk for human health. Generally, they are interconnected during the whole production activities of plating dyes, cleaning metals, the leather/tannery industry, etc. Among these HMs, lead, arsenic, and chromium are commonly discharged by diverse sources, which can cause adverse health problems to animals, aquatic life, and humans. Chromium, e.g., Cr (III, IV), is an important industrial HM detected in ore mining, leather tanning, alloys and steel processing, electroplating, metal cleaning and plating, wood preservation, glass and textile industry, dyes and pigment manufacturing, film and photography, fungicide industry, etc. (Shakya et al., 2019 ; Zhu et al., 2018 ). The discharged HMs disrupt the life and profiles of living forms as their accumulation, bio-magnify, transport in soil, sediment, and then cause adverse effects in the environment (Fig. 1 ). For example, arsenic that drinking water has led to a risk to the community health and impacted millions of people. Lead⸻is a common HM contaminant with high adverse toxicity, including carcinogenicity. Owing to the persistence and high toxicity of Cd (II) in farmland and water bodies, it has become an expanding concern in recent years. Illustrations of characteristics and adverse effects of toxical HMs are demonstrated in Table 1  . HMs exposure are one of the most critical parameters that induce reproductive toxicity and human health (Goutam Mukherjee et al., 2022 ). Some HMs impact biological development and functions, meanwhile, other HMs accumulated in various organs lead to several adverse diseases, e.g., cancer (Briffa et al., 2020 ). Due to bioaccumulation and biomagnification inside the living organs and tissues, these HM elements have become a special concern. They can directly affect the aquatic environment/ecosystems by flowing into the living structure, leading to (eco)toxicity and/or indirectly influenced by disrupting the food chain/web (Merola et al., 2021 ). Therefore, they are usually examined as excellent typical organisms for toxicological/toxicogenomic investigations (Das et al., 2012 ). Bioaccumulation and bio-magnification are two key indicators applied for investigating the geochemical HMs cycling in the ecosystems (Shahjahan et al., 2022 ). Bioaccumulation is defined as a process in which accumulation takes place within a “single trophic level” related to the food chain/web; while in bio-magnification, the accumulation of HMs occurred in multiple tropic levels of the food chains as a consumption consequence of HMs-contained foods by higher trophic level consumers. Bioavailability and the HMs uptake depend on several factors, e.g., HMs concentration, exposure period, interaction with other HMs, characteristics of consumers (e.g., age, size), detoxifying mechanism, its metabolic process and feeding behavior, and environmental chemical-physics properties, etc. (Delahaut et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, fish is considered as fatty acids and protein source for humans, and HMs could accumulate inside fish, and then they could easily be transferred to a human, causing adverse influences (Das et al., 2012 ). HMs could cause serious issues inside the human body by generating ROS that induce damage and oxidative stress to the DNA, leading to risks for important patterns such as proteins, enzymes, hormones, etc. The occurrence and distribution of these HMs, even at an extremely low level, consequently induced carcinogen threats in human beings as reported by “the U.S. National Toxicology Program” (Hokkanen et al., 2016 ). Especially, HM ions formed in the body can impact the liver, kidneys, and lungs (Chen et al., 2015 ). The “World Health Organization” (WHO) and “the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency” (U.S. EPA) have suggested acceptable maximum levels of Cd(II) to be respectively 0.05 and 0.03 mg L−1  (Chowdhury et al., 2014 ). Additionally, the U.S. Government has strictly set the maximum level of arsenic (As) in surface water and groundwater to be equal to 10 μg L−1  (Ding et al., 2018 ). Concerning exposure, HMs can enter humans in several pathways, including air inhalation, ingestion of polluted food, related to polluted drinking water, and skin contact from several sources, e.g., chemicals manufacturing, agricultural sector, residential and industrial zones (Walker et al., 2005 ). Also, the toxicity of HMs depends on several important factors, e.g., the presence of HM levels, the nature/profiles of HMs, the biological role of HMs, and their exposure pathways. HMs have been highlighted to interact/associate with DNA and nuclear proteins that can induce specific impairment or disadvantage (Valko et al., 2005 ). Two primary types of damage might be occurred, including “direct damage” and/or “indirect damage”. In the “direct damage”, conformational alterations are owing to the HMs taking place to the biomolecules. Furthermore, the HMs cause “indirect damage”, as a result of the generation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, involving superoxide (*O2 − ), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), hydroxyl radicals (*OH), nitric oxide (*NO), and also other endogenous oxidants, etc. Therefore, HM pollution environmental matrices could cause critical risks to organisms and humans.   3 Overview of biochar and feedstock for biochar production Biochar is determined as the carbon-rich yield generated from the burning of feedstocks under an oxygen-limited environment (Tripathi et al., 2016 ). Biochar is formed through thermochemical conversion under various processes, i.e., (i) pyrolysis, (ii) hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), (iii) gasification, and (iv) torrefaction. In accordance with temperature (°C) and vapor residence time (VRT), these thermochemical processes for biochar production can be classified as: (a) pyrolysis: conventional/slow pyrolysis (350–800 °C, VRT: sec – h), and fast pyrolysis (400–600 °C, VRT: sec), (b) gasification (700–1500 °C, VRT: sec – min), (3) hydrothermal carbonization (HTC): hydrothermal conversion to hydrochars (175–250 °C, VRT: h), and (4) torrefaction (200–300 °C, VRT: min – h) (Mohan et al., 2006 ). The advantages and drawbacks of typical thermochemical conversions in producing biochar are presented in Table 2  . Furthermore, most biochars are derived from agricultural wastes, sawdust, animal manure, forestry biomass, algae, etc. (Ullah et al., 2020 ). Generally, pyrolysis⸻is the prominent production method compared to other biochar production approaches such as HTC, gasification, and torrefaction (Wang and Wang, 2019 ). The function and biochar applications are determined by the structural characteristics and material constituents of the feedstocks. Feedstocks and thermochemical conversion conditions/processes are key factors in determining biochar properties. Feedstocks for biochar production include several biomaterials, e.g., agro-processing wastes, crop biomass and residues, municipal solid waste, sludge wastes and animal manure, microalgae, etc. (Table 3  ). These materials are able to contain critical properties, e.g., high SSA, highly porous microstructure, high cation exchange capacity (CEC), high fixed carbon, and pH varied from near-neutral to alkaline. Further, selecting and processing feedstocks have an essential role in biochar production. The literature review has described the feedstock available in the production of biochar, e.g., several production procedures, and the significance of optimal parameters, including retention time, pyrolysis temperature, and rate (Berslin et al., 2022 ). Agricultural biomass and residues are critical to biochar production, including rice husks and straws, woodchips, corn straws, and other feedstocks. The high level of oxygen and carbon content in biochar composites synthesized from the forest and agricultural feedstocks are usually found to be in surface functional groups, e.g., carboxylic (–COOH), hydroxyl (–OH), and ether (C–O–R), etc. (Takaya et al., 2016 ). Moreover, biochar produced from sewage sludge or animal manure feedstocks has gained attention.  4 Engineered biochar for heavy metal(loid)s removal from wastewater Removal of HMs from contaminated WWTPs aiding biochar has been considered attention in recent periods, mainly owing to their adverse toxicity and impact on the environmental ecosystem and health issues. There have been efforts to examine the performance of applying biochar toward HMs removal. Biochar is indicated to be a promising absorbent or bio-remediating agent in the industrial sectors. Remarkably, biochar-aided water treatment technology as a low-cost and potentially sustainable solution for clean water supply (Gwenzi et al., 2017 ; Tuan Tran et al., 2022 ). Large SSA and large interaction between the vital functional groups and environmental contaminants on biochar surfaces lead to promoting the effective performance of pollutants from water. Further, integrating nanomaterials onto the biochar surface makes it possible to elevate its physicochemical attributes through modifications in functional group composition, heightened porosity, and enhanced active surface availability (Ahuja et al., 2022 ). This, in turn, leads to an improved capacity for adsorbing HMs. The wide application of biochar has been examined extensively over the past years, and also several studies have illustrated modifications of their physicochemical characteristics to enhance remediation functionality for pilot and laboratory scales. For example, a comprehensive review of the biochar-aided application in removing HMs such as lead, chromium, and arsenic has been examined (Berslin et al., 2022 ). Investigation of adsorption behaviors of HM ions (i.e., Cd2+ , Hg2+ , Pb2+ , and Cr3+ ) via low-cost MnO2 -assisted magnetic biochar produced from the residue of palm kernel cake (PKC) (Maneechakr and Mongkollertlop, 2020 ). Development of sustainable and novel materials that are economical, efficient, low-cost, eco-friendly, and socially acceptable for full-scale application. Recently, marine macroalgae-derived biochars have gained consideration as a low-cost and efficient adsorbent for HMs remediation and other microcontaminants (Raheem et al., 2018 ). Marine algae and macroalgae biomass-derived biochars demonstrating distinguished physio-chemical profiles have reported great potential in removing several pollutants from wastewater sources, e.g., HMs (Son et al., 2018 ). It could be demonstrated that biochar production for environmental remediation has been popularly indicated as an efficient and low-cost solution (Minh-Ky et al., 2022 ; Z. Zhang et al., 2019 ), higher quality and cheaper than compared to activated carbon, as well as eco-friendly and sustainable (Berslin et al., 2022 ; Yaashikaa et al., 2019 ), low energy consumption, high yield, and easy and simple application (da Silva Veiga et al., 2020 ; Nguyen et al., 2022 ). Table 4   illustrates a summary of the performance of various biochars in HMs removal, and detailed biochars for HMs removal from wastewater are well discussed. 4.1 Lead (Pb) Lead (II) remediation from the aqueous environment was carried out by subjecting the feedstock to pyrolysis at different temperatures (350 °C, 450 °C, and 550 °C) and varying VRT of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 h (Mahdi et al., 2018 ). The findings demonstrated maximum adsorption efficiency of 74.6 mg g−1 , resulting in the biochar preparation at 550 °C. In another investigation, the apricot tree Prunus armeniaca  was prepared for biochar production to Pb sorption (Sekulić et al., 2018 ). In the study conducted by Hao et al. (2021) , they compared the efficacy of coconut shell-based biochar pyrolyzed at 350 °C with activated carbon (AC) produced through carbonization at 700 °C for the removal of Pb. The lead uptakes were illustrated as 3.9 mg g−1  and 12.1 mg g−1 , accordingly. The biochar produced at 400 °C from corn straw by the pyrolysis method was determined to favor a pH level of 7 by Pb(II) adsorption performance (Chi et al., 2017 ). Findings also indicate that pH plays a critical contribution in their sorption efficiency. Further, the lead sorption and their adsorption were indicated to be about 28.9 mg g−1  (Chi et al., 2017 ). Also, rice husk-based biochars generated at various pyrolysis temperature conditions (300, 500, and 700 °C) were performed to remove lead pollution (Yaashikaa et al., 2019 ). The sorption efficiencies of biochars at 300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C were reported to be 14.1, 21.7, and 26.7 mg g−1 . For the adsorption mechanism, promoting adsorption efficiency is due to enhancing the availability of biochar SSA and their micropores (Manyuchi et al., 2022 ). Cao et al. reported a consistent trend when dairy manure-derived biochar was applied for wastewater removal (Cao et al., 2009 ). Additionally, another study reported that coconut shell-derived biochar prepared at 350 °C for lead removal follows common mechanisms, including precipitation, surface complexation, physical adsorption, ion exchange, and electrostatic attraction (Hao et al., 2021 ). The sorption trials were carried out by Cui et al. (2018)  to investigate the removal capacity of biochar for Pb. It highlighted that around 68.1–99.4 % of lead (Pb) was treated by mid-heat treatment temperatures (mid-HTT) biochars (500 °C–600 °C), and this efficiency enhanced to 91.8–99.9 % for high/low-HTT biochars (Cui et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the sorption performance of Pb varied with temperature factor, and both high-HTT biochar (700 °C–900 °C) and low-HTT biochar (300 °C–400 °C) presented critically greater sorption performance than compared to mid-HTT biochars. This illustrated that the lead adsorption capacity on biochar was found and dominated by multiple critical mechanisms, e.g., precipitation, complexation, ion exchange, and coordination with π-electrons, etc. (Cui et al., 2016 ). In a recent investigation, an improved adsorbent material, BC@nHAP, was developed by combining rice straw biochar (BC) with nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HAP) (Ahmed et al., 2022 ). The biochar-nanocomposite resulting from this modification led to enhanced Pb (II) adsorption capabilities. The adsorption mechanisms were further confirmed through FT-IR spectroscopy and XPS spectrum, indicating ion exchange with Pb2+  and surface complexation involving–COOH and –OH groups.  4.2 Cadmium (Cd) Cadmium (Cd) is usually detected in the form of natural minerals (and ores) with other elements, e.g., oxygen and sulfur. Cd could be ingested and then enriched by living forms and eventually transported to human bodies via the food chains and webs, inducing chronic poisoning, etc. (Li et al., 2016 ). In order to avoid its extreme and adverse toxicity, Cd must be eliminated and treated from polluted water to protect the health, safety, and the environment. Although there are several methods, e.g., physical and chemical solutions perform well in removing cadmium from wastewater effluents, however, it still have critical drawbacks, i.e., high energy requirements, large sludge production, and also the formation of byproducts. Meanwhile, the adsorption process is regarded as a low-cost, high-efficiency, simple operation, and economical solution for Cd removal to decrease toxicity (Zamri et al., 2017 ). For example, biochar materials have been proven to have excellent performance thanks to their numerous advantages, including excellent removal efficiency, high stability, and large SSA. Several studies indicated that biochar could immobilize and remove cadmium to eliminate its toxicity. Corn straw-derived biochar recorded the cadmium adsorption capacity at 38.9 mg g−1  (Chi et al., 2017 ). Wheat straw and sesame biochar demonstrated the maximum Cd(II) adsorption was 70 mg g−1  and 86 mg g−1 , respectively (Park et al., 2016 ). Similarly, the produced biochars were applied as useful adsorbents for cadmium remediation from an aqueous solution (Khan et al., 2020 ). The findings demonstrated that the biochars remarkably sequestered HM ions, which enhanced the SSA, functional groups, and generated inner-sphere complexes with oxygen-riching groups. Additionally, the investigations have shown that the cadmium (II) adsorption process follows the Langmuir model, especially with magnetic biochar composites achieving the adsorption capacity up to 46.9 mg g−1 . Thus, biochar modification can give a useful solution to eliminating cadmium from aqueous environments. The essential adsorption mechanisms were included as electrostatic interaction, chemisorption, and also monolayer adsorption (Khan et al., 2020 ). Concerning influencing factors, several parameters play a critical role in the adsorption mechanisms, e.g., the SSA, mechanical stability, adsorption capacity, etc. The surface characteristics of biochar can be altered to promote the adsorption performance and potential by enhancing the selectivity and functional groups to eliminate HMs. Several modified approaches have been utilized to adsorb water removal in recent years. Karunanayake et al. (2018)  showed that Fe3 O4 -magnetized Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii ) biochar is successful in treating Cd(II)-contaminated aqueous solution. Another investigation also highlighted that Fe–Mn-modified biochar could be used as an excellent adsorbent to remove Cd from polluted wastewater (Tan et al., 2022 ). Thus, utilizing metal elements to help modify biochar can effectively raise the absorption performance of biochars. For instance, MgO-modified biochar demonstrated excellent adsorption for Cd(II) at an adsorbed dosage of about 18.1 mg g−1 , which was 2.8 times greater than compared to virginal biochar (Xiang et al., 2018 ). Similarly, chitosan bi-functionalized magnetic bamboo-derived biochar was produced as an adsorbent for HMs, including cadmium (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Microalgal-biochar immobilized complex is illustrated as a novel biosorbent in removing cadmium from an aqueous phase (Shen et al., 2017 ). The removal of cadmium (II) by the as-prepared bio adsorbents was well presented by “the pseudo-second-order kinetic model” and Langmuir isotherm. Until now, biochar application combined with microbes for promoted HMs immobilization has been illustrated by different labs, pilots, and full scales. For detail, increased Cd removal performance by growing B. cereus  RC-1 immobilized on various magnetic biochars via simultaneous bioaccumulation and adsorption (Deng et al., 2022 ). Enhancing HMs remediation with enriched biochar in combination with microbes is better than simple biochar. Furthermore, biochar's utilization within constructed wetlands (CWs) for the purpose of remediating water polluted with cadmium has been considered (G. Wang et al., 2023 ). When comparing the CWs without biochar, it was recognized that in the wetlands incorporating biochar (BC-CWs), a remarkable Cd (II) removal efficiency of up to 99.7 % was attained. This high removal rate was achieved associated with maintaining consistent physicochemical parameters.  4.3 Arsenic (As) Biochar applications were pyrolyzed at a temperature between 400 °C and 450 °C for arsenic degradation with four different feedstocks, including oak bark and wood, pine bark, and wood (Mohan et al., 2007 ). Results illustrated that the maximum adsorption performance occurred at a pH of 3–4, and oak bark (10 g L−1 ) reached equal to 70 % for arsenic removal. This examination also reported that the adsorption efficiency could be further promoted by the physical/chemical activation on biochar. In the other study, Yoon et al. (2017)  demonstrated that the maximum uptake of arsenic (V) was up to 22.8 mg g−1 . However, the sorption is negatively impacted by the co-existing ions viz. Ni(II) and PO4 3− . Some virgin biochars have illustrated sustainable performance, for example, the utilize of Japanese oak wood-derived biochar for sorption on arsenite (As, III) and arsenate (As, V) (Khan et al., 2018 ). These findings remarked that the adsorption performance of arsenate As(V) of 84 % is slightly higher compared to arsenite As(III) of 81 %. Also, perilla leaf-derived biochars produced at temperatures 300 °C and 700 °C have been investigated by showed that the biochar 700 °C was greater effective than that biochar 300 °C. It can be indicated that the higher SSA of biochar, notably 700 °C, and their surface aromaticity favored the As adsorption capacity compared to samples produced at 300 °C. Principally, functional groups (e.g., –OH, –COOH, –CH3 , –C–O) onto the biochar surface are significantly responsible for the precipitation and surface complexation of the pollutants (e.g., HMs) resulting in its removal in aqueous media. Further, the organic fraction (e.g., municipal solid waste) and rice husk were prepared as biochar materials/sources to determine the efficiency of arsenic removal (Agrafioti et al., 2014 ). Most biochars presented >95 % of removal efficiency. Rice husk-derived biochar, especially, has indicated vital mechanisms such as precipitation, co-precipitation, and electrostatic interactions for the remediation of arsenic pollution (Agrafioti et al., 2014 ). Another work also showed acid-activated biochar in degrading pentavalent As(V) and trivalent As(III) arsenic (Ding et al., 2018 ). For detail, Tetra packs  were pre-treated by hydrochloric solution (HCl) and then pyrolyzed at a temperature of 600 °C for 1.5 h. The findings indicated that the biochar surface achieves great element contents such as carbon (C), calcium (Ca), and aluminum (Al). As(III) and As(V) adsorption capacity was 33.2 and 24.2 mg g−1 , respectively. In addition, the individual adsorption performance of arsenic (As) was obtained to be over 90 % (Ding et al., 2018 ). However, the arsenic sorption occurred along with competitive PO4 3−  ion, which negatively affected the arsenic sorption phenomenon.  4.4 Mercury (Hg) In recent years, biochars were synthesized for the removal of Hg owing to their charged surfaces, microporous structure, and significant binding affinity of its functional groups to the HMs (Maneechakr and Mongkollertlop, 2020 ). In particular, nanoporous biochar achieves high SSA based on agricultural residue (i.e., rice straw) for efficient sorption of Hg ion from aqueous solution (Liu et al., 2022 ). In this research, biochar-aided adsorbent was produced by HTC, and alkali modification reached a high adsorption performance of 209.65 mg g−1 . Additionally, the mercury adsorption performance of biochar was investigated under various influencing parameters, e.g., pH, adsorbent dosages, and HMs ion (Liu et al., 2022 ). The adsorption follows “pseudo-second-order kinetics” as well as the Langmuir isotherm, demonstrating predominant chemisorption. This finding helps treat mercury-containing wastewater from rice straw residue. Furthermore, fabricated beads presented removal efficiency in Hg(II) up to 70–90 % from 1.0 mg L−1  mercury solution and indicating the adsorption performance of 0.1 mg g−1 , which attributed to the weight of biochar utilized for the beads (Isa et al., 2022 ). Tan et al. illustrated an enhancement in Hg adsorption efficacy by sulfurizing corn straw biochar (about 77 %) in 500 μg L−1  HgCl2  (Tan et al., 2016 ). Similarly, others demonstrated a higher mercury sorption performance in 320 mg L−1  by sulfurization of wood-derived biochar by 85 % (Park et al., 2019 ). The mercury sorption mechanisms of biochar revealed that the synthesized biochar could be applied to remove Hg-contaminated waters and is appropriate for full-scale.  4.5 Chromium (Cr) Agricultural residue or biomass (e.g., rice husk) and organic fractions can be utilized as precursors for biochar preparation at low temperatures. The biochars were prepared and impregnated with Fe0 , Fe3+ , and Ca2+  to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions (Agrafioti et al., 2014 ). Maximum chromium removal of rice husk impregnated with Fe3+  was observed at >95 %. About a 58 % reduction in Cr ions was found in treated wastewater with husk-derived biochar (Ahalya et al., 2005 ). Also, the HCl-activated biochar promotes SSA and lower surface negative charge, which enhances the successful treatment of Cr(VI) (Ding et al., 2021 ). Further, chromium (VI) sorption on ramie-derived biochar was determined by the physio-chemical characteristics of biochar (Zhou et al., 2016 ). The oxygen-rich functional groups could increase adsorption capacity by reduction of Cr(VI) (hexavalent chromium) into Cr(III) (trivalent chromium). The conducted experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficacy of the adsorbent in effectively removing Cr (VI) from real water samples (Li and Li, 2023 ). This serves to confirm further the broad applicability and practicality of the adsorbent, particularly in the context of adsorption column filtration. Owing to the biochar surface containing abundant hydroxyl (–OH) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups, ramie-derived biochar, when pyrolyzed to a lower temperature of 300 °C, exhibits a strong attraction to Cr(VI) ions, achieving an impressive adsorption dosage of 82.2 mg g−1  (Zhou et al., 2016 ). Another corn straw biochar was pyrolyzed under 500 °C (for one hour) in activated form and was applied to chromium recovery (Qu et al., 2021 ). The result indicated that Cr(VI) uptake was up to 116.97 mg g−1 . Huge SSA, high porosity, and abundant pores given by the activation were responsible for the remediation capacity. Other investigations indicated that Cr removal was attributed to co-precipitation and reduction mechanisms (Thangagiri et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, sweet lime-based biochar made at 450 °C for one hour, consequently also illustrated monolayer adsorption of Cr with primary mechanisms including chemical interaction, physical adsorption, and ion exchange (Shakya et al., 2019 ). The efficient removal of chromium (Cr) over biochar significantly depends on the pH value and sorption process favorable at lower pH conditions (Rafique et al., 2021 ). For detail, the highest adsorption was indicated for modified biochar at up to 99 % at a pH of 2. Also, nZVI particles combined with the medicinal herb residue (A. membranaceus ) biochar were applied for the removal of Cr(VI) from polluted water sources (Shang et al., 2017 ). The sorption capacity was reported to be strongly pH-dependent, and the highest sorption reached 98.7 % in a pH condition of 2 (Shang et al., 2017 ). Correspondingly, sewage sludge-based biochar aided by nZVI for the Cr(VI) remediation was examined. It was also confirmed that pH had a critical function in the sorption process and demonstrated the highest adsorption up to 31.5 mg g−1  at an initial pH of 4 (Fan et al., 2019 ).  4.6 Other metal(loid)s The application of biochar products toward the bioremediation of other HMs (e.g., Zn, Cu, Ni) is also elucidated in Table 4 . Alslaibi et al. (2014)  applied olive stone waste-derived biochar obtaining adsorption efficiency for Cu (II), and Fe (II) was equal to 22.73 mg g−1  and 62.50 mg g−1 , respectively. Also, marine microalga Chlorella  sp. residue-derived biochar for good adsorption performance with ultrasonication combination to treat/remediate metal(loid)s such as Ni (II) and Zn (II) (Amin and Chetpattananondh, 2019 ). The surface modification of engineered biochar is indeed an excellent strategy that enhances its sorption capacity for the remediation of contaminants. Biochar modification via activation can enhance the SSA, the number of available electrons, and surface functional groups that aim to improve HMs sorption (Ippolito et al., 2012 ). For instance, KOH-treated (1.3 M) and steam-activated (800 °C, 3 h) biochars have been reported to significantly remove copper (Cu) from aqueous environments (Ippolito et al., 2012 ). Additionally, in contrast to non-magnetic biochar, the development of magnetic biochar composites has garnered significant attention due to their enhanced efficiency in remediating HMs. Yi et al. (2020)  showed the magnetic biochar application for water removal to recommend that these excellent materials could remarkably promote their efficacy and clean environmental pollutants. Noticeably, by using the engineered magnetic biochar from marine macro-algal biomass illustrating maximum adsorption was obtained for copper (Cu) of 69.4 mg g−1  (Son et al., 2018 ). Thus, this recommends that the magnetic biochar (MBC) could potentially be applied as useful biosorbents for successfully removal of pollutants, e.g., HMs.   5 Mechanisms for remediation of heavy metal(loid)s from wastewater Generally, the biochar surface has a predominant role in removing HM ions and can be divided via physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms (Foong et al., 2022 ; Wen et al., 2024 ). Regarding the various chemisorption, the main mechanisms include ion exchange, precipitation, redox reaction, hydrogen bonding, and surface complexation. Whereas, the physisorption mechanisms are electrostatic interaction/attraction, pore filling, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interaction, π − π interaction, etc. (Berslin et al., 2022 ). Fig. 2   presents critical removal mechanisms of HM pollutants via using biochars, e.g., surface precipitation, co-precipitation, reduction, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, pore fillings, adsorption and diffusion, π-π interaction, complexation, and hydrogen bonding, etc. Actually, multiple mechanisms for HMs removal usually occur, e.g., it can be included integrated ion exchange, surface precipitation under an alkaline environment, complexation, and π-binding interactions between the biochar structure and the HM ions (Cai et al., 2023 ; Foong et al., 2022 ). Further, these mechanisms also depended on vital influencing parameters/factors related to experimental conditions (Berslin et al., 2022 ). Biochar has excellent potential for water treatment and is also reported as a helpful adsorbent in immobilizing HMs and further reducing their toxicity and bioavailability. The removal capacity of biochar at various operating conditions/parameters, e.g., feedstocks, pH, temperature, the initial level of targeted pollutant, adsorbent dosage, contact time, etc. (Berslin et al., 2022 ). For example, sugar beet tailing-derived biochar can remove Cr(VI) efficiently at an optimal pH of 2 (Dong et al., 2011 ). In contrast, peanut shell-derived biochar could remove As(V) that operated at an optimal pH of 6 (Sattar et al., 2019 ). Also, adsorption depends on the contacting time and process of the contaminated wastewater with the reactive adsorbents (microporous, high SSA, functional groups) to determine equilibrium time (Egirani et al., 2021 ). Their excellent sorption performance is linked to its highly-microporous structure and SSA, containing diverse functional groups (e.g., phenolic, carboxyl, hydroxyl groups), therefore it has a robust affinity for HMs (Ahmed et al., 2022 ; Cao et al., 2009 ). The adsorption mechanisms are usually explained and investigated via isotherms, kinetics, and molecular dynamics (Berslin et al., 2022 ). For example, isotherms are examined as an essential factor in assessing the adsorption performance and their process intensity. The adsorption mechanism of most biochar applications can be determined by fitting Freundlich and/or Langmuir isotherm. The biochar mechanism can be classified as a physicochemical technique, owing to its processes occurring on a surface structure (Qu et al., 2021 ; Tran et al., 2022a ). The adsorption mechanism is also analyzed by typical techniques, e.g., “Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy” (FT-IR) and “X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy” (XPS). Density functional theory (DFT) estimation and 2D FT-IR analysis are further utilized to inquire about the interaction sequence between critically functional groups and HMs (Hu et al., 2022 ). The findings illustrated that the adsorption mechanism, for example, Cr(VI) is confirmed to the adsorption-coupled reduction mechanism in which some redox-active components give electrons (e− ) for chromium removal. Furthermore, with regard to a biochar-nanocomposite, the efficient lead (II) adsorption capacity was predominantly determined by electrostatic attraction and surface complexation (Ahmed et al., 2022 ). Nano-biochar exhibits superior physicochemical properties compared to macro-biochar, including unique nanostructure, enhanced stability, larger specific surface area, improved surface functionality, more excellent catalytic capability, increased porosity, and higher density of surface active sites (Bhandari et al., 2023 ). The adsorption of inorganic pollutants on nano-biochar primarily involves the important processes: physical and chemical adsorption, precipitation, and ion-exchange (Amusat et al., 2021 ). For instance, nano-biochar has shown outstanding adsorption capacity for heavy metals like chromium (Cr) from aqueous solutions (Ma et al., 2023 ). The carboxyl (−COOH), hydroxyl (−OH), and phenol groups located on the surface of nano-biochar facilitate the chemisorption of pollutants by exchanging anionic ions with cationic pollutants. Physiosorption takes place due to Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions among the freely mobile electrons of surface functional groups of the nanoscale-based biochar, resulting in non-covalent attraction with C C bonds (Amusat et al., 2021 ; Bhandari et al., 2023 ). Additionally, heavy metal ion precipitation onto the nano-biochar surface can occur during the adsorption. Biochar concomitantly provides multi-benefits such as improving environmental quality, energy provision, and enhancing water quality. They offer several notable advantages over conventional adsorbents, including its carbonaceous matter (C-matter), distinctive micropore structure, active surface functional groups, adaptable preparation process, ease of modification, and stable chemical characteristics (Qu et al., 2021 ). However, depending on initial feedstock properties, there is the heterogeneity of internal and surface (micro)structure of biochars (i.e., SSA, porosity, micropore size distribution, etc.) and also surface functional groups (i.e., –OH, –COOH, C C). For instance, the biochar prepared at high-temperature conditions contains fewer hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) as well as functional groups but illustrates great aromatic properties and reaches lower ion exchange capability. In contrast, the biochar produced at lower temperatures indicates diverse organic characteristics, e.g., containing more –COOH and C C functional groups, and cellulose and aliphatic-type structures. HMs remediation strongly depends on the molecular and selectivity sieving capability of the biochar, henceforth, micropore geometry, porosity, and capacity of cation exchange are vital factors (Jiang et al., 2016 ).  6 Perspectives on environmental benefits of biochar applications toward sustainable development goals 6.1 Perspectives on environmental benefits Although the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have halved the number of people with inadequate safe water worldwide from 1990 to 2015, around 600 million people still cannot access/use clean water supplies, especially in developing nations (WHO, 2014 ). SDG 6 of the United Nations (UN) aims to ensure water access and sanitation, indicating the necessity to improve water-related ecosystems and the protection of water quality (Hering et al., 2016 ). However, the accelerated development of industry and urbanization have discharged a huge amount of wastewater into the environmental matrices. Therefore, the water treatment process is a critical and priority factor in achieving sustainable water mission/provision (Di Maria et al., 2020 ; Padilla-Rivera and Güereca, 2019 ). The conventional removal approaches followed by industrial sectors attributed to high maintenance costs, caused secondary pollution substances, and consumption of enormous amounts of energy (Chen et al., 2015 ). The challenges need to be toward highly well-organized solutions in order to achieve the standards and requirements for water quality. In order to overcome this issue, adsorption processes seem to be a promising solution for eliminating and removing water pollution, including HMs. Adsorption is more critical owing to the efficient removal and low-cost, availability, and regeneration of diverse sustainable materials as green adsorbents, e.g., biochar. Several investigations are available for low-cost biochars to remove environmental pollutants, especially HMs in comparison to conventional technologies (Alhashimi and Aktas, 2017 ). Biochar produced from agricultural residue and biomass (e.g., rice straw, corn straw, woodchip, coconut shell, algae, etc.) is considered a renewable resource for wastewater remediation. There are many potential environmental benefits of applying biochars for critical missions non-CO2  GHG emissions, and remediation of pollutants. It is necessary to control GHG emissions from WWTPs in the circular economy approach (Pahunang et al., 2021 ). Biochar has also proved to have a high potential to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs) in several countries and regions worldwide (Alhashimi and Aktas, 2017 ). Moreover, WWTP systems and sludge-to-biochar demonstrated high effectiveness in CO2  capture. For instance, sludge-based biochar, prepared through pyrolysis at 600 °C, showed a significant capacity for capturing carbon dioxide (Liu et al., 2023 ). The results indicated an impressive CO2  capture capability, measuring 86.56 mg g−1 . This promising outcome suggests the potential for practical engineering applications of biochar in carbon capture processes. Sustainable development can be deemed as development that, without negative impact causes damaging the environment and society (Hoang et al., 2022 ). Based on that, the environmental benefits of biochar application based on a circular economy approach toward SDGs are presented in Fig. 3  . Biochar is a renewable and low-cost adsorbent, demonstrating its appropriate application for low-income areas. The adsorption process has been examined as one of the best solutions with favorable advantages, e.g., cost-effective, simple design, less energy, excellent adsorption capacity, and high recovery. Biochar has a promising potential in effectively eliminating pollutants, enhancing carbon sequestration, and mitigating climate change (Masud et al., 2023 ; Matovic, 2011 ; L. Wang et al., 2023 ). Further, biochars were known as eco-friendly and attractive materials with diverse advanced applications for wastewater treatment (Jellali et al., 2022 ; Lap et al., 2021 ). N-enriched biochars significantly decrease GHG emissions (e.g., N2 O and CH4 ) (Nguyen et al., 2023 ), and enhance sustainable development and circular economy approaches (Jellali et al., 2022 ). The vital contribution of the WWTPs comes from their applications in providing safe water, health protection, and promoting water availability. Current efforts posing the perspective of biochar application to water treatment are pointed out. Low-cost biochar-aided water removal is one of the available interventions for community health protection and controlling/eliminating disease epidemics, especially among poor people (Gwenzi et al., 2017 ). As presented by Hering et al. (2016) , achieving SDG 6 on ensuring sanitation and safe water for all needs rapid action to transfer scientific knowledge/information (e.g., biochar-aided technologies) for water treatment practice and solutions. Further, the integrated application of artificial intelligence (AI) is necessary to be useful in environmental management and pollution control for SDGs (Hoang et al., 2022 ). Thus, the role of biochar application could be considered as one of the essential processes for the development of a circular economy to reach environmental sustainability. The significant achievement of clean water helps enhance life quality and friendly socioeconomic development, highlighting health and environmental protection. In general, biochar's ability to simultaneously contribute to carbon neutrality and address HM pollution aligns with global efforts toward sustainable development and environmental protection. The other analysis also illustrated that WWTPs could contribute to obtaining 11 out of 17 SDGs (Obaideen et al., 2022 ). Biochar's adsorption properties can help remove pollutants from water bodies, supporting SDGs. For example, the critical contribution comes from their capacity to promote water availability and human health worldwide (SDG 6 “clean water and sanitation”, SDG 2 “zero hunger”, SDG 3 “good health and wellbeing”, etc.). Management/control of wastewater could promote various approaches for the “circular economy”, and also design novel models based on the recovery and reuse of available by-products (Roychand et al., 2020 ). It could be seen that the circular economy has the enormous potential to develop creative patterns that enable society to obtain enhanced sustainable development, including friendly materials, low or no energy requirements, and appropriate environmental costs (Shehata et al., 2022 ). The use of effective biochar can remarkably promote the economic and environmental aspects of WWTPs. Several technologies have been reported as the sustainable mission for capturing, utilizing, and transforming CO2  released by WWTPs, e.g., sludge-to-biochar pyrolysis (Pahunang et al., 2021 ). Their strengths and challenges are critically examined, presenting a novel sustainable recognizance of WWTPs in the context of decarbonized and circular economy trends (Naddeo and Taherzadeh, 2021 ). In details, from the discharge of 100 tons day−1  of sludge at a WWTP, it's possible to produce 65 tons of biochar, yielding an average conversion rate of 65 %. According to the estimation of 0.9 kg of GHGs emission for every kilogram of biochar, a capture equal to 21 KtCO2eq  could be reached annually by the biochar production and conversion from WWTP sludge weight (Alhashimi and Aktas, 2017 ). Thus, it could be seen that considering the health risks of wastewater sludge, the biochar production from these sludges can be highlighted as a valuable alternative for sludge treatment/disposal, and in addition to CO2  sequestration toward socio-economic and environmentally sustainable development in agreement with the circular economy principles (Qambrani et al., 2017 ).  6.2 Further prospects Biochars play a critical role in making available and reliable plans/actions toward sustainable values to deal with environmental contaminants. Several missions have been proposed to enhance the significant contribution of the WWTPs to the critical SDGs. However, in order to overcome current challenges, it requires satisfying multiple purposes, including environmental, financial, technical, and socio-economic aspects. Herein, below is further prospects that should be examined:• Further investigate for remediation of emerging micropollutants to promote the environmental and techno-economic benefits of toxical waste management based on bi-adsorbent and/or nanomaterials in an industrial scale. It was suggested that low-cost novel biochar should be further investigated in removing toxic HMs from wastewater.  • Develop and optimize biochar-based WWTPs to mitigate some crucial challenges, i.e., optimal operating parameters and conditions, eco-friendly approaches, etc. Moreover, consider the life cycle assessment (LCA) of energy, water, and carbon footprints of WWTPs-aided biochars. Prioritize sustainability criteria for pollutant remediation by novel technologies, which are superior to current studies, to satisfy critical technical, economic, and environmental challenges.  • Upgrade magnetic adsorbents using low-cost and sustainable materials. It is not only applied for the remediation of HMs pollution from wastewater but only for toxic pollutants, especially emerging contaminants such as microplastic, pharmaceutical compounds, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), etc. In addition, the biochar efficiency in treating multiple pollutants should be evaluated for water treatment.  • Eliminating GHG emissions and energy recovery are crucial investigations that need to be considered for SDGs in wastewater removal. It is necessary to develop state-of-the-art approaches (i.e., biochar and their engineering applications for alternative solutions based on the circular economy) for carbon capture and wastewater remediation, with cost-effectiveness.      7 Conclusions HMs pollution is a potential risk to the ecological environment and humans. Their pollution and chemical pollutants strongly influence the ecosystem due to their features such as high persistence, bioaccumulation, and non-biodegradability. Therefore, biochar has been found to be able to reduce the environmental pollution risk of HMs. It is critical to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge and understanding of biochar-aided technology. It summarizes biochar-aided advanced engineering technologies and demonstrates insights into important directions for SDGs and a circular economy approach. Biochar is the byproduct of biomass through thermochemical conversion (i.e., pyrolysis, HTC, gasification, and torrefaction), which is prepared and includes various carbon-rich organic waste sources. The application of nanotechnology to modify biochar reaches great promise as a technology for expanding its environmental applications and achieving goals related to the removal of HMs. The study emphasized that biochars (500–600 °C) effectively treated around 99 % of lead (Pb) and demonstrated enhanced HM ion sequestration, attributed to boosting SSA and forming inner-sphere complexes. Biochar modification proves effective in eliminating cadmium (Cd) from water. Most biochars showed over 90 % efficiency in removing arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg), while modified biochar exhibited the highest adsorption for chromium (Cr), reaching up to 99 %. The sorption and removal performance for HMs can be significantly improved through surface modification of biochar using nanomaterials. Also, biochar is currently utilized as a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to remediate HMs pollution, as well as interest to the scientific community. They are applied as excellent adsorbents for the immobilization of harmful elements, including HMs. Further, biochar has recently been considered in the environmental engineering field as a green, eco-friendly alternative material for wastewater remediation, promoting the valuable efficacy of SDGs. This summarizes the remediation of typical HMs by biochar absorbents and indicates a practical alternative for ecologically sustainable. Applying biochar in various sectors, e.g., wastewater can eliminate/remove hazardous HM pollutants, highlighting low-cost and environmentally friendly approaches. The current work illustrates that biochar, a renewable solution, gives a sustainable approach to clean water, supporting multiple co-benefits in regard to the sustainable ecosystem and environment quality. The insights gained from the current potential provide a valuable foundation for local governments and organizations to launch initiatives and endorse targeted plans concerning safe water and environmental conservation, particularly in developing nations.
