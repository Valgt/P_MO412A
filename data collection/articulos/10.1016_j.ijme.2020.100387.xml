               <ce:para id="p0010" view="all">The second Responsible Management Education (RME) Special Issue follows the PRME 10th Anniversary IJME Special Issue launched at the 2017 PRME Global Forum. This Special Issue was launched at the <ce:bold>5</ce:bold>th <ce:bold>Responsible Management Education Research (RMER) Conference:</ce:bold> Responsible Leadership in Times of Transformation in November 2018 in Cologne, Germany.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0015" view="all">The idea of the RMER conferences developed in 2012, following the Rio+20 Earth Summit and PRME Global Forum which at that time had grown to over 600 signatories worldwide. Pioneering individuals had already foreseen the need to find a suitable organizational structure to accommodate this expansion by building a self-organizing ‘network of networks’. Core outcomes of the forum had been to inaugurate regional PRME chapters (with the founding of its first three PRME Chapters, i.e. the UK &amp; Ireland, DACH (Germany/Austria/Switzerland), and Brazil and further enhance already established working groups in order to enhance bottom-up connection between members at local and regional levels, and to instil self-lead grassroots initiatives for RME.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0020" view="all">The idea to create a global community gathering for researchers in RME by connecting the DACH chapter (led by Lutz Schlange) with the PRME Working Group on Poverty (led by Milenko Gudić) resulted in the First International RME Research (RMER) conference in Chur in November 2014, entitled “<ce:italic>The Future of Responsible Management Education</ce:italic>”. The event turned into a huge success, involving around 180 participants representing signatories and individuals from all corners of the PRME global network and beyond. While confirming the need of the RME community for staging outlets where delegates could present and discuss RME research issues, challenges and outputs, in order to explore how best to address the complex and interconnected issues related to sustainable development, the event created also an interest from other parts of the world to host future conferences.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0025" view="all">As a result, the initiators of the conference developed a model in which future events rotate between the DACH region and other regions where the members of the Anti-poverty WG are represented. Following this, the 2nd RMER conference on <ce:italic>Inclusive Business</ce:italic> was held in Cairo, Egypt in 2015, while the topic of the 3rd RMER event, which took place in Krems, Austria in 2016 was <ce:italic>Linking SDGs and RME at Universities</ce:italic>. The general theme of the 4th RMER Conference, held in 2017 in Curitiba, Brazil was <ce:italic>New Research Questions for RME and Advancement of the SDGs</ce:italic>, while the 5th RMER event (led by Monika Kolb and René Schmidpeter) event that took place in Cologne, Germany in 2018 focused on the theme of <ce:italic>Leadership Development for Advancing the Implementation of SDGs</ce:italic>.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0030" view="all">The 5th RMER programme included PRME Working Groups and Chapters Activities as well as 42 accepted papers and 18 Open Engagement Workshops representing contributions from 20 countries across 5 continents. This highlights the international nature of the responsible management movement. A quarter of all contributions were set up in a co-creative and interactive manner to involve the whole community and enabled joint value creation.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0035" view="all">All contributions were organized along the following seven tracks; 1. Responsible Management Education for SDG 1 Poverty Alleviation, 2. Teaching on SDGs and Student's Views, 3. Leadership Development Papers &amp; Roundtables, 4. Leadership Development Workshops, 5. Translating SDGs into Business and Educational Practice, 6. General Issues in Business Practice and Climate Change Education.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0040" view="all">This represented the strong orientation of the RME agenda to the SDG's. With a special focus on SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) which is also reflected by the PRME Working groups on Anti-Poverty (led by Milenko Gudić, Al Rosenbloom and Carole Parkes) and Climate Change &amp; the Environment (led by Petra Molten-Hill and Alex Hope). The conference offered a highly interactive and collaborative atmosphere of like-minded people who share their passion for RME and want to develop students to create sustainable value for a globally inclusive economy and to take on responsibility.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0045" view="all">The conference connected a wide and international array of academic and practitioner communities to discuss and create ideas, share good practice, and present research outcomes in the area of Responsible Management Education. A strong element of the program was the inclusion of students presenting posters, open engagement workshops and a video contest called #PRME4us. Over 80 students in 26 submissions from nine countries addressed why RME is so important and how they think it should happen.</ce:para>
               <ce:para id="p0050" view="all">This Special Issue was launched at the 5th Responsible Management Education Research (RMER) Conference in Cologne and as editors it has been good to see many of the papers that have come through the review process and are included here, reflect the growing interest and promising future for RME as an academic movement actively working to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The Special Issue is being brought together in early 2020, a decade away from 2030 but the agenda has never been more urgent. The coming years have been named as a Decade for Action by the UN and the RME community continue to commit to contributing to achieving the SDGs within their institutions, regions and working groups.</ce:para>
