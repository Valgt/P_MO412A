                  Localising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is often associated with the act of localising goals, targets and indicators, as well as the activities to measure and monitor progress. However, local communities worldwide are starting to engage with the SDGs by other means, for example, by incorporating the SDGs into local governance. In these efforts to make the SDGs part of an existing local governance process, which we call SDG engagement, the SDGs can be valued differently. They can be valued for their potential to support a widespread and fundamental change in society (the SDG transformative potential) or for their moderate addition to ongoing practices and activities (the SDG conventional value). Currently, how local governments can engage with the SDGs in different local governance activities is underexplored. This study introduces eight modes through which local governments can engage with the SDGs in local governance and discuss the unique transformative potential of those engagements via synthesising knowledge across 14 empirical studies of local communities in Australia. Building on the findings of this study, we propose a framework to aid SDG engagement in local governance activities, highlighting the transformative potential of the engagements. The study highlights the need for future explorations on the opportunities to enact a deliberate and more ambitious transformation driven by governance institutions.

Localising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is often associated with the act of localising goals, targets and indicators, as well as the activities to measure and monitor progress. However, local communities worldwide are starting to engage with the SDGs by other means, for example, by incorporating the SDGs into local governance. In these efforts to make the SDGs part of an existing local governance process, which we call SDG engagement , the SDGs can be valued differently. They can be valued for their potential to support a widespread and fundamental change in society (the SDG transformative potential) or for their moderate addition to ongoing practices and activities (the SDG conventional value). Currently, how local governments can engage with the SDGs in different local governance activities is underexplored. This study introduces eight modes through which local governments can engage with the SDGs in local governance and discuss the unique transformative potential of those engagements via synthesising knowledge across 14 empirical studies of local communities in Australia. Building on the findings of this study, we propose a framework to aid SDG engagement in local governance activities, highlighting the transformative potential of the engagements. The study highlights the need for future explorations on the opportunities to enact a deliberate and more ambitious transformation driven by governance institutions.

To meet the Agenda’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), targets and progress across multiple levels of society must be consistent (Gil et al., 2019 ). Ensuring such consistency requires a consolidated effort from national, regional and local actors. Against this backdrop, the local level has been recognised as an important arena for achieving the SDGs (Moallemi et al., 2019, Moallemi et al., 2020, Salvia et al., 2019, Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Recognising that the SDGs are relevant to assist local sustainability actions and consolidate local-to-global sustainability efforts, many local governments worldwide have taken the initiative to progress the SDGs at the local level through various actions. These actions are often discussed under the catch-all term ‘SDG localisation’, which loosely refers to the act of bringing the SDGs agenda to the local level (Oosterhof, 2018 ). It is often overlooked that this umbrella term accommodates different perspectives on localising the SDGs. A dominant perspective within this term is localising global targets and indicators, where local progress is intended to be analysed overtime, compared against and aligned with efforts at other scales (see, for example (Bandari et al., 2022; Patole, 2018; Sterling et al., 2020; Szetey et al., 2021; Oosterhof, 2018 ). This can be seen, for example, in the roadmap for localising the SDGs proposed by the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments, UNDP and UN-Habitat, where localising the SDGs is defined as “…taking into account subnational contexts in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, from the setting of goals and targets, to determining the means of implementation and using indicators that measure and monitor progress” (Global Taskforce on Local and Regional Government, 2016 ). In this perspective, localising the SDGs is to be enacted through four key steps: awareness, advocacy, implementation and monitoring. This approach has been adopted by many local and regional governments and is manifested in Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) (Fox and Macleod, 2021, UCLG, 2018 ). Though there are elements of operationalising SDGs implementation, this perspective emphasises the act of measuring, monitoring, and reporting on local progress. A less-prominent perspective in localising the SDGs is engaging the SDGs through local governance. Local governance here refers to the patterns at the local level that emulate the purposeful efforts to guide, steer, and manage the activities of social, political, and administrative actors (Jordan, 2008; Kooiman, 2003; Rosenau et al., 1992 ). The body of literature that discusses localising the SDGs from this perspective is growing. There are empirical cases that describe the experience of local governments engaging with the SDGs in governance activities beyond monitoring and reporting on local progress. Examples include Bristol City (UK) embedding the SDGs with the city's spatial development and COVID-19 recovery plan (Fox and Macleod, 2021 ), Cape Town (South Africa) linking the SDGs to ongoing urban resilience strategies (Croese et al., 2020 ), Kisumu City drawing on the SDGs (Kenya) in their integrated development plan (Croese et al., 2020 ), and the integration of SDGs into the local strategic planning process in Växjö municipality (Krantz and Gustafsson, 2021 ) (Sweden). These experiences are still scattered in individual case studies and are yet to be synthesised. Other literature from this perspective includes the analysis of conducive local governance systems for achieving the SDGs (Morita et al., 2020 ) and the call for participatory and inclusive governance in realising the SDGs at the local level, as seen in the proposed agenda of the Local Agenda 2030 (Moallemi et al., 2019 ). We argue that there is a need to chart the different processes of working with the SDGs through governance at the local level, specifically the different modes in which local governance actors engage with the SDGs. The SDGs are not only a set of global goals and targets to measure local progress. Embedded in them are normative aspects that can shape local priorities, affect power dynamics, influence resource distributions, and build narratives that affect local actors' thinking and communication processes (Fisher and Fukuda-Parr, 2019 ), all of which can have a steering effect to enact transformative changes within the SDGs agenda (Ordóñez Llanos et al., 2022 ). Given this background, SDG engagement in local governance is the focus of this research. In this study, we propose the term ‘SDG engagement’ to illustrate the deliberate arrangement of making the SDGs a part of an existing local governance process and differentiate it from the broad term ‘localising the SDGs’. To guide local actors in SDG engagement, specifically local governments as one of the key actors, we need to synthesise knowledge from current experiences of SDG engagement in local governance and develop a conceptual framework to approach the subject. Therefore, the first question that we ask in this research is How do local governance actors (local government officers and council members) engage with the SDGs in local governance activities?  Beyond recognising the different modes of SDG engagement in local governance, we are also aware that the SDGs could present different values as a global framework for local governance actors. As a non-binding framework, the SDGs leave much freedom for local governance actors to interpret the value of the framework and implement the goals (Biermann et al., 2017 ). There are indications that the value of SDGs goes as far as they can legitimise planned activities (Günzel-Jensen et al., 2020, Scheyvens et al., 2016 ) and reinforce local governments’ own interests and practices (Horn and Grugel, 2018 ). However, the SDGs can also be valued according to their transformative potential, that is, their capacity to enable fundamental change in a system (Birney, 2021, Moallemi et al., 2022 ). The SDGs can promote a more systemic view of governing sustainability locally (Boas et al., 2016, Weitz et al., 2018 ), thus breaking the mould of siloed actions (Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). Their uniquely comprehensive set of universal goals can also draw interest from a broader set of local actors to take action (Persson et al., 2016 ), thereby enhancing social learning and innovation toward sustainability (Hajer et al., 2015 ). Therefore, the second question we ask in this study is How does the difference in how the SDGs are valued shape the SDG engagement in local governance?  To address the research questions, this study specifically looks at SDG engagement from experiences in Australia’s local governance. Australia provides a unique context where there is an urgency to accelerate SDG action in critical areas such as responsible consumption and production, climate action, and inequality (Allen et al., 2019 ), but a consolidated local-focussed SDG action is missing due to the current federal government’s minimum-interference approach to the SDGs (ALGA, 2019 ). Against this backdrop, Australian local governments are taking the initiative to engage with the SDGs through different means and processes. Hence, the Australian context provides an opportunity to study local government engagement with the SDGs with ample detail. The different processes of local SDGs actions taking place among Australian local governments can aid us with important insight to address the research questions. We do this by first developing the conceptual lens that enables us to identify the modes of SDG engagement in local governance and the different ways they are valued (Section 2 ). Then, we describe the method used in this study, the source of data, and the process of data analysis (Section 3 ). In Section 4 , we present eight modes of SDG engagement in local governance activities and how each mode can manifest differently according to how local governance actors value the SDGs. Section 5  discusses the conceptual and practical implications of our findings to the current scholarly literature on SDGs and sustainability governance. In this section, we also put forward two suggestions to guide future SDG actions at the local level.  2 Conceptual background to analyse the modes of SDG engagement and their values 2.1 Analysing local governance structure This research aims to synthesise experiences of SDG engagement in Australian local governance to identify and examine the modes of engagement. For this, the study needs a conceptual framework to holistically look at local governance, including the structural components, their functions and the relations between them. We propose to use the Governance System Analysis (GSA) framework (Dale et al., 2013 ), drawing on a study with a similar research approach by Morita et al. (2020) , which discussed the effectiveness of governance system in achieving the SDGs. We take advantage of the GSA framework’s general applicability to analysing governance processes in different contexts. Given that the breadth of topics covered by the SDGs and the goal-oriented model underpinning them is unprecedented (Kanie et al., 2017 ), the GSA framework can be useful for applicability across different contexts and topics. However, it is important to point out that due to its general applicability, the GSA framework could miss unique and nuanced features in observed cases, which—if captured—can enrich the analysis of SDG engagement in local governance. Nonetheless, the GSA framework can provide an analytical lens to look at broad-based governance structures and functions required for this study. In the GSA framework, there are five activities of a governance system that can be generally applied to any theme, domain and sub-domain of governance, namely (1) Vision and objective setting (setting higher-level visions), (2) Analysis (research and assessment to underpin decision making), (3) Strategy development (determining the best strategies for securing visions and strategic objectives, including an appropriate solutions mix), (4) Implementation (delivery of broader strategies), and (5) Monitoring, evaluation, and review against the original vision and objectives. In the GSA framework, the outputs of Analysis are strategic research programs and strategic links between research programs and system monitoring, while the outputs of Strategy development are strategic plans that drive program development and implementation and a balanced mix of strategic solutions. In local governance, we note that the outputs in both activities are sometimes produced simultaneously by overlapping sets of actors, as observed in a study by Gustafsson and Ivner (2018) . Thereby, we modified the GSA framework to establish the following four activities that make up a standard local governance system:• Local community visioning: activities to formulate the local community’s high-level objectives  • Analysis and decision-making: tactical activities performed by local actors to come closer to the operationalisation of the local community’s visions, including assessment, deliberation, networking, and coalition  • Operationalising strategies: actions by local actors to deliver on strategies  • Monitoring and evaluation: follow-up and review progress against the local community’s visions    Rather than forming a linear process, we consider the four activities to feed into each other in a cycle. Each component informs and shapes the succeeding; e.g. the monitoring and evaluation component also serves to reassess visions and revisit strategies. In this study, we look into how local governance actors engage the SDGs in those four activities of local governance (Fig. 1  .), which subsequently we call ‘modes of engagement’. Fig. 2  .  2.2 The values of SDGs The current literature suggests that the SDGs present different values as a global framework for local governance actors. As discussed in current literature (see, for example, Hajer et al. (2015) ), the SDGs have the potential to guide actions for transformation, which we understand as a widespread and fundamental change in society towards a “…different, potentially more beneficial system, whose properties reflect different social–ecological controls” (Chapin et al., 2010 ). However, the impetus for transformation in the SDGs is not carried by the goal setting alone but also by the imperatives of integrated, systemic sustainability actions embedded in the whole agenda (Norström et al., 2014, Scoones et al., 2020 ). In this study, we understand the transformative potential of the SDGs in local governance as the value of the SDGs that give local governance actors the support and capacity to imagine, enact, and sustain a transformed world through their participation in governance activities. Acknowledging that there is a rich body of literature on transformations and transformative potentials, for example in complex system thinking (see Birney (2021) and Meadows (1999) ) and in socio-ecological systems (SESs) (see Olsson et al. (2004) and Moore et al. (2014) ), we decide to draw from the approach to transformative potential that focusses on individual and institutional capacities as proposed by Vogel and O’Brien (2022) . In this approach, the SDG transformative potential of the SDGs influence individuals and institutions in local governance to go ‘above, across and beyond current ways of being and doing’ (Vogel and O’Brien, 2022 ). The influence manifests in three ways: transdisciplinary (taking diverse knowledge seriously), transgressive (going against the grain), and transcendent (looking at  beliefs and paradigms instead of through  them). The SDGs are said to be taken for their transformative potential when they influence local governance actors to include diverse knowledge, disrupt current ways of doing things, and develop new ways of perceiving the world in local governance activities. However, as briefly mentioned in the introduction, the SDGs—and the values they carry—are subject to multiple interpretations due to their non-binding nature and the breadth of topics they cover. Therefore, the SDGs could be engaged in local governance activities without necessarily influencing individuals and institutions to go above, across and beyond current ways of being and doing. In this way, local government actors are engaging with the SDGs because they consider SDGs an agenda that adds value to ongoing practices and activities. Examples include improvements to routines, expansion of remit, legitimising current agenda, and strengthening current ways of coordinating actions. In this case, local governments value the SDGs according to the conventional use of the SDGs instead of what the agenda is capable of enacting (i.e. the transformative potential). Therefore, we call it the conventional value of SDG engagement in local governance.   3 Methods 3.1 Case selection and participants selection An exploratory qualitative approach was employed for this study because it helps researchers delve into the structure of a phenomenon that becomes the research subject, namely SDG engagements in local governance from the bottom up and their transformative potential. A multiple case study design (Yin, 2003 ) is appropriate for examining a phenomenon of concern (SDG engagement in local governance) in various contexts. While we acknowledge that the term 'local' and 'local communities within the SDGs discourse are used quite broadly, we limit the scope of this study to local communities as administrative units such as cities, municipalities, and townships. During the conduct of the study, there was no reliable database that compiles Australian cities, municipalities, and townships’ engagement with the SDGs that we can use to select units of analysis for this study. Therefore, we employed the following selection process. First, we carried out an initial search using Google in English with the keywords 'local government Australia SDGs'. The keyword ‘local government’ in the initial search was chosen for practical reasons since local governments were typically the key agent in initiating activities in local governance (Evans et al., 2006 ), and public records on local governance activities were often released by local governments. The initial search showed several articles and local government websites stating that they officially engage with the SDGs, notably manifested in the cities, municipalities, and townships’ community strategic plan. A community strategic plan is a mandatory document owned by all Australian local governments which describes local issues and the community’s vision to shape their future, typically developed through an extensive community consultation process (Tan and Artist, 2013 ). Therefore, to find more results, a follow-up search was performed with the keyword ‘Australia community strategic plan SDGs', which elicited several additional results. Since these were official documents from local governments, we used local governments as the unit of cases for this study. It is important to clarify that activities in local governance are made up of relations between a wide array of formal and informal actors (see Section 1 ). In this study, local governments thus serve as a modifier that approximates the activities within local governance. All searches were performed until no new local governments were identified, resulting in 18 cities, municipalities, and townships mentioning their engagement with the SDGs in one or more strategic documents. The name and availability of strategic documents in Australian local governments differ across state jurisdictions, but the standard ones are Strategic Plan , which outlines the community’s long-term vision and sets the contexts and priorities for an action plan; Action Plan , which local government’s activities which can achieve the community’s vision, Resourcing Plan , which details the budget, assets, and labour required to deliver on action plans, and Land Use Plan , which is the legal mechanism to regulate local land use (Tan and Artist, 2013 ). We read 51 publicly available documents from these local governments that mention the SDGs, including all of the Plans mentioned above, as well as media releases, periodical reports, minutes of council meetings, webpages, and other relevant documents (for a complete list of the documents, see Appendix A). Even though the documents gave an initial idea of the broad engagement with the SDGs, they did not capture the extent to which local governance actors engage with the SDGs and the process behind it. To capture this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with local government members who have/had the experience and knowledge of their community's engagement with the SDGs. Local government members in Australia comprise two elements; the political and decision-making element consisting of elected members (‘councillors’, collectively referred to as the Council), and the administrative element made of professional staff (or ‘officers’) with delegated authority (Bryant and Thomson, 2021 ). Officers carry out their responsibilities in response to decisions made by the Council while at the same time providing recommendations that influence Council’s decisions. Since both form an interplay that constitutes elements of local governance, both can provide unique perspectives on SDG engagement in local governance. Thus, the interview was targeted to comprise both perspectives whenever possible. Interview participants were chosen for their familiarity with the SDG engagement process and the community's sustainability efforts. The interviews were conducted via phone and video from August to October 2021. We centred the interviews around two main questions related to the objective of the studies: 1) In which activities of local governance do local governance actors engage with the SDG? and 2) What is the process behind their engagements with the SDGs? Additionally, we reviewed secondary documents referred by participants during the interview or discovered after interviews.  3.2 Source of data We interviewed 22 participants from 14 local governments. Fig. 3   illustrates the distribution of local governments included in this study with their IDs described in Table 1  . From the distribution, we can see that local governments who engage with the SDGs are still concentrated in major urban or peri -urban areas, even though some of them include areas that are considered ‘regional’. The state jurisdiction, number and type of participants interviewed, and documents reviewed in each case are detailed in Table 1 . A complete list of contexts for each studied case is available in Appendix A.  3.3 Data analysis We employed qualitative content analysis (Miles and Huberman, 1994 ) with the following steps. Firstly, the interviews were transcribed verbatim and double-checked for accuracy. We then manually read the transcripts and documents of each case and performed two rounds of the coding process. The first coding was conducted in an exploratory fashion to identify three major themes: a) The general context of the cases that were relevant to local governance process (e.g., location, local sustainability issues), b) How the SDGs were engaged in local governance activities, and c) The process behind the engagement with the SDGs. The result of this coding process assisted us in grasping the general narrative for each of the cases’ SDG engagement, the process behind it, and the context within which the engagement was situated. In this process, the GSA framework (see Section 2 ) provided a structure to identify the SDG engagement in each studied case and organise the findings. In the second coding process, we re-read all transcripts and documents to inductively developed a codebook to identify subthemes from themes b and c, whose results were aimed to address the research questions. While we used NVivo software to assist with data organisation throughout the coding process, the identification of subthemes was based on qualitative content analysis in the manual reading. The general narrative from the first round of coding assisted us to understand the contents better and examine statements in their appropriate context. From theme b, we identified eight SDG engagements among the studied cases. From theme c, we identified six major conditions that affect the SDG engagement process across all cases. Using the two concepts outlined in Section 2 , we elaborate our analysis of the eight modes of SDG engagement and the six conditions, building an empirically-informed discussion that will ultimately respond to the research questions.   4 Results 4.1 SDG engagement in local governance across the studied cases The findings showed that the SDGs were engaged in various ways. All studied cases engaged with the SDG framework in their local community visioning activities, reflected in formal adoption or references to the SDGs in the community strategic plan documents. Nine cases [LG 1, LG 2, LG 5, LG 6, LG 8, LG 9, LG 11, LG 12, LG 14] engaged with the SDG framework during analysis and decision-making activities. Ten cases engaged with the SDG framework in operationalising sustainability strategies [LG 1, LG 2, LG 4, LG 6, LG 7, LG 8, LG 10, LG 11, LG 12, LG 14], and nine cases engaged with the SDGs in monitoring and evaluation activities [LG 1, LG 3, LG 6, LG 7, LG 8, LG 11, LG 12, LG 13, LG 14]. A full summary of SDG engagements across the cases and the process behind them is available in Appendix B.  4.2 Eight modes of SDG engagement in local governance In total, there are eight modes in which local governments are engaging with the SDGs: 1) connecting local to global priorities, 2) assisting the community to shape a long-term vision, 3) shaping analysis and informing decision-making, 4) helping local actors to integrate sectoral issues, 5) fostering connections between stakeholders to operationalise strategies, 6) supporting cross-scale advocacy, 7) helping to track and communicate progress in monitoring and evaluation, and 8) assisting with consolidating local-to-global progress. Table 2   summarises the eight modes of SDG engagement and the cases where the modes are identified. 1) In connecting local to global priorities , the SDGs serve as a framework to contextualise local aspirations within the broader global sustainability ambitions. In some cases, the global aspirations represented in the SDGs were regarded as 'higher purposes' beyond the local boundaries, thus lending a sort of hierarchical legitimacy to the community vision.“…having them (the SDGs) there really gives the sort of a strong framework for us to kind of connect our own communities (to global)” [LG 2, Council member (C)1].   2) In assisting local communities with a long-term vision , the SDGs framework helped expand the community's aspirations beyond what they locally experience and desire in the short term. An example is LG12, where SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) was used to elaborate the community's vision of being a low-waste and circular economy community. 3) Participants in the cases drew from the SDG framework and its goals, targets, and indicators to shape analysis and inform decision-making  (either department-specific decisions or organisation-wide decisions). The SDGs were used to elevate assessment results [LG 11], moderate decisions related to budget and operations [LG 6, LG 8, LG 14], and reconfigure local assessment processes and mechanisms [LG 1, LG 4].“…(we) have many conversations where we are pulling out where decision making might be inconsistent with the SDGs, using it as a tool…to moderate our behaviour in a certain direction.” [LG 8, C1]   4) The SDGs were also used to integrate sectoral issues  during strategy development. The idea of interlinkages between goals and targets in the SDGs was used as a starting point and guidance for cross-departmental and cross-sectoral strategies [LG 2, LG 5, LG 6, LG 9, LG 11, LG 14]. Beyond that, local governments in the study developed a new local integrated sustainability plan drawing from the SDGs [LG 6, LG 8, LG 14], attempting to break away from the siloed sustainability strategy observed in the history of Australian local governments. Sustainability issues were still compartmentalised into specific departments, resulting in siloed strategies. Some cases reported not having an integrated sustainability strategic plan before the SDG engagement, and the SDGs helped catalysed the integration process.“…there were a lot of strategic documents all over the place, but very few of them talked to each other… we wanted to be able to make sure that sustainability was embedded into how we did business and how we engaged with the community.” [LG 11, O(Officer)1]   5) In fostering connections between stakeholders to operationalise strategies , the SDGs were used as a common language to expand cross-departmental coordination [LG 5, LG 10] primarily related to budget, workforce, and expertise.“…local government …was quite compartmentalised; sustainability here, land use planning is there, none of it really talked to each other …it was a lot of discussions to recognise that they should talk to each other” [LG 11, O1]  Beyond that, the SDGs were used as the basis for new intermediating roles within and beyond local government to coordinate sustainability projects under the banner of the SDGs [LG 7, LG 8, LG 11, LG 14]. This intermediating role could be in the form of SDGs-focussed sustainability officers [LG 7, LG 14] or SDGs committee [LG 11].“We hosted a stakeholder workshop which brought together a whole range of different organisations to kind of discuss …the SDGs … (and the) action groups around each of the goals, which focus on deliverable projects that can be achieved through collaboration …(and) partner in knowledge” [LG 8, O1]   6) The SDGs were used as a language to advocate for policy changes  at the state and federal levels where key strategies to achieve local community vision were outside of the local government’s authority. Some participants in cases [LG 4, LG 7, LG 8, LG 11] suggested that there are locally-prioritised SDG goals whose achievements depend on federal and state-level policies, particularly on issues such as climate change mitigation and housing. Where local governments could not support the SDGs’ achievement through projects, local policies, and service delivery, they used alternative means such as advocating policy changes at the state and federal levels. The SDGs could notably be used as the context and justification to support their causes in advocating for policy changes [LG 1, LG 6, LG 11]. In some cases, local governments drew from the SDGs framework, metrics, and global data to build the case for their advocacy agenda. The SDGs were included in materials for advocacy works, such as submissions to state and federal governments. The SDGs helped form a global narrative around the specific issues the local communities were advocating, thus serving as a tool to showcase the community’s perspective.“The benefit of being able to have …a plan and using the SDGs is that we had a really solid kind of document …also research and workshops …community input to say ' This is what we would prefer that you prioritise for our town rather than the other way around' ….” [LG 4, O1]  “… we have taken this approach to actually get ourselves ready so that when there is a new mine coming …we will have the biodiversity data. Furthermore, if they say (they) want to go here, we can say, 'Well, no, you cannot do that because (what is stated through the data)” [LG 11, C1]   7) The SDGs were utilised to track and communicate progress . The SDG goals were used to showcase local governments’ alignment with the global agenda [LG 6, LG 7, LG 8, LG 11], which gave the annual report a structure and more relevance to general audiences. There were also cases where the SDGs shaped the development of key performance indicators (KPIs) of local government staff [LG 8] and incorporated them into a community reporting dashboard [LG 14].“…the SDGs frame and allow us to have a conversation about community and stretch beyond what we would have normally measured… that there is commonality and we can be compared with other local governments.” [LG 8, O1]   8) The SDGs were used as checkpoints to assist with consolidating local-to-global sustainability progress  [LG 1, LG 3, LG 6, LG 8, LG 11, LG 12, LG 13, LG 14]. In other words, through engaging with the SDG, local governments can monitor progress and compare them against other local governments and other levels of government. Even though some participants expressed their institutions’ desire to have a quantitative measurement, (i.e., measuring the environment and socio-economic progress against SDG targets and indicators) as a way to consolidate sustainability progress across multiple scales, the measurement that has been done so far are mainly qualitative (e.g., the SDGs as qualitative checkpoints to compare progress with other local communities). Looking back at the findings, we observed that the studied cases adopted various combinations of the eight modes of engagement. We analysed how the adoptions of different SDG engagement modes correspond to the study’s findings (which were informed by the GSA framework). We found that each of these modes specifically corresponds to a local governance activity in the GSA framework, summarised in Fig. 4   below.  4.3 The SDGs values shaping the modes of SDG engagement in local governance The findings suggested that not only do local governments use different modes of SDG engagement according to their local capacities and contexts, but they also interpret the modes in different ways based on their perceived values of the SDGs. Some participants in the studied cases described the SDGs as a global framework that improves ongoing practices and activities but does not necessarily reconstruct or reorganise them. The participants used the words such as link, legitimise, highlight, align,  and extend  to describe the use of the SDGs in ongoing practices and activities. In local community visioning, for example, some Australian local governments needed a systematic global framework to support the legitimacy of their local priorities.“Once we have gathered that we know what SDGs are, what the underlying indicators are and we can easily correlate them to what the community's opinion has been…what we have actually found in various kind of consultation. (W)e both actually came together… (the) SDGs are providing us that framework to legitimise what we have heard from our community and we are delivering it.” [LG 14, O1]   In analysis and decision-making, some local governments [LG 6, LG 8, LG 11, LG 14] used the SDGs to highlight the urgency of decisions made and link several strategies to make them aligned.“The Sustainable Development Goals gave us a structure. And what we did was we used that then to look at what we're already doing and try and put it into what was already (in the SDGs)” [LG 11, C1]   In operationalising strategy, some local governments [LG 1, LG 5, LG 6, LG 10, LG 11] reported that SDGs are particularly used for strengthening current ways of coordinating actions because the local governments need more strategic partners and the SDGs happen to have a strong emphasis in partnership for action.“(We see) the SDGs as…connecting across our stakeholders, particularly the business and other communities” [LG 6, O1]   The participants in those local governments suggested that they engage with the SDGs because the SDGs improve ongoing routines and practices in local governance activities, legitimise current agenda, and strengthen coordination and communication between local stakeholders. In this way, the SDGs are not seen as having the potential to disrupt current practices. At the same time, local governments also engaged with the SDGs according to their transformative potential. In local community visioning, some of the studied cases used the SDGs to reconsider community priorities beyond the local borders [LG 4, LG 8], that is, making an explicit link between community objectives and their global consequences. Beyond that, the SDGs were used to reimagine the community’s future beyond a single trajectory [LG 4, LG 6]. The community’s long-term vision considered key drivers of changes that can affect their desired future instead of outlining a single picture of an ideal future. An example is Forrest community’s Forrest and District Plan 2030 (Szetey et al., 2020 ), which outlined several key drivers of change across multiple scales and sectors which will affect the future of the community, such as the population growth in surrounding areas, global economic crisis, future technology developments, and the changing nature of working culture. The SDG engagement in this component affected the underpinning values, goals, and worldviews of actors that shape the emergent direction of their local governance process. In analysis and decision-making activities, some of the studied cases took a step further in their SDG engagement by exploring new ways of assessing and analysing local data based on the SDGs [LG 1, LG 4]. For example, in the Forrest community, the SDGs were used to identify trade-offs and synergies among SDGs goals and targets across multiple sectors, which then inform the development of future strategies. The community developed six possible futures based on the identified trade-offs and synergies; 1) sustainability in all aspects, 2) inclusive growth at the expense of the environment, 3) prosperity without growth, 4) environmentally-friendly growth in a divided community, 5) no sustainability agenda, and 6) Business as Usual (Szetey et al., 2021 ). Beyond that, the SDGs were also used to develop a new local integrated sustainability plan [LG 6, LG 8, LG 14]. In this example, expert knowledge in computational modelling is taken together with knowledge from citizens, policymakers and community organisers. In operationalising strategies, some of the local governments engage with the SDGs through creating new intermediating roles based on the SDGs [LG 7, LG 8, LG 11, LG 14] and re-patterning coordination between stakeholders around SDG action (including government agencies, businesses, NGOs, and universities) [LG 4, LG 8, LG 12], forming a set of executing actors that act based on ‘nexuses’ instead of specific sectoral issues. Aside from that, some local governments took a novel course of advocacy by using cross-scale SDGs-based analysis that provides nuanced information to other level of government [LG 4], therefore supporting their causes in advocating for policy changes. In the monitoring and evaluation component, only LG 1 had engaged the SDGs to incorporate transformative potential in local reporting and review processes. In the SDGs framework, translating global SDGs targets and indicators into local ones was considered an action that will drive transformations, primarily because it will facilitate cross-scale accountability and stimulate effective implementation and achievement of the SDGs (Persson et al., 2016 ). Though none of the studied cases except LG 1 had started a process to localise global SDGs targets and indicators for monitoring and evaluation purpose, they expressed their wishes to eventually reach that point. Some maintained a more optimistic view by seeing their SDG engagement as a staged approach where they start with institutionalising the SDGs and getting the rest of the organisation to understand how their work fits into their SDGs, before finally being able to localise the targets and indicators [LG 3, LG 8]. Some others, particularly smaller local governments, were less optimistic due to the anticipated huge commitment and resources to start that process [LG 2, LG 11, LG 14]. Overall, we observe that local governments can do several engagements with the SDGs by focusing on the SDG conventional values in some local governance activities and using the SDG transformative potential in other local activities. Singleton Council, for example, engages with the SDGs in analysis and decision-making by mainly focusing on their conventional value but leveraging the transformative potential in operationalising strategies. This reflects the variety of SDG engagements among local governments according to their local capacities, contexts, and interpretation of the SDGs’ value. Table 3   outlines some examples of the differences in actions for each mode of SDG engagement according to the way local governments value the SDGs.  4.4 Conditions influencing local engagements with the SDGs Based on the participants’ account of the SDG engagement process in their respective local governments, six conditions contribute to SDG engagement across the studied cases as follows. Sustainability champions A significant number of the studied cases start to engage with the SDGs when a local government staff(s), or sustainability ‘champions’, propose an idea of SDG engagement. Borrowing a term used by Bryant and Thomson (2021) , the SDGs champions are local government staff who actively seek ways to embed sustainability into local governance activities. In some local governments [LG 2, LG 5, LG 6, LG 12], the SDGs emerge in a strategic conversation at the local government, and the champions push forward the proposal to engage with the SDGs', subsequently acting as brokers and getting people on board with the SDGs. Some are primarily experienced and knowledgeable in the SDGs, having engaged with the framework before their appointments [LG 1, LG7, LG 8, LG 10, LG 11, LG 12, LG 14].  Supportive organisational structure While the initiative to adopt SDGs came from key individuals, whether or not the SDG engagement takes off from the initial conversation depends on the readiness of the organisation to enact the engagement. In some instances [LG 12, LG 14], a dedicated position in the leadership team for sustainability (such as Chief of Sustainability) enable a quick follow-up to devise an engagement with the SDGs. Another example is the existence of a dedicated committee overseeing sustainability work in the council for years, which became the blueprint for an SDG local committee [LG 11]. A quick institutional buy-in is also supported by an existing whole-of-council approach and ongoing cross-sectoral programs [LG 7, LG 11].  Conducive planning practice Although engaging with the SDGs is seen by participants as valuable for local governance, it is a voluntary action that demands changes in local governance arrangements. Since Australian local governments are statutory institutions, participants indicate a limit to what local government members can change in their institutions’ current arrangement. Modes of engagement supported by existing planning and policymaking practices, such as legally-required action for local governments, can be the quickest first step for SDG engagement in local governance. Australian state governments require local governments to have a community strategic plan which has become one of the most feasible avenues for local governments to engage with the SDGs.  Strategic network and partnership While the existence of key individuals and the organisation's readiness formed the foundation of initial SDG engagement, further SDG engagement was supported by strategic networks and partnerships. SDG-related projects were particularly organised around multi-stakeholder partnerships involving government agencies, state-owned and private companies, civil society organisations, and universities. Partnerships with universities were a key driver in several processes leading to SDG local action [LG 1, LG 4, LG 7, LG 8, LG 14]. In some instances, the SDGs ‘champions' fostered these strategic partnerships and played a role in initiating the engagement [LG 1, LG 7, LG 14].  Sustainability issues as a local priority In local governments whose communities are generally more concerned about sustainability issues, new institutional changes and arrangements to engage with the SDGs are more feasible to execute [LG 2, LG3, LG 4, LG 8, LG 11]. Some communities engaged with the SDGs more quickly because they were already experiencing social and environmental issues that impacted their livelihoods, such as bushfires, storms, and floods; thus, they were urged to take bolder sustainability actions. In some instances, local governments have already engaged with other global agendas that incorporate sustainability, such as the New Urban Agenda, and further cemented their commitment by engaging with the SDGs [LG 8].  Availability of resources As a public institution with a periodically-planned budget, voluntarily engaging with a global sustainability agenda entails stretching available resources or obtaining extra resources [LG 2, LG 10, LG 11]. Stretching available resources to fit into new SDG engagement involves personal lobbying and collaboration among local government officers to share budgets and lend manpower [LG 7, LG 10]. More significant financial resources and expertise can be obtained mainly through external partnerships with the private sector, NGOs, and universities [LG 1, LG 3, LG 4, LG 6].    5 Discussion 5.1 Conceptual implications of the findings “The findings of this study have several conceptual implications. Firstly, it increases our conceptual understanding of SDG engagement in local governance beyond monitoring and reporting on local progress. Through the eight modes of SDG engagement, this study revealed the variety in which local governments can engage with the SDGs in the four activities of local governance. While some SDG engagements were conventional, others had transformative potential, as indicated by how they influence local governance actors to incorporate diverse knowledge (thus being transdisciplinary), overstep boundaries to change current ways of doing things (thus being transgressive), and re-evaluate their ways of seeing things (thus being transcendent) as showcased in Table 3 . The findings in this paper can also address the scholarly discussion on the limited evidence of the SDG transformative impact. An analysis of more than 3,000 scientific studies by Biermann et al. (2022)  suggested the SDGs have minimal impacts from the local to global level on the re-alignment of institutions, reallocation of funding and the enactment of more ambitious projects and policies needed for meaningful changes. While some impacts are evident, they are limited and incremental. The findings in this paper add to this discussion by providing some evidence of the SDGs’ impact on local governance. Indeed, consistent with findings from the literature, the SDGs are used based on their conventional values for local governance actors, including improvements to routines, expansion of remit, legitimising current agenda, and strengthening current ways of coordinating actions. At best, they create incremental impact, but in less desirable scenarios, the SDGs may serve as a red herring for unsustainable practices. However, we also found evidence of local governance actors valuing the SDGs’ transformative potential in local governance. Given this evidence, rather than responding to the current evidence pessimistically, we propose that the flexibility, multi-interpretative and non-binding aspects of the SDGs are two sides of the same coin; they give room for conventional valuation for local governance actors but also provide space for them to experiment with the transformative potential of the global agenda in local governance activities. Beyond that, we suggest that it is not enough to hope that the incremental impacts of the SDGs in governance—at all levels but especially local—will pick up speed in the coming years. A deliberate and more ambitious transformation driven by governance institutions is needed to break the pathological path dependencies that undermine the thriving of human and ecological systems (Dryzek and Pickering, 2018 ). This requires governance institutions, including local governance, to actively navigate changes above and beyond the current efforts. Indeed, some of the current literature on environmental governance suggests that incrementalism is inevitable in the context of local actions due to their limited capacity to drive fundamental change and their persistent willingness to adapt at the margin (Matyas and Pelling, 2015 ). However, on a more optimistic note, other scholars suggested the potential to situate incremental changes within a transformative agenda (Pelling et al., 2015, Weiss and Woodhouse, 1992 ) and have proposed notions such as ‘enabling small in-depth wins for continuous transformational changes’ (Termeer et al., 2017 ), ‘radical incremental transformations’ (Göpel, 2016 ), and ‘directed instead of disjointed incrementalism’ (Grunwald, 2007 ). Underpinned by the above discussion and building on the findings of this study, we propose an explanatory framework to aid local governments to engage with the SDGs, taking notes of the transformative potential that may be incorporated into the engagements (Fig. 5  ). We acknowledge that each local governance is uniquely structured and has its own process to engage with a global agenda (Croese et al., 2021, Keen et al., 2018, Ningrum et al., 2022, Wong-Parodi et al., 2016 ). From this study alone, it is impossible to specify which conditions were more influential for SDG engagement in certain local governance aspects and which ones played a bigger role to have SDG engagement with transformative potential. Rather than as a fixed blueprint that dictates the way SDGs could be engaged in local governance, the framework is intended to be the initial building block for actors to identify what conditions they can utilise to start the SDG engagement process, where in local governance structure SDG engagement can take place, and how the SDGs’ transformative potential can be exploited in those engagements. Beyond being an explanatory framework to aid local governments to engage with the SDGs, the framework and the discussion put forward by this study can be a potential boundary object between the (different bodies of) literature on transformation and literature on the governance of SDGs. For example, the framework and discussion of this study can further the conversation between scholarly works of transformation in the literature of systems thinking and the SDGs, particularly through SDG engagement in local governance. There are some pioneering studies that engage with both the topic of local governance and the scholarly work of transformation in systems thinking, such as the study by Bryant and Thomson (2021)  that discusses learning as a key leverage point of sustainability in the local government of Perth in Australia, but they are not explicitly in the context of the SDGs. We suggest that there is potential for further investigation on how the SDGs expand or limit these transformation levers in local governance. Indeed, bridging the conversation between different bodies of literature is a challenging and highly ambitious task. This study alone could not and would not accomplish such a task, but it may contribute to putting forward the urgency and potential space for it.  5.2 Practical implications of the findings At the practical level, the framework can be a guide for actions; first, for local governments who want to expand on the idea to engage with the SDGs according to their current capacities and contexts, and second for other actors who interact with local governments and are interested in making the transformation agenda more deliberate in SDG governance, such as state and national government, higher education institutions, businesses, and civil society organisations. In applying the framework, we highlight two key practical suggestions:1) Discourse about the value of the SDGs in local governance, i.e. in what way they can support or limit transformational changes, should be more explicit and deliberate, especially in six key conditions responsible to drive and enhance the SDG engagement process (as outlined in section 4.4 ). The SDGs champions can be encouraged and facilitated to learn about transformation and engage in reflexive learning on the SDGs as an agenda. Partnerships and regional networks can be better designed as a peer learning environment for transformative practices in local SDG engagement where experience can be shared and modified across different contexts. Organisational structure and planning practice can be designed to be more flexible and accommodative for changes, especially those that require ‘going against the grain’ in the spirit of transformation. Local resources, including financial and technical resources, should be more reliable to support disruptive practices and innovations in local governance. Finally, local priorities can be made to reflect the spirit of transformation more explicitly.  2) There should be a stronger joint commitment to value process in enacting transformations through the SDGs. This requires all elements of society involved to have a commitment to processual changes—such as improved trust between local government and communities, growing openness among local government staff to innovative forms of partnerships, or increased reflexivity in projects planning and implementation—knowing that those changes may not always be measurable. Alternatively, there should be more initiative to cultivate innovative ways of measuring and monitoring those processual changes as ‘progress’. However, this requires dealing with the politics and power-laden dynamics between various actors involved in local governance due to differences in their perception and valuation of processes.”      6 Conclusion At the beginning of this paper, we set out the urgency to understand better the current efforts of local governments in making the SDGs a part of an existing local governance process, which we term SDG engagement. Through this study, we aim to elucidate the concept of ‘SDG localisation’ which—despite its evolving function in illustrating different processes of realising the SDGs at the local level—still give prominence to the monitoring and reporting activity of localised global goals and indicators. In this study, we also investigated how the SDGs could present different values as a global framework for local governance actors, specifically the conventional value and the transformative potential. Through exploring the experiences of Australian local governments, we presented eight modes through which local governments can engage with the SDGs in local governance activities and six conditions that support SDG engagement. We also described how the SDG engagement modes could be valued conventionally or with transformative potential. Although the findings of this study were drawn from the Australian context, the conceptual framework developed can be used as a lens to analyse SDG engagement beyond Australia, specifically for countries where SDGs implementation has been similarly slow, or with no clear strategy for localisation (Bilsky et al., 2021 ). As mentioned, the scholarly works on this topic are still preliminary and need further exploration. Hence, we position this study as the building block for further inquiries into SDG engagement, including how the framework can be improved by considering different geographical, social and political contexts. In the discussion section, we positioned the findings of our study within the evolving discussion on the SDGs’ impact on governance and as a mode of governance (Biermann et al., 2022, Kanie and Biermann, 2017 ). Though our study demonstrated the incremental impacts of the SDGs as those literature have identified, we maintained that there is evidence of—and thus opportunities for—local governments experimenting with the transformative potential of the global agenda in local governance activities. Moving forwards, we can exploit these opportunities to enact a deliberate and more ambitious transformation driven by governance institutions. To do so, we propose an explanatory framework to aid local governments to engage with the SDGs. This study has several limitations. First, as the SDG local engagements are not yet comprehensively documented, there could be other local governments in Australia who have engaged with the SDGs that we are not aware of. There could also be non-local governments actor that initiate SDG engagement in local governance process in Australia, though they have not been well-documented so far. Furthermore, the limited and uneven sample size of the interviews and the uneven distribution of councillor-officers for each case might have implications for bias and failure to include other relevant issues in this study. With these limitations, our study is intended to build initial findings and stimulate future research on enacting transformation through SDG engagement in governance activities, particularly at the local level. Finally, this study focuses on identifying transformative potential in SDG engagement in an ex-ante (forward-looking) sense. Thus, the extent to which the transformative potential identified in this study yield actual changes in local governance and the broader social and environmental system needs is subject to further analysis. Finally, the focus on governance actors and institutions as agents to enact transformation requires further investigation of the challenges, limitations, and contradictions, which in the words of Dryzek and Pickering (2018) , requires dealing with the politics of governance as part of Anthropocene institutions. The tendency for incremental changes among governance institutions may be stronger than scholars have posited. To overcome this, we may need to develop governance capacities that have no precedence nor have fully demonstrated before. The task moving forward is to explore the ‘seeds’ of these capacities in current efforts and examine ways to develop them in different contexts.
