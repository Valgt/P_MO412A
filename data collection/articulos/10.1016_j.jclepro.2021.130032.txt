                  This study investigates the capacities of Iran as a developing country to attain the full meaning of sustainability and explores the achievability of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a conceptual system dynamics (SD) model. From one perspective, investigating complex systems such as sustainable development requires research methods that take into account the dynamic interdependencies among the 17 SDGs. From another perspective, although achieving SDGs are a universal agenda for all nations, the evaluation of each country's accomplishments has to be based on its national capacities and challenges in the way of implementing these goals. Therefore, as a response to this research agenda, the presented conceptual SD model of sustainable development consists of 14 causal loops that highlight the direct and indirect interdependencies among the SDGs. Moreover, based on the proposed SD model, it is concluded that not only the obstacles in the way of attaining several SDGs in Iran, namely as 1) regional conflicts and environmental concerns, 2) internal conflicts of interests among key stakeholders, 3) sanctions, and 4) absence of updated data and credible evaluation mechanism, makes it impossible for the country to reach the preordained milestones of specific SDGs, but also they would eventually affect the achievements of other goals badly. Furthermore, the presented study reveals that I) SDG 9 and SDG 17, II) SDG 8, III) SDG 12, and IV) SDG 13, SDG 14, SDG 15, respectively have the highest influence on achieving the desired behavior of the system in the context of Iran. This study provides valuable insights to the local managers in Iran in designing a set of prioritized policies for mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda into national plans and for the policymakers in other developing countries, creates a profound understanding of the systematic relationships among SDGs.

From one perspective, investigating complex systems such as sustainable development requires research methods that take into account the dynamic interdependencies among the 17 SDGs. From another perspective, although achieving SDGs are a universal agenda for all nations, the evaluation of each country's accomplishments has to be based on its national capacities and challenges in the way of implementing these goals. Therefore, as a response to this research agenda, the presented conceptual SD model of sustainable development consists of 14 causal loops that highlight the direct and indirect interdependencies among the SDGs. Moreover, based on the proposed SD model, it is concluded that not only the obstacles in the way of attaining several SDGs in Iran, namely as 1) regional conflicts and environmental concerns, 2) internal conflicts of interests among key stakeholders, 3) sanctions, and 4) absence of updated data and credible evaluation mechanism, makes it impossible for the country to reach the preordained milestones of specific SDGs, but also they would eventually affect the achievements of other goals badly. Furthermore, the presented study reveals that I) SDG 9 and SDG 17, II) SDG 8, III) SDG 12, and IV) SDG 13, SDG 14, SDG 15, respectively have the highest influence on achieving the desired behavior of the system in the context of Iran. This study provides valuable insights to the local managers in Iran in designing a set of prioritized policies for mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda into national plans and for the policymakers in other developing countries, creates a profound understanding of the systematic relationships among SDGs.   Keywords Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  2030 agenda  Developing countries  Iran  System dynamics (SD)    1 Introduction On September 25, 2015, world leaders of 193 countries joined together at the 70th General Assembly of the United Nations to acknowledge an ambitious and new agenda in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development entails 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets which introduce new measurements to fight poverty by transcending social development targets, conserve our vulnerable planet to a greater degree, lessen social and economic inequalities, advocate human rights, not to reduce hunger but to end permanently, and not to disregard inequality but jointly to destroy it (GA, 2015 ). The timely achievement of SDGs through national plans and roadmaps requires sufficient financial and non-financial means of implementation (MIO) (Bhattacharya and Ali, 2014 ; Elder et al., 2016 ; Olsen et al., 2014 ). These MIOs have been evolved through key global agreements on sustainability (including Agenda 21 in 1992  (Agenda, n.d.), the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 (Nations, 2002 ), Rio +20 in 2012 (Assembly, 2012 ), the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in 2015 (Agenda, 2015 ) and ultimately were determined as seven broader categories including I) multi-stakeholder partnerships, II) data, monitoring, and accountability, III) technology, IV) capacity building, V) finance, VI) policy and institutional coherence, and VII) trade in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development (GA, 2015 ). However, in order to implement SDGs, countries must undertake profound, thoughtful, and long-term fundamental changes in resource utilization, technologies, infrastructure, organizations, and social relations in a short time (Sachs et al., 2019 ). On the one hand, many countries have not been successful in implementing the SDGs due to several challenges, including but not limited to; the financial failure of governments and private sectors to invest in sustainable development particularly in countries with lower-income, barriers in technology transfer from developed regions to less developed regions, trade impediments that disadvantage middle and low-income countries, governmental failure of establishing long-term integrated sustainable development plans and lack of coherent partnerships, devising unconducive customized metrics, and inadequate and incompetent evaluation mechanisms (Sarvajayakesavalu, 2015 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, the 2030 Agenda consists of 17 interconnected goals which indicate that implementing each goal has inevitable effects on other goals (GA, 2015 ). Hence, unintegrated implementation efforts that address each goal separately and disregard these interactions are deemed to failure of the 2030 Agenda (Collste, 2017 ). As such, the evaluation of each country's journey towards the 2030 Agenda requires dynamic approaches that shed light on these interdependencies, assess the challenges of MIOs from an integrated perspective of global, national, and local levels, and takes into account the feedback structure of different policy interventions. No previous study has attempted to address these two concerns simultaneously by investigating the interconnectedness of the Sustainable Development Goals via a system dynamic approach and exploring the challenges in the path of achieving these goals through a case study. Therefore, to fill out this research gap, this paper presents a conceptual system dynamics model of sustainable development to i) shed light on the inevitable direct and indirect interdependencies (synergies and trade-offs) among the 17 SDGs, ii) demonstrate how the success in achieving a specific SDG facilitate/impede the success in another goal, and finally, iii) investigate the SDGs with the highest influence on the total system's behavior within the context of Iran's sustainable development case study. The presented case study evaluates the various challenges in the way of SDGs implementation in a developing country, Iran, and demonstrates how the challenges of implementing several SDGs will inevitably affect the achievements of other goals adversely, and argues that missing the interdependencies of SDGs as a socio-ecological system will inevitably result in the sustainable development failure of this nation. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows; section 2  reviews the literate regarding the integrated nature of the 2030 agenda and the SDGs implementation challenge, while section 3  explores the research framework of the presented study and overviews the system dynamics approach as the main research method for addressing the objectives of the paper. Section 4  takes a retrospective look at Iran's national plans after committing to the 2030 agenda and this country's sustainable development achievements so far through statistics, followed by presenting the conceptual System Dynamics model of sustainable development in subsection 4.3 . Subsequently, section 5  discusses and outlines Iran's future sustainable development outlook via investigating the internal and external barriers which have the highest influence on the accomplishment in or impediment to achieving SDGs in Iran. Finally, section 6  highlights the key findings of this paper and outlines the future directions of this research.  2 Literature review After the announcement of the 2030 Agenda as the integrated framework of human, social, and environmental development goals and given the significant disparities among the developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries in terms of their capacities, early critics were raised about the aspirational nature of SDGs which makes them achievable in a world called utopia (Horton, 2014 ). Given the aspirational will of the 2030 Agenda to “leave no one behind” which implies that the sustainable development goals and targets must be met for all countries and all cohorts of society (El-Zein et al., 2016 ; GA, 2015 ; Stuart and Samman, 2017 ; Weber, 2017 ), several criticisms of this global agenda are aroused. 2.1 The integrated nature of SDGs A major criticism of most of the studies on sustainable development goals is their neglect of the complex interlinkages of the SDGs in mainstreaming these universal targets into national action plans. A study argued that the existing effort and means of implementation are not sufficient to achieve the SDGs unless the interlinkages throughout I) sectors (e.g., transport, finance, energy, and agriculture), II) societal players (government agencies, local authorities, civil society, and private sector), and III) between and among high, medium, and low-income countries are taken into consideration (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Although many studies acknowledged these interactions (Greco, 2020 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Pizzi et al., 2020 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ; Vladimirova and Le Blanc, 2016 ; Weitz et al., 2014 ), little research works paid attention to quantify and model such interactions (Del et al., 2021 ; Zelinka and Amadei, 2019 ). The Sustainable Development Goals and targets are not independent and on the contrary, they generally entail interactions in the forms of synergies (whereas the accomplishment in one goal facilitates the accomplishment in another) or trade-offs (whereas the accomplishment in one goal impedes progress in another) (Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Waage et al., 2015 ). Hence, the achievements of all the SDGs and targets considerably depend on whether synergies are harnessed properly and trade-offs are approached effectively (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). For instance, the role of infrastructure, as a set of technological systems that relates humans, their communities, and the broader environment, in the sustainable development of countries has been the focus of several studies (Adshead et al., 2019 ; Chester, 2019 ; Davies et al., 2019 ; Fischer and Amekudzi, 2011 ; Fisher and Fukuda-Parr, 2019 ; Liu and Jensen, 2018 ; Morozova et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). A recent study emphasized the interlinkages of SDGs targets and reveals the direct and indirect effect of the adequacy of infrastructure, as a set of technological systems that relates humans, their communities, and the broader environment, on the achievements of all 17 SDGs and 121 out of the total number of 169 targets (Thacker et al., 2019 ). Additionally, their results indicate that each target is much more likely to be indirectly affected by an infrastructure system than directly (Thacker et al., 2019 ). In other words, the interdependencies of each SDGs with several goals of the 2030 agenda, indicates that failure in or progress towards achieving one goal has inevitable implications for other goals. Another ramification of SDGs interconnections is the discord among the environmental goals (SDGs 13,14,15) and socio-economic goals (the remaining 14 SDGs). Several studies discuss how achieving the socio-economic goals in the remaining timeframe of the 2030 Agenda will put more strain on the planetary boundaries by increasing the human ecological footprints (Griggs et al., 2013 ; Rockström et al., 2009 ). A recent study investigated the amount of which the socio-economic SDGs are attained and their burden on the success of environmental SDGs achievements through a global simulation model (Randers et al., 2020 ). Their final results demonstrated that under the scenario of business-as-usual, in which individual, corporate, national, and global decisions are made in a continuous trend of the past, socio-economic SDGs and environmental cannot be achieved together (Randers et al., 2020 ). Table 1   demonstrates recent studies on the interlinkage of sustainable development goals and targets.  2.2 The challenges of SDGs implementation Another criticism of the 2030 Agenda is the disparities among developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries in terms of the available and adequate MIOs. Mainstreaming SDGs at the national level requires profound, thoughtful, and long-term fundamental changes in resource utilization, technologies, infrastructure, organizations, and social relations that must be undertaken in each country in a short time (Sachs et al., 2019 ). In this regard, the key role of infrastructure, in achieving the sustainable development of countries has been the focus of several studies (Adshead et al., 2019 ; Chester, 2019 ; Davies et al., 2019 ; Fischer and Amekudzi, 2011 ; Fisher and Fukuda-Parr, 2019 ; Liu and Jensen, 2018 ; Morozova et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). Namely, developed countries have comparative advantages of technology advancements to support their measures towards sustainability challenges and facilitate the productivity in making the best utilities of their natural, financial, and human resources, while underdeveloped and developing countries must depend on the technology transfer from developed regions for further local needs. More specifically, these countries face various challenges in mainstreaming the SDGs into their national plans and strategies (Uneze et al., 2016 ). Another significant difference between developed and developing regions is their financial abilities to afford the achievements of SDGs. More specifically, the financial needs for sustainable development consist of I) basic human needs that pertain to hunger and poverty alleviation, education and health improvement, fostering affordable energy, and contribute to gender equality, II) national sustainable development schemes, including the monetary needs for development plans resilient to climate change, civil infrastructure advancement, pastoral development, and energy, and III) global public plans, such as the investment in the global environment conservation and addressing climate change and its ramifications (UN, 2014 ). Although determining the exact amount of financial costs to achieve sustainable development is complex due to the dependency of these estimations on the macroeconomic rules and policy environments of countries and the effective use of resources by nations, approximations on these financial needs are indicative for key decision-makers in developed and less developed countries (UN, 2014 ). To determine whether underdeveloped and developing countries can afford the SDGs, it is crucial to compare the total cost of SDGs achievements to the amount of available public finance which includes the government revenue and aid (Hoy, 2016 ). An international report addressed the financial gaps for the establishment of a satisfactory standard of living based on the national realizations, consisting of minimum income amenities, worldwide health care, and accessible quality education at the primary and secondary level, for those currently left behind. Their results shed light on the disparities between developed and developing countries in term of financial affordability by revealing that the total financial gap to address these three SDGs is approximately 84$ billion per year and 73$ billion of it belongs to low-income nations (Greenhill et al., 2015 ). Table 2   summarizes the SDGs implementation challenges based on relevant studies.   3 Methodology The presented research was carried out in two stages, namely as environmental scanning and qualitative SD modeling, for the ultimate goals of i) demonstrating the interactions (synergies and trade-offs) of 17 SDGs in a feedback manner, ii) studying how the accomplishment in a specific goal facilitate/impede the accomplishment in another, and iii) identifying the goals with the highest influence on the total system's behavior of Iran's case study. Therefore, the following subsection pertains to overviewing the system dynamics as the main research method of this study. 3.1 System dynamics: an overview of the approach System Dynamics (SD) was introduced by Jay Forrester (1958)  as a qualitative and quantitative approach (Nabavi et al., 2017 ) to the application of systemic view, to capture the interactions among components within a system (Zhang et al., 2013 ), and study the behavior of complex economic, social, managerial, economic, and ecological issues over time (Zelinka and Amadei, 2019 ). While qualitative SD pertains to identifying causal interactions among the system's components, building a network of feedback loops to explain a dynamically complex system and provide insights to managers (Kunc, 2017 ), quantitative SD concentrates on mathematically formulating and further simulating the system, using individual or participatory processes to analyze the system's behavior under various policies and scenarios (Nabavi et al., 2017 ). The necessary steps required for employing an SD approach to investigate a complex system differ slightly across the literature in terms of the number of stages and definitions. Despite these differences, the main activities of an SD modeling process involve conceptualization, formulation, testing, and implementation (Luna-reyes et al., 2003; Randers, 1980; Richardson and Pugh, 1981; Roberts et al., 1983; Sterman, 2000; Wolstenholme, 1990 ). Table 3   compares these processes throughout the literature (see Table 3 ). SD modeling approach has evolved from the conventional management techniques by acknowledging the key role system feedbacks, causal relationships, time delays, and non-linear behaviors of a system's components in defining the aggregated system behavior (Forrester, 1958 ; Sterman, 2000 ). Since the advent of SD and its initial use for industrial and business systems, the application of this approach has been extended to other fields of research, especially studies concerning sustainable development (Collste, 2017 ; Figueroa-Armijos, 2012 ; Hjorth and Bagheri, 2006 ; Zelinka and Amadei, 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2016 , 2017 ). As sustainable development necessitates action plans for achieving sustainability throughout all sectors of the economy, society, and environment simultaneously, the application of the SD method can potentially contribute to creating an understanding for managers about maintaining compatible relationships among all sub-systems (Nabavi et al., 2017 ).  3.2 Research framework The presented study was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, secondary data from various well-cited research papers were collected to identify the direct and indirect interlinkages among sustainable development goals and various challenges of a fully-fledged implementation of SDGs in countries and particularly in Iran. In the second stage, an expert panel of discussion among 8 academic scholars with multidisciplinary backgrounds was firstly conducted at the Department of Management, Science and Technology at the Amirkabir University of Technology to gather data in addition to those elicited from the previous stage regarding the synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs. Conducting a panel of discussions is a technique to collect qualitative data for conceptualizing a system dynamics model (Luna-reyes et al., 2003 ). This panel consists of i) four scholars with academic and hands-on expertise in the field of social, economic, and environmental sustainability and ii) four experts with extensive research backgrounds in the field of community planning and development. The authors of this study were responsible for guiding the panel, keeping the discussions focused on the subject matter, assuring that all the voices are heard, and finally analyzing the collected data for building the conceptual system dynamics model. Despite the various academic backgrounds of the participated experts, the synergy of their knowledge in the interdisciplinary concept of sustainability contributes extensively to present a comprehensive conceptual SD model of sustainable development. On the grounds of data extracted from the environmental scanning and panel discussion, the conceptual SD model of sustainable development is built in two steps. In the first step, the complex dynamic problem of sustainable development needs to be articulated in terms of problem definition, system boundary, and time horizon (Sterman, 2000 ). Defining the problem pertains to identifying the mechanisms necessary for achieving sustainable development and main variables and intermediate factors to clearly outline this issue (Sterman, 2000 ). Determining the boundary is another component of problem articulation which answers the question of how far in the future does the issue needs to be investigated (Sterman, 2000 ). Finally, the boundary of the system and the time horizon are required to be identified. In the second step, the dynamic hypothesis of sustainable development is formed through 3 components of constructing a network of feedback loops based on the causal relationships among variables, identifying leverage points, and finally building stock and flow diagrams (Sterman, 2000 ). Causal relationships among the system variables are shown using positive and negative polarity along with arrows for showing the direction of influence, that is, if an increase in variable x implies an increase in variable y, we have a positive influence, and so on. Then, a network of feedback loops needs to be built to convey all the existing interconnected causal relationships. Feedback loops are either i) reinforcing, where they promote long-term growth or decline, or ii) balancing, where they contract the initial force and create goal-seeking actions (Galli et al., 2019 ). Following, the leverage points, which are the variables with significant influence on the system's total behavior and can potentially contribute to achieving the desired system's performance, are identified (Kieft et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). Finally, the stock and flow diagram of the conceptual SD model is built to set grounds for mathematically formulating the model in future studies. The variables in the stock and flow diagrams are defined into three types; 1) stock or state variables which demonstrate the level of any system status at a specific time instant, 2) flow or rate variables which are respondent to the increase or decrease of the stock variables, and 3) auxiliary variables which can be calculated from other existing variables within the system (Sterman, 2000 ).   4 Case study: Iran's sustainable development This study investigates Iran's sustainable development as a case, through implementing the proposed research framework. Right after Iran's pledge to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the government initiated an examining procedure of the existing institutions. This procedure is then followed by the declaration of the National Committee for Sustainable Development's responsibility (NCSD) for further inter-ministerial coordination and responsible for reporting of all policies, actions, and plans concerning the national implementation of the SDGs (HLPF, 2017 ). Subsequently, to efficiently carry out the coordinating mechanism among various stakeholders, ministries and governmental agencies were determined as custodians of subcommittees and responsible for the one or two respective SDGs. Moreover, The Statistical Centre of Iran was assigned to provide credible statistics with the SDGs indicators to the NCSD and custodians. (HLPF, 2017 ). The NCSD extended its stakeholder networks by involving the inputs provided by the Steering Council of Sustainable Development, the Parliament, local governments and organizations, academic community, civic institutions, and the private sector for the Voluntary National Review (VNR) of SDGs achievement in 2017 (HLPF, 2017 ). Iran's efforts in promoting SDGs achievement nationally carried out with the integration of the SDGs into relevant interventions and policy makings. Such actions include the incorporation of the SDGs considerations into Iran's 6th National 5-Year Development Plan (NDP) between 2017 and 2022 (HLPF, 2017 ). Additionally, supporting national documents including the National Welfare Plans, the Resilient Economy Policies, the Health Transformation Plan, and Climate Change Plan were approved to make the national frameworks more aligned with the SDGs targets and indicators (HLPF, 2017 ). However, this country like other less-developed regions continues to struggle with challenges of poverty, hunger, health, education, inequalities, economy, infrastructure, and significant environmental deterioration. This is indeed corroborated by the 2020 SDG Index report prepared by the team of independent experts in collaboration with the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) (Sachs et al., 2020 ). Accordingly, Iran ranked 59 out of 166 countries with a total score of 71.8 out of 100 in 2020. Based on the results of their research, the scores in achieving goal 13 (Climate Action) indicate that Iran is on the wrong path. Furthermore, Iran remains inactive and has a rate under 50% of the growth rate required to attain the goals 1 (End Poverty), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) by 2030, while the country's scores in goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), 5 (Gender Equality),7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 13 (Climate action), and 14 (Life Below Water) are increasing at a rate over 50% of the needed growth rate but under the rate required to attain these SDGs by 2030. Moreover, goal numbers 4 (quality education), 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and 17 (Partnerships for the goals) scores are steady and their historical trends have remained at or over SDG attainment. It is worth mentioning that there is not enough data about the country's progress addressing goals 10 (Reduced Inequality), and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Additionally, according to the database of Asia-Pacific SDG Gateway (UN ESCAP, 2020 ), from the total of 232 SDG indicators, while 97 of the total SDGs indicators in Iran have sufficient1  1 Indicators with at least an underlying series of data with two data points or more between 2000 and 2019.   data availability (42% of the total SDGs indicators), the data on 63 of the total SDGs indicators are insufficient2  2 Indicators with an underlying series of data with at least one data point but not sufficient for historical trend estimation.   (27% of the total SDGs indicators) and there is no available data3  3 Indicators with no data for the country.   for 72 of the SDGs indicators (31% of the total SDGs indicators). Accordingly, a general outlook of Iran's profile in achieving SDGs reveal that Iran's national efforts were only successful to achieve goal 4 by 2020 and the country is on track to achieve goals 9 and 17 by 2030 (17.65% of all the goals) and the remaining goals cannot be attained by 2030 through the current national and local plans (82.35% of all the goals). Detailed information regarding Iran's achievements in SDGs is presented in Table 4  . 4.1 Conceptual system dynamics model of sustainable development Building the presented conceptual system dynamics model of sustainable development is carried out in two steps; the first step pertains to the articulation of the problem and the second step relates to forming the dynamic hypothesis (see Fig. 1 ). 4.1.1 Problem articulation The presented conceptual system dynamics model intends to investigate sustainable development from the environmental, social, and economic perspectives simultaneously. Thus, the interactions and causal relations among 17 SDGs are classified into three main categories namely as biosphere, society, and economy as demonstrated in Fig. 2   . The interactions among SDGs indicate that the progress in one goal facilitates/impedes the progress in another. Moreover, although the conceptual system dynamics model could have implications for other developing countries, the boundary of the present system dynamics model is confined to the case of Iran. Furthermore, the time horizon of the presented model is set as the target year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  4.1.2 Formation of the dynamic hypothesis As explained in the research framework in section 3 , the qualitative data necessary for building the causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagram are elicited from the literature review and by conducting a panel of discussion. In order to build the main feedback loops and the stock-flow diagram, VENSIM PLE simulation software which is designed for academic purposes (Ventana Systems Inc., 2010 ), is used. This simulation software provides various features which allow for graphically demonstrating the causal loop diagrams, building stock and flow diagrams, and further mathematically modeling and simulating dynamic systems. 4.1.2.1 Causal loop diagrams The negative and positive marks related to each arrow in Figs. 3 and 4    imply the direction of the influence of one variable on the other. For instance, the positive causal relationship (+) between SDG6 and SDG3 denotes that growth or decline in access to clean water and sanitation will lead to growth or decline in health and wellbeing of people consecutively. Conversely, the negative (−) causal relationship between SDG8 and SDG 4 indicates that an increase or decrease in economic growth and decent works will cause a decrease or increase in the poverty respectively. Ultimately, series of positive and negative causal relationships among the 17 SDGs and the intermediate variables form the causal feedback loops of this study. The presented conceptual system dynamics model of sustainable development consists of 7 reinforcing loops (as shown in Fig. 3 ) and 7 balancing loops (as demonstrated in Fig. 4 ). The reinforcing or positive loops ( Image 3  ) are responsible for the exponential growth or decline behavior of the system over time, while the balancing or negative loops  Image 4   oppose the forcing change in a system and slow down the exponential growth or decline. Having a grasp of the reinforcing and balancing feedback loops of the sustainable development system dynamics model, provides valuable insights for the managers about the possible behaviors of SDGs over time. The details of each feedback loop are described as follows. The first reinforcing causal loop illustrates the positive interactions between birth rate and population (R1). The second reinforcing causal loop shows the positive influence of sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) on the availability of quality educations for all (SDG 4), which consequently raises the standards of living, increases the birth rate and population, and ultimately boost the required workforce for sustainable economic growth (R2). The third reinforcing causal loop depicts the positive impact of sustainable economic growth and decent works for all (SDG 8) will reduce the inequality within a country (SDG 10), brings about peace and justice in society (SDG 16), raises the standards of living, increases the birth rate and population, and finally strengthen the necessary workforce for sustainable economic growth (R3). The fourth reinforcing causal loop demonstrates how sustainable economic growth and creating decent works for all (SDG 8) leads to poverty reduction (SDG 1) and an increase in the standards of living, which positively affects the birth rate and the population in a longer time, and builds up the required workforce for sustainable economic growth (R4). The fifth, sixth, and seventh reinforcing causal loops display the positive effect of sustainable economic growth and decent work creations for all (SDG 8) on the increased level of financial investments in infrastructure, contributing to the improved resilient infrastructures and sustainable industrialization (SDG 9), better access to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and sustainable energy (SDG 7), and more sustainable agriculture, food security and enriched nutrition (SDG 2), which enhances the public health and well-being (SDG 3), and ultimately leads to the improved standards of living, increased birth rate and population, and boosted workforce for sustainable economic growth (R5, R6, R7). The first balancing causal loop shows how the death rate offsets the population (B1). The second balancing causal loop depicts how the increased population leads to the augmented demand for quality life services, less available quality life services, which ultimately lowers the standards of living, drops the birth rate, and adversely affects the population (B2). The third and fourth balancing causal loops demonstrate the negative effect of increased exploitation of renewable and non-renewable on the availability of these resources, which inevitably lowers the exploitation rates for further economic utilizations (B3, B4). The Fifth, sixth and seventh balancing causal loops addresses the impact of less sustainable production and consumption patterns (SDG 12) on the increased value of emitted pollution and created waste, which predictably endangers the biodiversity more and emphasizes the actions to conserve terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystem and combat the climate change (B5, B6, B7).  4.1.2.2 Identification of leverage points The significance of identifying the leverage points is the implications for designing effective policies to achieve the desired SDGs. Leverage points in this case study are the SDGs with the highest potential to have transformational influences on the total system's behavior of Iran's sustainable development. One way to identify these leverage points is to discover the SDGs with the most involvement in causal loop diagrams. In the first place, resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation (SDG9), and partnership to achieve the goals & strengthen the means of implementation (SDG17) have the highest influence in the presented causal loops. In the second place, sustainable economic growth & decent work for all (SDG8) has the most transformational power, followed by sustainable production & consumption patterns (SDG 12) in the fourth place. Finally, the required actions to combat climate change (SDG13) and conserve marine ecosystems (SDG14) and terrestrial ecosystems (SDG15) stand in the final place in terms of their impacts on the presented system dynamics model of sustainable development.  4.1.2.3 Stock and flow diagram The existing variables in the following stock and flow diagram are determined based on their roles in the presented system dynamics model. Stock/State variables  Image 5   are responsible to store the level of the system over time and integrate the net results of their related flow variables, flow variables  Image 6   are responses to the increase or decrease behaviors of the stock variables through differential equations, and finally, auxiliary variables can be obtained from other variables of the system. Additionally, the variables in the stock and flow diagram in Fig. 5   are in three distinct colors, red for variables related to the economic category, blue for variables related to the society category, and green for variables related to the biosphere category.     5 Discussion: future outlook of sustainable development goals in Iran Although achieving SDGs is a universal agenda for all nations (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ), each country has its challenges to implement SDGs targets and goals. In this sense, underdeveloped and developing countries like Iran have specific national capacities (financial resources, natural resources, human capital, infrastructures, social and cultural considerations, etc.) that affect the SDGs' implementation. Therefore, undertaking SDGs in such countries not only requires extra attention to establish prioritized guidelines and policy portfolios based on these national capacities to enable balanced SDGs achievements (Bryan et al., 2019 ; Sarvajayakesavalu, 2015 ), but also interlinkages throughout sectors, societal actors, among countries, and the SDGs themselves need to be taken into consideration as well (Sachs et al., 2019 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ).Therefore, on the grounds of the proposed conceptual system dynamics model and the identified feedback loops among the 17 SDGs, this section discusses why Iran with its national capacities has been prevented from the fully-fledged implementation of SDGs and how the barriers in the way of attaining several SDGs, will inevitably impact the achievements of other goals adversely. 5.1 Regional conflicts and environmental concerns Implementation of the SDGs goals and targets is not only influenced by national endeavors but also is driven by multiple factors that extend beyond national borders (El-Zein et al., 2016 ). In this regard, some of Iran's measures to address several SDGs have been constrained by regional and geographical events (HLPF, 2017 ). In the recent decade, Middle-Eastern countries including Iran have been faced with frequent and destructive sand and dust storms due to climate changes, desertification, land degradation, and water scarcity not only within its border but also in the neighboring countries (Javadian et al., 2019 ; Madani et al., 2016 ; Vaghefi et al., 2019 ). This serious environmental challenge has not only caused intense health problems for the people of Iran's southern provinces and cities (SDG 3 and causal loops R1- R4) but also adversely impacted the food security and agriculture (SDG 2 and causal loop R1-R4, R7), water scarcity (SDG 6 and causal loops R1- R5) local economy and workdays (SDG 8 and causal loops R1-R7, B1-R2) and biodiversity (SDG 15 and causal loops B5– B7) in the country (Miri et al., 2009 ). Another issue of the Middle-eastern countries is the threat of extreme violence in the region. In recent years, Iran along with other influenced countries collaborated closely to ensure stable peace and security in the region (SDGs 16 and causal loops R1- R4) and demonstrated serious intention for international cooperation to address regional environmental challenges (SDG 17 and causal loops B5–B7) (HLPF, 2017 ). Consequently, these undesirable conditions had put strains on the financial capitals of Iran's government and brought about limited monetary budgets for crucial sustainability challenges of the country.  5.2 Internal conflicts of interests among key stakeholders One of the main prerequisites for the implementation of SDGs targets and indicators at the national and local levels is the common language among the key stakeholders (Elder et al., 2016 ) (GA, 2015 ). Given the aspirational will of the 2030 Agenda to “leave no one behind” which implies that the SDGs' goals and targets should be met for all countries and for all segments of society (GA, 2015 ; Stuart and Samman, 2017 ), the second obstacle that lies ahead of Iran's pathway to adequate policy makings is the differing views and conflict of interests among major players of some controversial SDGs. Some of these disagreements relate directly to education (SDG 4 and causal loop R2), gender equality (SDG 5 and causal loop R3), and reduced inequality (SDG 10 and causal loop R3). Such issues include disputations on the government's voluntarily consent to apply the 2030 UNESCO education framework for action, in line with SDG 4, while many key decision-makers believed that implementation of this agenda is opposed to the aspirations of Iran's culture and aspirations (Iran Front Page News, 2017 ; Tehran Times, 2017a ). Eventually, as the disagreements raised between the consenters and protestors of this international framework, the “High Council of Cultural Revolution” whose task is to protect the Iranian-Islamic culture rescinded the implementation of this agenda at a secession chaired by the president (Tehran Times, 2017b ). Moreover, although there are several disagreements regarding the true definitions of gender equality (SDG 5) and social inequality (SDG 10) among key players in the country, the government of Iran claimed to have taken effective steps towards the improvements of such principles through publishing a national document called “Charter of Citizenship's Rights”, which promotes a wide range of social issues based on the national and local considerations including freedom of speech and press, minority and ethnic rights, judicial justice, access to information, women's rights, in 2016 (HLPF, 2017 ). Despite the mentioned endeavors, major challenges still exist regarding the achievements of SDG 5 and SDG 10 (Sachs et al., 2020 ; UN ESCAP, 2020 ) partly due to the differing views among the custodian organizations and key decision-makers.  5.3 Sanctions Implementation of the ambitious goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda requires the global partnerships that support knowledge share, technology transfer, and facilitations on access to financial resources especially for underdeveloped and developing countries (SDG 17 and causal loops B1–B7) (GA, 2015; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ; Tabeau and Meijl, 2020 ). A major impediment to Iran's process of achieving SDGs is the imposed restrictions on any forms of cooperation in foreign trade by the United States, the European Union (EU), and some other countries over the last decade (Felbermayr et al., 2020 ; GA, 2017 ; Tehran Times, 2020 ). These restrictions had put Iran into an economic solitude which caused a significant decline in the country's incomes, precipitated the devaluation of the national currency, and brought about increased inflation and unemployment (Ghorbani Dastgerdi et al., 2018 ; Kokabisaghi, 2018 ) (SDGs 8, 9 and causal loops B1–B2). In response to these constraints, Iran's governors decided to employ self-sufficient economic policies to meet the demands of the nation (food, energy, water) which over-burdened the natural resources of the country (SDGs 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, and causal loops B3–B7 and R5, R6) (Fotourehchi, 2020 ; Fu et al., 2020 ; Tehran Times, 2016 ). Moreover, these sanctions on banking, financial system, and shipment have led to adverse effects on the general quality of life for the low and middle-income population cohorts of Iran. These damaging effects include the decreased level of welfare to afford nutritious food (SDGs 1, 2 and causal loop R7) (Babar and Kamrava, 2014 ; Roshan et al., 2015 ), healthcare and medicine (SDG3 and causal loops R1-R4) (Aloosh et al., 2019 ; Danaei et al., 2019 ; Kheirandish et al., 2015 ; Setayesh and Mackey, 2016 ; Shahabi et al., 2015 ; Takian et al., 2020 ) which is contrary to the SDGs principle to leave no one behind. Given the current economical atmosphere of Iran under these trade embargos, the government does not have anywhere close to enough funding to support the implementation of SDGs.  5.4 Absence of updated data and credible evaluation mechanism Achieving the 2030 Agenda with its targets and indicators requires good data and clear metrics to recognize where countries stand, build roadmaps for achieving the targets and track progress (Allen et al., 2018 ; Lamichhane et al., 2020 ; Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ; Sarvajayakesavalu, 2015 ). A serious challenge of Iran in undertaking SDGs is the lack of sufficient data on the indicators at the national and local levels which makes the monitoring and assessment processes infeasible for the authorities (SDGs 1–17 and all the causal loops). Although the Statistical Centre of Iran was given the mandate to provide the ministries and governmental agencies with credible data to ensure the continuous monitoring of the targets and indicators of SDGs (HLPF, 2017 ), there is an apparent lack of adequate data. As it was stated in section 4.2 , while 42% of the total SDGs indicators have sufficient data availability, there is insufficient and no data on the remaining indicators (58%). If validated data were provided in the form of annual and quarterly evaluations, early signs of discordance and deviations in each SD goal and target will be given to the Iranian managers and custodians to seek out the mid-course necessary corrections. It can be derived that based upon the role of key players, Iran's obstacles combating the implementation of sustainable development can be categorized to internal challenges (including (I) the internal conflicts of interests among key stakeholders and (II) absence of updated data and credible evaluation mechanism) and external barriers (including (I) regional conflicts and environmental issues and (II) imposed sanctions). Unlike the arduousness of dealing with the external barriers, simple changes would go a long way toward resolving the internal challenges within the remaining timeframe of the 2030 Agenda. Therefore, it is better for Iran to firstly adopt the SDGs that can be best undertaken with the existing resource capacity and secondly plan to develop resource capacity for the remaining goals. To enable this over the next 10 years, Iran should actively reach out across the governmental and non-governmental organizations, private companies, financial investors, and civil society to establish a prioritized national plan based on its capacities (financial resources, natural resources, human capitals, infrastructures, social and cultural considerations, etc.) to come up with an integrated framework to regularly I) device metrics, II) design monitoring processes, III) assess progress, IV) improve infrastructure, and V) validate and standardize data (Lu et al., 2015 ).   6 Conclusion Following the announcement of the 2030 Agenda as an integrated plan for the sustainable development of nations, early criticism has been directed at the aspirational nature of the SDGs. Adequate financial and non-financial means of implementation are required from one perspective to ensure the timely achievement of the SDGs through national plans and roadmaps. However, there are major gaps between developed and less developed countries in terms of their capacity to provide these means of implementation, which is expressed in the fewer SDGs obtained by most of the less developed countries. From another perspective, the 2030 Agenda consists of 17 interconnected goals which imply that the implementation of each goal will inevitably have an impact on other goals. As a consequence, unintegrated implementation efforts that approach each goal separately and neglect these linkages are perceived to be a failure of the 2030 Agenda. Nonetheless, while traditional management research techniques often solve a problem by fragmenting it into isolated elements, exploring complex systems such as sustainable development requires the acknowledgment of the key role system feedbacks, causal relationships, time delays, and non-linear behaviors of a system's components in defining the aggregated system behavior. No prior study has addressed these two critics simultaneously by investigating the linkages of the Sustainable Development Goals via a system dynamic approach and exploring the challenges in the path of achieving these goals through a case study. In response to this research gap and as the first attempt to investigate sustainable development in Iran's case study, the presented research framework is conducted in two consecutive stages. In the first stage, secondary data from various well-cited research papers were collected to identify the direct and indirect interlinkages among sustainable development goals and different challenges of a fully-fledged implementation of SDGs in countries and particularly within the presented case study of Iran's sustainable development. In the second stage, an expert panel of discussion was conducted initially to collect additional data regarding the synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs for conceptualizing a system dynamics model. In the following, the conceptual system dynamics model of sustainable development is built up through two steps of i) problem articulation (problem definition, identification of system's boundary and time horizon) and ii) formation of the dynamic hypothesis (building the causal feedback loops, identification of leverage points, and constructing the stock and flow diagram). The presented model consists of 7 balancing and 7 reinforcing feedback loops which shed light on the synergies and trade-offs among the 17 SDGs and contributes to the understanding of how the progress in one goal facilitate/impede the progress in another in the context of Iran's case study. Moreover, given that identification of leverage points of the system dynamics model assists the managers to design effective policies to achieve the desired performance, i) SDG 9 and SDG 17, ii) SDG 8, iii) SDG 12, and iv) SDG 13, SDG 14, SDG 15 respectively. were determined to have the highest influence on the total behavior of the system. Additionally, based on the system dynamics model of sustainable development, it is discussed that not only the obstacles in the way of attaining several SDGs, namely as 1) regional conflicts and environmental concerns, 2) internal conflicts of interests among key stakeholders, 3) sanctions, and 4) absence of updated data and credible evaluation mechanism, makes it impossible for the country to reach the preordained milestones of these SDGs but also they would eventually affect the achievements of other goals badly. In addition to the theoretical contribution of this study by incorporating the system dynamics approach into sustainable development research, the study provides practical implications for national and global authorities as well. Firstly, the national key-decision makers and managers in Iran, who are responsible for mainstreaming these global agendas into the national plans, can potentially take advantage of the presented holistic understanding of the dynamic relationships among SDGs and the identified leverage points that highly affect the aggregated system behavior of sustainable development. Secondly, the presented conceptual system dynamics model can be of use for the policymakers in other developing countries with a similar profile to Iran to avoid the same pitfalls and failure in the implementation of SDGs. Thirdly, global authorities may also benefit from the investigation of the aspirational will of the 2030 Agenda to “leave no one behind” through the case study of Iran. Iran's case as a developing country with its capacities, national realizations, and the obstacles combating the SDGs achievements reveals that the ongoing national efforts have been only successful regarding goals 4, 9, 17 so far (17.65% of all the goals), and the remaining goals cannot be attained within the next 9 years through the current national strategies and local plans (82.35% of all the goals). On the grounds of the conceptual system dynamics model and the presented stock and flow diagram of sustainable development, futures work should mathematically formulate this model to enable simulating various policy interventions and conducting sensitivity tests to explore the changes of leverage points/influential SDGs over the next 9 years for the ultimate goal of designing a set of prioritized policies to boost the progress and minimize the impediments in the total system's achievements.
