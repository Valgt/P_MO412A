                  This editorial essay introduces the 27 papers included in the special issue proposed by the SDG Academy of the U.N. Sustainable Development Network on the nature, extent, and challenges to progress towards SDG 4: Quality Education for All at the mid-point of the 2030 campaign. Problematic paradigms, and potential pathways towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4. With contributrions from leading scholars and practitioners working in the areas of global governance, international development education, and comparative education, this special issue reflects on how far the world has come, provides clarity on what the fundamental obstacles to progress have been, and offers suggestions for ways forward, in addition to raising issues and posing (at times, uncomfortable) questions with which stakeholders should grapple as they work towards SDG 4—and future global goals. The commentaries are focused on five inter-connected themes. These themes relate not only to progress on SDG 4 but also to the key conditions (capacity), processes (measurement), and contexts (e.g. vulnerable contexts) that are relevant to debates about how to make progress on SDG 4, or whether a different approach (geo-political and/or onto-epistemic in nature) is necessary. This essay concludes by encouraging the reader to decide for themselves which arguments they see as being more persuasive. We wouldencourage readers to reflect on why one argument or line of reasoning may resonate more or less—and to consider what the cause of that resonance could be. It is suggested that each reader, each of us, also has work to do when it comes to reflecting on the positions that we take or favor, why, and which voices or perspectives are left out by our answers to these questions. As the contributions to this special issue suggest, there are no easy answers.

                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Although Target 4.1 seeks to ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education, between 2015 and 2022 the world showed progress, but not at the rate needed to meet the global goals: primary school completion increased from 85 to 87 percent, lower secondary completion rose from 74 to 77 percent, and upper secondary completion grew from 54 to 59 percent. Moreover, despite the aspiration of universal secondary school completion, only one in six countries aims to achieve this goal by 2030 based on their national targets. Even if these targets are met, an estimated 84 million children and young people will still be out of school by 2030.</entry>

                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Pre-primary education enrollment has increased from 47 percent in 2010 to 61 percent in 2020. Moreover, the global average for participation in pre-primary education one year before offical primary school age rose to 75 percent in 2020. Rates are much lower in middle- and low-income countries, where figures for this last statistic are less than 66 percent. These figures stand in contrast with the with aspirations embedded in Target 4.2, which states that all girls and boys should have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.</entry>

                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">The tertiary education gross enrolment ratio has reached 40 percent, having grown around one percentage point per year since 2000, and ranging from 9 percent in sub-Saharan Africa to 78 percent in Europe and Northern America. By gender, the statistics are 43 percent for women and 37 percent for men. These statistics are a long way from meeting the language of Target 4.3: By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university.</entry>

                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Target 4.4 zeroes in on the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship. In around half of 91 countries, however, a majority of adults possess none of the nine core information and communications technology skills monitored under SDG 4. There are also gender gaps. For example, for every 100 men who can use a basic arithmetic formula in a spreadsheet in Pakistan’s Balochistan, only 8 women can. In addition, there is a wide wealth gap, for example, in Mongolia, where only 1 percent from the poorest quintile have spreadsheet skills compared to 39 percent from the richest quintile in Mongolia.</entry>

                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd" role="rowhead">Target 4.5—Gender equality and inclusion</entry>
                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">This target speaks to the need to eliminate inequities in education, including inequities for persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, and children in vulnerable situations. On the positive side, Cambodia, Congo, the Gambia, Ghana, Haiti, Malawi and Rwanda have, within a generation, come close to eliminating what used to be a large gender gap in upper secondary education completion. On the negative side, though, in western and central African countries, such as Chad, the Gambia and Togo, no more than 5 percent of children aged 7–14 speak the language of instruction at home. Additionally, the percentage of 6- to 14-year-old Syrian refugees in Lebanon attending education fell from 67 percent in 2020 to 53 percent in 2021. And, in Sub-Saharan Africa, as of 2020, for every 100 boys enrolled in school, there were 96 females at the primary level, 91 at the lower secondary level, 87 in upper secondary school, and 80 in tertiary education—though, interestingly, performance trends show inequality in the other direction, with 115 girls demonstrating proficiency in reading for every 100 boys at the lower secondary level, for example. Although this trend is reversed in science and mathematics among high performers, girls perform better on average.</entry>

                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Although the world youth literacy rate increased 4 percent during 2000–2015 (from 87 percent to 91 percent), it increased by less than one additional percentage point by 2020. Regional averages show progress with room for further improvement. Central and Southern Asia, for example, increased from 74 percent in 2000 to 88 percent in 2015 and then 90 percent in 2020. Sub-Saharan Africa grew from 66 percent in 2000 to 75 percent in 2015 and then to 77.5 percent in 2020. For adults globally, the figures have gone from 81 percent in 2000 to 86 percent in 2015 and then 87 percent in 2020. In terms of gender dynamics, women represent over half (56 percent) of all illiterate youth and 63 percent of illiterate adults.</entry>

                        <entry xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">What stands out for this target is that the necessary data are unavailable. While some data have been pulled from existing databases or other initiatives, they do not relate directly or completely to the focus of this broad target, which covers everything from education for sustainable development to education for human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity as well as the contribution of culture to sustainable development. Where data are available they indicate, for example, that only 39 percent of countries have a national law, policy or strategically dedicated to climate change education, and that only 63 percent of teacher training includes a planned focus on climate change.

                  <ce:simple-para id="sp0020" view="all">This editorial essay introduces the 27 papers included in the special issue proposed by the SDG Academy of the U.N. Sustainable Development Network on the nature, extent, and challenges to progress towards SDG 4: Quality Education for All at the mid-point of the 2030 campaign. Problematic paradigms, and potential pathways towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4. With contributrions from leading scholars and practitioners working in the areas of global governance, international development education, and comparative education, this special issue reflects on how far the world has come, provides clarity on what the fundamental obstacles to progress have been, and offers suggestions for ways forward, in addition to raising issues and posing (at times, uncomfortable) questions with which stakeholders should grapple as they work towards SDG 4—and future global goals. The commentaries are focused on five inter-connected themes. These themes relate not only to progress on SDG 4 but also to the key conditions (capacity), processes (measurement), and contexts (e.g. vulnerable contexts) that are relevant to debates about how to make progress on SDG 4, or whether a different approach (geo-political and/or onto-epistemic in nature) is necessary. This essay concludes by encouraging the reader to decide for themselves which arguments they see as being more persuasive. We wouldencourage readers to reflect on why one argument or line of reasoning may resonate more or less—and to consider what the cause of that resonance could be. It is suggested that each reader, each of us, also has work to do when it comes to reflecting on the positions that we take or favor, why, and which voices or perspectives are left out by our answers to these questions. As the contributions to this special issue suggest, there are no easy answers.</ce:simple-para>

These goals —of which there are 17—are intended to orient and animate governments and stakeholders around the world, that is, in both the Global North and Global South, as they strive to achieve development that is more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable. It is no secret, however, that the world is not on track to meet the SDGs, for which a target date of 2030 was set (Butler, 2030; <ce:cross-ref id="cr0045" refid="bib29">United Nations, 2023</ce:cross-ref>). For example, based on available data, progress on more than 50 percent of all SDG targets is weak and insufficient; for 30 percent of targets progress has stalled or gone into reverse; and the world is on track to meet only 15% of targets by 2030 (<ce:cross-refs id="crs0005" refid="bib16 bib29">Mundy, 2023; United Nations, 2023</ce:cross-refs>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0035" view="all">The same is true for SDG 4, the only goal exclusively related to education. With its focus on “quality education for all,” the deceptively simple language of this goal belies a broad and complex agenda that encompasses multiple dimensions, content areas, targets, and indicators. As will be further discussed by the entries in this special issue, the focus of SDG 4 includes, among other things: (a) every level of education from early childhood to tertiary, in addition to technical, vocational, lifelong, and adult education; (b) content and skills related to work preparation, entrepreneurship, literacy, numeracy, information and communications technology, digital literacy skills, global citizenship education, and education for sustainable development; (c) the elimination of inequities in education related to gender, language of instruction, and financing; (d) the provision and transformation of education facilities and learning environments such that they are effective, non-violent, safe, and sensitive to the needs of children; and (e) increasing the supply of qualified teachers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the ambitious nature of SDG 4, progress has been difficult and slower than hoped (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0050" refid="bib30">UNESCO 2023a</ce:cross-ref> and <ce:cross-ref id="cr0055" refid="bib31">2023b</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>

To get a sense of the gains made and the scope of the shortcomings, consider the examples summarized in <ce:float-anchor refid="tbl0005"/>
                     <ce:cross-ref id="cr0060" refid="tbl0005">Table 1</ce:cross-ref>. The examples noted there relate to each of the seven core targets embedded in the Education 2030 Framework for Action, which was adopted by 184 UNESCO Member States in Paris in November 2015 (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0065" refid="bib26">UNESCO, 2015</ce:cross-ref>). While some advancements have been made, this thumbnail sketch suggests the depth and breadth of the challenges that confront UN Member States and a diversity of stakeholders as they strive to make progress towards the global educational agenda.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0045" view="all">At the midpoint of SDG 4, and with the aforementioned challenges in mind, the present special issue brings together 27 commentaries from leading scholars and practitioners working in the areas of global governance, international development education, and comparative education. As editors, we reached out to contributors and directly solicited commentaries based on the contributors’ track record of meaningful involvement in—and/or research on—global education campaigns. Despite the fact that the entries in this special issue are conceptualized as commentaries, all contributions have been revised following feedback from both the editors and external reviewers. Ultimately, the purpose of this special issue is to bring together informed commentaries that can, we hope, encourage reflection on how far the world has come, provide clarity on what the fundamental obstacles to progress have been, and offer suggestions for ways forward, in addition to raising issues and posing (at times, uncomfortable) questions with which stakeholders should grapple as they work towards SDG 4—and future global goals.<ce:cross-ref id="cr0070" refid="fn2">

                  <ce:para id="p0085" view="all">As opposed to problematizing the goals or to focusing on challenges to state capacity, the contributions to this section highlight and reflect on the progress that has been made. The first paper, by Fernando Reimers <ce:cross-ref id="cr0075" refid="bib22">(2024)</ce:cross-ref>, entitled, “The SDGs and education: Achievements and opportunities,” goes beyond an examination of statistical progress to draw our attention, as well, to the bigger picture, that is, to the qualitative developments that have been effected by SDG 4. In so doing, it asks: What kinds of progress have been encouraged? Is SDG 4 still the right goal? And, What challenges remain? Interestingly, in response to the first question, Reimers underscores the value of the aspirational nature of the SDGs. The SDGs greatly expand the scope of ambition by focusing not only on primary school enrollment or gender equality, but by also including in SDG 4 pre-school, secondary school, and tertiary level education, in addition to including learning and skills acquisition. For Reimers, the scope of the ambition contained in the SDGs has not been matched since the emergence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (approved in 1948). One consequence of their ambitious nature is the fact that the SDGs are terribly difficult to achieve. This reality, however, is not seen as problematic for this author. Rather, the breadth of the goals is appropriate for the challenges facing the world today, particularly when it comes to climate change and social inequality. Moreover, it is argued that the language of the goals should spur a wide range of organizations, from the local to the global, into action, and in a coordinated manner. Although Addey (this volume) reveals inter-organizational tensions that can prevent coordination, it bears emphasizing, as does Reimers, that the underlying hypothesis behind the SDGs is that initiatives such as these, which countries are encouraged to endorse and to track, can stimulate strategic action and knowledge sharing to accelerate progress. To this end, Reimers concludes by suggesting that efforts towards achieving the SDGs should not become distracted with narrowly-defined targets but should, instead, keep their eye on the big picture—that is, first, on the fact that SDGs are system goals, and, second, on the knowledge and skills that students will need to change the world, now and in the future.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0090" view="all">The next four commentaries build on the piece by Reimers <ce:cross-ref id="cr0080" refid="bib22">(2024)</ce:cross-ref> in that they keep their eye on the components of the system, and the need for these different components to work together. Catherine Porter <ce:cross-ref id="cr0085" refid="bib20">(2024)</ce:cross-ref>, for example, in her piece on “Reprioritizing inclusion and equity to meet SDG 4,” argues for the importance of coordinating policies across sectors to support children’s learning and to ensure that they remain in school. From the perspective of this author, the focus in practice should be on developing strategies within and beyond the education system to support the needs of children. Drawing on data from 20 years of the Young Lives Study (of which Porter is the current director), the author highlights the crucial role of “social protection schemes”, such as those that address nutrition, provide housing, and combat restrictive social norms (especially for girls). This commentary provides examples of how collaboration between researchers and governments can lead to policies that look “across the life cycle and across sectors.”</ce:para>

Oketch argues that, in absence of progress along these lines, the people of Africa will not be able to access “the full social and health benefits of quality education.” In order to move in this direction, traditional measure of performance, efficiency and effectiveness are insufficient. Attention, rather, should be directed, first, at developing system diagnostic tools that enable a “fuller understanding of the sources of good or poor performance. This would then be followed by the identification of “reform pathways” which take into account “the full chain of linkages required for achieving SDG 4.” In other words:</ce:para>

With a focus on “fixing the broken interlinkages between education and gender inequality,” it draws particular attention to the fact that the percentage of women participating in the economies of these countries has not increased significantly (and has decreased in some places), despite increases in the enrollment of girls in school. After reviewing statistics related to these phenomena, the authors argue that one of the broken linkages is the kinds of textbooks used in this region. Gender biases in these texts do not contribute to changing gender norms—indeed, they reinforce discriminatory beliefs that encourage the differential treatment of boys and girls. Of course, these beliefs go beyond treatment at the level of the school; they also contribute perspectives and practices that relegate women to the sphere of the household. A key step, then, to addressing SDG 4 (on quality education) and SDG 5 (related to gender equality and women’s empowerment) is revising and updating the content of the educational resources used to shape the values and norms of future generations.</ce:para>

These barriers relate to: resources, recognition, marketisation, status competition, labour market links, difficulties of measurement, and lack of imagination. As McCowan argues, it is necessary to address these barriers precisely because higher education institutions, more than providing knowledge and skills, are also at the forefront of research, innovation, and public engagement—and thus are central to making progress towards all 17 SDGs.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0115" view="all">The final contribution to this section, by Mark Bray <ce:cross-ref id="cr0105" refid="bib6">(2024)</ce:cross-ref>, takes a different tack. As opposed to addressing progress on goals included the SDGs, it seeks to raise the profile of an issue that has been left out—namely, private tutoring. It draws attention to the lack of data collection on this widespread phenomenon and argues for action to be taken. Given that private tutoring, or, in the author’s terminology, “shadow education,” is a global practice “with enrolment rates in some countries and at some grades now exceeding 70 percent,” it represents a significant feature of modern schooling—and one that can, as the author points out, contribute to reproducing or worsening social inequalities, a consequence of the fact that private tutoring is used to gain an advantage over others as students take exams and progress from one grade to the next. Yet many governments feel that private tutoring does not warrant attention, or that “it is beyond their remit and/or that they lack regulatory capacity.” In the fact of these challenges, Bray concludes not only by calling for more data collection and monitoring of private tutoring, but also by noting that significant measures must be taken if this practice is to be significantly diminished. These measures include, for example, improving the quality of education across the board, such that there are not “glaring shortcomings in schooling,” in addition to ensuring that teachers are compensated appropriately, so that they do not have to seek supplemental income through the provision of private tutoring. A final suggestion is that countries can, in this area, “learn much from comparative analysis of regulatory approaches, recognising that different approaches may be needed in different cultural contexts.” To this end, the next section discusses contributions to this special issue that zero in on governance and state capacity.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0120" view="all">The five commentaries in this section all pivot to address the issues of—and the challenges to—governance and state capacity. Governance can be understood as strategies and tactics for managing a government’s activities, while state capacity typically refers more specifically to the ability and effectiveness of a government to design and implement policies and programs that provide (educational) services (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0110" refid="bib4">Asadullah and Savoia, 2018</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0125" view="all">Karen Mundy <ce:cross-ref id="cr0115" refid="bib16">(2023)</ce:cross-ref>, in her paper, “SDG 4 and state capacity: Where are we now?,” provides a useful panorama of the extent to which the SDGs are not being met, in addition to commenting that the proposals put forward at the 2023 SDG Summit “did not instill confidence that global initiatives are coherent, coordinated and effective.” Likewise, at the country level, where most of the responsibility for achieving the SDGs sits, she writes that there is “slim” evidence that “the capacity or quality of governments around the world has improved since 2015.” These challenges are also true for the education sector and for SDG 4, where there has been “continued neglect … of efforts to support state capacity.” In light of this observation, the author critiques the SDGs, first, for not providing a framework for prioritizing and sequencing goals and, second, for the lack of initiatives to support nationally-led strategies. Relatedly, Mundy underscores the importance of reforming the global financial architecture for developoment (see also Archer, this volume), the production of knowledge and evidence in a way that is useful to countries (rather than serving the interests of think tanks, consulting firms, and universities located in the Global North), and improved monitoring and accountability (for more on this theme, see the articles in the next section).</ce:para>

To this end, she writes: “among education’s global governors, rigorous discussion about state capacity—what it means and how to strengthen it, measure it, and support it systematically and sustainably—is lacking.” Mundy offers an insightful recount of the various ways that the capacity-building focus has been both central and insufficient in recent decades in the realm of global education governance, with examples ranging from sporadic trainings (the go-to response for international development organizations) to “Deliverology” (a technocratic approach to improving implementation based on big data and accountability) to decentralization (i.e., making sub-national units responsible for service provision). Mundy ultimately concludes that “each approach seems to neglect (or side step) the deeper capacity challenges within educational bureaucracies,” that too much attention is paid to approaches based on accountability and incentives, and that too little attention is paid to “strengthening the capacity for professional judgment and group level learning and problem solving.” What is needed is more attention to how organizations operate and learn. As will be see below, other contributors to this special issue (e.g., Menashy &amp; Zakharia and Rappleye et al.) have a different view on the concern with state capacity, seeing it as patronizing and as a vestige of colonial dynamics.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0135" view="all">The following commentary, entitled “Transforming the financing of education at the mid-point of the SDGs” and written by David Archer <ce:cross-ref id="cr0125" refid="bib3">(2023)</ce:cross-ref>, a long-time civil society activist working with ActionAid, is closely related to the state capacity focus of Mundy in that his paper raises the issue of resources. Building on decades of work related to the financing of education, Archer calls for action in four areas: Debt, tax justice, austerity, and in terms of changing the paradigm for how spending on education and public services is viewed. Along these lines, Archer’s persuasive commentary argues, first, that debt relief, restructuring and/or cancellation is important in order to make funding available for education (particularly in low-income countries, where more is spent on debt servicing than on education or health); second, that additional taxes are crucial, especially taxes that are progressive (in that they do not disproportionately affect low-income earners), gender-responsive (so that women and girls are not disadvantaged), and climate-sensitive (incentivizing sustainability and disincentivizing actions that accelerate the climate crises), in addition to curbing tax avoidance and enacting new global taxes (e.g. on corporate profits, financial flows, and carbon) to raise revenue for low-income nations (to fund education and other public services); third, that austerity policies which typically cut funding to education (as one of the largest governmental expenditures) should be curbed; and, fourth, that spending on education should not be seen as a cost but rather as an investment in the future. Archer concludes by noting that “education voices are largely silent in the debates on tax or debt austerity” and that “when the IMF are in discussions with Ministries of Finance there is no seat for education, and very rarely any significant attention paid to education needs.” This needs to change, he argues, along with the inadequate attention that funding has received in the processes of global education governance (e.g., the Finance Working Group of the High-Level Steering Committee on SDG 4). Ultimately, more attention—and change—is needed when it comes to the power structures that control and influence education financing, including the voting structure of the IMF and the laws that regulate (and tax) global financial flows. However, in order to advance in these areas, education advocates must, in Archer’s words, “break out of the education bubble!”. That is, they must go beyond engagement on how to do education; rather, they must pressure those organizations that affect how education is funded.</ce:para>

In his piece, entitled “Education: Why not a race to the top?,” extends the analysis of Archer by additionally pointing out the “glaring global inequality of educational investment.” As the author notes, high-income countries account for 63 percent of global investment in education but account for only 10 percent of the school-age population, a reality which amounts to “a global reproduction of educational inequality.” Crucially, Garnier also speaks to the “poverty trap” in which many low-income countries find themselves, a trap which greatly affects countries’ ability to invest in education—to wit: to expand their capacity. The logic proceeds thus: First, when a country is highly unequal and has a large supply of very cheap labor, the best way to attract investment is to ensure that foreign companies will have continued access to cheap labor. A consequence of this strategy is that countries are disincentivized from educating their workforce, not to mention disincentivized from improving production processes or introducing more modern technology. Each of these actions would imply additional costs for an economy that is based on manual labor in factories (e.g., in the production of clothing for export). Where there is no perceived need for investments in human capital, there is little appetite for raising taxes to finance education. A further consequence of this situation—i.e., where countries are characterized by extractive or low-productivity economies—is the following:</ce:para>

He zeroes in, first, on the need for more and better schools (that are safe, healthy and stimulating environments that support equality and inclusion) and, second, on the need for more and better teachers (and strengthening their working conditions and the perception of them in society), in addition to the importance of harnessing the digital revolution (meaning the connectivity, technologies, and new resources that this has entailed). However, in order to move in these directions, schools will need access to these digital resources and teachers will need the knowledge and skills to take advantage of them. In both cases, the author argues for transforming “teaching and learning resources into free and open global public goods.” There are, no doubt, interesting and important questions to be considered going forward about the technologies and strategies that can be employed to make this vision a reality.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0160" view="all">For the fourth paper related to governance, Lee Crawfurd <ce:cross-ref id="cr0145" refid="bib7">(2024)</ce:cross-ref>, writing from the Center for Global Development in the UK, emphasizes that “We can achieve the SDGs by funding feasible and politically attractive projects”—as the title says. In a different way, Crawfurd responds to the challenges highlighted by Garnier: this paper suggests actions that can be taken “even in contexts of weak state capacity.” From the premise that it is necessary to expand access to education before shifting to learning outcomes, this commentary “argues governments should focus first on simple, scalable reforms to expand enrollment, chiefly abolishing school fees and exam barriers,” though this must be combined with the provision of additional resources to the education system, to offset the decrease in funding coming from families. More broadly, and in contrast with the commentaries discussed previously, the author argues that “improving quality is less about spending more money than about changing the behaviour of thousands of teachers across a country, to improve their teaching ability.” The central conclusion of this commentary is that, in the absence of a clear path forward being provided by the SDG 4 framework, and in the context of constrained budgets, “progress requires focus where returns are clearest”.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0165" view="all">The final contribution to this section is oriented in the opposite direction. Rather than accepting the current limits of the SDGs, Steven Klees <ce:cross-ref id="cr0150" refid="bib11">(2024)</ce:cross-ref>, in his piece on “Why SDG 4 and the other SDGs are failing and what needs to be done,” takes aim at the world system by which these efforts—and “state capacity”—are constrained. For him, the lack of financing and political action are symptoms of the global capitalist economy, just as Garnier (discussed above) points out. Moreover, where half measures are taken—as in the case of the SDGs—these can be seen as attempts to maintain the legitimacy of the social order (see contribution to this special issue by Mario Novelli for more on this point). He also emphasizes the limits of market solutions: “We will not grow our way out of our multiple crises, nor will the private sector do much other than make profits and pass on as many risks as they can to the public.” In response to these kinds of approaches, Klees highlights a number of alternatives to education and development, including: smart cities, green economies, economic democracy, eco-socialism, degrowth, alternative currencies, and decolonization, among others. He further names a number of movements and initiatives that are working to promote these alternatives, such as The Green Economy Coalition, the Next System Project, the Democracy Collaborative, the Global Tapestry of Alternatives, and The Alternative Project. His conclusions, echoed and expanded upon in the section of this special issue on geo-politics, declare that “any sober assessment of SDG progress must recognize that we will never achieve these goals without drastic changes in how we live and organize ourselves on this planet.” The necessary changes include challenging the “assumptions underlying the SDGs that economic growth is the way forward and that the private sector can be the engine of ‘development’.”</ce:para>

The first contribution—by Manos Antoninis <ce:cross-ref id="cr0155" refid="bib2">(2023)</ce:cross-ref>, the director of UNESCO’s Global Education Monitoring Report—argues that global campaign success should be judged by acceleration towards the goals and by whether purposeful policymaking is occurring toward these ends, not whether the goals have been achieved numerically. From this perspective, the SDGs have been successful. As he writes, at the global level, the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is universal” and “it has brought people and planet, as well as poor and rich countries, together for the first time under an integrated framework, through an inclusive and participatory process.” As for acceleration, one needs to refer to statistics to make a judgment, and for that the world needs data—and lots of it. In this regard, it is helpful to recall that:</ce:para>

Here, three developments stand out. First, in 2019, the Technical Cooperation Group selected seven SDG 4 indicators for benchmarking—focused on early childhood education attendance, out-of-school rate, completion rate, gender gaps in completion rate, minimum proficiency rate in reading and mathematics, trained teachers, and public education expenditure. Second, during 2021–2022, three quarters of countries set their own national targets for these benchmarks—with targets for both 2025 and 2030.

However, beyond simply documenting progress or using data as a means for holding governments accountable (or shaming them), reporting on indicators can be seen as a first step to learning from one another. That said, other commentaries, such as the one discussed next, raise concerns about the relevance of SDG 4 data at the national level for informing policymaking.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0195" view="all">In contrast with the high hopes placed on the vision of the “data revolution” that was supposed to follow the approval of the SDGs, Clara Fontdevila (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0175" refid="bib9">2023</ce:cross-ref>) examines the “supply” and “demand” mismatches in the production of SDG 4 metrics. While the scale of data collection on education is, Fontdevila argues, “one of the most visible and ground-breaking innovations brought about by the 2030 Agenda,” this massive effort is also premised on two faulty assumptions: First, that global demands for data will induce country governments to produce the needed data, and, second, that the data needed for tracking global goals are also useful for domestic decision-making. Fontdevila, based on her previous research in this area, explains that neither of these assumptions have played out as expected. On one hand, only 38.3 percent of data series needed have data for at least 2 years since 2015, and 7 of the 43 SDG 4 indicators have no data available (at the level of the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, to which countries should provide data for tracking). On the other hand, per Fontdevila, “even those countries scoring relatively well in relation to data infrastructure or other dimensions of statistical capacity might exhibit low levels of SDG reporting.” The takeaway for this author is that there is limited political interest at the national level in contributing the time and energy necessary to produce the data needed at the global level. This finding is not surprising if one considers that “not all global indicators are necessarily policy-relevant at the domestic level, and that the data sources and formats more amenable to comparative and global reporting purposes are not necessarily those more appropriate to operate as policy-informing tools at the domestic level.” Fontdevila continues: “most global datasets are frequently of little use to local decision-makers, as they lack the granularity and precision necessary to orient domestic policy-making, resource allocation or service delivery.” Global initiatives like the SDGs thus end up diverting capacity, time, and resources away from concerns that are closer to home. Fontdevila concludes that, going forward, further reflection is warranted when it comes, first, to strengthening domestic data gathering and, second, to the tradeoffs between “comparability, actionability and relevance.”</ce:para>

In her article, entitled “Intensions, tensions and resistance: International organizations’ struggles in monitoring and measuring SDG4,” she reveals power dynamics which are usually out-of-view related to how international organizations—in this case, UNESCO and the OECD—work together “in the monitoring of and making of global learning metrics for SDG 4.” The argument is not only that inter-organizational tensions must be taken into account when planning for global educational agendas, but also that, if they are not, the result will be “inevitable overlaps and struggles in measuring and monitoring processes.” In the case of SDG 4, Addey writes that these tensions have led to “a waste of resources and a fragmentation of efforts.” It should be no surprise that such tensions can result from fundamental differences of worldview, for example, related to the purpose of education, differences which subsequently affect what kinds of data are seen as relevant and how they should be measured and used.</ce:para>

These authors note that large-scale assessments are typically based on standardized indicators, and that these indicators are then used to make determinations about achievement and accountability. An issue they highlight is that “assessment to a large extent defines who is good enough and who can contribute in the right way to educational communities and the learning process of schooling.” Moreover, if we recognize that the knowledge of how to take a test, as well as mastering the knowledge that the test evaluates, is an issue that conflicts with diversity, then we see how standardized testing “has repercussions … because assessment becomes a governing technology determining what is acceptable and desirable, who is in and who is out.”</ce:para>

Written by Marcia McKenzie, Aaron Benavot and Aaron Redman <ce:cross-ref id="cr0220" refid="bib14">(2024)</ce:cross-ref>, this commentary shows that academics and partner organizations complement and supplement the work of international organizations leading global education campaigns. The project led by McKenzie—the Monitoring and Evaluating Climate Communication and Education (MECCE) Project—is an example of this. MECCE responds to the fact that, at the mid-point of SDG 4, it is not possible to know “whether progress of any kind has been made on SDG 4.7 (or 13.3 and 12.8) due to the lack of appropriate and sufficiently robust indicators.” Existing data for these three indicators—all of which relate to climate change education and information—are weak. UNESCO’s plan was to use a survey given to countries with self-reported responses about progress in these areas; however, participation in the survey is voluntary and, in the last round, in 2020, was completed by less than 40 percent of countries to which it was given. The MECCE project responds to the lack of capacity and resources that constrain UNESCO. It does so through the collaboration of 100 partners and collaborators, including a number of UN agencies. Ultimately, the goal of the MECCE project is to increase the quantity and quality of climate change communication and education in policy and practice through the generation and provision of relevant global data. The project is ambitious and promising; however, given that it project is still ongoing, it remains to be seen if this initiative can avoid some of the tensions highlighted in the commentaries by Fontdevila, Addey, and Ydesen and Elfert.</ce:para>

In view of this reality, the authors discussed below highlight the concept of resilience.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0245" view="all">The first paper, by Kazuhiro Yoshida (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0225" refid="bib34">2024</ce:cross-ref>), co-chair of the SDG-Education 2030 Steering Committee, reflects on the history and importance of SDG target 4.7. He argues that countries need not only focus on the ‘learning crisis,’ but also on socio-emotional skills and the resilience that will be necessary to bring SDG target 4.7 to fruition—related, as this goal is, to a range of themes that go beyond content knowledge to include appreciation for diversity and the ability to respond to the challenges of climate change. Kazuhiro concludes by sharing his perspective that “the main interest of development has shifted from economic growth to realizing human potential and further to transforming society and individuals to become more sustainable and resilient” and that, to achieve this, “education must fulfil its role in producing learning outcomes that nurture SEL and behavioural changes.”</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0260" view="all">This argument responds to the fact that the present moment is prompting policymaking to focus education systems on “cross-cutting themes related to sustainability, global citizenship, peace, and climate change,” and that, as such, in order for the world to successfully respond to these challenges, resilience is what is needed. They write: “Accompanying these themes is a recognition of the value of educating for resilience—the ability to anticipate and manage disruptive shocks among individuals, schools, communities and systems.” The authors thus conclude by calling on the international community to “re-commit itself to Target 4.7 in deeds, and not just in words.” In practice, this means documenting and sharing “school, community and national experiences in relation to education for sustainability, global citizenship, and resilience,” for it is “only by sharing knowledge and experience in these areas can we expect to learn to live sustainably with each other and the many species gracing our planet.”</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0265" view="all">In the third commentary, <ce:cross-ref id="cr0235" refid="bib24">Shah et al., 2024</ce:cross-ref> focus not on the whole world as a context of vulnerability but rather on refugee contexts. In their piece, entitled, “Learning as ecosystems: Shifting paradigms for more holistic programming in education and development,” they note that there are 108 million displaced people around the world and that half of refugees are out of school. They also note that education for refugees is not a new concern: it has been on the global policy radar since the 1950 s, and commitments in this area have been renewed at recent global summits. However, education for refugees is a “wicked problem” in that it has complex root causes, the stakeholders involved have multiple interests (that typically do not align), and the issue is continually evolving, thus rendering solutions difficult to identify. Moreover, current approaches—such as distance learning and integrating refugees into the education systems of the host country— are insufficient. The authors suggest instead an ‘eco-systems’ approach which draws on the principles of living systems, namely, connectedness and embeddedness (“developing a culture of meaningful connectedness across actors and nested scales of influence/work”), reflective learning for emergent change (“building crucial capacities to critically reflect on own thinking and acting, in order to better understand and respond to complexities and nestedness of systems”, and a focus on potential (“moving beyond solving problems to exploring potential for dynamic change, recognizing that ecosystems are open, adaptive and thrive when there is diversity and flexibility”). The challenge going forward will be to get multiple sectors to coordinate and collaborate, in addition to encouraging the professionals and stakeholders involved to act in ways that are not only introspective but also in ways that they may not perceive as being in their best interest (that is, to act altruistically).</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0270" view="all">The final contribution to this section raises issues that challenges the visions and aspirations of the three previous commentaries. Although this commentary, written by Francine <ce:cross-ref id="cr0240" refid="bib15">Menashy and Zakharia, 2023</ce:cross-ref>, focuses on education in emergencies (EiE), the challenges spotlighted—related to issues of power, colonial hierarchies, racism, and marketization—are relevant more broadly. This broader concern is exemplified as ithe commentary brings SDG4’s focus on vulnerable populations into conversation with SDG17’s emphasis on global partnerships as being central to achieving all of the SDGs. As the authors note, the language of the Framework for Action for achieving SDG4 stipulates that education should be “maintained during situations of conflict, emergency, post-conflict and earl recovery” (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0245" refid="bib26">UNESCO, 2015</ce:cross-ref>, p. 9). Following this and other high-profile declarations related to education in emergency contexts, a proliferation of “global partnerships” have emerged or evolved, including the Global Partnership for Education, Global Business Coalition for Education, the Global Partners Project, and the Global Education Coalition for COVID-19 Response, among others. These partnerships have been complemented by national- and local-level initiatives. However, there are critiques, as they depict:</ce:para>

                        <ce:simple-para id="sp0065" view="all">Since the SDGs’ establishment in 2015, actors and organizations in EiE have brought to light continued and problematic power asymmetries in the EiE arena, largely rooted in colonial legacies. Scholars have critiqued the absence of people affected by crisis within partnerships and decision-making spaces, and the outsized influence of actors from the Global North within EiE governance and policy. Researchers have also found very limited localization within EiE programming and country-level activities, citing the absence or superficial participation of communities affected by crisis.</ce:simple-para>

                  </ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0280" view="all">The authors also note that other studies have highlighted a lack of attention to race, a topic further discussed by Sharon Walker and colleagues in their commentary (see below). Finally, Menashy and Zakharia note that, in the EiE space, a preoccupation with market mechanisms and market principles …leads to focus on efficiency over participatory approaches, the neglect of local-level perspectives, and the prioritization of profit. They conclude by questioning: “what, if any, benefits have resulted from these rhetorical and infrastructural advancements at the nexus of SDG 4 and 17 in EiE?”.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0285" view="all">As far as they can see, three kinds of action should be taken to make significant progress on EiE. First, flexibility should be prioritized: “In EiE contexts, marketized, efficiency-oriented, and output-driven expectations on strict timelines are often not feasible during crises, and these demands could be insensitive to the challenges local actors are facing.” Second, there should be a shift away from paternalistic language of “capacity building”, which pathologizes those on the receiving end of these initiatives while also tending to ignore historical injustices. Third and finally, “all EiE organizations within partnerships ought to engage in a process of deep and ongoing self-reflection about power imbalances, including acknowledgements of their roles in upholding hierarchies, particularly those rooted in colonial legacies.” The contributions to the final section, discussed next, continue with this line of argument.</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0290" view="all">The papers in this final section explicitly question the foundations of global governance—as relates to education, but also more broadly. In doing so, they extend the analysis presented by Menashy and Zakharia by placing front and center questions of historical inequalities, colonial relations, and geo-politics, as well as the onto-epistemic implications of these phenomena.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0295" view="all">Take, for example, the commentary written by Mario Novelli <ce:cross-ref id="cr0250" refid="bib18">(2023)</ce:cross-ref>, entitled “Historicising the geopolitics of education and the SDGs: From Western hegemony to a multi-polar world.” Here, Novelli clarifies the Cold-War foundations of global education goals (EFA, the MDGs, and now the SDGs) and concludes that they were all “constructed in a moment of uni-polar, US-led, Western hegemony” that today is being challenged and, from the perspective of Novelli, is “collapsing.” In presenting this analysis what Novelli does is change the framing of the SDGs. Although many stakeholders and participants in the structures and processes of global governance may be well-intentioned, this analysis encourages readers to see how the structures of global education campaigns may subtly reproduce inequalities on a global scale. Moreover, it highlights how, from the earliest days of “development” in the post-WWII period, initiatives carried out in its name were intended to preserve disparities between high- and low-income countries. In the present moment, the SDGs can be seen as the “social face of a much more contradictory, and overwhelmingly Western-led programme” (see also the commentary by Klees, discussed above). Part of the problem for the West, Novelli argues, is that socially-oriented development projects, such as the SDGs, are being confronted with increasing skepticism, and are treated as tokenistic, particularly as the self-serving intersection of diplomacy, defense, and development (a la Iraq and Afghanistan) becomes more apparent to people around the world. Moreover, China, Russia and the other “BRICs” countries are stepping into political, economic, and moral void that has been created by shifting sentiments and geo-politics. The question going forward is what should be done, especially as “the West is trying to close its borders as wars, environmental crises and economic collapse force many from their homes in the global south to seek opportunities in the West.” Novelli ends on a hopeful note by highlighting that the field of comparative and international education is well-positioned to provide a “people-to-people platform” for pursuing a “reckoning with the West’s colonial and imperial past (and present), and an openness to recognize—and respect—plurality of thought, culture, identity and polity”</ce:para>

                  <ce:para id="p0310" view="all">In looking at the present landscape of global governance of education, they argue that the appearance of progress on race is given through the language of high-profile declarations. In practice, though, the statements that result from global summits are insufficient. Indeed, action beyond the discursive level remains taboo. With regard to the SDGs, even the semiotic dimension is missing in that race is absent from the related pronouncements and programs. Although concerning, this absence is perhaps not surprising given that the worldview upon which global campaigns—and development more generally—is constructed can be seen as exhibiting an active ignorance, that is, a purposeful avoidance of race in light of the “ubiquitous nature of racial inequality fomented through colonialism and imperialism.” <ce:cross-ref id="cr0260" refid="bib32">Walker et al., 2023</ce:cross-ref> conclude with five recommendations: First, be attentive to the histories of educational disadvantage and how they shape (and/or are left out of) the framing of global education campaigns; second, plan for the redistribution of resources to nation-states which have suffered as a result of colonialism; third, address epistemic violence in education (e.g., through curriculum content that excludes multiple ways of knowing); fourth, develop target that can help to hold both international organizations and governments accountable for racial justice in education (e.g. related to reducing disparities and promoting epistemic and linguistic diversity); and, fifth, reform the vision and governance of SDG 4 by drawing on a “plurality of voices and knowledge systems.”</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0315" view="all">Interestingly, in addition to arguing that the current paradigm is an example of epistemic violence, each of the next two commentaries take the additional step of arguing that the ontological foundations of modernity—and thus modern states, not to mention global governance apparatuses—should be seen as central to the challenges facing the world today. The first of these two commentaries is written by Jeremy Rappleye, Iveta Silova, Hikaru Komatsu, and Keita Takayama (2023); the second by D. Brent Edwards Jr <ce:cross-ref id="cr0265" refid="bib8">(2024)</ce:cross-ref>. Through an examination of ontological foundations, they are able to center the individualism that has emerged from the overlapping histories of Christianity, the Enlightenment, capitalism and the French Revolution (i.e., liberalism). These foundations have led to a development paradigm that “has always promised to produce autonomous ‘agents’ who jettison embeddedness and embrace disembedded Reason to move us closer to … utopian future(s)” (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0270" refid="bib21">Rappeley et al., 2024</ce:cross-ref>). What is more, both commentaries remind us that the SDGs, not to mention the entire field of comparative and international education, are implicated in the continuation of the long-standing project of “modernization.” One consequence of this history is that development experts—incapable as they are to see or to grapple with their own ontological frameworks—are unable to perceive the limitations of the available studies on the causes of climate change (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0275" refid="bib21">Rappleye et al. 2024</ce:cross-ref>). Further to this end, Rappleye et al. turn the typical empiricist demand for data around by proposing that discussions of the connection between sustainability and modern education be based on evidence. From their perspective, the entire enterprise of the SDGs is built on a faith in the prevailing development model—unsupported by research—that does not lead to “greater social and environmental sustainability.” Or, in the case of Edwards’ commentary, it is shown that the language and assumptions of the SDGs—and of global governance—is trapped inside the layers of modernity mentioned above (i.e. Christianity, Enlightenment thinking, capitalism, and liberalism). Drawing on their previous studies, Rappleye et al. present suggestive findings that non-Western (and less individualistic countries) contribute less to climate change—and thus argue that what is needed going forward is to break with the modern paradigm of education and development in order to move towards other ways of seeing and being. Similarly, Edwards recurs to a Hawaiian worldview in order to provide an example of what it would mean to see (and to be) education, development, and ourselves differently, from a non-Western perspective.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0320" view="all">With the above in mind, <ce:cross-ref id="cr0280" refid="bib21">Rappleye et al. (2024)</ce:cross-ref> perceive that the “current SDG 4 indicators merely index progress towards the fulfillment of the modern paradigm.” In contrast, “development” should be defined by engaging with other worldviews and cosmologies—even if, as Edwards <ce:cross-ref id="cr0285" refid="bib8">(2024)</ce:cross-ref> argues, this means abandoning goals of a “global” nature that assume a single worldview rooted in modernity. This break may be what is necessary for those interested in operating outside the modern (i.e., colonial) framework and its foundations. However, as further explained in Edwards’ commentary:</ce:para>

Movements grounded in alternative onto-epistemologies have long worked outside the state, and continue to do so. Moreover, the idea that current structures of global governance cannot accommodate efforts to move beyond the Christian-positivist-liberal-capitalist foundations of modernity is not troublesome. Decolonial projects—i.e., those that pursue alternatives to the foundations just mentioned—do not seek to be measured by a common yardstick, that is, by global goals. The focus is on working in the cracks, in finding spaces and places to experiment with and to build alternatives, in addition to learning from difference on both micro and macro scales, that is, in the classroom but also in meetings between different groups that represent disparate perspectives in the broader ecology of knowledges.</ce:simple-para>

                  <ce:para id="p0330" view="all">The final two commentaries push the aforementioned conclusions a little further. On one hand, Emily Markovich Morris, Ghulam Omar Qargha, and Rebecca Winthrop <ce:cross-ref id="cr0290" refid="bib12">(2023)</ce:cross-ref> speak to the idea that education has many purposes and that, among other things, it should be culturally and spiritually sustaining. This dimension, they note, receives “insufficient consideration in global education conversations.” From their perspective, these conversations should be more attentive to “Indigenous pedagogies and philosophies education” and should seek to sustain and amplify “cultural knowledges and … the importance of developing relationships with oneself alongside one’s land and environment, community, culture, and faith.”</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0335" view="all">The final commentary dovetails with the previous one. In “Beyond sustainability: Indigenous Knowledge Systems for locally and globally renewing earth relations,” Elizabeth Sumida Huaman and Jonelle Walker <ce:cross-ref id="cr0295" refid="bib25">(2023)</ce:cross-ref> seek to “direct reader attention to Indigenous Knowledge Systems that interrupt mainstream definitions and applications of sustainable development through grounding in situ and close attention to contexts, cultural practices, and languages that propose human activity <ce:italic>for life’s sake</ce:italic>.” As Indigenous scholars—Quechua and Ojibwe, respectively—they “offer provocations for Indigenous educators and allies to draw from their senses of place to create learning opportunities that are based on regard for the spirit in all beings.” In doing so, their purpose is to propose a “comprehensive framework for education with and always mindful of Indigenous communities that emerges from and serves Indigenous Knowledge Systems and where education becomes a means of implementation for restorative and compassionate earth relations.” The underlying argument is that it is “illogical to restructure the material systems of the planet into an extractive model void of reciprocity and then act surprised when the bottom falls out” and that</ce:para>

They are intended to “fully attend to the workings of Indigenous communities as confluences of people and places” and to “offer ancestral and innovative philosophies and designs of education that are unwaveringly committed to (re)connection and to repairing severed ties between and among those people and places (<ce:cross-ref id="cr0300" refid="bib25">Sumida Huaman &amp; Walker, 2023</ce:cross-ref>).”</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0360" view="all">When it comes to SDG 4 and to conversations about education more broadly, the assertion of Huaman and Walker is that they both must be viewed as “inherently inextricable from comprehensive and relational definitions of land, law, health, technology, etc.” It is no surprise that these authors urge for discussions of education to “overcome western liberalism and human-centricity.” With the above in mind, Huaman and Walker conclude by writing the following:</ce:para>

                        <ce:simple-para id="sp0090" view="all">We advocate that sustainable development discussions and resulting policies and projects build on Indigenous research methodologies, including creating and nurturing careful debate and redefinition of SDGs according to Indigenous worldviews, value systems, and language principles. We also argue against universalizing human-centric metrics for SDGs and in favor of longitudinal approaches and support for place-based/place-mindful and Indigenous-led trial and error in land-based educational development, Indigenous knowledges education, and the pedagogies that result from these bold and necessary experiments.</ce:simple-para>

                  <ce:para id="p0370" view="all">What we have done in this introductory essay is provide a summary of the main arguments and conclusions of the contributions in this special issue. In the interest of space, we have only highlighted what we see as the key insights from each piece. The interested reader should refer to each of the commentaries for additional details and further development of the arguments discussed above.</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0375" view="all">It is to be expected—given the focus of this special issue—that many more questions may be generated than answered by the articles in this volume. We purposefully sought to bring together researchers and practitioners with different backgrounds, diverse commitments, and varying perspectives on the progress, problems, and underlying paradigm of SDG 4. In doing so, this special issue necessarily contains articles whose arguments do not align. We see this as fitting: the global governance of education is not a neat and tidy space. Disagreement is alive and well, just as the authors of this special issue make clear. The question for readers and for stakeholders is what should be done going forward—and at multiple levels. From the local to the global, key actors will be strategically engaged as they work together and/or in competition with one another. In assembling the essays in this special issue, we were interested to make available in one place a wide range of perspectives—to make them visible and available in the hopes that they can inform future discussion, debate, and “development.”</ce:para>
                  <ce:para id="p0380" view="all">Readers will have to decide for themselves which arguments they see as being more persuasive. We would also encourage readers to reflect on why one argument or line of reasoning may resonate more or less—and to consider what the cause of that resonance could be. In other words, each reader, each of us, also has work to do. You may ask yourself: Whose perspectives are left out by the position I take? What are the actions that seem most appropriate? What is the worldview and what are the assumptions that inform my responses? Our experience has been that there are no easy answers. The same is true of the questions raised by commentaries this special issue.</ce:para>
