                  Social media had been extensively used for communication and networking purposes among corporates. Literature indicates social media platforms had also been used by the firms for building relationship with different stakeholders (i.e. customers, employees, investors and neighbouring communities). But there exists a gap in literature, whether social capital present on social media can be used for building corporate reputation (CR) in the society. Literature indicates corporate social responsibility (CSR) impacts CR. Therefore this study explores how CSR messages on social media impacts CR. For this study assumption was made that all the concerns and issues raised by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the social responsibilities of the CEOs. The study tries to explore this gap by analysing the tweets posted by two group of CEOs, i.e. CEOs in top 200 fortune companies and top 100 social influencer CEOs. Top 100 social influencer CEOs on social media were identified from the Hootsuite.com. Social influencer CEOs are having tremendous amount of influence on Twitter. The statistically test performed on the two group of the CEOs depicts there is significant difference in the number of CSR messages posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs. Results reveals social influencer CEOs had posted 5.97 times more CSR messages on Twitter as compared to fortune CEOs, which in turn may had led to better CR, in terms of shares and likes by social capital present on Twitter. The study reveals may be social influencer CEOs through CSR messages are trying to engage stakeholders strategically on Twitter. This is an open question at present, therefore future researchers can explore this in more details. The managerial implication of the study for CEOs and firms had been highlighted in the study.

Vigneswara Ilavarasan  Information Systems area, DMS, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India Information Systems area DMS Indian Institute of Technology Delhi India   ⁎ Corresponding author.      Social media had been extensively used for communication and networking purposes among corporates. Literature indicates social media platforms had also been used by the firms for building relationship with different stakeholders (i.e. customers, employees, investors and neighbouring communities). But there exists a gap in literature, whether social capital present on social media can be used for building corporate reputation (CR) in the society. Literature indicates corporate social responsibility (CSR) impacts CR. Therefore this study explores how CSR messages on social media impacts CR. For this study assumption was made that all the concerns and issues raised by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the social responsibilities of the CEOs. The study tries to explore this gap by analysing the tweets posted by two group of CEOs, i.e. CEOs in top 200 fortune companies and top 100 social influencer CEOs. Top 100 social influencer CEOs on social media were identified from the Hootsuite.com. Social influencer CEOs are having tremendous amount of influence on Twitter. The statistically test performed on the two group of the CEOs depicts there is significant difference in the number of CSR messages posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs. Results reveals social influencer CEOs had posted 5.97 times more CSR messages on Twitter as compared to fortune CEOs, which in turn may had led to better CR, in terms of shares and likes by social capital present on Twitter. The study reveals may be social influencer CEOs through CSR messages are trying to engage stakeholders strategically on Twitter. This is an open question at present, therefore future researchers can explore this in more details. The managerial implication of the study for CEOs and firms had been highlighted in the study.   Keywords Leadership  Sustainability  Twitter  Social media  Corporate social responsibility  Corporate reputation    1 Introduction Corporate Social Responsibility  (CSR) initiatives had undergone a transformation from a voluntary adoption of the organization to the government regulating the actions of businesses (Albareda, Lozano, & Ysa, 2007 ). CSR tries to captures the most important concerns of the public regarding business and society relationships (Carroll, 1999 ). Carroll (1999)  points out CSR is an essential part of business practices and corporate communication. CSR activities effects the relationship between firm’s and their stakeholders (Albinger & Freeman, 2000 ; Bhattacharya, Korschun, & Sen, 2009 ; Turker, 2009 ). Literature indicates CSR expenditures may plays a significant role in stakeholder management (Brammer & Millington, 2005 ). Therefore there is a need for the firm’s to invest in CSR, for building organizational identity (Marin & Ruiz, 2007 ) and corporate reputation (Dijkmans, Kerkhof, & Beukeboom, 2015 ) within society. Corporate Reputation  (CR) is an umbrella concept, referring to the cumulative impressions of internal and external stakeholders (Chun, 2005 ). Corporate reputation had a positive influence on stakeholders satisfaction (Su, Swanson, Chinchanachokchai, Hsu, & Chen, 2016 ), commitment (Su et al., 2016 ), trust (Keh & Xie, 2009 ) and identification (Keh & Xie, 2009 ). There are some studies in literature which had measured the impact of CSR on CR (Eberle, Berens, & Li, 2013 ; Lin-Hi & Blumberg, 2018 ; Mitra, 2011 ). CSR messages had boosted CR, word of mouth and organizational identity. Literature suggests CSR communication on interactive channels can improve CR (Eberle et al., 2013 ). Therefore this study tries to investigate the impact of CSR messages, focusing on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on CR within an online environment, Twitter (in terms of sharing and liking). For this study an assumption was made that discussion on SDGs in social media are the social responsibilities of the CEOs. Such social discussions not only raises overall awareness on the SDGs among followers but also highlights the possibilities of the organization of the CEO to adopt suitable practices. For this investigation, two group of the CEOs, Fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs where considered. The list of Fortune 200 CEOs was used for searching the CEOs of Fortune 200 companies on Twitter whereas for the list of social influencer CEOs, the list published by Hootsuite was considered. Every year Fortune magazine creates a list of 500 largest companies, on the basis of the gross revenue figures available publicly (Fortune, 2018 ). Edgar P. Smith had first given the concept of Fortune 500 and first list was published in 1955 (The New York Times, 1989 ). Walmart, world's largest retailer had been ranked first in the list, followed by Exxon Mobil, Berkshire Hathaway, Apple and UnitedHealth Group. To best of our knowledge Fortune 500 is an extensive list for a researchers to get familiarize with largest and stable companies. Therefore authors had opted to study how Twitter is being used by the CEOs of these Fortune 200 companies (alias as Fortune CEOs) for communication related to CSR activities (Group 1). Hootsuite offers solutions in social media management of various accounts available on different dominant social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, Google + and much more from a single dashboard. Hootsuite has published a list of top 100 social influencer by examining their impact on society through social media platforms (alias as social influencer CEOs, Group 2). CEOs who are actively participating in social discussions and holds industry leadership qualities are ranked higher in the list. Richard Branson, chairman, and founder of Virgin Group ranked first in the list, followed by Bill Gates, Technology advisor of Microsoft and Co-chair of Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. Arianna Huffington had been given the third position on the list, the first woman CEO on the list. Arianna Huffington is a co-founder, president and editor in chief of AOL Huffington post media group. The 100th rank on the list is occupied by John Chen, CEO and executive chairman of Blackberry. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by United Nations (UN) provide guidelines for the member countries to move towards sustainable and equitable society and have long-term implications for the business firms. Multinational enterprises can use SDGs as a guideline to invest in sustainable development while pursuing their own business interests (Chakravorti, 2017 ). The framework for achieving SDGs is kept robust enough to include complexities and dimensions of sustainable development so that nations could adopt the goals with implementation strategies based on scope and context. These SDGs are comprehensively explained with 17 goals defined with 169 targets along with 230 indicators (Jerven, 2017 ). Twitter is a microblogging service, started in 2006, to enable users to share content within a limit of 140 characters, now upgraded to 280 characters. The discussions are normally available in the public domain unless protected. As of 3rd  quarter, 2018, Twitter has 326 million active users (Statista, 2018 ). Every day, around 500 million tweets are created (Internet live stats, 2018 ). Twitter has been used by firms for multiple functions such as marketing (Aswani, Kar, Ilavarasan, & Dwivedi, 2018 ; Pacauskas, Rajala, Westerlund, & Mäntymäki, 2018 ), branding, deliberation on political (Grover, Kar, Dwivedi, & Janssen, 2018 ) and social concerns (Karami, Dahl, Turner-McGrievy, Kharrazi, & Shaw, 2018 ; Rathore, Kar, & Ilavarasan, 2017 ; Rathore, Tuli, & Ilavarasan, 2016 ), in emergency situation (Kim, Bae, & Hastak, 2018 ; Li, Zhang, Tian, & Wang, 2018 ; Martínez-Rojas, del Carmen Pardo-Ferreira, & Rubio-Romero, 2018 ; Son, Lee, Jin, & Lee, 2019 ), and for building public relation (Capriotti & Ruesja, 2018 ). CEOs also use twitter to interact with different stakeholders (Alghawi, Yan, & Wei, 2014 ; Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010 ). Literature indicates social media is a powerful tool for empowering humans (Jones, Temperley, & Lima, 2009 ). The current study thus uses Twitter data for the following reasons. Firstly, twitter data can be accessed freely through Twitter application programming interface (API). The tweets can be downloaded around themes, keywords or timelines and can be analysed objectively. In this study tweets had been downloaded from CEOs timelines. Secondly, Twitter is one of the fastest growing social media platforms with a very high number of users and reach. Thirdly users in Twitter follow others, post, like and share their updates publicly, more frequently than that on other platforms like Facebook. Fourthly, user-generated content in Twitter is indexed in organic search results, and thus have higher visibility. This article contributes to the existing literature by discussing following, firstly, CR can be built in the society by using the social capital present on Twitter as showcased by social influencer CEOs in the study; secondly, CSR messages posted on the social media can be beneficial for the society (in terms of awareness), if the message is of the social value. The reaction of the users on the tweets had been recorded in terms of number of the retweets and likes. Corporates will be benefited by building good reputation; whereas society will be benefited by getting aware / knowledge / learning of sustainability issues and concerns. Thirdly, SDGs messages when posted by CEOs can lead to higher level of social participation and engagement on SDGs (Vaast, Safadi, Lapointe, & Negoita, 2017 ). Based on 196,644 tweets posted by 93 CEOs (16 fortune CEOs and 77 social influencer CEOs), the paper offers insights on how CSR messages on social media can leads to CR. The paper consists of nine sections. The first section introduces the study. The second section elaborates the theoretical background required for the study. The third section discusses SDGs. The fourth section presents social capital theory as the theoretical lens and discusses the hypothesis for the study. The fifth section describes the research approach followed. The sixth section presents results of analysis performed. The seventh section discusses the implication of the findings. The eighth section contains the conclusions for the study followed by the limitations of the study.  2 Literature review – background context The theoretical background section has been divided into four sub-sections. The first sub-section provides an overview of CSR along with its impact on different stakeholders. The second sub-section gives brief overview of CR along with its impact on different stakeholders. The third section tries to explain the linkage between CSR and CR, followed by the research gap and contributions of the study. 2.1 Corporate social responsibility (CSR) CSR is an obligation for the firms towards stakeholder constituent groups in the society (Jones, 1980 ; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001 ). Dominant stakeholders for the firms are customers, employees, investors and communities (Jones, 1980 ; Maignan, 2001 ; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001 ; Turker, 2009 ). Governments has an asymmetric effect on the firms which strongly influences firms for adopting minimum standards of CSR but for adopting best practices of CSR, there is very little influence on the firms (Jackson & Apostolakou, 2010 ). The government develops CSR policies: (a) to improve social responsibility among corporates; (b) to improve business practices; (c) to improve the awareness among stakeholders; (d) to improve collaboration between firms, government and civil society stakeholders (Albareda et al., 2007 ). Four types of CSR strategies had been indicated in literature, namely, obstructionist, defensive, accommodative, and proactive strategies (Lee, 2011 ). Firms following obstructionist strategy completely reject social and ethical responsibility that lie outside their economic activities. Firms following defensive strategy reject the ethical responsibility. Firms following accommodative strategy follow legal responsibility and accept some of the ethical responsibility towards the stakeholders. Proactive firms recognize their social responsibility and engage with stakeholders for social welfare. Table 1   outlines the impact of the CSR activities on different stakeholders along with literature evidences. CSR engagement positively influences (a) operating performance of the firm (Harjoto & Jo, 2011 ); (b) financial performance of the firm (Crespo & del Bosque, 2005 ; Rettab, Brik, & Mellahi, 2009 ; Van Beurden & Gössling, 2008 ); (c) employee commitment (Rettab et al., 2009 ); and (d) corporate reputation (Dijkmans et al., 2015 ; Rettab et al., 2009 ). CSR activities create and nurture consumers' trust in the firm (Park, Lee, & Kim, 2014 ). CSR leads to stronger loyalty among customers (Marin, Ruiz, & Rubio, 2009 ). Consumers in US highly value corporate economic responsibilities whereas consumers in French and German are more concern about legal and ethical standards followed by the businesses (Maignan, 2001 ). High levels of CSR activities has the ability to attract the most qualified employees for the jobs (Albinger & Freeman, 2000 ; Branco & Rodrigues, 2006 ). Choice of CSR activities is positively associated with governance characteristics of the firms such as board independence, institutional ownership, and many more (Harjoto & Jo, 2011 ). A higher CSR rating is positively related to rapid growth in online presence (Lee, Oh, & Kim, 2013 ). Further CSR activities may help firms in developing new resources and capabilities. Literature suggests firms with good social responsibility reputation can improve their relations with public (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006 ) and also have a direct influence on the investment decisions and perception of the firm (Chun, 2005 ).  2.2 Corporate reputation Corporate reputation is an intangible asset for the firms (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006 ; Wei, Ouyang, & Chen, 2017 ). Chun (2005)  defines corporate reputation as the cumulative perceptions of the firms held by all relevant stakeholders, whereas Branco and Rodrigues (2006)  suggests corporate reputation of the firm depends on stakeholder engagement and corporate disclosures. Image and identity are the main components of reputation (Chun, 2005 ). Literature indicates three attributes of reputation (Duhé, 2009 ): (a) management quality; (b) financial soundness; and (c) social responsibility. Corporate reputation contributes towards relationship building (Su et al., 2016 ). Corporate reputation has an impact on stakeholders of the firms. Different stakeholders of the firm’s presented in Table 2  , along with their impacts as suggested by literature. Corporate reputation leverages trust, satisfaction, loyalty and brand equity in customers. Good corporate reputation increases the potential of the firm for attracting better qualified employees. Higher level of the corporate reputation lead to favourability among public. Firm’s survival in the society is heavily depended on developing and maintaining reputation (Gray & Balmer, 1998 ) among customers, employees, investors and neighbouring communities. Literature indicates how crisis situation for the firm had been negatively related to firm’s reputation (Claeys, Cauberghe, & Vyncke, 2010 ; Kim, 2014 ). Firm's violation of government regulations can diminish their reputation in the society (Williams & Barrett, 2000 ). A good reputation enhances the ability of the firm to attract lower cost capital (Caruana & Ewing, 2010 ). There is a need for the managers to cultivate the firm’s reputation in the society for different stakeholders as highlighted in Table 2 .  2.3 Relationship between corporate social responsibility and corporate reputation Both CSR and CR has a positive impact on customers and leverages their trust (Agarwal, Osiyevskyy, & Feldman, 2015 ; Keh & Xie, 2009 ; Park et al., 2014 ) and satisfaction (Chun, 2005 ; Marin et al., 2009 ; Su et al., 2016 ) for the products or services provided by the firm. For potential customers CSR builds the reputation of the firms (Castaldo, Perrini, Misani, & Tencati, 2009 ; Dusuki & Abdullah, 2007 ; Marin et al., 2009 ; Park et al., 2014 ), which indeed lead to better firm identification (Keh & Xie, 2009 ; Wei et al., 2017 ). CSR and CR both enhances brand equity among customers (Caruana & Ewing, 2010 ; Heinberg, Ozkaya, & Taube, 2018 ). CSR activities motivates employees (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006 ) and increases their organizational commitment (Turker, 2009 ) among current employees. This leads to positive relationship bond between employees and the organization (Kim, Lee, Lee, & Kim, 2010 ). This also enlarges the job satisfaction within the individuals (Valentine & Fleischman, 2008 ); whereas CR leads to employee retention within an organization (Su et al., 2016 ). Both CSR and CR attracts better and qualified employees (Albinger & Freeman, 2000 ; Branco & Rodrigues, 2006 ; Wang, 2013 ). CSR leads to reduction in risk due to firm stock prices which indeed can lead to effective communication of the management with investors (Dhaliwal, Li, Tsang, & Yang, 2011 ; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009 ). Literature indicates if a firm have good corporate reputation in a market, then firms can take an effective decision on the choice of investment (Caruana & Ewing, 2010 ). Both CSR and CR builds the organizational identity of the firm in neighbouring communities (Dijkmans et al., 2015 ; Marin & Ruiz, 2007 ) which can lead to generalized favourability towards the firms (Agarwal et al., 2015 ; Wei et al., 2017 ). Thus all the above evidences indicates there is a link between CSR and CR; literature also indicates CSR activities had a direct and positive effect on corporate reputation (Park et al., 2014 ). CSR and CR relationship had been illustrated in literature, some of the references are listed below: (a) firms with higher levels of philanthropic expenditures have better reputations in society (Brammer & Millington, 2005 ); (b) socially oriented companies can successfully leverage their reputation in community (Castaldo et al., 2009 ); (c) reputation perceptions driven by nonfinancial aspects are given more value (Raithel & Schwaiger, 2015 ); (d) CSR must be utilized when a company has a good reputation and no crisis (Shim & Yang, 2016 ); and (e) literature indicates there is a need for CSR for claiming counter to negative publicity (Vanhamme & Grobben, 2009 ). However, the factors affecting this relationship is yet to be explored in existing literature for social media ecosystem.  2.4 Social media Social media had been used for promoting awareness among public on various issues related to people planet, policy and human conditions. Some of the issues related to people which had been extensively published on social media is related to electronic cigarettes (Harris et al., 2014 ), social tensions (Burnap et al., 2015 ), diseases (Al-Taee & Abood, 2012 ) such as, swine flu in 2009 (Kostkova, Szomszor, & St Louis, 2014 ); ebola in 2014 (Odlum & Yoon, 2015 ); and zika virus in 2016 (Sharma, Yadav, Yadav, & Ferdinand, 2017 ). Social media data had been extensively used for analysing voting behavior (Burnap, Gibson, Sloan, Southern, & Williams, 2016 ; Grover, Kar, Dwivedi, Janssen, 2018 ); identifying and measuring behaviour and preference transitions (Aswani, Kar, & Ilavarasan, 2018 ; Joseph, Kar, Ilavarasan, & Ganesh, 2017 ; Lakhiwal and Kar, 2016 ) and social media marketing (Grover & Kar, 2018 ). Twitter helps in sharing information and gathering advice from large groups of stakeholders with minimal effort. Twitter discussions also influence the users (Sedera, Lokuge, Atapattu, & Gretzel, 2017 ). Users influence on Twitter can be measured by measuring retweets and like (Paniagua & Sapena, 2014 ; Perdana & Pinandito, 2018 ). Among social media platform, Twitter had been chosen for the exploration undertaken in the study because, firstly, these channels escalates the messages across the world within few seconds (Prøitz, 2017 ); secondly, engagement on social media had been positively related to corporate reputation (Dijkmans et al., 2015 ); thirdly, Twitter has a strong influence on business activities (Paniagua & Sapena, 2014 ); fourthly, literature indicates CSR communication through social media increases stakeholder engagement (Zizka, 2017 ); fifthly, social media provides a framework where firm’s reputation can be co-created by the stakeholders (Jones et al., 2009 ); sixthly, because social media affects firm’s relationship with society (Paniagua & Sapena, 2014 ); Literature indicates 3.45% and 7.06% of posts on Twitter and Facebook are related to corporate disclosures (Zhou, Lei, Wang, Fan, & Wang, 2014 ). Twitter user’s response to these disclosure within 13 min on an average whereas Facebook user’s response to these disclosure within 25 min (Zhou et al., 2014 ). Engagement is the major factor that influence firms' reputation in the market (Li, Berens, & de Maertelaere, 2013 ). Literature also highlights that firms are not using social media much for communication related to CSR activities (Jones et al., 2009 ). Literature indicates firms are using social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter for business and advertising communication, but not for CSR communication (Ros-Diego & Castelló-Martínez, 2012 ). Social media features like Facebook pages could be effective channels for forming and enhancing CSR reputation (Lee, 2016 ).  2.5 Literature gap CSR communication through social media can increase stakeholder engagement (Zizka, 2017 ) which can in turn lead to positive corporate reputation (Dijkmans et al., 2015 ). Chen (2009)  had highlighted organizations can form the networks in social media for discussing topics on CSR. Therefore this study tries to explore this knowledge gap: whether the CSR messages posted by the firms on social media can bring reputation to the firm or not. This study focus on the below research question: 2.5.1 Literature gap: can CSR messages on social media leads to CR? For investigating this research questions this study tries to explore fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs SDGs posts impact on their reputation in terms of sharing and liking among public. Fig. 1   outlines the conceptual concept and investigation undertaken in the study. For this study assumption was made all the concerns and issues raised by SDGs are the social responsibilities of the CEOs. For exploring this research question three hypothesis had been framed and discussed in Section 4 .    3 Sustainable development goals Sustainable development is a strategy which helps the people to meet the current needs without compromising on future generation’s need (Campbell, 2017 ). The sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by United Nations in 2015 provides guideline to move towards sustainable and equitable society and have long-term implications for the firms. Multinational enterprises can use the SDGs as a guideline to invest in sustainable development while pursuing their own business interests (Chakravorti, 2017 ). There were seventeen SDG goals had been proposed by UN, these are: no poverty (NOPO); zero hunger (ZERO); good health and well-being (GOOD); quality education (QUAL); gender equality (GEND); clear water and sanitation (CLEA); affordable and clean energy (AFFO); decent work and economic growth (DECE); industry, innovation and infrastructure (INDU); reduced inequalities (REDU); sustainable cities and communities (SUST); responsible consumption and production (RESP); climate action (CLIM); life below water (LIFW); life on land (LIFL); peace justice and strong institutions (PEAC); and partnerships for the goals (PART). The SDG guidelines cannot bound any organizations directly, but member countries, being signatories, can promote them through regulatory intervention. The largest barrier of the sustainability is poverty, which can be reduced by applying the sound business thinking (World Business Council for Sustainable Development, 2002 ). Therefore authors of the study feels CEOs can improve the awareness regarding the sustainability development goals among public, because they create opportunities for employment. Investing in the environmental measures could improve the quality and cost performances of the firms as well (Pullman, Maloni, & Carter, 2009 ). Regional inequality can be reduced by economic development and can contribute positively towards sustainability (Ye, Ma, Ye, Chen, & Xie, 2017 ). Thus these evidences indicates firms can play a big role in attaining sustainability in the society. SDGs are applicable to the whole world and includes wider range of issues for corporate firms which is targeted to be met by 2030 (Campbell, 2017 ). The sustainability component is indispensable for the firms if they need to survive and needs profit for a longer time. Literature indicates managers should satisfy six criteria’s for corporate sustainability: eco-efficiency, socio-efficiency, eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency and ecological equity (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002 ). Sustainable development can be achieved through education (Bell et al., 2017 ), competitive international markets (World Business Council for Sustainable Development, 2002 ), economic development (Ye et al., 2017 ) and through local authorities emphasizing on sustainability (Tessema, 2017 ). In present scenario, it was felt that the interest of the CEOs on different SDGs will be different. For example, “Industry, innovation and infrastructure” will be more popular among CEOs because of direct impact on their nature of work whereas many CEOs will be less concerned about SDGs such as “Life below water” unless there is direct impact on the business activities. Therefore it was necessary to explore whether CSR messages on the social media can bring CR for the firms or not. Therefore Twitter posts of fortune CEOs (already having good reputation in society) and social influencer CEOs (aiming to build good reputation in society) related to SDGs had been analysed.  4 Theoretical lens and hypothesis development Firm’s needs to invest in CSR for building organizational identity within the society (Marin & Ruiz, 2007 ). Therefore this study tries to investigate whether SDGs messages posted by fortune and social influencer CEOs on Twitter raises their reputation within virtual community by attracting more shares and likes. Social capital theory (Thakur & Hale, 2013 ; Zheng, Li, Wu, & Xu, 2014 ) had been used as the theoretical lens for framing the hypothesis for the study. Putnam (1993)  defines social capital as the social organization of the networks, norms, and trust which facilitates coordination and cooperation among public for mutual benefit; whereas, Adler and Kwon (2002)  says social capital is the goodwill available to an individuals. The goodwill can be used by the individuals for information sharing, influencing and for achieving common goals. Social capital of an individual depends on two factors: (a) the position of an individual within the network; and (b) access to weaker ties; (Burt, 2000 ). Social capital can be built over the time (Pruijt, 2002 ). Social capital is for both public as well as for private good (Pruijt, 2002 ; Putnam, 1993 ). Social capital approach can help us in formulating new strategies for development within minority communities, public education, sustainable and safer world (Putnam, 1993 ). Literature points out social capital is a source for (a) sustainability; (b) competitive advantage; (c) service success; for a firm and provides more opportunity if used strategically (Thakur & Hale, 2013 ). Information sharing within virtual communities (Pinjani & Palvia, 2013 ) depends on three dimensions i.e. structural (social ties), relational (identity, trust and reciprocity) and cognitive (shared resources i.e. language and vision) (Chiu, Hsu, & Wang, 2006 ; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998 ). Social interaction ties and reciprocity increases the quantity of information shared by an individual (Chiu et al., 2006 ). Social media enables rapid growth of messages around the world (Prøitz, 2017 ). CSR rating of the company had been positively related to media exposure (Reverte, 2009 ). Therefore hypothesis H1, tries to examine the fortune CEOs and social influencers CEOs frequency of the post related to SDGs on Twitter.H1 There is no statistically significant difference in tweeting on SDGs by fortune CEOs and social influencers CEOs.   Crespo and del Bosque (2005)  had suggested a firm should communicate its social orientation and environmental involvement intelligently to the public. There is a need for the firms to satisfy stakeholder demands of CSR (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001 ). On the other hand, some study points out social-media amplifies the need for corporate reputation practices (Rokka, Karlsson, & Tienari, 2014 ). Firms are not using social web for communicating their social responsibility (Jones et al., 2009 ). Literature indicates positives and negatives, therefore hypothesis H2 and H3 had been framed neutral. But authors of this study believes in as suggested by Gray and Balmer (1998)  firm’s survival in a society highly depends on recognizable image and good corporate reputation. Firms using Twitter can disseminate information and can promote products and services with minimal efforts. Engagement on social media had been positively related to corporate reputation (Dijkmans et al., 2015 ). Retweets induces higher social presence (Lim & Lee-Won, 2017 ). Literature points out users on Twitter retweet those tweets which they find interesting and important (Abdullah, Nishioka, Tanaka, & Murayama, 2015 ). Tweets expressing certainty are retweeted more as compared to the others (Runge et al., 2013 ). The second and third hypothesis tries to investigates whether there is any impact on sharing and liking of the tweet among different stakeholders when fortune and social influencer CEOs post something related to SDG’s. To best of our knowledge there is no study in existing literature which had tried to explore hypothesis, H2 and H3 before but there are some indication in existing literature.H2 There is no statistically significant difference in sharing of SDGs tweets posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs.   Likes within Twitter ecosystem are mechanism to show appreciation for the authors who had posted the tweet (Perdana & Pinandito, 2018 ). Like count also known as the favourite count. Like count had been used in the literature for analysing popularity of the posts (Shahzad et al., 2017 ). Like count had been positively related to retweets (Bhattacharya, Srinivasan, & Polgreen, 2014 ). Paniagua and Sapena (2014)  had pointed out likes positively influences firm’s share value.H3 There is no statistically significant difference in liking of SDGs tweets posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs.   Twitter had been useful in information propagation and communication purposes (Gao, Barbier, & Goolsby, 2011 ; Yoo, Rand, Eftekhar, & Rabinovich, 2016 ). Wu and Shen (2015)  indicates sharing on Twitter as an important mechanism for information propagation in society. Information propagation depends on the author’s follower count (Wu & Shen, 2015 ) and its influence within the online community (Yoo et al., 2016 ). Therefore hypothesis H4, tries to propose for all CEOs when they post on any of the group of SDGs (i.e. ethical, legal and economic), there is equal possibility of propagation in each group.H4 When all the CEOs discuss about the SDGs, there is no statistically significant difference based on group of SDGs and possibility of propagation.   CSR includes following responsibilities, i.e. ethical, legal, and economic (Carroll, 1991 ; Schwartz & Carroll, 2003 ). Ethical responsibilities focus on a voluntary commitment by the firms for public welfare. The legal responsibilities suggests firms should work according to the regulatory framework set by the governments. The economic responsibilities includes activities link to earning, profit, efficiency and competitive spirit of a firm within an industry.  5 Research approach The empirical research like surveys, focus groups, interviews and qualitative case studies cannot be applied for exploring research question mentioned in the study due to social desirability biases inherent in the objectives. If the survey will be designed for the study than there is a high probability that respondent of the study, i.e. fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs will not answer the survey or respond in lines of socially desirable responses. Therefore this study uses the Twitter profile of CEOs because CEOs’ tweets would indicate the leadership’s position on SDGs on a more personal and value level, which will eventually present the way firms would operate under their leadership. The tweets posted by firms had not be used because many firms holds multiple accounts on Twitter and they are managed by professionals to have higher multiple stakeholder orientation. If the company social media profile is chosen, this may lead to biases in findings as more skilfully crafted communications suited for customers and shareholders would be analysed. This section on research methodology had been divided into the two subsection. The first subsection tries to illustrate the way data had been collected for the study. The second subsection explains the way tweets had been categorized to different SDGs using dictionary method pointed out by Grimmer and Stewart (2013) ; for automatic content analysis. 5.1 Data collection In this study data collection has been done in two ways. In the first way, fortune 200 CEO’s were searched on Twitter, by putting CEO name, firm name and Twitter within Google search box. The first two pages of Google search results were screened for CEO’s Twitter profile. For all those CEO’s present on Twitter their tweets were scraped for further analysis. This dataset will be used as the first dataset (group 1) for the study (named as, Fortune CEOs). In the second way, a list of top 100 social influencer CEOs on social media were identified from the Hootsuite.com (Hootsuite Blog, 2016 ). These CEOs were searched on Twitter. The tweets present on their timelines were extracted for the further analysis. This dataset will be the second dataset (group 2) for the study (alias as, social influencers CEOs). In the initial round of the data collection authors had decided to search for only top 100 fortune CEOs only, but among top 100 fortune CEOs only 10 CEOs were actively present on Twitter and these CEOs are not in the list of social influencer CEOs. In comparison to the sample collected for social influencer CEOs, fortune CEOs sample was very small therefore authors had decided to extent the search of the fortune CEOs on Twitter to fortune 200 CEOs. Among top fortune 200 CEOs only 35 CEOs were present on Twitter. In these 35 CEOs only 27 CEOs were active on twitter. Beyond fortune 200 CEOs it was not feasible for the researchers to search for each fortune CEO, to search on Twitter, therefore fortune CEOs search had been limited to fortune 200 only. Among 100 social influencers CEOs only 91 CEOs were present on Twitter at the time of data collection. In these 88 CEOs were active on Twitter. Non active CEOs were removed from both the datasets. After removing non-active CEOs, there were 11 CEOs which were present in both the datasets. These were Timothy D. Cook (Apple), Mary T. Barra (General Motors), Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Michael S. Dell (Dell Technologies), Mark T. Bertolini (Aetna), Bruce D. Broussard (Humana), Charles H. Robbins (Cisco Systems), Mark V. Hurd (Oracle), Stephen J . Easterbrook (McDonald’s), Gary C. Kelly (Southwest Airlines) and Jonas Prising (ManpowerGroup). CEOs common in both the dataset were removed from the datasets because authors of the study feels these can affect in the testing of hypothesis, H1, H2 and H3. Twitter API had been used to facilitate the data collection for the study. Biggest limitation faced in data collection, was that Twitter allows only 3200 latest tweets to be extracted even though when a CEO may have published more than 3200 tweets. The tweets extracted in both the datasets contains five variables, tweet identification number, creation date, tweet content (alias as text), tweet sharing count (alias as retweet_count) and tweet bookmarking count (alias as favorite_count). After following the above process in fortune CEOs dataset there were only 16 CEOs; and in social influencer dataset there were only 77 CEOs. For fortune CEOs 5699 tweets were collected and for social influencer CEOs 190,945 tweets were collected. In total this study tries to analyse 196,644 tweets by 93 CEOs.  5.2 Data analysis The current study adopts a mixed research methodology. The paper used selective methods from social media analytics (Brandt, Bendler, & Neumann, 2017 ; Fan & Yan, 2015 ; Grover & Kar, 2017 ; Grover, Kar, & Davies, 2018 ; Grover, Kar, & Ilavarasan, 2018 ) emerging out of computer science discipline and combined them with conventional data analysis approaches from social science research methodologies to derive the required insights. Majority of the methods discussed here are derived from data science approaches highlighted in reviews of social media analytics (Rathore et al., 2017 ), big data analytics (Grover & Kar, 2017 ) and other techniques based on machine learning (Chakraborty & Kar, 2016 ; Kar, 2016 ). Content analysis method was applied to recognize salient elements of the CEO’s views regarding SDGs on Twitter. Content analysis includes techniques from the domain of natural language processing and text mining. Content analysis (Kassarjian, 1977 ) is the way by which the qualitative data can be converted into the quantitative data based on the inherent semantics (meaning) of the content. The conversion helps in analysis of the data using statistical approaches and its subsequent understanding (Krippendorff, 2004 ). Hopkins and King (2010)  indicates it is infeasible to hand code unstructured text and highlights the significance of how computer scientists have methods for automated content analysis for handling high data volumes. For this study automated content analysis had been used. In literature automated content analysis had been refer to as automatic textual analysis also. Automated text analysis reduces the costs for analysing large collections of the tweets (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013 ) and automatically track linguistic patterns across large amounts of the textual data. Grimmer and Stewart (2013)  had outlined methods to convert textual data in numbers. Among those methods, dictionary method had been used for classifying tweets into categories. Dictionary method classifies documents into categories on the basis of the keywords appear in a text. For this study a codebook containing rules for categorization was prepared, by referring to the guidelines given by United Nation on SDGs along with keeping 169 indicators proposed by United Nations in mind. For this study problem-specific dictionary had been created by taking the expert opinions. The experts belongs to the field of information communication. The dictionary is presented in the Appendix A. A tweet is an informal unstructured content consisting of the text, images, hyperlinks, hashtags and much more. Therefore to extract useful information from the tweets before processing cleaning is required. The tweets collated from the platform were cleaned and all the words in the tweets were transformed into lowercase. Each word with a SDGs category had been given equal weightage, of one each. Each tweet of a CEO was screened. If a tweet contains any of the word mention underneath SDG mention in Appendix A than that tweet had been categorized as belonging to SDG mention at the top. Table 3   contains the two column where column 1, contains the tweet from the sample collected and column 2, contains the coded category of the SDGs. For example, Michael J. Jackson CEO of AutoNation had retweeted “RT @CBSMiami: AutoNation kicks off 'Drive Pink' campaign aiming to raise $5 million for fighting cancer #AutoNation #DrivePink #Cancer”. This tweet had been categorized to GOOD because it is containing term cancer. If any tweet contains the words of two different SDGs, than that tweet had been counted as only one for testing hypothesis H1, H2 and H3. The three variables such as SDGfrequency, SDGsharing and SDGbookmarking was computed for each CEO. SDGfrequency records the total frequency of tweets which had been posted by the CEO in relation to SDGs. SDGsharing contains the total number of the retweets on SDG tweets posted by CEO. SDGsharing contains the total number of the likes on SDG tweets posted by CEO. Once these variables had been computed for each CEOs, for further analysis CEOs were grouped in two groups of fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs. For checking the statistical significance of the groups there was a need to apply statistical tests, either parametric or non-parametric. Therefore to decide, normality and homogeneity of the above variables were tested. For testing normality, Kolmogorov-Smirnov was applied. For testing homogeneity levene statistic was applied. The test reveals the variables computed were neither normal nor homogeneous completely. The conditions of parametric test was not satisfied. Therefore t -test cannot be applied. Therefore alternative of t -test, non-parametric test Mann-Whitney was applied for checking the statistical significance of the two groups (i.e. hypothesis, H1, H2 and H3). For testing hypothesis H4, Kruskal-Wallis H test was applied. Also for testing the fourth hypothesis, fuzzy set theory has been used (Dubois, 1980 ; Klir and Yuan, 1995 ; Zadeh, 1965 ). Fuzzy set has been used for assigning the membership to SDGs for their belonging to different CSR responsibilities i.e. ethical, legal and economic. For the mapping of SDGs with the groups, consensus was sought from the four experts. After the achievement of consensus, to each SDG, a membership grade ranging between zero and one had been applied for each group. These four experts had an average of over 14 years of research experience in the domain, where they were working as academicians. SDGs belonging to only one group of CSR responsibility, had been assigned as membership equal to one for that group, for the rest of the CSR responsibility the SDGs have been assigned membership equal to zero. For example, according to experts opinion, SDG INDU, is purely economic responsibility, therefore for INDU, membership is equal to zero for ethical and legal; and membership is equal to one for economic. SDG belonging to two groups of CSR responsibility, had been assigned as membership equal to 0.5 for each group, for the rest of the CSR responsibility the SDGs had been assigned membership equal to zero. For example, according to the experts opinion SDG DECE, is ethical and economic responsibility, therefore for DECE, membership is equal to 0.5 for ethical and economic; and membership is equal to zero for legal. SDG belonging to three group of CSR responsibility, had been assigned as membership equal to 0.33 for each group. For example, according to the experts opinion SDG REDU, is ethical, legal and economic responsibility, therefore for REDU, membership is equal to 0.33 for ethical, legal and economic.   6 Finding and analysis Only 17.5% of top 200 fortune CEOs are present on Twitter. Among those fortune CEOs present on Twitter only 77.14% CEOs were active on Twitter. Among 91% of social influencers CEOs were present on Twitter from those 96.70% of social influencer CEOs were active on Twitter. The sample reveals on an average fortune CEOs has tweeted 44.06 related to SDGs whereas social influencer CEOs had tweeted 263.25 on an average. This may be because, overall social influencer CEOs had tweeted more as compared to fortune CEOs. The Fig. 2  , presents SDGs wise percentage of CEOs had tweeted related to SDGs. All CEOs in both the groups had tweeted on INDU and REDU. For QUAL around 97% of the social influencer CEOs had tweeted whereas for fortune CEOs it had been drastically drop to 44%. Fortune CEOs in the sample had not tweeted related to CLEA, LIFW and LIFL SDGs whereas sample indicates social influencer CEOs had tweeted for all the SDGs. SDG LIFW had been least tweeted by social influencers. Tweeting frequency of fortune CEOs and social influencers CEOs towards SDGs was tested. For fortune CEOs only 16 participants’ count of the SDGs tweets was computed. For the second sample, social influencer CEOs only 77 participants’ count of the SDGs tweets was computed.H1 There is no statistically significant difference in tweeting on SDGs by fortune CEOs and social influencers CEOs.   A Mann-Whitney test indicated that SDG related tweets was greater for social influencer CEOs (Mdn = 234 ) than for fortune CEOs (Mdn = 9 ) on Twitter; U = 97.500, p<0.001 . Thus there was a significant difference in the count of the SDGs tweets posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs on Twitter. Fig. 3  , the innermost circle contains the name of the SDGs. The middle circle contains the number of the CEOs tweeted related to SDG in the innermost circle, connected by the edge. The outer most circle contains the number of times tweets posted by CEOs had been retweeted, the numbers in Fig. 3 (b) are in thousands. For example for fortune CEOs (figure a), GEND (SDG) — 1–285 indicates that on gender equality, 1 fortune CEO had tweeted and it had been shared 285 times on Twitter. For example for social influencer CEOs (figure b), GEND (SDG) — 11 — 2 thousand indicates that on gender equality, 11 social influencer CEOs had tweeted. There tweets had been shared more than two thousand times on Twitter. Thus Fig. 3 , presents the retweeting power of the CEOs for each SDGs. The Fig. 3 (a) illustrates, fortune CEOs has maximum retweeting frequency for REDU and minimum for NOPO and DECE whereas Fig. 3 (b) illustrates, social influencer CEOs has maximum retweeting power for REDU followed by QUAL. Social influencer CEOs has minimum retweeting power for PART followed by LIFL. Fig. 4  , presents the sharing per tweet ratio for SDGs related tweets posted by fortune (in green bars) and social influencer (in blue bar) CEOs. The average of both bars had been indicated with yellow line. For any SDG related tweet posted by social influencer CEOs, a CEO gets 624 retweets on an average whereas for fortune CEOs only 47 retweets. Result indicates there is huge difference in sharing power of both group CEOs. Therefore to statistically validate the same H2 had been proposed and tested, using non-parametric Mann Whitney test.H2 There is no statistically significant difference in sharing of SDGs tweets posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs.   A Mann-Whitney test indicated that mean sharing of the SDG related tweets was greater for social influencer CEOs (Mdn = 117.557 ) than for fortune CEOs (Mdn = 25.818 ) on Twitter; U = 396.00, p=0.025 . Thus on the basis of Mann-Whitney test hypothesis H2 is rejected and it had been proved that there is a significant difference in sharing of SDG related tweets posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs on Twitter. Fig. 5  , presents the likes SDGs related tweets posted by fortune CEOs (in column 1) and social influencer CEOs (in column 2). The average of both had been computed in column 3. For any SDG related tweet posted by social influencer CEOs, a CEO gets 3535.63 likes on an average whereas for fortune CEOs only 54.69 likes. Result indicates there is huge difference in number of likes. Therefore to statistically validate the same H3 had been proposed and tested, using non-parametric Mann Whitney test.H3 There is no statistically significant difference in liking of SDGs tweets posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs.   There was no significant difference in the mean liking of the SDG related tweets by fortune CEOs (Mdn = 52.645 ) and social influencer CEOs (Mdn = 16.337 ) on Twitter; U = 477.000, z=-1.415, ns . Therefore H3 is not rejected and we conclude there is no statistically significant difference in gathering likes for the SDGs related tweets posted by fortune and social influencer CEOs. For investigating the hypothesis H4, SDGs on the basis of four expert opinions had been mapped to CSR responsibilities present in Fig. 6  . For expert opinions on SDG to CSR responsibilities Appendix A had been shared by them. In the first around all experts has consensus on mapping for 9 SDGs to CSR responsibilities. For the rest of the 6 SDGs, to meet the consensus of majority of the experts, Appendix A was circulated again along with the expert opinions on mapping. Further on these SDGs a small group discussion of experts was also conducted to meet consensus. On the basis of the expert opinion and group discussion following SDGs mapping had been finalized. NOPO and ZERO had been grouped under ethical responsibilities. LIFL and CLIM had been grouped under legal responsibilities. AFFO, INDU and PART had been grouped under economic responsibilities. CLEA, GOOD and LIFW had been grouped under ethical and legal responsibilities. DECE, QUAL and SUST had been grouped under ethical and economic responsibilities. PEAC had been grouped under legal and economic responsibilities. REDU, RESP and GEND had been grouped under ethical, legal and economic responsibilities. Since Fig. 6 , reveals ethical, legal and economic responsibilities are not disjoint set. Therefore fuzzy set theory has been used for the analysis of these sets, considering that a SDG may have membership in more than one set. Therefore, for SDG present in three groups had been given 0.33 membership in each group; for SDG present in two groups had been given 0.50 membership in each group; and for SDG present in the one groups had been given 1.00 membership. H4 tries to investigate sharing of the tweets in these three responsibilities.H4 When all the CEOs discuss about the SDGs, there is no statistically significant difference based on ethical, legal and economic responsibilities groups of SDGs propagation.   For fortune CEOs Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that there was no statistically significant difference in propagation (in terms of sharing) of tweets belonging to ethical, legal and economic responsibilities groups, χ2 (2) = 2.103, p > 0.05. For social influencer CEOs, Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that there was no statistically significant difference in propagation (in terms of sharing) of tweets belonging to ethical, legal and economic responsibilities groups, χ2 (2) = 1.043, p > 0.05.  7 Discussion Putnam (1993)  had highlighted social capital can be used for building sustainable society; whereas, Thakur and Hale (2013) , had highlighted social capital is a source for sustainability. Therefore this study tries to explore how CEOs can use their social capital for building CR through CSR messages on social media platform, Twitter. In this study we found CSR messages on social media positively influences the relationship between the firm’s CEO and stakeholders which is in line with literature (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006 ; Dijkmans et al., 2015 ; Rettab et al., 2009 ). Literature indicates a higher CSR activities of the firm had been positively related to higher online presence (Lee et al., 2013 ). Literature suggests firms having good social responsibility reputation can improve their public relations with ease (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006 ). Therefore, the study analyses the positive influence in terms of the number of the shares and likes on the virtual ecosystem. Literature indicates CSR activities helps in building organizational identity of the firm (Dijkmans et al., 2015 ; Marin & Ruiz, 2007 ) which in turn lead to generalized favourability (Agarwal et al., 2015 ; Wei et al., 2017 ). Results of the study indicates social influencer CEOs had posted 5.97 times as compared to fortune CEOs on an average. Hypothesis H1 indicates there is statistically significant difference between fortune and social influencers CEOs tweeting related to SDGs. From this we may conclude social influencer CEOs, by posting CSR messages on Twitter, are trying to build their identity in the society for the generalized favourability and corporate reputation among stakeholders; whereas fortune CEOs are already having good reputation in society, and therefore not tweeting much related to SDGs. Why these outcomes are observed need to be explored in future studies. These CSR messages posted by CEOs are building positive perception of the firms in the society. It seems as CSR messages have been seen as an organizational commitment of the firm towards the society by the stakeholders. Hypothesis H2 indicates there is statistically significant difference between fortune and social influencers CEOs sharing of SDGs tweets. Social influencer CEOs on SDG tweet have gathered 624 retweets on an average whereas fortune CEOs have gathered only 47 retweets. The results of the study reveal CSR message on Twitter is attracting huge social capital. Thus results of the study indicate CSR communication on interactive channels such as social media can improve CR which is in line with literature (Eberle et al., 2013 ), in case of the social influencers. On the basis of our findings, it can be concluded that social influencer CEOs are inducing higher social presence on Twitter as compare to the fortune CEOs (Lim & Lee-Won, 2017 ). Literature indicates users on Twitter retweet those tweets which they find interesting and important for the society (Abdullah et al., 2015 ). Thus it can be inferred that social presence on Twitter is highlighting that tweets of social influencer CEOs are more relevant; or possibly social influencer CEOs are strategically framing their tweets for attracting this social capital. Drivers for this behaviour is however out of the scope of the present study and can be explored in future research. The sample dataset indicates social influencer CEOs SDG tweet attracts 3535.63 likes on an average whereas for fortune CEOs can only attracts 54.69 likes only. Result indicates there is huge difference in attraction of likes. But when hypothesis, H3 had been tested by Mann-Whitney test indicates there is no statistically significant difference in liking of SDG tweets posted by fortune CEOs and social influencer CEOs. Thus study thus depicts the following: (a) CSR messages positively influences CR when posted on social media; (b) fortune CEO firms are not using social web for CSR communication; whereas social influencer CEOs are using social media extensively for CSR communication; (c) from the data mining of the SDG tweets it seems through social media, social influencer CEOs are increasing their stakeholder engagement which is in line with the literature (Zizka, 2017 ); (d) the sample showcases social influencer CEOs are extensively tweeting in social media in relation to CSR for building corporate reputation and organizational identity within the society. CSR messages posted by CEOs on social media is being broadcasted to their all connections. These connection through retweeting propagates the diffusion of the messages in the society. The retweeting by CEOs follower and further by follower connection and so on. This chain of retweets leads in spread of the message in virtual ecosystem. Thus the study is an example of how social capital can be used for raising corporate reputation. At the same time the society can also be benefited by learning issues and concerns related to global sustainability. 7.1 Managerial implication for practise and policy Literature indicates fortune companies had been more active in CSR activities (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001 ) but this study highlights how small companies or social influencer CEOs can also play a proactive role in CSR activities through social media platforms. Literature indicates there is the need for the better communication for firms with stakeholders (Wei et al., 2017 ), these firms can use social media i.e. Twitter for corporate communication and social reporting which may subsequently lead to higher corporate reputation in society. Posting CSR messages on Twitter by CEO is beneficial for the firms, because firm reputation can be co-created by the social capital present on social media (Jones et al., 2009 ). Secondly, doing this firms can satisfy stakeholder demands of CSR (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001 ). Thirdly, this act of CEOs can help in building organizational identity and corporate reputation in the society (Marin & Ruiz, 2007 ); as social influencer CEOs had demonstrated in the study. Fourthly, literature indicates there is a need for CSR claims for countering negative publicity (Vanhamme & Grobben, 2009 ), which can be fulfilled by maintaining healthy relationship with stakeholders through social media platforms. Posting CSR messages on Twitter by CEO is beneficial for the society as well, if the message is based on social valves. Social media communication on CSR can support and enhance awareness among users regarding sustainable development goals. CEOs has the potential of initiating collective engagement along with connective actions for sustainable development goals for mutual benefit. Authors of the study suggests, in achieving the sustainable agenda of 2030, CEOs may play a great role, by influencing the thoughts of millions of followers. The Fig. 3 (a) and (b) illustrates how the information posted by CEOs can be spread across million followers.   8 Conclusion The study tries to contribute to the existing literature by investigating relationship between the corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate reputation (CR) on social media platform, Twitter. Two groups of CEOs, one belonging to fortune CEOs and other social influencer CEOs had been compared on tweeting frequency, sharing and bookmarking of SDGs messages on Twitter. The study tries to validate three hypothesis statistically, the result is presented in Table 4  . The exploration undertaken in the study reveals social influencer CEOs are extensively posting on SDGs; which is subsequently leading in leveraging their corporate reputation and organizational identity within the society. The social capital of the social influencer CEOs present on Twitter help them in building recognizable identity. Fortune CEOs are not using social media much to discuss about SDGs in comparison to social influencer CEOs.  9 Limitation and future work From the exploration undertaken in the study it seems social influencer CEOs are posting extensively on CSR messages on Twitter; whereas fortune CEOs are not tweeting much related to SDGs. The reasons affecting the difference in behaviour by the two groups of CEOs on the social media, is an open questions which can be undertaken by future researchers for further exploration. Social capital present on Twitter is finding tweets related to SDGs of social influencer CEOs as being more relevant; or social influencer CEOs are strategically framing their tweets for attracting the social capital. This is the out of the scope of the present study. The current research is somewhat limited from self-selection and computational methodological biases which may occur due to the choice of words in the dictionary method and for topic modeling. There may be some discussions which may not have been identified if any of the discussion was not having the words listed in Appendix A. Shortened and vernacular language modelling would have also posed a limitation to the outcome of the study. In future research scholars can use different research approach for exploring the research question addressed in the study.
