                  Identifying the principal dimensions of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is key to measuring the extent to which SDGs are addressing the broader aim of agenda 2030. However, the key axes of global SDG progress over the past two decades remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify the major axes of global SDG progress and analyze the variation of SDG axes along with their spatial-temporal patterns and in relation to economic status. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify major axes of the SDGs that comprise basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs bundles. The results show that three key axes, viz. resources and ecosystems, the living environment, and well-being and equality, underpin the basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs SDGs respectively. Spatially, highest PC scores for basic-needs are clustered in high income countries, governance PC scores are globally polarized, while the results suggest that higher-needs PC scores are progressing only at a sluggish pace in most countries. In terms of temporal trends, progress has relied heavily on the contribution of basic-needs and governance SDGs. The SDG axes differ by country income levels, although the goals that contribute most to major axes in high-income countries also contribute most to global axes. The identified key axes of SDG progress highlight the necessity to promote the nexus of sustainable food-water-land, resilient cities, health, and equality to implement the SDGs more holistically. The study assists in the identification of appropriate research priorities and in developing more effective transformation strategies towards delivering the SDGs by 2030.

three SDG bundles (i.e., basic needs, governance, and higher needs). A) ternary plot of countries across three SDG bundles. Circles with different colors represent countries classified into high, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low income. The size and position of each circle represent the relevant SDG index score and affiliation of the corresponding country with different bundles, respectively. B) box and whisker plots of the relative SDG index scores across three SDG bundles. The middle line represents the median SDG index score; lower and upper boundaries represent the 25th and 75th percentiles. Whiskers extending from each box correspond to the range of remaining data, with dots indicating outliers.  Fig. 1   Fig. 2 Key dimensions of multivariate SDG progress for (A) basic needs, (B) governance, and (C) higher needs. Each sub-figure (i.e., A, B, and C), comprises three parts: 1) biplots of  the PCA.

However, the key axes of global SDG progress over the past two decades remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify the major axes of global SDG progress and analyze the variation of SDG axes along with their spatial-temporal patterns and in relation to economic status. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify major axes of the SDGs that comprise basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs bundles. The results show that three key axes, viz . resources and ecosystems, the living environment, and well-being and equality, underpin the basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs SDGs respectively. Spatially, highest PC scores for basic-needs are clustered in high income countries, governance PC scores are globally polarized, while the results suggest that higher-needs PC scores are progressing only at a sluggish pace in most countries. In terms of temporal trends, progress has relied heavily on the contribution of basic-needs and governance SDGs. The SDG axes differ by country income levels, although the goals that contribute most to major axes in high-income countries also contribute most to global axes. The identified key axes of SDG progress highlight the necessity to promote  the nexus of sustainable food-water-land, resilient cities, health, and equality to implement the SDGs more holistically. The study assists in the identification of appropriate research priorities and in developing more effective transformation strategies towards delivering the SDGs by 2030.

In 1992, Agenda 21 was adopted at the Earth Summit to promote synergy between people and the environment (UN, 1992 ). In 2000, the Millennium Declaration set out eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to halve extreme poverty and promote health and education by 2015 (UN, 2015a ). Building on decades of work, the UN then set the 2030 Agenda with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 nested targets in 2015 (UN, 2015b ), aiming to end deprivation, promote prosperity, and protect ecosystems globally by 2030. The 17 goals, which vary in their foundations and progress, contribute differently to overall SDG achievement, individually or through interaction (Griggs et al., 2013 ). SDG implementation, therefore, is a complex system supported by multiple goals and development dimensions (e.g., social, economic, and environmental) through tradeoffs and synergies (Wu et al., 2022 ). Identifying the dominant dimensions of complex systems lies at the frontier of systems research. The state and evolution of complex systems are always supported or driven by critical pillars (Diaz et al., 2016 ; Migliavacca et al., 2021 ). In natural systems, for instance, productivity and water/carbon utilization are key to supporting ecosystem functions (Migliavacca et al., 2021 ). Despite the complexity of components and interrelationships in the SDGs, SDG evolution is  likely to be driven by several important  axes. Although previous studies have identified particular systematic features (e.g., national baselines, priority and urgency) of SDG progress (Allen et al., 2019 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ), the key axes that underpin the global SDG performance remain unquantified. Most of the research on SDGs has focused on assessing their progress (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020 ), analyzing interactions among goals (Laumann et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2022 ), dwelling on the factors that affect the SDG networks (Biermann et al., 2017 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019 ), and finding pathways for SDG achievement (Sachs et al., 2019 ; Soergel et al., 2021 ). These works built on SDG status that is assessed on the basis of indicators (Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ; UN, 2021a ; b , 2022 ), and rarely on the key dimensions of SDGs. Recent studies have argued that SDG progress was already off track (Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ; UN, 2021b , 2022 ), and that decades of progress have been constrained or even reversed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts (Pereira et al., 2022 ; UN, 2021a ). Such assessments of progress were generally tracked by comparing the absolute value of the SDG indicators in the time series. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, a reduction in the absolute value of metrics in one year hardly represents the overall SDG trend (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). Therefore, analyzing the holistic trend of SDGs through the lens of major axes provides a novel perspective by which to characterize the evolution of sustainable development. In addition, implementing the SDGs depends largely on the national socioeconomic status, which is primarily described by income levels (Allen et al., 2017 ; Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). Therefore, in order to clarify the contribution to the SDGs of countries at different stages of economic development, it is necessary to observe the main axes of global SDG progress across different income levels. Bearing in mind multidimensional development needs, the SDGs are evolving in an increasingly complex global environment in the context of climate change, population growth, economic transformation and policy change. To identify the pillars underpinning overall sustainability and more holistically predict the response of SDGs to global change, it is crucial to identify the key axes of SDG progress as a representation of sustainable development globally . In this study, the first of its type, we identify the key axes of global SDG progress and their evolution over the past two decades. The findings enable mapping of overall SDG performance innovatively and improve understanding of the role of different SDG bundles and country clusters in the 2030 Agenda. In aiming to characterize the major axes of the global SDG progress, index scores of basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs SDG bundles (i.e., groups of goals synergistic to the overall SDG progress) were calculated to evaluate the status of SDG progress in countries from 2000 to 2020. The most important axes explaining SDG progress variation and the spatial distribution and temporal characteristics of principal components were identified and analyzed with reference to socioeconomic status . The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section 2  introduces the data and methods used, section 3  shows and interprets the results of the major SDG axes, section 4  discusses the reasons and significance of the results, and the fifth part summarizes the study.  2 Material and methods 2.1 Data Data on 17 SDGs for 218 countries/regions from 2000 to 2020 were collected based on the Global SDG Indicators Database (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database , accessed in November 2021). The UN SDG framework includes 231 unique indicators (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/ ), and this study includes 188 unique indicators due to missing data on the remaining indicators in the Global SDG Indicators Database. The 17 goals, corresponding to 188 unique indicators, are shown in Table A1 , which includes 472 indicators since a unique indicator may involve multiple specific measures. To reduce the impact of missing values and statistical errors, we considered all 472 indicators and calculated the average of the group of indicators corresponding to a unique indicator as the value of this unique indicator. Since the UN updates the Global SDG Indicators Database every three months, the number of indicators will change and different indicator versions can be found in the SDG database archives (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/archive ). The period 2000–2020 was selected for the analysis since, although SDGs were formally proposed only in 2015, it is possible to observe global sustainable development status since the beginning of the 21st century, as in other studies and in the UN Sustainable Development Reports  (Laumann et al., 2022 ; UN, 2022 ; Xu et al., 2020 ).  2.2 Methods The SDG index scores were first evaluated to provide a basis for understanding the major axes of global SDG progress. The change attribute of each variable were evaluated, i.e., positive or negative (Zhang et al., 2022 ), and the variables were normalized to yield a value from 0 to 100 (UN, 2021b ). To assess the SDG index scores, the 2000–2020 mean score for each indicator was calculated. Then, the SDG index scores of each country were estimated by calculating the average of indicators, with same index weight, over 20 years (UN, 2021b ). Classifying SDG bundles from the intertwining goals facilitates more efficient identification of the main dimensions of the SDG process. The 17 SDGs were categorized into basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs bundles based on the classification from Fu et al. (2019) . The basic-needs SDG bundle (SDG 2, 6, 7, 14, 15) represents what is fundamentally required for human survival and is a vital element of sustainable development (O'Neill et al., 2018 ). The higher-needs SDG bundle (SDG 1, 3–5, 8, 10, 16) comprises issues associated with equality and socioeconomic development. Their attainment depends more on elements associated with society and ethics. The governance SDG bundle (SDG 9, 11–13, 17) effectively manages competitive relations and establishes fair rules and institutions to meet basic needs while achieving higher needs (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Scores for the corresponding goals of basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs were averaged for each of these three bundles. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify the key dimensions of SDG progress (Granato et al., 2018 ). Each variable, i.e., SDG, was standardized using z-score transformation. The number of principal components (PCs) was selected according to the eigenvalues (eigenvalue >1) of the PCs or the proportion of the variability explained by the first three PCs (explained variation >70%) (Kaiser, 1960 ). After extracting the PCs, eigenvalues of the extracted PCs, the factor loading matrix, and the corresponding standard orthogonalized eigenvectors were calculated followed by PC scores based on the eigenvectors and the normalized variables. The major axes of basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs SDG bundles respectively were identified and then the spatial distribution of the PC scores and temporal characteristics of PCs were analyzed based on annual global SDG progress. Variation in the SDG axes and goals with the highest contribution in different income groups of countries defined by the World Bank (https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html ) were compared. The 2010 World Bank's criteria for each country classification were selected, since the study considered the overall SDG progress from 2000 to 2020 (Table A2 ). To enable the country income category to represent the general classification from 2000 to 2020, the most frequent country income categories from 2000 to 2020 were used and compared with the 2010 country categories. As 96% of countries fall into the same category in 2010 as between 2000 and 2020, the middle year of the study period is considered to be a reasonably representative year for the study period (Figure A1 ). Compared with nonlinear fitted methods, the PCA exploratory technique can avoid over-parameterising the indicators and data used in this study (Granato et al., 2018 ; Kaiser, 1960 ).   3 Results 3.1 Distribution of the SDG index scores The distribution of SDG index scores for countries and 17 goals across the three SDG bundles are shown in Fig. 1  . The dots representing countries are clustered around [40, 40, 20], corresponding to the three SDG bundles of basic needs, governance, and higher needs. The score ranges of the basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs SDG bundles were calculated as 20–60, 20–80, and 0–60, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The box plots show that progress is more balanced among basic-needs SDGs, while gaps are identified mainly in SDGs related to governance and higher needs. Of all the goals, SDG 4, 16, 3, 6 (education, justice, health, and water) show better progress, with 21-year average index scores of 58.9, 58.0, 53.4, and 51.2, respectively. SDG 10, 12 (equality, responsible consumption and production) exhibit the least progress, with index scores 9.8 and 6.4, respectively (Fig. 1 B).  3.2 Key axes of global SDG progress The key axes with the greatest contribution to SDG progress and their goals are identified corresponding to basic needs (Fig. 2  A), governance (Fig. 2 B), and higher needs (Fig. 2 C) SDG bundles respectively. The first two principal components (PCs) were extracted to identify the main dimensions of SDG progress, given that the eigenvalues of the first two PCs exceeded 1 and the explanatory degree of the other PCs declined sharply after the first two PCs accounted for the greatest SDG variation. The resource and ecosystem axis supports the progress of basic-needs SDGs. The first three axes explain 76% of the variation in progress in the basic-needs SDGs (Fig. 2 A). PC1 and PC2 (i.e., linear combinations of SDG 2, 6, 7, 14, and 15 after dimensionality reduction), with eigenvalues greater than 1, explains 37% and 24% of the variation respectively. SDG 6 (water and sanitation) and SDG 15 (life on land) contribute the most to PC1, accounting for 29.5% and 28% respectively, in explaining the progress in basic-needs SDGs. In the case of PC2, SDG 2 (zero hunger) is the most important contributor (38.3%), followed by SDG 7 (35.3%). The living environment axis supports progress in governance SDGs. The first three PCs explain 84% of the variation in governance SDG progress (Fig. 2 B). PC1 and PC2 (i.e., linear combinations of SDG 9, 11, 12, 13, and 17 after dimensionality reduction), with eigenvalues greater than 1, explain 42% and 26% of the variation, respectively. SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action) are seen to exert the most influence on PC1, with a contribution of 31.8% and 30.3% respectively, thereby explaining the major variation in governance SDG progress. In respect of PC2, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) effect the greatest contribution among the governance goals (43.1%). The results suggest that the well-being and equality axis supports progress in higher-needs SDGs. The first four PCs explain 76% of the variation in higher-needs SDGs (Fig. 2 C). PC1 and PC2 (i.e., linear combinations of SDG 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 16 after dimensionality reduction), with eigenvalues greater than 1, explain 27% and 17% of the variation respectively. SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being) contribute most to PC1 explaining the higher-needs SDG progress, accounting for 30.5% and 27.9% respectively. SDG 1 is positively associated with PC1, while SDG 3 exhibits a negative relationship (Fig. 2 C). In PC2, SDG 10 (reduced inequality) is shown to make the most substantial contribution (52.2%).  3.3 Spatial and temporal characteristics of the SDG axes PC scores were calculated for each country to analyze the spatial distribution of the SDG axes. From basic needs and governance to higher needs, the global PC scores change from being predominantly positive to predominantly negative. Specifically, the three SDG bundles all exhibit significant differences in PC scores among countries. For PC1, countries with high SDG scores on basic needs are concentrated in the regions of North America, Europe, East Asia and Australia. Governance SDGs tend to be polarized, with only a few countries with high PC scores, such as the United States, Germany, Poland, Russia and India, with low scores clustered in South America, Africa and Central Asia. The spatial distribution of higher-needs SDGs is globally more balanced, as most of countries exhibit a rather sluggish pace of performance in higher-needs SDG scores. It is worth noting that, comparing the gaps in progress between countries, some African countries have performed better in basic-needs SDGs than in those related to governance and higher-needs. For PC2 which has a lower degree of explanation, European and North American countries lead in global PC scores, while low value clusters are associated with African and Central Asian countries (Fig. 3  ). The identified PCs for average progress across 2000–2020 for the 17 SDGs reveal that PC1 explains 51.1% of the variability. All the goals in the basic-needs (except SDG 2) and governance SDGs contribute consistently to PC1. Higher-needs SDGs are the main contributors to PC2, which explains 15.6% of SDG variability. In terms of temporal trends, SDG advances occur more rapidly in recent years, i.e., the more recent the year, the greater the contribution to PC1 (with the notable exception of 2020). The year 2010 appears to have been a turning point, as the contribution to PC1 before that was negative and positive thereafter (Fig. 4  ; Figure A2 ).  3.4 Variation in SDG axes with income levels The PCs and the SDGs’ contributions varies across countries with different income levels. In the basic-needs SDG bundle, countries varied by income are irregularly distributed around the PC1 and PC2 axes (Fig. 2 A). In the governance and higher-needs SDG bundles, countries with different incomes levels are clustered along the axes. The positive sides of the axes are mainly clustered in high-income countries. The variance explained by PC1 and PC2 is mainly contributed by high income countries (Fig. 2 B and C). In the higher-needs SDGs bundle, the points of low-income and lower-middle-income countries are mainly distributed near the origin, indicating a small contribution to the PCs (Fig. 2 C). PCs for countries with different income levels explains the highest percentage of the variation (Fig. 5  ) than the global average (Fig. 2 ). As for PC1 in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, SDG 15 and SDG 6 contribute the most to the variance in respect of basic-needs SDG bundle. SDG 9 and SDG 13 contribute the most to the governance SDG bundle and SDG 3 and SDG 5 is the most important concerning the higher-needs SDG bundle (Fig. 5 A). As for PC2 in high-income countries, SDG 7 is the major contributor to the variance in terms of basic-needs SDG progress, and SDG 17 is the main driver in the case of governance SDG progress (Fig. 5 B). In short, the results suggest that the SDGs that contribute most to PCs in high-income countries (Fig. 5 ) are also dominant at the global scale (Fig. 2 ). Apart from this, for PC2 in lower-middle-income and low-income countries, SDG 2 and SDG 6 are the important contributors to basic-needs SDGs (Fig. 5 B), as in the global axes.   4 Discussion Identifying the key axes of SDG progress is critical for the UN, as well as individual countries at different development stages, to formulate holistic and phased strategies towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. This study offers fresh insights into the gains, gaps, and overall trends in global sustainable development since the 21st century. The results reveal that improvements in goals related to resources and ecosystems, the living environment, and well-being and equity form the main axes of global sustainable development, and that these axes correspond to the basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs SDGs respectively. Spatiotemporal disparities among countries and SDG bundles are evident and the differences are most strongly influenced by socioeconomic conditions, as characterized by income levels. The importance of nature's contribution, living environment construction, and well-being improvement related to the SDG axes in supporting sustainable development among nations has been widely recognized (Herrero et al., 2021 ; Islam et al., 2021 ; Kruk et al., 2018 ; Meghji et al., 2021 ). Variations in performance relating to the basic-needs SDGs are substantially explained by the axis centered on the contribution of natural systems, such as ecosystem services (SDG 15), water, food, and energy resources (SDG 6, 2, 7) (Fig. 2 A). As the most important resources underpinning human livelihoods and wellbeing, the food-energy-water nexus, and related resource technologies are prerequisites for implementing the SDGs (Cacal and Taboada, 2022 ; Sepehri and Sarrafzadeh, 2018 ; Sepehri et al., 2020 ; Yin et al., 2022 ). These fundamental necessities (e.g., crops, livestock, freshwater, bioenergy, medicines) are generally provided by ecosystems. Ecosystem services also advance the achievement of multiple SDGs by providing resources, regulating climate, and satisfying cultural needs. Furthermore, the close interlinkages among terrestrial natural resources, as reflected in the food-energy-water-land (FEWL) nexus (SDG 2, 6, 7, 15) (Bleischwitz et al., 2018 ), support sustainable development through the operation synergies (Wang et al., 2021 ). The significance of the resource and ecosystem axes in implementing basic-needs SDGs is clearly highlighted in our results. Governance SDGs are explained largely by axes related to the management of the human living environment, both at the micro (SDG 11, cities) and macro (SDG 13, climate) scales. Cities are considered to be important focal points for SDG implementation due to their high concentration of people, capital, and resources (Rodriguez et al., 2018 ; Weiss et al., 2018 ), while climate change continues to weaken the natural foundations underpinning the SDG performance (UNEP, 2021 ). Characterized by frequent extreme weather events and changing drought and flood patterns, climate change impedes SDG progress towards poverty reduction (Khanal et al., 2021 ), food and agricultural security (Campbell et al., 2018 ), human health (Mazorra et al., 2020 ), water security (Hasan et al., 2019 ), and infrastructure (SDG 1–3, 6, 9) (Droli et al., 2022 ; Soergel et al., 2021 ). Managing the human living environment axis (e.g., optimizing urbanization and strengthening global climate actions) requires extensive global cooperation (Soergel et al., 2021 ). Therefore, global partnerships (SDG 17) play a coordinating role in shaping a safe and sustainable human environment (Fig. 2 B). The analysis reveals that the higher-needs SDGs are mainly supported by axes related to prosperity, health, and equality (SDG 1, 3, 10) (Fig. 2 C). Before the COVID-19 pandemic, important progress was evident in relation to poverty reduction, health care and well-being (SDG 1, 3) (UN, 2022 ). The share of the world's population living in extreme poverty fell by 1.4 percent from 2015 to 2018 (UN, 2020 ) and maternal and child health had improved, immunization coverage increased, and communicable diseases had reduced (UN, 2021a ), albeit that the rate of progress was still falling short of making the 2030 target date. The results here highlight the positive association of SDG 1 with PC1, while SDG 3 is negatively correlated (Fig. 2 C). This indicates that there are tradeoffs between poverty reduction and wellbeing advancement across countries in different development stages in terms of higher-needs SDGs. Eliminating poverty is a key priority in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, while promoting human well-being is more of a concern in developed countries. Nevertheless, developed countries with a higher level of well-being also face the negative spillover effects of economic development, such as the challenge of resource overexploitation and the transgression of biophysical boundaries (O'Neill et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the combined onslaught of war, geopolitical conflict, climate change, biodiversity crisis, and the pandemic have exacerbated existing inequalities among countries and hit the most vulnerable hardest of all (SDG 10) (UN, 2022 ). Accordingly, reducing inequalities between countries and among their populations is vital to achieving progress in the higher-needs SDGs. The results of this study also identify turning points in the time series of SDG progress. For example, Fig. 4  shows that the balance of PC1 contributions to progress is negative before 2010 but positive thereafter. Turning points in SDG evolution are further explored for the last 20 years, as the Mann-Kendall statistical results also indicate a transition around the year 2010 (Figure A2 ). Underlying causes include the 2008 global economic crisis, which led to global sustainable development stalling. With economic recovery and progress towards the MDGs, global sustainable development was advanced after 2010 (Figure A2 ). However, the annual contribution of the PCs reversed again in 2020 (Fig. 4 ), reflecting the deleterious impact of COVID-19 on the global SDG process. The UN assessment indicates that overall global SDG performance decreased in 2020 for the first time (UN, 2021b ). Moreover, as fiscal space tightens and political pressures increase (e.g., the global recession and regional conflicts), the gap between progression and vision in achieving the SDGs is widening in the wake of COVID-19 (Yin et al., 2021 ). Many studies, including official UN SDG reports, have highlighted the deviation in SDG progress and the diminishing likelihood of acclaiming the 2030 vision (Moyer and Hedden, 2020 ; UN, 2020 , 2021a ). It is to be hoped that the rise in poverty and economic recession under the pandemic are temporary setbacks in the long-term SDG process. Indeed, local volatility can be a window of opportunity in the post-pandemic era to recover better (Diffenbaugh et al., 2020 ). By taking advantage of the booming digital economy, distance education and online shopping, the post-pandemic era need to follow a more sustainable and digital development path once the COVID-19 crisis ends and the impacts dissipate (de Leon et al., 2021 ; Zhao et al., 2022 ). The major axes identified here reveal the weaknesses in global SDG progress and therefore also assist in setting priorities to address these. The SDGs are intended not only to meet bare minimum human survival needs, but also to improve, for example, health care and reduce inequity. The results indicate that, globally, PC scores decline from those associated with basic-needs and governance to those reflecting higher-needs (Fig. 3 ). Moreover, basic-needs and governance SDGs are clearly the major contributors to the SDG axes over the 21-year period, and the higher needs SDGs make a much smaller contribution (Fig. 4 ). This confirms that the world's SDG efforts over the two decades have afforded priority to increasing  the supply of basic resources (e.g., food, energy, water) and strengthening actions and governance rules to encourage synergy between survival and development. However, achieving the goals of no poverty, universal health coverage, and equality worldwide remain a significant weakness in the SDG implementation. The results also reveal differences in the performance of SDG principal components across countries with different income levels. Higher values of PC scores relating to basic-needs are clustered in high income countries, while governance PC scores are globally polarized and those relating to higher-needs indicate rather sluggish performance in most countries (Fig. 3 ). Income emerges as a major descriptor of the national macroeconomic status (Galor and Zeira, 1993 ; Zilberman, 2014 ) and strongly influences SDG implementation (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ). The stronger the economic background, the more likely health services, infrastructure, ecological engineering, climate action, and in SDGs in general will be supported financially (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ; Meghji et al., 2021 ; Niessen et al., 2018 ; UN , 2022). Due to the global universality of the SDGs, which are focused in general on eliminating inequity and promoting prosperity, wealthy nations are able to meet the majority of their basic-needs and social thresholds (e.g., well-being and equality) (O'Neill et al., 2018 ). Moreover, developed countries have a more solid socioeconomic foundation to achieve SDGs more quickly. The least developed countries, on the other hand, lack adequate infrastructure and mechanisms to provide their own impetus for development (Soergel et al., 2021 ; UN, 2022 ). A weaker  socioeconomic context is clearly associated with low status in terms of education and health (Allen et al., 2017 ; Niessen et al., 2018 ) and, thus, the international sustainability agenda has to focus on low-income countries (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). Low-income countries have made progress in eliminating poverty and improving the availability of basic services and infrastructure, and, indeed, they do so with a smaller ecological footprint (Soergel et al., 2021 ; UN, 2021b ). Although rich countries lead in global sustainability, they also generate substantial negative socioeconomic and environmental spillovers through, for example, unsustainable trade and supply chains, imposition of taxes, and factory relocation that all threaten the economic and ecological carrying capacity of other countries to implement the SDGs (UN, 2021b ). This indicates that the focus on economic growth to deliver human welfare at the expense of environmental sustainability often creates trade-offs between SDG progress. Previous studies also indicate that higher gross domestic product may indeed lead to higher levels of human health and well-being, but are also associated with a larger environmental and climate footprint (Wu et al., 2022 ). Inequality, defined economically, remains one of the thorniest challenges of the 2030 Agenda. In revealing key axes of the SDGs and highlighting the need to focus on sustainable food-water-land, resilient cities, climate actions, health, well-being, and equality, this study can support transformation towards equality and sustainability (Kruk et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ). Promoting the key SDG axes and prioritizing in particular those goals that are lagging behind may advance SDG implementation overall more efficiently. With less than a decade of the 2030 Agenda to go, countries need to coordinate and accelerate the pace of progress in basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs goals. It is therefore essential to prioritize poverty alleviation, improve access to basic infrastructure, and curb ecosystem degradation to ensure these basic needs (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ), while reducing inequality, addressing climate change, and promoting global partnerships to advance the higher needs goals (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). Global SDG progress is severely challenged by inequalities among countries and driven by economic disparities. Therefore, to achieve a more balanced sustainability, it is necessary to assist low-income countries in obtaining their minimum needs and, more importantly, to foster the development of their own capacity by improving infrastructure, production, and technology (Herrero et al., 2021 ). Meanwhile, innovating and further improving strategies for sustainable development in rich countries remains important, since they play a leading role in the global sustainable agenda and can help to chart the pathway to achieving higher-needs goals everywhere. Building a safe and just development space is key to improving both physical provisioning systems (e.g., by obtaining sufficient resources) and social supporting mechanisms (e.g., reducing income inequality and enhancing social well-being) (O'Neill et al., 2018 ). The sustainability agenda typically requires long-term planning, but with only a few years to 2030, the SDGs need to be urgently reconsidered in order that the progress made thus far is not wasted (Zhao et al., 2022 ). Although this study offers a fresh and valuable perspective on global sustainable development, limitations remain. Firstly, due to data availability, only 188 of the 231 UN indicators were used but, hopefully, as appropriate data become more accessible, future research may improve the accuracy and reliability of SDG analyses. Secondly, the study focuses on the major dimensions and holistic spatiotemporal characteristics of global SDG progress, which makes it difficult to establish the detailed effects of some key nodes in the time series. For instance, because the effects of the pandemic are still unfolding, the study really only captures its negative impact on SDG axes, and fails to fully characterize the longer-term effects. Ongoing assessment of how major global SDG axes evolve in response to critical emergencies, such as the 2008 global financial crisis and the current pandemic, is also a key research focus in the global sustainable development arena.  5 Conclusions This study reveals the three major axes of global SDG progress and presents the variation of these SDG axes in terms of spatial-temporal changes and economic status. The three axes, viz . resources and ecosystems, living environment construction, and well-being and equality, underpin the basic-needs, governance, and higher-needs SDGs respectively. Spatially, the higher basic-needs PC scores are clustered in high income countries, governance scores are polarized globally, while higher-needs scores indicate generally sluggish progress made in most countries. In terms of temporal trends, SDG progress over the 21-year period is shown to have relied heavily on the contribution of basic-needs and governance SDGs. These findings expose gaps in SDG progress, both among countries with different economic circumstances and among SDG bundles from basic needs to higher needs. To reinforce the key axes underpinning global sustainable development, urgent actions are required to reduce inequities, manifested by economic disparities, in the implementation of the SDGs. This study outlines a novel perspective on global sustainable development that facilitates the identification of research priorities and transformation strategies towards delivering the SDGs by 2030.
