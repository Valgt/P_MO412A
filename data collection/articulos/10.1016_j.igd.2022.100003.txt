                  Industrial agglomeration not only brings economic prosperity, but also raises concerns about its environmental impact. How to balance industrial agglomeration and inclusive economic growth is a major challenge for today's social development. On the foundation of the balanced panel data of 164 cities in China from 2003 to 2013, our study employs the dynamic spatial Dubin model to empirically analyze the possible spatial effects between industrial agglomeration and air pollution at China's urban level, and detects the potential transmission mechanism through the lens of environmental regulation, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading. The findings denote that: (1) An inverted “N" type relationship exists between industrial agglomeration and air pollution, namely, with the deepening of industrial agglomeration, the air pollution of the city will first decline, then rise, and finally recover the trend of decline. (2) The influence of local industrial agglomeration on neighbor air pollution also presents an inverted “N" shape, denoting that local industrial agglomeration also has an alleviating influence on air pollution in adjacent regions in the long run. (3) Industrial agglomeration can reduce the air pollution level in urban agglomeration by affecting environmental regulation, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading. These results provide a detailed reference for promoting industrial development and air pollution control.

How to balance industrial agglomeration and inclusive economic growth is a major challenge for today's social development. On the foundation of the balanced panel data of 164 cities in China from 2003 to 2013, our study employs the dynamic spatial Dubin model to empirically analyze the possible spatial effects between industrial agglomeration and air pollution at China's urban level, and detects the potential transmission mechanism through the lens of environmental regulation, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading. The findings denote that: (1) An inverted “N" type relationship exists between industrial agglomeration and air pollution, namely, with the deepening of industrial agglomeration, the air pollution of the city will first decline, then rise, and finally recover the trend of decline. (2) The influence of local industrial agglomeration on neighbor air pollution also presents an inverted “N" shape, denoting that local industrial agglomeration also has an alleviating influence on air pollution in adjacent regions in the long run. (3) Industrial agglomeration can reduce the air pollution level in urban agglomeration by affecting environmental regulation, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading. These results provide a detailed reference for promoting industrial development and air pollution control.   Keywords Industrial agglomeration  Air pollution  Dynamic spatial dubin model  Spillover effect    1 Introduction Among all environmental problems, air pollution is closely related to human daily life and health, and has always been the top priority of environmental governance (Marquès & Domingo, 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). Studies have pointed out that outdoor air pollution, dominated by fine particulate matter, causes about 3.3 million premature deaths globally every year, mainly in Asia (Lelieveld et al., 2015 ). Take China as an example, in recent years, the frequent haze weather and unsatisfactory air quality in Chinese cities have attracted public attention at home and abroad (Hao et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2021 ). Referring to the Environmental Performance Index: 2018 report  published by Yale University, China has become a disaster area with excessive PM2.5  levels, with two-thirds of the world's 30 most polluted cities, making it one of the most polluted areas worldwide (Chai et al., 2021 ; Deng et al., 2021 ). So, splendid significance can be attributed to detect the mediating factors of air pollution and sort out the prevention and control countermeasures of urban haze (Hao et al., 2022 ; Shen et al., 2022 ). As the important measure to promote regional economic growth, industrial agglomeration is a distinctive form of economic organization in today's world (Ren et al., 2022 ; Xue et al., 2022 ). It is a process in which the same or similar industries are immensely concentrated in a specified geographical region and production factors are constantly converging in a specific space (Tanaka & Managi, 2021 ). Practice shows that the spatial agglomeration of industries has become an essential motive power for regional economic development (Otsuka et al., 2010 ). For example, Japan's Tokyo Bay area and Kansai region, centered around Osaka, generate 70 percent of Japan's GDP; Sixty-five percent of America's GDP is generated by the San Francisco area and the Great Lakes region; and the economic aggregate of Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta in China is close to 30% of the national aggregate, which is sufficient to show the efficient resource allocation of industrial agglomeration as an industrial organization form. In fact, showing an inevitable trend, industrial agglomeration has been a vital method of local economic growth in China. Statistics suggest that China's 169 national-level high-tech industrial clusters generated about 13% of the national GDP in 2021 with 0.1% of the national territorial area.1  1 https://www.ncsti.gov.cn/kjdt/xwjj/202202/t20220227_60446.html  (in Chinese).   However, it should not be ignored that while industrial agglomeration boosts economic development, the agglomeration of production factors caused by it may also leads to certain pressure on the environment. Although some researchers have stated industrial agglomeration can create knowledge spillovers and technological advantages, thus promoting concentrated use of raw materials and improving resource utilization efficiency (Yuan et al., 2020 ; Xue et al., 2022 ). However, industrial agglomeration also increases population density and expanses production scale, thereby increasing the consumption of raw materials, which may produce more pollution (Guo et al., 2020 ). Therefore, how to balance industrial agglomeration and environment protection to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth is an important challenge facing today's social development. Although the existing literature has paid attention to the influence of industrial agglomeration on local environment contamination (Gao et al., 2020 ; Liu et al., 2017 , 2022 ), but they generally ignored the spatial spillover effect, and did not carry out in-depth discussion on the possible influencing mechanism behind it. Based on this, this study employs the panel data of China's urbans and administrates the dynamic spatial Dubin model to quantitively examine the impact of industrial agglomeration on air pollution, and further investigates transmissions of this impact. To sum up, the main contributions of this research include the following three points: firstly, as for the research content, different from the previous studies which are merely limited to industrial agglomeration influence on local environment, this study innovatively considers the spillover effect of industrial agglomeration on neighboring regions from the standpoints of regional linkage, and constructs spatial econometric models for empirical analysis. Secondly, as for research samples, the existing literature mostly adopts provincial panel data for research (Gao et al., 2020 ; Liu et al., 2017 ). However, China is still at the primary development stage nowadays, and the imbalance and inadequacy of economic development are prominent. Different regions in the same province may also have significant discrepancies in economic development level, industrial structure and resource endowment. Therefore, this research employs urban level data, which is helpful to get more detailed and accurate findings. Last but not least, this paper also analyzes and verifies the possible transmission mechanism of industrial agglomeration on air contamination, which makes an important contribution to fill the gap in current research and fully grasp the connections between them two. Other sections of this research are arranged in this way: the second part offers brief literature review, the third section analyzes the possible transmission paths, the fourth section explains the econometric model setting, indicator selection and data sources, the fifth part is the empirical results and discussion, and the sixth part presents main conclusions and relevant policy suggestions.  2 Literature review This paper mainly studies the relationship between industrial agglomeration and the degree of air pollution in China. Specifically, this paper is related to three types of literature. 2.1 Industrial agglomeration The definition of industrial agglomeration derived from industrial area which is also called industrial agglomeration district. Marshall (1890)  determined it groundbreaking that the industrial district is a region defined by both history and nature, where small and medium-sized firms actively interact to integrate with social trends. Industrial agglomeration initially means the situation that the corporates which produce the same or similar type of commodity are highly agglomerated in a specific geographical region (Fan & Scott, 2003 ). The fundamental motivation for the industrial agglomeration formation lies in the external scale economy effect, which is mainly reflected in the regional specialized development, the formation of labor market with specific industrial skills, the strengthening of forward and backward links between upstream and downstream enterprises, and the promotion of technological progress (Klarin et al., 2021 ). Krugman (1991)  constructed a core-edge model based on the assumptions of increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition, and then suggested that the emergence of industrial agglomeration is the resultant force of the centripetal and centrifugal forces. That means the local market effect and price index effect jointly contributes to the regional industrial agglomeration. In terms of the external influence brought by industrial agglomeration in industrial areas, researchers mainly put forward two viewpoints: Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) externalities, focusing on industrial specialization effects and Jacobs externalities, focusing on industrial diversification effects. Marshall (1890)  indicated that firms receive increasing returns from a trinity of agglomeration economies: a local pool of skilled labor, local supplier linkages and local knowledge spillovers. Moreover, the industrial agglomeration can reduce the communication cost between enterprises and bring “MAR externality”. However, Jacobs (1969)  pointed out that the knowledge spillover effect between complementary rather than similar industries can be applied in other industries to improve economic efficiency. The complementary across diverse firms and economic agents facilitates innovation. The expansion of economic scale will attract more enterprises to migrate to the industrial agglomeration area, bringing out the continuous expansion of industrial agglomeration scale and relevant core products' production. In addition, related enterprises emerge and the level of specialization and collaboration within the region is improved obviously (Neffke et al., 2011 ). Moreover, when the agglomeration area scale continues to expand, the supply of production factors in the area will increase, which will reduce the average production cost of the whole industry, promote labor gather and develop industrial competitiveness. The above effect is always compared to the formation of a reservoir (Bellandi, 1989 ). However, some scholars indicated that the externalities of industrial agglomeration are not always optimistic. For example, Hoover (1948)  suggested that industrial agglomeration is not sufficient to produce the best effect of agglomeration without a certain scale. On the contrary, if the agglomeration scale exceeds the regional carrying capacity, it will reduce the overall effect of the agglomeration area. In Chinese context, Lin (2021)  analyzed the relationship between market environment and industrial agglomeration, and pointed out the basic position of the market in the Chinese resources’ allocation, which is helpful to promote the flow of elements and the greater scale of FDI.  2.2 Air pollution Based on the concept defined by International Standardization Organization, the air pollution usually refers to the phenomenon which is harmful to the human comfort, health and welfare because certain substances produced by human activities of natural process enter into the atmosphere, present enough concentration and reach enough time. Rapid economic enhancement has caused air pollution in a sense and industrialization and urbanization has become a major environmental problem to be solved urgently in the world. This problem has also attracted close attention from the political, academical and social fields (Jacobs, 2016) . Brunekreef and Holgate (2002)  pointed out that air pollution has become one of the important conundrums threatening human survival and sustainable development, and may become more and more serious with economic growth. In the early stage of China's reform and opening up, due to the problems of low production level, low energy using efficiency and weak innovation ability of most production enterprises, the extensive development mode promoted the rapid economic growth of China, and the rapid energy consumption also led to the rapid increase of air pollutant emissions (Chen et al., 2022 ). Today, air pollution has threatened the ecological environment and the high-quality economic higher improvement at the macro level, as well as the residents' health and public travel at the micro level. According to present study, in the process of the rise and construction of urban agglomeration, the urban district represented by Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta has become China's “pollution group” as all kinds of excessive resources continue to converge to them (Zhang et al., 2020 ). Recently, the academic research on air pollution, especially air pollution, is increasingly in-depth. In addition to energy consumption, the unreasonable energy structure, the overspeed urbanization, the unbalanced industrial structure, unduly foreign direct investment, more slowly technological progress and intumescent economic expansion also lead to the air pollution (Xie et al., 2019 ). Some studies have focused on the relationship between urbanization and air pollution in China, as well as air quality management in large Chinese cities. Chan et al. (2008)  indicates that the increase in Chinese exports has boosted the property growth, extensive construction activities and cars purchases, which have aggravated air pollution.  2.3 Industrial agglomeration and environmental pollution The impact of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution mainly includes agglomeration scale effect and knowledge spillover effect. Researches that support the agglomeration scale effect find that industrial agglomeration will lead to the expansion of capacity and the increase of energy consumption in the agglomeration area, resulting in negative externalities on the environment (Tan et al., 2022 ). Therefore, some researchers believe that industrial agglomeration will not only promote economic development, but also aggravate the deterioration of environmental pollution in the agglomeration area, bringing a “double-edged sword” effect (Chen & Wang, 2022 ). However, scholars who are inclined to knowledge spillover think that industrial agglomeration can improve environmental pollution (Taylor & Copeland, 2003 , p. 9823). This argument is mainly based on the externality theory of Marshall (1890)  and Jacobs (1969) . Marshall (1890)  pointed out that the geographical agglomeration of the same industry is conducive to the diffusion and sharing of knowledge and technology, and provides the production efficiency of enterprises, while Jacobs (2016)  puts forward that knowledge spillovers often come from diverse industries, and diversified agglomeration is more conducive to the diffusion of technology and knowledge. Although the types of industrial agglomeration studied by these two theories are not the same, they both agree that industrial agglomeration can increase the opportunities for mutual learning and communication among enterprises, and promote the diffusion of technology and knowledge among enterprises. Further research revealed this knowledge spillover effect can encourage enterprises to adopt more environment-friendly and cleaner production technologies (Kageyama et al., 2006 ). The adoption of environmental technologies will help to decrease the level of environmental pollution in the agglomeration area (Cooke, 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). While researchers who advocate linear relationship have different opinions on the direction of effect of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution, supporters of nonlinear theory have formed different views on the shape. Specifically, different opinions are held on “U-shape”, “inversed N-shape” and “N-shape” (Pei et al., 2021 ). Wang and Wang (2019)  suggested that there should be a positive U-shaped relationship between industrial agglomeration and environmental pollution because knowledge and technology spillover effects will promote technological progress and perfect the environment in the early stage. However, when the agglomeration area is overcrowded, the natural resources and energy are rapidly and massively consumed, leading to the rapid deterioration of the environment. However, Tan et al. (2022)  supposed that in the early stage of industrial agglomeration, the resource allocation does not reach the optimal state, and a large amount of energy have the need to be consumed in the process of industrial development, so industrial agglomeration will lead to relatively serious smog pollution. Then, as the scale of industrial agglomeration tends to be stable, knowledge and technology sharing among enterprises will be conducive to green development and improve environmental performance. However, if the degree of industrial agglomeration continues to rise and the scale is too large, it will cause overcrowding and aggravate pollution. Therefore, there is an N-shape nonlinear relationship and Liu and Lin (2019)  assumed that industrial agglomeration and environmental pollution have a dynamic inversed N-shape relationship. This is because knowledge and technology sharing will raise the production efficiency of enterprises, accelerate green innovation and reduce environmental pollution in the early stage. When the industrial agglomeration reaches a certain degree, the agglomeration area will be overcrowded which probably will lead to the environmental deterioration. However, with the iterative upgrading of green innovation technologies and the transformation of highly polluting firms, enterprise agglomeration will no longer aggravate pollution, but improve environmental performance. In general, although the existing literature has explored the externality of industrial agglomeration, the harmfulness of air pollution, and the linear or nonlinear relationship, there are still some deficiencies. Firstly, from the perspective of research, existing literature mostly focuses on the linear or nonlinear relationship between industrial agglomeration and environmental pollution, but do not fully consider the spillover effect of agglomeration on neighboring areas, and few studies further explore the relationship between industrial agglomeration and air pollution through spatial econometric methods. Secondly, in terms of the mechanism, the existing literature lacks in-depth and systematic research on the influencing mechanism of industrial agglomeration on air pollution. Finally, in terms of research samples, the existing literature mostly adopts provincial panel data for research. However, China has still in the primary stage of development presently, and the imbalance and inadequacy of economic development are prominent. There are significant discrepancies in the level of economic development, industrial structure and resource endowment between different regions in the same province. Considering the above deficiencies, this paper makes appropriate improvements based on the existing researches, in order to study the effect and transmission mechanism of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution further to provide targeted suggestions for the more effective industrial and environmental policies formulation. There is no definitive conclusion about the relationship between Chinese industrial agglomeration and environmental pollution. Liu and Zhang (2021)  suggested that China has still been in the stage of increasing levels of air pollution, but the intensity of pollution is falling.   3 Mechanism analysis The influence of industrial agglomeration on air pollution is not completely and directly in many conditions, but may also be transmitted through many factors. The paper discusses and analyzes the transmission mechanism of industrial agglomeration to air pollution from the following three dimensions that are environmental regulation, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading. 3.1 Industrial agglomeration, environmental regulation, and air pollution “Regulation” is not only an independent single factor, but also a means and arrangement that can be extended to many fields to positively stimulate the performance and future development (Wang et al., 2021a,b ). Specifically, environmental regulation refers to administrative orders and market-based environmental rules issued to enterprises, and the primary goal of environmental regulation is to achieve regional environmental development for the better by inhibiting the firm's pollution behavior (Wang & Shen, 2016 ). Environmental regulation is a kind of external supervision and intervention on environmental protection, which is implemented by the government and mostly point to the pollution-oriented enterprises (Wang et al., 2022 ). During the China's reform and opening up, the extensive development mode brought many serious pollution problems, which made environmental regulation enter the field of domestic economic research. In China, environmental regulation is mainly carried out by Chinese central government and supplemented by local governments, with the participation and assistance of multiple subjects, involving multiple guidance means and measures such as administration, finance and taxation (Du et al., 2020 ). China's environmental regulation is mainly reflected in a series of relevant policies, including the collection of pollutant discharge fees and emission quotas for highly polluting enterprises (Wang & Shen, 2016 ). In the aspect of the industrial agglomeration effects of environmental regulation, scholars generally believe that when the industrial concentration reaches a certain size and tends to be stable, the basic conditions can support the implementation of environmental regulation. The basic conditions include that the regional infrastructure has often perfect and the knowledge and technology sharing between enterprises is also more and more smooth and convenient (Zhu et al., 2014 ). Strict regulation implementation will reduce enterprises number which emit a lot of pollution, and contributes to the enhancement of environmental requirements of market access, in order to urge enterprises to improve production technology, eliminate or transfer polluting production, and encourage enterprises to fulfill their social responsibilities, emission reduction and environmental protection actively. After that, the degree of local air pollution can be reduced (Zhang et al., 2019a,b,c ). As environmental pollution has been reducing, the strong environmental regulation can also promote firms to carry out more innovative actions, and the production benefits brought by technological innovation can offset the cost of environmental conservation, so as to realize a virtuous circle between environmental regulation and ecological performance (Elrod & Malik, 2017 ).  3.2 Industrial agglomeration, technological progress, and air pollution The technological progress essence in society is to improve production efficiency and product quality by realizing new combinations of production factors and production conditions (Galor et al., 1997 ). It drives the business and social development. There are some factors driving the social innovation development including governmental investment, social R&D supports (Wen et al., 2021 ), corporate regulation (Li et al., 2021 ), entrepreneurship, policy environment, innovation environment, industrial situation, social capital, technical cooperation and technology spillover (Zhen et al., 2021 ). In addition, the interactions between a country's innovation support, infrastructure, and production factors also have impacts on technological progress (Pradhan et al., 2022 ). Industrial agglomeration can influence technological innovation through the following three paths. First, industrial agglomeration will intensify the competition in the same industry, forcing enterprises to actively promote technological progress and green innovation to occupy a dominant position (Sellitto et al., 2020 ). Second, the spillover effect of knowledge and technology will shorten the distance of knowledge transmission among enterprises to the greatest extent, allow the invisible knowledge transmission, construct innovation network and knowledge system with the flow of knowledge storage as the core, and generate a new driving force of technological progress. Based on technological progress, the market scale and demand are further expanded, and the income structure is also changed which contributes to the further promotion of technological progress which is centered on the regional industrial structure upgrading (Lai et al., 2014 ). Third, enterprises in the agglomeration area can jointly bear R&D costs and share R&D results through more convenient exchanges and cooperation, so as to improve the technological progress efficiency and promote the resource utilization. When the environmental protection technology in the region makes great progress, regional division of labor will be refined, regional production efficiency will be improved, and traditional pollution industries will be transformed and upgraded, which will reduce the negative impact on air quality to a certain extent (Margono et al., 2010 ). In addition, energy conservation and emissions reduction technology can raise the utilization efficiency of natural resources and energy, replace polluting energy production technology, reduce the enterprise cost, increase enterprise profit and stimulate enterprises increase investment to green technology research, which is conductive to realizing a virtuous cycle of enterprise production in the industrial agglomeration area (Fan et al., 2021 ). Such green technology-oriented technological progress and innovation will reduce the degree of air pollution and enhance air quality significantly (Huang et al., 2022 ).  3.3 Industrial agglomeration, industrial structure upgrading, and air pollution The upgrading of industrial structure mainly refers to the structural changes and optimization within the industry in the process of economic development, which promotes the rationalization of the proportion among industries and makes the benign changes among the levels of industrial structure (Dasgupta et al., 1980 ). The adjustment of the industrial structure will enable the previous development of the industry to be coordinated, harmonious and balanced, and maximize the effect of the industrial structure due to the self-adaptation function to the market (Wang et al., 2022 ). Existing literature indicates that industrial agglomeration might have an effect on industrial structure through the following three ways (Humphrey & Schmitz, 2000 ). Firstly, industrial agglomeration can improve resource utilization efficiency by reversing resource mismatch, resource integration ability, infrastructure construction to promote resource usage efficiency. It also can promote the circulation of factors and resources, realize the complementary advantages and industrial interaction within the industry, so as to promote the optimization and upgrading of industrial structure in the agglomeration area. Based on the Copeland-Taylor model, the empirical model was constructed, Liu et al. (2017)  concluded that the infrastructure improvement brought by industrial agglomeration can reduce the discharge of industrial pollutants in China indirectly. He studied the statistical panel data of 285 cities in 2003–2014 and pointed out that China has entered new normal stage of economic development which is more sustainable. Secondly, industrial agglomeration can force enterprises to reduce transaction costs and product prices through market price competition mechanism, which will encourage the optimization and upgrading of industrial structure. Based on the study of Chinese potential resources allocation and environmental capacity, Zhang et al. (2022)  measured the agricultural sustainable development index in 31 provinces of China and drew a conclusion that China's agricultural industrial agglomeration can exert a sustainable nonlinear effect on agricultural development through the upgrading of industrial structure. Finally, the industrial agglomeration may also increase the segment market, lift the specialization degree of collaboration, make enterprise focus on raising their productivity and efficiency to achieve scale reward, pay attention to saving the unnecessary technology transfer and the optimal allocation of resources. The industrial structure upgrading will affect air pollution directly or indirectly. For one thing, the unremitting adjustment of industrial structure will change the emission intensity and emission of air pollution in the production process directly, and then lead to the reduction of the total amount and emission rate of air pollution emissions (Zheng et al., 2020 ). Studies present that the industrial structure efficient upgrading and environmental protection will have a long-term and far-reaching impact on the environmental improvement, which is conducive to industrial adjustment and upgrading. It plays a decisive action in environment sustainable development as well (Wang & Wang, 2021 ). On the other hand, the industrial structure upgrading will bring indirect environmental effects. The rise of high-tech industries will reduce the environmental costs brought by economic development, and contributes to the economic mode transformation and air quality enhancement (Du et al., 2021 ). The industrial structure upgrading will also stimulate the rise of emerging industries. Emerging industries can alleviate air pollution through technological progress or chain linkage (Zhang et al., 2019a,b,c ), which is conductive to expanding China's development advantages and boosting the high-quality development of China's economy, and the resource-saving society and an environment-friendly society building on the high-quality development of industrial agglomeration and industrial structure transformation and upgrading (Liu et al., 2021 ). In summary, the industrial agglomeration influence mechanism on air pollution is depicted in Fig. 1   below.   4 Research design 4.1 Econometric model 4.1.1 Setting of dynamic spatial Dubin model Based on the spatial lag model, the spatial Dubin model is developed through considering the spatial correlation between the explanatory variables and explained variables, which is the synthesis of spatial autoregressive model and spatial error model (Hao et al., 2021 ). Considering that air will drift along with the movement of atmospheric circulation and wind, which makes air pollution become a kind of mobility pollution, it is essential to take the spatial spillover effect into account when investigating the effect of industrial agglomeration on air pollution. Moreover, since the accumulation of air pollutants is dynamic and continuous, the current pollution situation is very likely to be affected by previous state. Thus, we introduce the first-order lag term of the explained variable as well. This both takes the continuity of air pollution into account and makes it possible to separate the potential factors affecting air pollution, which can correct the bias of the static spatial panel model and improve the accuracy and reliability of results. (Elhorst, 2014 ). Referring to Feng and Wang (2020) , this paper preliminarily constructed the following dynamic space Dubin model:(1) ln  a i r p o l l u t i o n  i t   = α + μ  ln  a i r p o l l u t i o n  i t − 1   + ρ l n A g g l  i t   + θ W ∗ l n A g g l  i t   + ∑ β  ln  X i t   + ε i t           where, i    and t    stand for city and year respectively; a i r p o l l u t i o n    refers to the dependent variable, air pollution, and PM2.5  concentration (pm25 ) is selected as its proxy variable. A g g l    represents the core explanatory variable industrial agglomeration. Specifically, it includes two indicators: Specialized Industrial agglomeration level (s p e x   ) and Diversified Industrial agglomeration level (d i v   ). The selected spatial weight matrix is represented by W    and ln    is the logarithmic form. Since air pollution is also affected by a series of other economic factors, this paper also considers a series of control variables, denoted by X   , including economic development (p g d p   ), environmental regulation (er ), foreign direct investment (f d i   ), technology progress (r d   ) and industrial structure (s t r   ). α    is a constant term of the model, μ   , ρ   , θ    and β    are coefficients to be estimated, and ε i t      represents the random error term. As can be known from the previous literature review, domestic and foreign scholars have found that there may be “U”, inverted” U”, “N”, and inverted “N” relationships between industrial agglomeration and environmental pollution. Therefore, to comprehensively investigate the possible nonlinear relationship, we also introduce quadratic terms (ln  A g g l  i t  2    ) and cubic terms (ln  A g g l  i t  3    ) of industrial agglomeration on the basis of model (1), and obtain the following Equation (2) :(2) ln  a i r p o l l u t i o n  i t   = α + μ  ln  a i r p o l l u t i o n  i t − 1   + ρ 1  ln  A g g l  i t   + ρ 2  ln  A g g l  i t  2  + ρ 3  ln  A g g l  i t  3   + θ 1  W ∗ ln  A g g l  i t   + θ 2  W ∗ ln  A g g l  i t  2  + θ 3  W ∗ ln  A g g l  i t  3  + ∑ β l n X i t   + ε i t         It should be noted that in equation (2) , the coefficient ρ i     (i  = 1,2,3) measures the effect of industrial agglomeration on local air pollution, while the coefficient θ i     (i  = 1,2,3) reflects the spillover effect of industrial agglomeration on air pollution in neighboring areas. By substituting the specific indicators selected in this paper into Equation (2) , the dynamic spatial Dubin model for benchmark regression in this paper can be obtained as shown in Equation (3) :(3) ln  p m 25  i t   = α + μ  ln  p m 25  i t − 1   + ρ 1  l n s p e x  i t   + ρ 2  l n s p e x  i t  2  + ρ 3  l n s p e x  i t  3  + θ 1  W ∗ l n s p e x  i t   + θ 2  W ∗ l n s p e x  i t  2  + θ 3  W ∗ l n s p e x  i t  3  + β 1  l n p g d p  i t   + β 2  l n e r  i t   + β 3  l n f d i  i t   + β 4  l n t e c h  i t   + β 5  l n s t r  i t   + ε i t         4.1.2 Construction of the spatial weight matrix Spatial weight matrix is a way to express the proximity relationship between spatial units and is an indispensable part before spatial metrological analysis (Zhang et al., 2021 ). It reflects the degree of interdependence between certain geographical or economic attribute values in different spatial regions (LeSage & Pace, 2008 ). In this study, the inverse distance matrix W1  represents the spatial weight effect between regions. At the same time, in order to comprehensively investigate the influence of economic distance and R&D capability distance, the economic distance weight matrix W2  and R&D capability distance weight matrix W3  are constructed by making the reference of the method of Dong and Wang (2019) . The economic distance weight matrix represents the economic distance by the difference of regional GDP, and the R&D capability distance weight matrix represents the R&D capability distance by the difference of R&D input. Specifically, the construction method of the economic distance matrix W 2     is shown in Equations (4)–(6) :(4) W 2  = W 1  d i a g ( e d  1  ¯  e d  ¯   , e d  2  ¯  e d  ¯   … … e d  n  ¯  e d  ¯    )          (5) e d  i  ¯  = 1 ( t 1 −   t 0  + 1  )   ∑ t 0  t 1   e d  i t           (6) e d  ¯  = 1 n ( t 1  − t 0  + 1  )    ∑ i n  ∑ t 0  t 1   e d  i t              Among them, e d  i  ¯     is the mean GDP of region i  over the years. e d  ¯     is the mean GDP of the full sample. The distance matrix of R&D capability W 3     is constructed as shown in Equations (7)–(9) :(7) W 3  = W 1  d i a g ( H 1  ¯  H ¯   , H 2  ¯  H ¯   … … H n  ¯  H ¯    )          (8) H i  ¯  = 1 ( t 1  − t 0  + 1  )   ∑ t 0  t 1   H i t           (9) H ¯  = 1 n ( t 1  − t 0  + 1  )    ∑ i n  ∑ t 0  t 1   H i t              Among them, H i  ¯     is the mean R&D input of region i over the years. H ¯     is the mean R&D input of the full sample. To verify the robustness of the results under different spatial weight matrix selection, this paper further selects the square matrix of the inverse distance matrix W4, the square matrix of the economic distance W5 and the square matrix of the R & D distance matrix W6. At the same time, considering the possible measurement error of the distance between the whole samples and the need of this paper to investigate the impact on different urban economic circles, this paper also sets the local spatial weight matrix with the thresholds of 200 km, 250 km, 300 km, 400 km, 500 km and 600 km to investigate the impact of industrial agglomeration on air pollution in urban economic circles with different distances.  4.1.3 Verification of conduction mechanism According to the previous analysis, the impact of industrial agglomeration on air pollution is likely to be affected by other factors. Aiming to further explore the impact mechanism of industrial agglomeration on air pollution, this paper also establishes the following Equations (10)–(12)  to test the impact of environmental regulation, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading:(10) ln  p m 25  i t   = α + μ  ln  p m 25  i t − 1   + ρ 1  l n s p e x  i t   + ρ 2  l n e r ∗ l n s p e x  i t   + β 1  l n p g d p  i t    + β 2  l n f d i  i t   + β 3  l n t e c h  i t   + β 4  l n s t r  i t   + ε i t        (11) ln  p m 25  i t   = α + μ  ln  p m 25  i t − 1   + ρ 1  l n s p e x  i t   + ρ 2  l n t e c h ∗ l n s p e x  i t   + β 1  l n p g d p  i t    + β 2  l n f d i  i t   + β 3  l n e r  i t   + β 4  l n s t r  i t   + ε i t        (12) ln  p m 25  i t   = α + μ  ln  p m 25  i t − 1   + ρ 1  l n s p e x  i t   + ρ 2  l n s t r ∗ l n s p e x  i t   + β 1  l n p g d p  i t    + β 2  l n f d i  i t   + β 3  l n e r  i t   + β 4  l n t e c h  i t   + ε i t        where, the meanings of each variable are consistent with the previous ones.   4.2 Variable selection 4.2.1 Calculation of industrial agglomeration Based to the different modes of agglomeration, industrial agglomeration can be divided into specialization and diversification. In order to accurately describe the regional industrial agglomeration level, this paper firstly included 19 subdivided industries such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and mining into the measurement range of industrial agglomeration level in accordance of the classification of China Statistical Yearbook, and then used the distribution of employment number among industries to measure the degree of regional specialization and diversification of industrial agglomeration. Specifically, this two kinds of industry agglomeration degree of calculation is as follows: (1) Specialization agglomeration (s p e x   ). In the existing studies, the location quotient (LQ) is the most common indicator for the evaluation of the specialization agglomeration (Galliano et al., 2015 ; Han et al., 2018 ; Tian, 2013 ). This is because LQ index can eliminate the influence of regional scale and reflect the distribution of geographical factors in space more realistically. Referring to previous studies, We measure specialization agglomeration of each city based on the LQ index, which captures MAR externalities:(13) s p e x  i  = Max j  ( S i , j   S j   )          where SPE i   is specialization agglomeration in city i . S i,j   represents the employment weight in given industry j  in given city i ; and S j   refers to the employment weight of industry j  in the total employment in all cities. (2) Diversification agglomeration (d i v   ). Originating from Duranton and Puga (2001), we calculate the diversified agglomeration of each city through Equation (14) :(14) D I V i  = 1 ∑ j = 1  n  | S i , j   − S j   |            where DIV i   is diversification agglomeration in city i . Other variables mean the same as in Formula (7) . n  is the total number of industries (max = 19), according to the industrial classification for national economic activities (GB/T4754-2002) by the National Bureau of Statistics of China.  4.2.2 Calculation of air pollution As smog pollution has become one of the most concerned air pollution problems in recent years, PM2.5 concentrations is used to measure air pollution level in this paper. With reference to Hao et al. (2021) , we calculated the annual average PM2.5 concentration data of Chinese cities by ArcGIS software based on the 2003–2013 global PM2.5 density map released by the Center for Socioeconomic Data and Applications (SEDAC) of Columbia University and combined with the geographical situation of China.  4.2.3 Control variables Economic development (pgdp ). Regional economic development is inevitably accompanied by energy consumption and waste emission, which makes economic development a crucial factor affecting air pollution (Roca et al., 2001 ). In this paper, per capita GDP is taken as the measurement index of regional economic development level, and considering the result deviation caused by price factors, the GDP data is deflated by price index based on 2003 to ensure the comparability and consistency of data (Hao & Liu, 2016 ). Environmental Regulation (er ). Environmental regulation is a vital means to carry out environmental supervision and optimize environmental quality. However, academic researchers have not reached a unified conclusion on the influence of environmental regulation on environmental pollution (Zhang et al., 2019a,b,c ). Therefore, environmental regulation is also taken into account in this paper, and the average value of three indicators, namely, the standard compliance rate of industrial wastewater, the comprehensive utilization rate of industrial solid waste, and the harmless treatment rate of domestic waste, is used for measurement (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Foreign direct investment (fdi ). There are still various opinions on the effect of foreign direct investment on environmental pollution. Some believe that the host country has pollution refuge effect, that is, foreign direct investment will deteriorate the environmental quality of the host country (Bu & Wagner, 2016 ). Others hold different opinions, suggesting that the inflow of FDI is conducive to improving regional environmental pollution (Tripathy et al., 2022 ). Therefore, this paper takes foreign direct investment as one of the control variables, and uses the proportion of foreign investment in GDP to represent the index of foreign direct investment. Technology progress (tech ). Technological progress contributes to the increase of energy utilization efficiency and plays a pivotal role in the improvement of environmental pollution, and the amount of urban investment in science and technology can reflect how much a city attaches importance to technology (Wu et al., 2020 ). In consideration of the availability of data, this paper selects the scientific expenditure of each city to measure the technology progress. Industrial structure (str ). Industrial structure is the synthesis of linkages and proportional relations among industries, and the energy consumption and pollution emission of different industries are very different. Generally speaking, the energy consumption of the tertiary industry is much lower than that of the secondary industry, resulting in less pollution (Hao et al., 2020 ). Referring to the existing literature, this paper uses the third proportion to measure the industrial structure in each city (Hao et al., 2021 ).   4.3 Data sources and descriptive statistics To ensure the accuracy of the data, in this paper, the data involved in the calculation of industrial agglomeration are from the database of Chinese industrial enterprises and the other variables are data are mainly from the China Urban Statistical Yearbook, and are supplemented by the China Economic and Social Development Statistical Database. Subject to the availability and completeness of industrial agglomeration data, this paper finally collected balanced panel data of 164 cities in China from 2003 to 2013 for empirical study. At the same time, in order to ensure the comparability of the data, this paper deflates the relevant nominal data in the base period of 2003. For the vacant data, this paper adopts the mean method to make up. To mitigate the influence of heteroscedasticity and statistical bias on the accuracy of estimation results, all variables in the model were logarithmicized in this paper. Descriptive statistics of data are listed in Table 1  . As reported in Table 1 , the standard deviation of air pollution and technology progress are much larger than other variables, indicating that the environmental qualities and development levels among China's cities varies widely.   5 Results and discussion 5.1 Benchmark regression results On the foundation of the dynamic spatial Dubin model, the regression results of industrial agglomeration on air pollution are reported by Table 2  , from which, the coefficients of one-stage lag term of explained variable (lnpm2.5 it-1  ) and the square of random error's standard deviation (sigma2_e ) are all significant at 1%, and Spatial rho  is acceptable, denoting that it is reasonable and feasible to employ the dynamic spatial Dubin model to explore the local-neighborhood spatial effects of industrial agglomeration on air pollution. Moreover, the coefficient of lnpm2.5it-1  is significantly positive, indicating that air pollution in China has a time-lag effect. That is, the former air pollution will aggravate the current air pollution, which is also consistent with the conclusion of Gan et al. (2020) . The coefficients of lnspex , (lnspex) 2   and (lnspex) 3   all denote the same trend of “negative-positive-negative” under various spatial weight matrix, which implies that an inverted-N relationship exist between industrial agglomeration and air pollution. More accurately, the air pollution of industrial agglomeration area may experience the ups and downs of “gradual decline-increasingly pollute-improve again” with the development of industrial agglomeration, which is in consistency with the results of Liu and Lin (2019) . In the early stages of industrial agglomeration, a batch of different types of enterprises that produce a product, as well as upstream and downstream enterprises supporting these enterprises, are highly concentrated together in a certain area (Guo et al., 2020 ), and resource allocation is effectively utilized, which can effectively improve carbon productivity (Liu & Zhang, 2021 ), thereby reducing air pollution in industrial agglomerations. As industrial agglomeration advancing to a certain stage, the overall level of its impact on industrial pollution will gradually increase (Liu et al., 2017 ), which can be further interpreted by the fact that the industrial agglomeration develops too fast while the related transportation (Wei et al., 2020 ) and downstream sales services cannot keep on pace with industrial agglomeration, resulting in the excessive burden of resource endowment of the industrial agglomerations itself (Zheng et al., 2022 ), thereby polluting the atmospheric environment. And then, the development of industrial agglomeration increasingly becomes mature, weighter the supporting policies of industrial agglomeration and the transportation service in industrial agglomerations and neighbor areas. The agglomeration areas can strengthen cooperation with neighboring cities, improve the utilization efficiency of resources, save costs of production and sales, thus reducing the air pollution of the agglomeration areas. At the same time, the coefficients of W × lnspex , W × (lnspex) 2   and W × (lnspex) 3   also indicate the trend of “negative-positive-negative” under various spatial weight matrix, which denoting that an inverted-N nexus also exists between local industrial agglomeration and neighbor air pollution. Furthermore, the neighbor air pollution may experience the ups and downs of “gradual decline-increasingly pollute-improve again” with the advancement of local industrial agglomeration. The possible interpretation for this phenomenon is in the process of industrial agglomeration, some enterprises in adjacent areas may be first attracted to industrial agglomeration cities, which makes the air pollution level in adjacent areas decrease. Then, with the advancement of industrial agglomeration, the development of industrial and enhancement of transportation infrastructure (causing large-scale congestion within and between the cities) will greatly increase the overall pollution level of the region (Liang et al., 2019 ; Shen et al., 2017 ), resulting in a further increase in air pollution levels in neighboring areas. Finally, as the industrial agglomeration areas can push the industrial upgrading and transformation of surrounding cities due to the radiation effect, the air pollution in adjacent areas will be improved again. Overall, industrial agglomeration will effectively reduce the overall urban air pollution in the long run. As for control variables, the estimated values of GDP per capita (pgdp ) are basically negative at 1% level, denoting the advancement of GDP per capita is conducive to the betterment of air quality. This can be attributed to the fact that in the time sample interval (2003–2013) selected in this paper, China's economic development was in the transition from “extensive development” method to “high-quality development” method. While energy consumption was important support for maintaining economic growth then (Fei et al., 2011 ), more and more attention was paid to the environmental protection, thus leading to the overall quality improvement of air. The estimated values of foreign direct investment (fdi ) are notably greater than 0, denoting the introduction of foreign capital can hinder the air quality improvement of industrial agglomerations. During the economic transition period, foreign direct investments were attracted into China for Chian's vast and cheap labor force, which may bring huge pollution to China's environment. In addition, environmental regulation (er ), technological progress (tech ) and industrial structure upgrading (str ) have significantly negative impacts on air pollution. Both environmental regulation and industrial structure upgrading contribute to mitigating air pollution, namely, energy efficiency improves due to stringent environmental policies and industrial structure upgrading could alleviate air pollution emissions (Lee et al., 2022 ; Zhou et al., 2019 ), and technological progress can improve air quality by reducing resource and human costs (Chen et al., 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2021 ). The regression results above based on global spatial weight matrixes imply that the neighbor air pollution will signal an inverted-N trend as local industrial agglomeration advancing. But the construction process of global spatial distance weight matrixes may include measurement errors, and because of the limitation of industrial agglomeration policy and the agglomeration characteristics of urban groups, the impact of industrial agglomeration has on air contamination may alter. For the purpose of further detect the influence of industrial agglomeration on air pollution in terms of different scale city groups, local spatial weight matrixes with 200 km, 250 km, 300 km, 400 km, 500 km and 600 km as the thresholds respectively are framed for further exploration. Table 3   lists the main findings. The findings reveal that the coefficients of W × lnspex , W × (lnspex) 2   and W × (lnspex) 3   also imply a trend of “negative-positive-negative”, indicating that an inverted-N relationship also exists between industrial agglomeration and air pollution under different local spatial weight matrixes. That is, as industrial agglomeration developing, the air pollution level of industrial agglomerations and its surrounding areas may still experience the ups and downs of “gradual decline-increasingly pollute-improve again’. Moreover, the effects of industrial agglomeration on air pollution in neighboring areas within 600 km are all noticeable, which can be interpreted by the continuous strengthening of regional links over the years. As urbanization accelerates all over the world, the concept of polycentric urban areas (PURs) was first proposed by Hoyler et al. (2008) . PURs refer to the gradual integration of many cities that are originally adjacent but have different functions, forming a broader urban agglomeration with many cities bear a variety of urban agglomeration functions. From this point of view, industrial agglomeration cities can rely on unique endowments (such as mineral resources, labor, scientific and technological progress) provided by other urbans in PURs to create green industrial value (Wang et al., 2021a,b ), and then alleviate the overall air pollution in the urban agglomeration over the long period. In addition, the spatial spillover effect of industrial agglomeration on air contamination implies the trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the increase of distance, and reaches the peak at the distance of 400 km, that is, within the limits of 400 km, the spatial spillover effect of industrial agglomeration on air pollution is the most noticeable.  5.2 Robustness test Industrial agglomeration specialization focuses on the high concentration of upstream and downstream enterprises and related industries. Industrial agglomeration diversification refers to the diversified structure of regional industries (Lili & Yuqi, 2021 ), which is another development direction of industrial agglomeration. This section replaces the core explanatory variable industrial agglomeration specialization (spex ) with industrial agglomeration diversification (divx ) to check the robustness of the benchmark regression model. Table 4   lists the main findings. As listed in Table 4 , the coefficients of lndivx , (lndivx) 2   and (lndivx) 3   also denote a trend of “negative-positive-negative” and are all statistically significant, confirming the robustness of the benchmark regression results. Moreover, the coefficients of W × lndivx , W × (lndivx) 2   and W × (lndivx) 3   reveal a “positive-negative-positive” trend, indicating that local industrial agglomeration diversification may increase air pollution levels in surrounding cities over the long term. This may be because diversified agglomeration in China is still in its primary stage compared with specialized agglomeration. Therefore, enterprises in the agglomeration area lack effective division of labor and cooperation, resulting in low efficiency of resource allocation and difficulty in playing the role of pollution control in the surrounding areas (Li et al., 2021 ).  5.3 Transmission mechanism verification In order to further detect how industrial agglomeration impacts air pollution, this part empirically checks the transmission mechanism of industrial agglomeration on air pollution from three perspectives of environmental regulation (er ), technological progress (tech ) and industrial structure upgrading (str ). 5.3.1 Industrial agglomeration, environmental regulation and air pollution The empirical results taken environmental regulation (er ) as the mediator variable are listed in Table 5  , which denoting that after the introduction of the interaction term lnspex × lner , the coefficients of which are less than 0 and notable at the p = 0.01 level, indicating the marginal effect of industrial agglomeration on air pollution will be affected by environmental regulation. More correctly, the influence of industrial agglomeration on air pollution will be weakened with the strengthening of environmental regulation. The possible explanation is that environmental regulation is mainly reflected in a series of relevant policies, among which there are many measures such as imposing emission fees and issuing emission limits on high-pollution enterprises. It can reduce the degree of air pollution by forcing enterprises to fulfill their social responsibility for energy saving and environment protection (Zhang et al., 2019a,b,c ). Additionally, due to strict environmental regulation strategies in industrial agglomeration areas, high-pollution enterprises may transfer polluting industries to less developed regions (Konisky, 2007 ; Wang et al., 2021a,b ), which also alleviates local air pollution.  5.3.2 Industrial agglomeration, technological progress and air pollution The empirical results taken technological progress (tech ) as the mediator variable are pointed out in Table 6  , which denoting that after the introduction of the interaction term lnspex × lntech , the coefficients of which are notably less than 0 at 1%, denoting the marginal effect of industrial agglomeration on air pollution will be influenced by technological progress. Less generally, the effect of industrial agglomeration on air pollution will be weakened with the enhancement of technology, which is mainly caused by the fact that when the production technology in the region continues to progress, the regional production efficiency will be greatly improved, thereby improving the air quality (Margono et al., 2010 ; Huang et al., 2022 ). In particularly, green technological advances in production process can effectively reduce haze pollution (Feng et al., 2021 ).  5.3.3 Industrial agglomeration, industrial structure upgrading and air pollution The empirical results taken industrial structure upgrading (str ) as the mediator variable are shown in Table 7  , which denoting that after the introduction of the interaction term lnspex × lnstr , the estimated values of which are all negative and significant at the p = 0.01 level, implying the marginal influence of industrial agglomeration on air pollution will be influenced by industrial structure upgrading. More specifically, the impact of industrial agglomeration on air pollution will be weakened with the continuous optimization of industrial structure. This can be attributed to the fact that optimized adjustment and upgrading of industrial structure is beneficial to the coordinated and balanced advancement of industries, while maximizing the industrial structure effect in the complex economic context currently (Wang et al., 2022 ). In addition, Wang and Wang (2021)  stated that industrial structure upgrading takes an important part in environmental sustainability. Zhang et al. (2019a,b,c)  also pointed out that optimizing industrial structure could improve air quality. The empirical results and analysis indicate that the third conduction mechanism is valid.    6 Conclusions and policy implications On the foundation of the balanced panel data of China's 164 cities from 2003 to 2013, the dynamic spatial Dubin model is adopted to quantitively detect the possible spatial effect of industrial agglomeration on air pollution at the city level, and explores potential mediating effect from the standpoints of environmental regulation, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading. The principal results are: Firstly, an inverted-N relationship exists between industrial agglomeration and air pollution. More explicitly, over the short term, the air pollution in the industrial agglomerations will decrease first, then increase. In the long term, with the enhancement of supporting measures for industrial development and infrastructure in the agglomeration areas, industrial agglomeration will effectively reduce the smog pollution. Secondly, because of the accelerated evolution of urbanization in China, an inverted-N relationship also exists between local industrial agglomeration and neighbor air pollution, and over the long period, the improvement of industrial agglomeration of the local can still lessen the adjacent cities’ air pollution. Finally, industrial agglomeration can alleviate the air pollution in urban agglomerations by influencing environmental regulation, technological progress and industry structure. On the grounds of conclusions above, the concerning policy suggestions are proposed: First, accelerate industrial agglomeration, especially industrial agglomeration specialization and improve related infrastructure construction of industrial agglomeration areas and the surrounding cities. Empirical analysis indicates that industrial agglomeration specialization of local cities will reduce air pollution of the cities and surrounding regions in the long term. As a result, following the principles of develop coordinately and produce eco-friendly, the government should blueprint well for local industrial clusters. Simultaneously, local government ought to reinforce the guidance of scientific planning, optimize the policy environment of industrial agglomeration, highlight the advantages and characteristics of local industries, and improve specialization and cooperation of local industrial clusters, so as to cultivate and develop local industrial clusters with characteristics of structure optimized, management system completed, eco-friend and competitiveness maximized, and effectively integrated industrial clusters into the scientific development track. Second, improve the environmental coordinate governance mechanism of industrial agglomeration cities and adjacent areas. Considering that industrial agglomeration can not only affect local air contamination, but also takes a positive part in reducing smog pollution in adjacent areas, it is necessary to set up a synergistic and effective governance mechanism for air pollution avoidance while promoting industrial agglomeration. The government ought to thoroughly contemplate the development direction of industrial clusters in local and adjacent areas, precisely decide the standpoint and planning prospects of policies, build a regional collaborative governance system, and enhance the effectiveness of environmental governance. Simultaneously, the authority ought to advance the responsibility mechanism of regional governance participation in ecological environment, realize the common participation of government, enterprise and the general public, thus fostering regional environment governance. Third, promote the innovation ability and upgrade industrial structure of industrial agglomeration areas, thus helping to advance the governance of regional air contamination. Empirical analysis of this research denotes that industrial agglomeration is able to further alleviate air contamination by stimulating technological progress and optimizing industrial structure. Therefore, the government of industrial agglomerations should adhere to the “Innovation-driven” strategy, increase financial support for scientific and technological research of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), thus achieving continuous improvement of regional scientific and technological level. Meanwhile, the government should encourage industrial optimization, thus optimizing the proportion of the three major industries in the region, enhancing the utilization rate of industrial resources, alleviating the total carbon emissions in the region, and achieving energy saving and carbon-emission reduction. Although this paper examines the possible influence and transmission mechanism of industrial agglomeration on air contamination from the standpoints of spatial dynamic evolution, there are still many deficiencies. Following our research, future research can consider the differences between industrial agglomeration specialization and industrial agglomeration diversification to examine their potential impacts on air pollution respectively. In addition, air pollution contains various types, taking the reliability and availability of data into account, this study only administrates PM2.5  concentration as indicator of air pollution. Further investigation can incorporate multiple emission indicators, even environmental governance indicators at the government level into the air pollution evaluation system so as to greatly improving the universality of research conclusions.
