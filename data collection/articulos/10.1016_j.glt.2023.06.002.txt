                  Despite an increasing global demand for the implementation of necessary measures to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the increasing number of disaster and public health emergencies, and the outcomes of recent crises, have proven to be a real obstacle to achieving these goals. The outcomes of several past events, in particular the coronavirus-19 pandemic crisis, illustrate a turning point in achieving these goals due to its political, economic, and sociocultural impacts. Since the United Nations' sustainable development goals are interrelated, they are all prone to internal and external disturbances. The analysis of past events has particularly revealed that the lack of partnership, peace, justice, and strong institutional structure, is the main obstacle to achieving these goals. This rapid review confirms the impact of disasters and public health emergencies on two major sustainable development goals, i.e., goals 16 and 17, indicating a need for global partnership (goal 17) to achieve peace, justice, and a strong institutional structure (goal 16) as a prerequisite to achieving the entire United Nation's development goals.

From a humanitarian perspective, such a transition aims to transform human life and societies into a marked change in several fields [2 ,3 ]. Although such transition aims to achieve positive development, it might be influenced by local, national, and global events, e.g., natural, and man-made hazards, with negative outcomes on humanity [4–6 ]. The Indian Ocean Tsunami that hit several countries in Southeast Asia was one of the deadliest examples of such events that killed more people than any other tsunami in recorded history, with 227,898 dead or missing in 14 countries across the Indian Ocean. The humanitarian, and healthcare-related impacts of the Tsunami were global with several deaths among the victims from around the world [7 ,8 ]. In 2010, the earthquake in Haiti resulted in the loss of lives and properties but also destroyed infrastructure, intensified poverty, and hunger, and resulted in economic and health-related negative outcomes [9 ]. In July 2011, the terrorist attacks in Oslo and Utøya affected the well-being of the Norwegian and created anger, fear, and anxiety in the rest of Europe [10 ,11 ]. Examples are many, however, they all contribute negatively to the environmental, political, and socioeconomic life of people to a different degree depending on each country's socioeconomic and infrastructural development [12 ]. At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2012, the so-called “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDGs) were developed. These 17 global goals, related to the environmental, political, and economic issues and challenges, facing humanity, were selected by the UN member countries in 2015 as universally applicable objectives that could transform the world between 2015 and 2030 into a better situation. The goals are formulated as a commitment that seeks to address the most urgent, global, and interrelated problems [13 ]. SDGs call for universal and sustainable action against threats to humanity, such as climate change, insufficient management of natural resources, reducing inequality, poverty, access to health, etc. Each goal can be achieved solely; however, since the goals are interrelated, the assessment and management of all goals simultaneously should be considered and prioritized [14–17 ]. Although there are various ways of classifying these goals, they have been classified into four areas for this study.a) Environmental factors    These are fundamental factors concerning the human environment that contribute to a healthy and sustainable life and consist of: Clean Water (Goal 6), Affordable Clean Energy (Goal 7), Climate Actions (Goal 13), Life below Water (Goal 14), and Life on Land (Goal 15).b) Infrastructural and economic factors    These are essential requirements for societal development and link environmental factors to social and healthcare-related factors. They consist of Decent Work and Economic Development (Goal 8), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (Goal 9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal 11), and Responsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12).c) Social and Health-related factors    These are either a consequence of the two first areas or are facilitators. They consist of No Poverty (Goal 1), Zero Hunger (Goal 2), Good Health and Well-Being (Goal 3), Quality Education (Goal 4), Gender Equality (Goal 5), and Reduce Inequalities (Goal 10).d) Consequential factors    These are factors that are instrumental for the GT process, global transformation, and implementation of the other three groups. The impact of these factors on the achievement of the goals is critical. They consist of Peace, Justice, Strong Institutions (Goal 16), and Partnerships for the Goals (Goal 17). While all nations are called upon to design their plans and activate their resources to achieve SDGs goals [13 ], the complexity and interdependency of SDGs may create some difficulties in their implementation since achieving some goals depends on some other goals. The most important prerequisite in achieving SDGs seems to be the consequential factors. The absence of peace, justice, and strong institutional structure on one hand and the lack of partnership, on the other hand, may have a strong impact on environmental, infrastructural, economic, social, and health-related factors [14–17 ]. This rapid review aims to study the recent publications dealing with SDGs and to identify the impacts of the consequential factors on achieving the other elements of the UN's SDGs.  2 Method A rapid literature review, i.e., a systematic search and non-systematic analysis of available papers was performed to examine the most relevant publications in the field regarding SDGs, matched with the consequential elements of SDGs, i.e., Peace, Justice, Strong Institutions, and Partnership [18 ]. Searching process:   The search keywords; “Peace,” “Justice,” “Strong Institutions,” “Partnership” and “Sustainable Development Goals”/“SDGs” were used alone or in combination to identify available publications in the following search engines; PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligibility:   Only publications in English describing or discussing the impacts of keywords on SDGs. Each eligible study was thoroughly reviewed. Inclusion criteria:   All recently published papers from 2022 to 2023. Exclusion criteria:   Articles with no relevance to the aims, non-English papers, and those dated before 2022 and later. Content analysis:   A qualitative thematic analysis of the included literature was conducted, focusing on similarities and differences in the findings to present the tentative results [19 ]. The findings were coded and categorized as diverse themes.  3 Results The initial search with no date limitation resulted in hundreds of thousands of publications dealing with SDGs and various elements and factors that could impact them negatively or enhance their achievement. As it seemed to be an impossible task for a rapid review, each keyword was isolated and represented as “XX” and the following stepwise search was implemented to reduce the number of potential and recent publications with the following outcomes: “Peace” 24,000; AND “Justice” 9440; AND “Strong Institutions” 588; AND “Partnership” 204; AND “Sustainable Development Goals” 185. A review of the abstracts of the selected papers resulted in the removal of 155 papers, which were either duplications (n = 44) or not related to the aim of the study (n = 111). The remaining 30 papers from PubMed (n = 2), Scopus (n = 24), and Web of Science (n = 4) were studied thoroughly (abstract and the main manuscript). In addition, 21 articles from the reference lists of included studies with relevance to the topic were added in the final stage (Fig. 1  ). Content analysis resulted in the following subsections. 3.1 Preparedness and SDGs In general, the purpose of crisis preparedness is to protect the life and health of the population, the critical societal functions, and the ability to maintain fundamental values of a society, such as democracy, justice, the rule of law, freedoms, and human rights (SDG no. 16 ) [20 ,21 ]. To do so, there is a need for structure and organization, an awareness of the content of each entity, and proper knowledge about how these entities can collaborate (SDG no. 17 ) through phases of the disaster and emergency cycle to make a larger network, capacity, and potential to combat subsequent hazards and incidents [22–24 ]. The process of DPHEs can be divided into four stages: preventive, planning/preparation, response, and recovery phases. These phases aim to minimize the risks and counteract the negative consequences of a crisis in a stepwise process [25 ,26 ]. Preventive measures, i.e., a set of interventions that aim to counteract identified, experienced, or learned risks, are implemented as solutions to the gaps and shortcomings before and after an event and aim to reduce the likelihood of a crisis or disaster occurring. These measures aim to secure all environmental, infrastructural, social, and health-related factors (SDGs no 1 to 15 ) that can be influenced by DPHEs. DPHEs can influence the prerequisite factors for SDGs achievement, i.e., peace, justice, structural institutions, and necessary partnership (SDGs no. 16,17 ) [9 ,20 ,27 ]. Thus, any risks or identified shortcomings influencing the elements of SDGs 16, and 17 may lead to a failure in subsequent incident management [28–33 ]. To identify, intervene, and evaluate the outcomes of risk or shortcomings that lead to failure of achieving SDGs, one should either be exposed to real DPHEs or partake in a simulation exercise [34 ]. In each way, critical factors that influence the outcome in all phases of an incident should be carefully considered and incorporated into a plan. A simulation, however, offers a safer environment to make mistakes and learn from the mistakes with no harm to victims [34 ].  3.2 Critical factors Changing and growing threats to the nation's infrastructure have altered the boundaries of traditional risk assessment and risk mitigation efforts [25 ,27 ,29 ,31 ]. Resilience has become a common concept and involves the continuous provision of social and health-related services, even in the aftermath of destructive events. This applies both to recurring and known events, but also to events that have not been predicted or practised and that require deep knowledge in the technical and financial spheres [31–33 ]. Power grids, transport networks, information, and communication systems are among the so-called "critical infrastructures” that are necessary to maintain vital societal functions and that must be protected from natural and manmade hazards, and criminal activity (SDGs 8,9,11,12 ). This includes border areas, major road networks, rail traffic, waterways, marine ports, airports, power and water sources, nuclear power plants, and major pipelines. Damage or destruction to these critical areas has negative consequences for the safety and well-being of human beings (SDGs 1,2,3,4,5,10 ) [17 ,27 ,28 ,35 ,36 ]. As a measure to reduce vulnerability to these factors, the European Commission has launched the European Critical Infrastructure Protection Program (EPCIP). This is a package of measures aimed at improving protection and constitutes support for national and regional authorities (EU-Critical infrastructure) [37 ]. Similar packages should be established globally. 3.2.1 Communication system The communication structure has developed intensively in a short time. An increasing dependence on functioning IT structures for external and internal surveillance, transactions, trade, control, and security, at the same time constitute sensitive areas for the maintenance of crisis management. Eliminating individual systems complicates efforts in areas where analogue counterparts have been scrapped or become substandard due to a lack of maintenance [38–40 ]. Information and misinformation can be easily spread via social media or data breaches [41 ]. Congestion can knock out telephony and other vital control and logistics systems. One of many examples is global navigation systems, such as "Global Positioning System (GPS)", and "GNSS receiver (Global Navigation Satellite System)" which are used to an increasing extent in various industries. GPS/GNSS is increasingly important for the safe operation of several critical infrastructures such as electricity networks, telecommunications networks, and financial systems, and is used in many critical network infrastructures, such as fixed and wireless networks and for transport. Work to detect, minimize or eliminate various risks to these critical factors from natural disasters to sabotage is part of the preventive measures to maintain preparedness [38–40 ,42 ]. These changes have direct impacts on almost all SDGs.  3.2.2 Critical buildings Protection of critical infrastructure during certain types of intentional threats or accidents, such as explosions, and blast waves is another type of preventive activity. Vulnerability in buildings is identified and classified through accurate material modelling, structural mechanics, and numerical simulation techniques. Authorization systems in personnel-intensive operations are another challenge. An example is hospitals, where openness and flexible access to operational activities and support activities are necessary, while crises and disasters surrounding hospital environments not only pose primary threats during the event itself but also threaten preparedness in the aftermath. In addition, a hospital needs to be built for quick and efficient evacuation, although recent incidents of threats within buildings have underlined the need to be able to contain parts of buildings. Furthermore, the demands on person/border controls and police authority are increasing. Situations, where special interventions by the police, rescue services, and other surveillance and security activities are required, may also increase. Terrorist attacks within the EU, such as those in Paris and Brussels, increased the focus on issues affecting democracy, the rule of law, and human freedoms and rights [31–33 ,43 ].  3.2.3 Information security Information security is about the measures taken to prevent information from being leaked, distorted, or destroyed, but also that information must be available to authorized persons when it is needed. Information can be communicated, stored, and can be used to control processes. A large part of the information is vital for the individual (e.g., patient records) but also for society (governance and maintenance systems). Information security requires considerations of availability, authorization, reliability, confidentiality, need for encryption, and traceability. In addition, information and information systems need to be protected against digital threats and sabotage (e.g., viruses, worms, overload, phishing, and Trojans) [39–41 ,43 ,44 ].  3.2.4 Supply chain Technical infrastructure and supply systems may be targeted by natural or man-made hazards through 1) Disruptions in the electricity supply, 2) Disturbances in electronic communications, 3) Disruptions in the fuel supply, and 4) Disruptions in the flow of goods to/from the large marine ports. Should any of these social disturbances occur, it would have an impact on what is worth protecting in that specific local, regional, or national area and impacts all SDGs [45 ].  3.2.5 Climate change Climate change can be caused by both natural and man-made hazards and increases the risks of major incidents locally and nationally, affecting cultural environments such as landscapes, buildings, and ancient remains [5 ,14–16 ]. Torrential rains, storms, floods, mudslides, landslides, forest fires, droughts, and heat waves, can all cause major consequences for people's health, and property, their living environment, and societal functions. The results of these incidents impact all SDGs, especially social and health-related factors. Almost all these hazards require detailed geographical analysis to identify prone areas and their geographical delimitation [29 ,31 ,43 ]. Extreme cold and prolonged heat waves can occur throughout some countries. Heat waves are a risk that increases with climate change. Cities might be particularly vulnerable due to local heat effects, so-called heat radiation from buildings and streets [46 ]. Forest fires have been identified as a risk in some countries [47 ].  3.2.6 CBRN Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) events can cause damage to people and their living environment and critical societal disturbances. The risks for such incidents should be identified in vulnerable areas, consisting of areas with landslide risks, dam failure, pollution (in soil or through emissions from ships), oil spills, releases of radioactive substances from a nuclear facility, chemical accidents with the release of substances, contaminated drinking water source, etc. (chemical release or biological contamination) [48 ].  3.2.7 Social risks Social risks are linked to people's living conditions and trust in society and its institutions (SDG 16 ). The lack of trust can be directed at the individual himself, at others, as well as at society and its institutions. Building trust between government and people depends on the ability of a government to offer its people a good living environment, employment, the possibility of personal mobility, necessary healthcare, democracy, financial stability, and education. Social risks are prevented by maintaining trust, which ought to be worth protecting. Deteriorating living conditions lead to lower trust in society and more vulnerability to DPHEs [49 ].  3.2.8 Diseases Diseases can cause major consequences in society. Some diseases are contagious and can thus affect a large part of the population, with a loss of socially important functions as a result. Diseases also give rise to great fear and anxiety. Communicable diseases that affect people on a large scale have serious consequences for society. The following types of infections are of major concern: 1. Epidemic/pandemic; 2. Epizootics (animals); 3. Zoonosis (contagion between animals and humans); and 4. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, chronic diseases may worsen and increase the burden of the already overwhelmed healthcare system, as witnessed by the still ongoing coronavirus pandemic [50–52 ].  3.2.9 Refugees and mass migration Refugee and mass immigration occurs for various reasons, such as conflict, political or religious oppression, lack of livelihood, and climate-related causes, and contributes to instability and differences in living standards, and fluctuating but increasing refugee immigration. Refugee immigration, both legal and illegal, place a demand on society and its functions, such as healthcare and education. The former finds itself in a strained situation with difficulties in meeting the need of the normal population as well as for assistance of the physical and mental health of asylum seekers. Social services as well as school and educational activities face the same difficulties with adaptations to different language groups and cultural differences. Furthermore, demands on the availability of housing contribute to the relocation of refugees to sparsely populated municipalities whose supply of adapted services may be insufficient, increasing inequality, hatred, and racism [53 ,54 ].   3.3 The impact of DPHEs on healthcare Although the availability of resources and the risks for DPHE occurrence varies from land to land, healthcare will be overloaded with several challenges. In general, most countries face the following challenges on large or small scales. 3.3.1 Decontamination capacity Capacity tests should be performed to avoid duplication and recontamination among multi-agency organizations, emergency services, and hospitals in events of CBRN. Although capacity is a major issue for many countries, locally or nationally, other issues should be considered, such as the need for establishing joint strategies between diverse entities. Public awareness and increasing staff's willingness to partake in such an event are crucial. Simulation exercises may contribute to guidelines adjustment and mutual collaboration [55 ,56 ].  3.3.2 Logistics Logistics in disaster consists of chains of land, air, and marine-based ambulances, but also to supply other necessary materials, food, drugs, etc. to the DPHE-affected areas [45 ,57 ]. There are several issues and shortcomings in both the number of available vehicles and their function in DPHEs. In some areas, a significant number of secondary transportations between different hospitals endanger total preparedness. Unnecessary usage of ambulances and a lack of proper guidance for logistics in partnership with voluntary agencies can be important constraints. The number of available medical helicopters, and marine-based ambulances, especially in distanced areas varies due to the financial support and geographical patterns of each country [58 ,59 ]. Countries such as Norway have access to a larger number of helicopters for geographical reasons, while countries in other parts of the world may lack even one. This calls for continuous capacity tests of contracted/available resources and their staff through simulation exercises. Other alternatives such as temporarily stationed ambulances may increase the availability of ambulances during the risk period [58 ].  3.3.3 Special units and instruments There is a potential lack of ventilators during DPHEs. In addition, the lack of electricity may cause severe difficulties in the management of disaster victims. Mechanical ventilators should be used. Scenario-based simulation may assist in calculating the required number of ventilators in diverse scenarios. Current ethical and medical guidelines mandate a greater proportion of respirators for shorter or longer periods, as proven during the Covid-19 pandemic [60 ]. Some regions may lack care facilities for burn injuries. An investigation into how and in which facilities lighter burn injuries can be treated needs to be carried out. Potential hospitals in other regions or other countries should be identified and coordination, and cooperation should be enhanced for future collaboration [61 ]. The same concerns apply to dialysis units [62 ]. Several types of injuries are common in incidents caused by natural and man-made hazards. Capacity estimation and partnership with other agencies or nations are mandatory [62 ,63 ]. Finally, various types of staff are needed with a focus on areas of deficiency, e.g., pediatric, geriatric, etc. [64 ]. Multiagency collaboration and the use of voluntary staff place a special concern on clarification and coordination of roles, responsibilities, routines, and communication of the healthcare system in the emergency and disaster medical preparedness plan. The integration of crisis management, prehospital and hospital medical organization as well as educational initiatives on prehospital and trauma care in the disaster medical plan have proven to be insufficient in several countries. In addition, there might be shortcomings in cooperation and collaboration between internal and external authorities. A review of crisis and disaster medical preparedness plans and continuous simulation-based exercises should be mandatory to let all potential healthcare workers adjust to new situations, roles, and responsibilities [65 ].    4 Discussion While there has been an increasing global demand for the implementation of necessary measures to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the increasing number of DPHEs has proven to be a real obstacle to achieving these goals [25 ]. Although the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has proven to be a turning point in achieving SDGs due to all its consequences at the political, economic, and sociocultural levels [66 ], previous DPHEs have also illustrated the lack of partnership among diverse organizations and countries and the difficulties in living in peace and justice [8–11 ,17 ,44 ]. As such, the European Union (EU)’s efforts in Haiti showed that future humanitarian efforts require more than just motivation and financial support, and the most critical need turned out to be the ability to integrate different resources effectively through collaboration and organization-wide partnership [9 ]. In Norway, the evaluation of the events after the terrorist attacks in Oslo and Utøya in 2011, showed an insufficient integration and collaboration among involved emergency organizations [11].  As a consequence of this event, Norway, as the first country in the world, adjusted its preparedness legislation with the addition of the principle of “collaboration” to the previous three principles of “responsibility,” i.e., those responding to an incident in peacetime, have the responsibility to respond to similar incidents in crisis (professionality), the principle of “proximity,” i.e., the closest unit of the responsible organization acts first (local preparedness), and finally, the principle of “equality”, i.e., dealing with the situation as equally as in peacetime. The new principle of collaboration focuses on exercises and the need for evaluation models after exercises to assess the ability to collaborate and to maintain the sustainability of the link between all principles and organizations [10 ,11 ]. One of the most important prerequisites of SDGs, besides the efforts of the governments, is the awareness among populations regarding the definition and aims of SDGs and whether these goals converge with their national social interests. A recent study showed that people, in general, have insufficient or no knowledge and awareness regarding SDGs and their impacts on them and their national development [67 ]. It is therefore imperative to initiate information campaigns and educational initiatives to increase the knowledge of SDGs among the population and demonstrate how SDGs converge with national social demands. Such information and knowledge enable contextualizing the SDGs and facilitating the discussion on their implementation, in adherence to principles of the health promotion field [68 ]. Another crucial factor for the achievement of SDGs is the understanding of their complexity and interlinkage between various goals. In a recent study, the authors used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting of 400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17 SDGs and an additional variable (annual average temperatures), representing progress in the response to the climate crisis, among 181 countries to illustrate such a complexity [69 ]. From 2000 to 2019, they could illustrate differences among analyzed countries, emphasizing the need to adjust and define goals by local circumstances and priorities. In this study, global partnership (SDG 17 ) was reported to be a pivotal factor in global sustainability efforts, which have been strongly linked to economic growth (SDG 8 ). However, repositioning economic growth and trade expansion as a means instead of an end goal of development, education (SDG 4 ), and poverty reduction (SDG 1 ) became more central and prioritized in a global partnership. Urban livelihoods (SDG 11 ) were also flagged as important to avoid replicating unsustainable patterns of the past [69 ]. In another study, Anderson et al. showed that each of the SDGs and their corresponding targets may contribute as facilitators or inhibitors towards achieving other SDGs and targets, based on SDG indicator data. For instance, efforts towards SDGs 5  (Gender Equality) and 17  (Partnership for the Goals) may accelerate progress, while SDGs 10  (Reduced Inequalities) and 16  (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) are shown to create potential hurdles [70 ]. Analyzing the importance of SDGs 16  (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions] and 17  (Partnership) for the implementation of other SDGs, several studies have confirmed the importance of peace and the existence of justice, the role of law, and strong institutions. Taghavee et al. analyzing the relationships between MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and North American regions found a synergistic relationship, indicating that the involved countries should develop their relationships in a peaceful environment via regional agreements, unions, and openness [71 ]. The importance of democracy in the implementation of SDGs was emphasized through collected research data between 2015 and 2021, from 193 countries covering all the geographical areas. The study found two models of development. The Asian model of sustainable development was characterized by economic growth, and the Western democratic model was based on democratic institutions, fair justice, and mechanisms for preserving peace. The critical factor explaining the Western model was found to be the functioning of the governments and political participation, which also emphasize the importance of civic engagement and political accountability, i.e., democracy as a prerequisite for achieving an optimal level of the SDGs [72 ,73 ]. The lack of justice and a strong institutional structure to guarantee a democracy leads, among others, to the exploitation of natural resources, such as water and food, and causes conflicts. Access to water and food security are important predictors of conflict, while other resources, such as oil are relatively less important [74 ]. Besides a negative impact on peace, conflicts also influence all educational initiatives, including higher education, negatively [75 ,76 ]. A society in peace and justice with strong institutional influence and positive partnerships is necessary to secure decent work and economic development to cover the cost of developing and implementing preventive measures, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries [77 ]. It can also enhance the collaboration between government and industry, creating innovative opportunities, resilient infrastructure, sustainable cities, and communities, and responsible consumption and production (SDGs 8,9,11,12,13 ). These steps must be taken before providing solutions to no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, and reduction of global and local inequalities (SDGs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10 ). Achieving these goals offers a parallel opportunity to handle future issues such as the possibility of living below water and on the land according to the existing needs (SDGs 14,15 ) [78 ,79 ].  5 Limitations The main limitation of this study remains the thoroughness of the "Identify” and "Evaluate” steps in the rapid review process, which is largely influenced by the time available for the review and can lead to the exclusion of potentially relevant studies, thus influencing the overall quality of the review. Another limitation related to the rapid review process in general, and this study particularly, is the potential for bias in the selection of studies by a sole author, which may impact the completeness and generalizability of the findings. However, this study aimed to investigate the status of the topic. Hopefully, this study encourages and enhances future larger studies, including systematic reviews. Finally, the study could incorporate case studies or specific examples to illustrate how the lack of peace, justice, strong institutions, and partnership may impact the achievement of SDGs. However, several events demonstrating these facts are the results of political governance and democracy issues, which were clearly shown globally in the current Coronavirus-19 pandemic with diverse management approaches, public health attitudes, and policies. Since this was not the aim of this study, future studies should identify major contributions, which significantly may have shaped the discourse around SDGs.  6 Conclusions While there has been an increasing global demand for the implementation of necessary measures to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the increasing number of disaster and public health emergencies has proven to be a real obstacle to achieving these goals. Disasters and public health emergencies are inevitable events that hit diverse societies and result in human and material damage. The management of such incidents needs resources, capabilities, and collaboration among all involved stakeholders and in all disaster and emergency cycle phases. In addition, preventive measures should be implemented to avoid disasters and public health emergencies and create a peaceful environment, and justice, strengthening the role of law and strong institutional structures. These steps should be taken globally and call for peace, justice, and political stability. The current classification of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals does not reflect the complexity of achieving these interrelated goals. A new classification, described in this study, shows the importance of the so-called consequential factors in achieving the entire UN's goals. By focusing on goals 16, and 17, the global call for peace, justice, strong institutions, and global partnership, illustrates the need for stronger collaborative action from global authorities to facilitate national development for achieving global equality and development.
