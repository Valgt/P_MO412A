               Approximately one billion tons of food is wasted annually. Households account for 61% of this waste, followed by the food service industry with 26% and retail with 13%. In order to feed the world’s population, which currently numbers two billion, we will need to produce 60% more food by the year 2050. With food insecurity now affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide, reducing food waste is essential for developing low-impact, wholesome, and resilient food systems. Reducing food waste benefits people, the planet, and prosperity in a variety of ways. It increases food security, deals with the world’s issues of pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change, and eases the pressure on waste management systems. In order to inform national food waste prevention efforts and monitor progress toward the 2030 goals (halve food waste by 2030), the Food Waste Index invites countries to utilize its methodology to evaluate food waste at the household, food service, and retail levels. The Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO) offers a variety of consumer- or household-level suggestions for reducing food waste, including maintaining a balanced diet, only purchasing what is necessary, and storing food properly. In order to implement the focused intervention, it is crucial for countries to identify key commodities and the subsequent stages where substantial losses take place. By identifying these crucial loss spots and implementing the necessary remedies, food loss can be significantly reduced. In order for nations to create evidence-based, focused actions, data collection efforts are critically required.

Households account for 61% of this waste, followed by the food service industry with 26% and retail with 13%. In order to feed the world’s population, which currently numbers two billion, we will need to produce 60% more food by the year 2050. With food insecurity now affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide, reducing food waste is essential for developing low-impact, wholesome, and resilient food systems. Reducing food waste benefits people, the planet, and prosperity in a variety of ways. It increases food security, deals with the world’s issues of pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change, and eases the pressure on waste management systems. In order to inform national food waste prevention efforts and monitor progress toward the 2030 goals (halve food waste by 2030), the Food Waste Index invites countries to utilize its methodology to evaluate food waste at the household, food service, and retail levels. The Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO) offers a variety of consumer- or household-level suggestions for reducing food waste, including maintaining a balanced diet, only purchasing what is necessary, and storing food properly. In order to implement the focused intervention, it is crucial for countries to identify key commodities and the subsequent stages where substantial losses take place. By identifying these crucial loss spots and implementing the necessary remedies, food loss can be significantly reduced. In order for nations to create evidence-based, focused actions, data collection efforts are critically required.   Keywords Food insecurity  food waste  energy  food loss  data   3.1 Introduction  Food is one of the most important pillars of life and a source of survival in the world. Everything that exists in the world needs some kind of fuel to survive, in layman’s language, to do all for a living. This energy is present in food, but there is a law or principle for this energy transfer, which is the 10% rule, given by Lindemann in 1942. According to this rule, only 10% of energy is transferred from one tropic level to the next. But the point of concern is that 10% of energy is possible if everyone gets a sufficient amount of food for their living. If we look around, we find that a huge volume of food is dumped in dustbins on a daily basis, among which households contribute the most waste, followed by food services and retail (United Nation Environment Programme, 2021 ). According to the report, households generate around 931 million tons of food waste every year, among which, as earlier mentioned, households are the highest food waste contributors, contributing around 570 million tons of food waste every year. Per capita, around 74 kg (570,997.259059 kcal) of food is wasted every year. Before digging into the topic of food waste production and its management, let us first know what food waste is and how is it calculated? So, food waste is that part of the total volume of food that cannot be consumed or used to feed anyone. Food loss and food waste (FLW) are the two main factors that contribute to the total volume of food wastage given. Food loss is the amount or volume of raw food or crops that get damaged during the stage from their cultivation to storage. On the other hand, food waste is the amount or volume of food that is wasted either raw or cooked by consumers. These two factors give the overall figure for total food waste in the world in the respective year.  3.2 Status of worldwide food supply The total volume of food consumed by people in the whole world is equal to the amount of food loss. Many factors contribute to food loss during the crop production process in farms, including the environment, pests, water, and so on. When all these factors do not meet as expected by the crops, then the total production falls. Unexpected conditions during food storage can result in a reduction in total production and storage volume. Therefore, there is a significant reduction in the amount of food that reaches consumers. According to data, around 1/3 of all produced food is affected by food loss due to all these factors, which gives an average of around 1.3 billion tons of food every year (Gustavsson et al., 2011 ). After food reaches the consumers, the second factor, which is food waste, comes into place when people waste the food they want to eat and think it is excess for them to have. Of course, this kind of waste of food can be prevented so easily by making people understand to have only as much food as they can eat without wastage. The per capita supply from producer to the consumer for per day kcal of food, excluding food waste by a consumer, shows a significant change from 2010 to 2019, as shown in Fig. 3.1  , implying that the world has enough food to feed every individual but it is mostly wasted at the consumer’s end (Roser et al., 2013 ).  3.2.1 Food wastage status The data we had in the above paragraph shows that almost 931 million tons of food is wasted on average every year, and on the other hand, 720–811 million people are facing hunger on average every year. This means it is quite clear from the data that we have an adequate amount of food to feed the world’s population, but food wastage is the main culprit in making food inadequate to feed the entire world. Therefore, solely focusing on data on wastage does not give a proper solution to solve the food insecurity crisis. We need to focus on solutions to have a sufficient amount of food available and also to avoid any kind of harmful effect on the environment from this wastage of food.  3.2.2 Sustainable development goals As we are living on earth, the resources we are utilizing to live in the present are needed by our upcoming generations. For that, we need to use all present resources as precisely and correctly as possible so that it does not hamper the stored amount of resources. Sustainable development is a defined way of developing by which we develop the present without hampering and exploiting the resources and keeping them safe for future generations. Food is the most important resource we need to keep as good as possible so that it will be available for the upcoming generation. On the other hand, as food is organic having some inorganic compounds, it also has impacts on the world’s environment and climate. We do not know much about the negative impacts of food wastage and improper dumping of waste management, but we know that as foods are bio-degradable materials, their decomposition gives out many gases by the aerobic process of degradation. Food waste not only causes world hunger but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. All 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) are made to work on a principle to develop the world without hampering the world’s resources. Among all 17 SDGs, food waste is number 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. All these goals are focused on reducing food wastage from retailers to consumers and reducing food loss from the supply chain to prevent total volume of food from reaching crisis level. Additionally, by reducing wastage, we could provide as many people sufficient amounts of food as they need for their living (United Nation Department of Economic & Social Affairs, 2018 ). These SDGs aim to preserve or protect food from waste, as well as from the climate, in primarily two ways (United Nation Environment Programme, 2021 ): (a) The first way is to take the data from different sources to know about the estimate of food being wasted every year country-wise. Then from the data, an estimate needs to be made of which country and which income grade countries are causing what kind of food waste.  (b) The second way is the methodologies that can be used to track down the wastage of food and progress in its prevention to reach the SDGs by 2030.    Food waste management is as important as the need to conserve or protect food. Food is organic matter and its degradation needs many steps, it could be both an aerobic and an anaerobic process. It has been estimated that almost 28% of total world agricultural land is used to produce that amount of food, which gets wasted, and thus the degradation of food gives out nearly 3.3 billion tons of CO2  into the air per year (Paritosh et al., 2017 ). Traditionally, municipal food waste is incinerated, which has many negative consequences for both people and the environment (Agarwal et al., 2005 ).   3.3 Food waste generation worldwide Globally, on average, 700–900 million tons of food is wasted every year. As per the UNEP-Food Waste Index Report 2021, it has been stated that 931 million tons of food have been wasted in the trailing year 2020. For many years, the overall generation of food waste was not more than 800 million tons, but the sudden increase in the volume of food waste warns us about the rate of food wastage. In the graphic representation, percentage distribution of food wastage is shown in 3 main potential areas of food wastage generation. Among them, households produce the highest percentage of food wastage. 3.3.1 Food wastage versus COVID-19 In the years 2019–21, the world suffered the worst pandemic of the century. This caused many issues, including insufficient food availability. In December 2019, an unseen enemy took the stage of the world, which is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Wu et al., 2020 ). Its intensity of spreading from one individual to another is quite high, which leads to worldwide lockdowns. Now here comes another problem. As all the essential services get halted or take a slow pace, people start gathering food stocks depending on their wealth. Some who have good wealth accumulated a good quantity of food, but many who do not have good wealth and those who are getting food daily by their daily earnings did not get sufficient food. It is found that there is an uneven distribution of food stocks among people, which leads to increased food demands too. On the other hand, waste that is being produced by households shows that households are major contributors to food waste as all the commercial places were shut down. This type of great pandemic showed us the great efficiency of any uneven condition, which causes a huge shift in food loss, food security, and food waste (ReFED, 2020 ). As the time and other requirements of people and the environment are changing due to this, people started creating slight changes in their body requirements. Especially in their eating habits, people started developing a kind of craving for mind-comforting food and drinks. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food has provided complete and informative data indicating that people began stockpiling nonperishable foods at home; they began eating on a disrupted schedule in a day; their eating schedule changed; and, most importantly, they began consuming comforting foods such as alcoholic beverages, sweet foods, and so on (Aldaco et al., 2020 ). One such example of sudden change causing such drastic changes in people’s diets is any disease. Simultaneously, this sudden change in the eating pattern of such a large population leads to the generation of FLW both from the supply chain and consumer end. FLW are defined by FAO as major factors in making food sufficient to feed the population of the world. This food loss and food waste is termed FLW (Gustavsson et al., 2011 ). Food waste is generated at different supply chain levels, as mentioned in the below-given Table 3.1  . If waste is being generated, we must clear it as soon as possible to grow new crops and produce a new batch of food. So to do this, the rapid degradation or decomposition of food waste is needed in different ways, as shown in Fig. 3.2  . As foods are made up of organic matter only, the process of degradation of food (organic matter) is easy but still takes time. During degradation, the process gives or emits gases that have a greenhouse effect. That gas is CO2.  Let us learn about the process of food waste management.    3.4 Sustainable food waste management Food waste management is the basic way to rightly manage the food waste that is produced either during production, after production at the raw stage, or at the cooked stage. We can have the best method of sustainable food waste management because this food requires a living to consume. Studying the ways of sustainable food waste management mainly involves the ways by which we can avoid any kind of direct degradation or disintegration of the food. We try to use the food as long as we can. So food waste management first looks for what is the first classification of food waste as mentioned in Fig. 3.3  , that is, qualitative (meaning what category of food waste is perishable or nonperishable) and then quantitative (meaning how much the quantity of food in a specific category is there for management). Then waste management is done by many companies through different processes. So, let us look at the factors that are responsible for proper food waste management. Food waste management has a proper food waste hierarchy about how we can manage food waste to avoid less final wastage. Fig. 3.4   shows the hierarchy of food waste management from the most preferred way to the least preferred way. Let us discuss more about each process to save food from waste.   3.4.1 Reduce As food waste is increasing every year globally, the data shows that one-third of total global production directly goes to waste, which is around 1.3 billion tons of food every year (de los Mozos et al., 2020 ). A study done by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States found that most of the FLW, or food wastage, is done in high-income countries at a very late stage, irrespective of the fact that it can be eatable by the consumers. On the other hand, in underdeveloped countries, FLW takes place mostly at the supply chain end (de los Mozos et al., 2020 ). When this wastage comes to light, we become more aware of the wastage of food to reach the sustainable goals by 2030 and that the first step of sustainable food waste management is to reduce it. A very basic cycle, which is developed especially for sustainable development, is given in Fig. 3.5  . We basically try to use a variety of resources that do not impede or create a mess from leftovers. In the reducing technique, the surplus supply of food should not be done at different places, creating an uneven supply. We need to make food available for every individual in the world. There is a reduction in the process if the supply chain transfer of food at an uneven rate makes a proper distribution by the supply chain. This reduction in food waste is done by making less waste of leftover food. FLW’s main contributors are households, which contribute around 61% of FLW to all waste. We can reduce this food waste significantly by making ourselves understand the importance of food availability for ourselves and for the world too. Food waste generated by households in various income group countries demonstrates how we treat food and its importance. As per Table 3.2   (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021 ), high-income countries show somewhat less importance in reducing food waste, followed by upper-middle, lower-middle, and low-income countries. By using the data as per Table 3.2 , we can easily find a loophole to solve the issue of excess food waste generation. By finding a solution, we can reduce the volume of food waste that is generated every year, thus creating a loss in the final volume of food for people. As individual households are generating a great amount of food waste every year and by the number of countries that are generating the highest amount of food waste, we can find the solution to the reduction of food waste generation by making them aware of the food wastage and food shortage by showing them the data that is being collected by daily data research operations.  3.4.2 Redistribution Sometimes the food that reaches the retailers or customers is quite surplus to the amount of food required by the people present in the area, and thus, in that case, the excess amount of food is mostly wasted. This comes to light in the FAO report, in which it has been found that food wastage results in 3.3 Gt of global CO2  emissions, which is nearly 7% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions (Food & Agriculture Organization, 2013 ). The Water and Resources Action Programme in the UK  showed that if we redistribute the food if it is left, then it could lead to many positive factors as it avoids the generation of a high volume of food waste. As there is a reduction in food waste, the emission of CO2  also gets reduced by a significant amount. That is a reduction of 3.1 tons of CO2  (Parry et al., 2015 ). Simultaneously, the redistribution of food can also lead to the development of a good environment and economic development. By donating food as charity or for any cause, we can create a good social image and, by giving food, we can avoid world hunger. On the other hand, through redistribution, we get a good amount of economic development. By getting this money, we can develop the infrastructure and surrounding environment naturally and not put extra effort into conserving nature (Facchini et al., 2018 ). In other countries, this redistribution of surplus food benefits charity while also making food more affordable so that a daily wage earner can purchase it easily, thereby reducing food waste generation (Webster, 2014 ). The process involved in the redistribution is that when a supply chain makes food available at a place and then that food is found to be in a surplus amount, the supply chain again has to get involved in the process of redistribution of the food supplied from the place where food is available in a surplus amount to a place where that food is needed or in a different way to the person who needs that food. Therefore, the supply chain takes the path. This not only helps the food reach the right place but also makes sure everyone has it.  3.4.3 Animal feeding The most common and oldest way to contribute to food waste is by feeding it to animals. Farmers are already using this method to avoid food wastage. Whenever they get surplus food, they feed it to their animals and cattle. This method not only helps them to avoid any food wastage but also helps economically, as farmers need feed for their animals and this method of feeding them allows them to have a good source of all types of nutrients. In the second place, this method of food waste management helps them to avoid any kind of unwanted financial use other than their primary work. As for food wastage, they need to have a landfill, which costs different companies and also takes up a good area of space on their ground. Avoiding food wastage by feeding surplus food to animals helps to grow both environmentally and economically. The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has developed this hierarchy of food waste management and keeping the way to feed the food to animals comes from the earliest practice. Through research, it was found that feeding food waste as feedstock to animals came as an option in countries such as India, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and South America. This has come to be known as pig-feeding countries, and poultry-farming countries mostly follow this way (Dou et al., 2018 ). Landfills are a good option for food waste management, but due to the large volume of food waste disposed of, these landfills are slowly losing capacity. Feeding food waste to animals could solve the issue on a large scale, and this method of processing also helps animals (Kim et al., 2011; US Environmental Protection Agency, 2016 ). Food waste is the food itself and has a good source of nutrition in it, so feeding food waste to animals could help animals have a good source of nutrition in it. As these foods are leftovers, the biomolecules present in the food get accumulated as these leftovers and food waste mostly have edible parts, which are quite a rich source of nutrition for animals. Depending on the type of feed and animal, these food wastes are used as animal feed. In an experiment, it was tested what percentage of food waste we could add to animal meals to have a great effect on both animal growth and food waste management. It was observed that 10% to 100% of food waste as substitution is good for serving the animals as food in their diet. In more detail, it was found that different animals have different levels of nutritional requirements and, thus, they have a different range of food waste in their diet. In many experiments, some animals did not have any change due to the substitution of food waste in the diet (Chen et al., 2007; Kwak & Kang, 2006; Myer et al., 1999 ). In other experiments, it is reported that there is some decrease in weight gain in chickens (Chen et al., 2015 ) and pigs (Westendorf et al., 1998 ). It was also found that this method increases the meat quality and flavor due to different sources of nutrition.(a) Basically, by this method of food waste treatment, we can get many benefits at the same time, i.e.  (b) Economic growth by not wasting money on inefficient food waste management methods.  (c) Animal and livestock feeding of food waste solves the issue of food waste management and also provides sufficient nutrients to animals.  (d) Increased quality of livestock.  (e) Increased productivity of animals.  (f) Increased market value.    Feeding animals with food waste is one of the best ways of food waste management by giving many positive impacts in a wide field, and this process is also easy to implement.   3.4.4 Anaerobic digestion In the process of degradation of waste, whether it is solid or liquid, anaerobic digestion is mandatory to be in the list of ways of waste management. Microorganisms, which are responsible for the decomposition or final degradation of any organic compounds, are anaerobic in nature, which means they break down the substrate into its smaller components by the process of anaerobic digestion that takes place in the absence of air or oxygen (O2 ). Thus, the result of this reaction is lactic acid, along with the final biomolecule substrate and the two gaseous by-products it gives out: methane (CH4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) (Paritosh et al., 2017 ). The process of anaerobic digestion is also called biogas production because of the methane and carbon dioxide that are produced in the reaction. This is a great source of renewable energy, and the cost of production is so affordable that it can be easily built into households (Morita & Sasaki, 2012; Muhammad Nasir et al., 2012 ). Biogas production/anaerobic digestion has a series of steps or reactions as given in Fig. 3.6  . In the process of anaerobic digestion, there are four major steps, that is, fermentation, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis (Paritosh et al., 2017 ). Therefore, in the process of sustainable food waste management, the process of anaerobic digestion is the most conventional way that involves the function of microorganisms, which was unknown earlier. After research and findings, it was found that groups and strains of microorganisms are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion. Among all the microorganisms, methanogens are the most important microorganisms that actually make the process of anaerobic digestion an impactful and sustainable process for food waste management. Food waste is a source of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that act as a substrate for anaerobic reactions and give the product methane gas, which is an energy-carrying gas and can be used as a source of electricity. The steps involved in the process of anaerobic digestion are (Fig. 3.6 ): Substrate: Before moving to the reaction steps the first thing we need is a substrate that is food waste rich in carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The basic formula for carbohydrates is n (CH2 O). 3.4.4.1 Enzymatic hydrolysis It is a common hydrolysis reaction in which large molecules of carbohydrates, that is, polysaccharides broken down into smaller subunits such as oligosaccharides and monosaccharides. This breaking of carbohydrates mediates the transfer of carbohydrates through the cell membrane. Similarly, proteins break down in peptides and lipids break down into glycerol (Paritosh et al., 2017 ). This is the first step of the whole reaction.   3.4.4.2 Acidogenesis phase In the second step of anaerobic digestion, the hydrolyzed products act as substrates and are not converted into volatile fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and valerate along with carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and ammonia. During this process, the facultative anaerobic bacteria use oxygen and CO2 , which leads to creating an environment where oxygen is absent and makes the surroundings suitable for methanogens . In this step, the produced product of the reaction is used by different groups of bacteria to give organic acids.  3.4.4.3 Acetogenesis phase In this step bacteria belonging to acetogenic genera. Mainly involving two genera Syntrophomonas  and Syntrophobacter  helps in the conversion of acid phase products into acetates and hydrogen (Schink, 1997 )  3.4.4.4 Methanogenesis phase In this last phase of anaerobic digestion, methanogens take  part, which belong to the group of Archaea. In this process, methane is produced by with fermentation of acetic acid or by the reduction of hydrogen. Bacteria that are involved in different stages of anaerobic digestion are given in Table 3.3  . In all these steps of anaerobic digestion and methanogenesis, the final product that gets produced is methane, which is natural gas and can provide electricity. Anaerobic digestion for food waste management is one of the most renewable and sustainable processes available at a very low investment cost.   3.4.5 Composting Composting is the technique of using organic waste as a soil nutrition conditioner, which enhances the nutrition level of agricultural soil by adding organic waste, which is mostly food waste into the agricultural soil. Food loss and waste are organic substances that have many ingredients for a body’s needs. Therefore, this food waste is first decomposed bit by bit by decomposers, which are provided with food waste as their food source. Then, after some process of decomposition, it turns into compost or manure, which is then directly applied to the agricultural field where any recent or forthcoming crop cultivation is going to take place. Composting is one of the best methods because it keeps the food cycle without waste. The food that is being produced from the soil gets back to the soil to help it produce more nutritive crops by using less or nearly negligible amounts of chemicals as a soil enhancer. Composting is the most widely adopted method of food waste management in most developing countries. As these countries do not have a specific source all the time for every need, they use the process of sharing and creating a cycle of transfer of resources. At present, there are more than 70 facilities in India for composting, which use 5.9% of the food waste produced in the country and generate around 4.3 million tons of compost every year (Thi et al., 2015 , pp. 223–224). Composting is such a wonderful  process that benefits us on many levels, including economic benefits by reducing our reliance on chemical fertilizers for the good condition of soils; environmental benefits because we reduce our reliance on chemical fertilizers; soil and water do not get mixed with these chemicals, avoiding any types of contamination; improving soil conditions; and reducing negative environmental impacts because these manures are completely organic, avoiding an impact on the environment. Thus, we need the process of sustainable development to lead the resources to our future generations safely (Elmore, 2011 ). Development in the process of every day also leads to development in the process of composition. As per a study, two types of composting techniques have been classified (Al-Rumaihi et al., 2020 ). 3.4.5.1 Windrow composting inventory This method of composting starts with the process of collection of solid waste, that is, food waste, from different sources. This waste is then transported to the two segregation facilities to make a perfect recipe for the process. The perfect recipe for compost should contain moisture content (60%), with carbon and nitrogen present in a perfect ratio of 27:1. Additionally, the right proportion between the bulk density and free space, that is, the bulk density should be around 400–600 kg/m3  and free space of 50%–60%, and lastly, the particle size of the food waste used in the process should have 1/8–2 inches for this process of composting (Saer et al., 2013 ). After this process of segregation and collecting the specific size and recipe of the food waste, it undergoes windrow composting, where it gets covered for the first phase of composting for a certain time period of a few weeks. In the first phase of composting, intense composing takes place, and afterward, it moves to phase 2. In phase 2 composting, once again the waste gets covered for 2 weeks and then, after completing the process of phase 2, the waste undergoes phase 3 curing, where it is exposed to air and kept in an aerated condition for the next 2 weeks. After phase 3, the phase of curing keeps going before the manure gets separated into specific particle sizes. A quality test is being done before releasing the compost into the market to be sure about its levels of compliance, which needs to be met as per regulation to get the compost released into the market (Al-Rumaihi et al., 2020 ).  3.4.5.2 Anaerobic digestion with composting As the name suggests, it goes in the same way, starting from anaerobic digestion to the production of biogas, and the leftover stocks are converted to compost by a little addition of oxygen and air. Anaerobic digestion is the process of conversion of food waste or organic waste into its smaller constituents by giving out biogas, which can be used as a source of energy. Therefore, in the process of anaerobic digestion, composting improves each process by many folds because they contribute to each individual process in order to get the most efficiency from the substrate and extract as many useful products as possible. In the diagram in Fig. 3.7  , it is shown that first the collection of food waste is done,  and then the specifics of food waste being segregated are shown in Fig. 3.8  . Then these wastes are then given to an anaerobic digester where a huge number of beneficial anaerobic bacteria are present, which starts the process of anaerobic digestion step by step, which has already been discussed above in point 4 “Anaerobic digestion.” After the completion of anaerobic digestion, when biogas is produced, the leftover from the process, called digestate, undergoes the process of composting by the conventional method of composting (Finnveden et al., 2005 ). This method of composting is highly recommended for sustainable development as it is a multistep single process with multiple products with beneficial uses for humans. Landfills:  Landfills and dumps are the major methods of sustainable food waste management, which use around 90% of the total globally produced food waste in a year. Landfills are generally not beneficial to development because the disposal of food waste in landfills causes decomposition, but the process of decomposition can result in the emission of several gases, some of which can be used to convert energy (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2022 ). Several countries are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions by not following the proper way of segregating waste before dumping it (Adhikari et al., 2009 ). These landfills should be reduced in the coming years. Incineration:  In the process of sustainable food waste management, incineration is also a process to get rid of food waste or solid waste at a large volume. This is a process of burning waste at a very high temperature of around 870°C–100°C for a few seconds to convert it into ash. This method is the most effective way to reduce the demand for landfill space by simultaneously reducing the volume of waste. The process of incineration requires a well-set and designed infrastructure, with all the necessary equipment and requirements in place to keep the temperature high without damaging the environment and keep the process running effectively. This is a costly process, so most countries do not have the facility to avail themselves of this management system (Rand et al., 2000 ).    3.5 Management objectives for sustainability According to the United Nations Environment Programme, Food Waste Index Report 2021 (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021 ) has been focused on the sustainable management of food waste, which is being produced every year globally. It was found that nearly 931 million tons of food is wasted every year due to which 700–900 million people do not get a sufficient amount of food for their day-to-day lives. Sustainable food waste management goals are aimed at cutting food waste production in half by 2030. They created an entire SDG for food waste management and named it SDG 12.3, with the goal of reducing waste by 2030 and making food available to an increasing number of people.  3.6 Conclusion SDGs are critical goals for the current situation because we are depleting all resources such as water, fossil fuels, wood, food, and so on. All of the resources on Earth have limits, and our overuse and waste of them make us fools  in terms of understanding their importance. We need to keep in mind that all these resources could get finished, so we should keep these resources forward to our upcoming generation and also let them use these resources. Among all these resources, food is one of the main ones. Food is not actually a limited resource that will run out someday, rather it is being produced by farmers every year and they are also producing food at a good volume, but still not everyone in the world is getting enough food due to food wastage. So keep an eye on and monitor food waste. The United Nations Environment Programme stated the SDG 12.3 by which every country can measure food loss and food wastage. By which we can achieve the target of feeding a large number of the world’s hungry people in a year. 12.3 has the aim of halving the volume of food being wasted every year by 2030, and to achieve this, all countries need to work together.
