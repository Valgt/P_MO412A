                  In this work, the efficacy of additive manufacturing in revolutionizing the food industry is explored as a contributor to achieving the sustainable development goals (SDG) set out by the United Nations. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of 3D printing in the food industry by mapping it to the SDGs it can currently achieves. The study analyzes recent progress in additive manufacturing in various applications with emphasis on personalized nutrition, food waste utilization, and production of complex customized edible designs. This showcases the significant advantages the technology possesses compared to conventional routes of food production. In addition, limitations on the performance of the technology are discussed in order to reduce the gap between 3D printing and the market demand. Results confirmed that the technology had direct impact on SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 17 and it is on track to achieve greenhouse gas emissions mitigation of 130.5–525.5 Mt by 2025. Despite mentioned advantages, further work is required to increase the sustainability of 3DFP.

Table 1 Summary of literature review on the application of food waste utilization via extrusion.      Printed Construct Purpose Summary Points Ref   Cookie dough Establish the effect of grape pomace & milling wheat waste on printability A balance of high and low concentrations improves printability. [15]   Salmon skin gelatin gels (SGGs) Evaluate the printability of SGGs at different concentrations A balance of high and low concentrations improves printability. An inverse correlation exists between SGG concentration and extrudate hardness. [16]   Food packaging Establish the effect of printability on rice husk fractions of different size The milling method produces better flowability compared to the mixer ground method due to controlled heating effects that generates amorphous silica with more hydration capacity. Due to the challenge possessed by fibrous rich materials in printing, adding hydrocolloid decreases the viscosity and the binding capacity as well as the water absorptive power resulting in enhanced printability. [17]   Noodles Establish the effect of particle size of potato peel (PP) powder waste & addition of wheat flour on printability Finer fractions of the powder peel yield smooth material flow and a stable structure. An inverse correlation exists between swelling power of the product and the proportion of fine-PP indicating the importance of adding WF to the fine-PP. [18]   Food packaging Establish the effect of banana peel and sugarcane with 1% of guar gum on printability Due to the large particle size of SCB, the extrusion process is made difficult. The hydrocolloid decreases the hardness of the samples [19]   Jackfruit ink Establish the effect of adding hydrocolloid on printability Poor printability of the jackfruit seed is due to the high starch content present in the seeds. The author’s suggested the decrease of particle size which helps to influence printability. The addition of hydrocolloid with ink achieves modified viscoelasticity and high print resolution [20]   Durian husk ink Establish the effect of xanthan gum on printability Decreasing the particle size or adding hydrocolloids mainly xanthan gum as a rheological modifier positively affects the printability of the ink [21]      Table 2 Summary of literature review on the application of customized shape fabrication via extrusion process.      Printed Construct Purpose Summary Points Ref   Mashed potato Establish the effect of adding cricket and pea protein on shape The study concludes a non-linear trade-off between shape fidelity and complex modulus (G*). An inverse relationship exists between shape fidelity and printability with the increase of additive concentration. [22]   milk protein concentrate (MPC) Establish the effect of adding whey protein isolate (WPI) on shape & printability The difference in the type of protein used have different water binding capacity. The increase of WPI into MPC produced a paste with increased mobility and decreased apparent viscosity. The increase in WPI gradually increases the resistance to deformation and improves printability. [23]   soy protein isolate Establish the effect of adding sodium alginate and different concentrations of gelatin on shape retention Incorporating gelatin into the material experienced high hardness and resilience, heat flow peak, lowered melting temperature. A positive effect of the samples was established in terms of printing behaviour and appearance as well as higher hardness when adding gelatin to the mixture at 35 °C. [24]   potato puree Establish the effect of adding agar, alginate, lecithin, and glycerol on shape & printability The hydrocolloid alginate increases the tensile strength and hardness of the material making it difficult to push out of the extruder. The gelling nature of the additive provides high yield stress and thixotropy values. [25]   Egg yolk and Egg white Establish the effect of the addition of rice flour on shape The difference in solid, fat, protein content as well as the type of protein present in each sample act as important factors when determining the pasting values, hardness, cohesiveness, resilience, and printability. The addition of polysaccharides (starch) results in a stable structure with easiness of flow for EY and thus better printability. [13]   mango and starch-arabinoxylans blend Study the viscoelasticity and self-recovering behaviour of the blend A high starch content blend tends to have higher gel strength (G’-G” value) which increases printability with stable structure prints as well as improves thixotropic index [26]   cookie dough Establish the effect of the cookie dough without addition of gums on shape Incorporating a reduced sugar and milk content into the sample allows an improved flowability and a stable structure. The rheological properties depend on the physiochemical properties of flour where different types of flour produce different internal networks due to differences in protein type and content. [27]   Mushroom Establish the effect of the addition of wheat flour on shape & printability The addition of WF enhances the printability of Mushroom powder (MP) due to the synergistic effect between the wheat protein and the polyunsaturated fatty acids and fibre fractions of MP [28]   Chicken nuggets Establish effect of adding refined wheat flour (RWF) to ground chicken (GC) meat on printability An increase of RWF to GC increases the viscosity and improves consistency, which is favourable to achieve enhanced printability [29]      Table 3 Summary of literature review on the application of Personalized Nutrition.      Printed Construct Purpose Summary Points Ref   Fruit based snacks Establish effect of print speed and flow levels on printability There exists a direct relationship between print speed and height change where an increase of print speed that is not significantly high (maximum) produces a sufficient growth rate in height. In addition, the flow level parameter plays a major role in altering the weight of the sample where an increase of flow level to a maximum produces a maximum increase of weight with limited porosity and therefore exhibits a stable structure. [30]   Vegetables Establish effect of the addition of hydrocolloid to meet needs of dysphagia patients Garden peas produce a thickening like consistency with high viscosity and yield stress and therefore renders them printable with good mechanical strength. The difference of starch and water content present in each vegetable affects the amount of HC added and therefore provides an overview of the taste, texture, and aroma of the printed structure. [31]   Pork paste Establish effect of the addition of xantham and guar gum on printability The addition of HCs to the cooked pork paste experienced no significant changes in the apparent viscosity of the samples indicating a good extrusion viscosity suitable for printing through the nozzle. The HC influences the textural properties where it reduces the hardness of the samples after post-processing providing a state of chewiness and easiness of swallowing for dysphagia patients. [32]   Food paste Evaluate the printability of paste containing starch, skimmed milk powder, oat protein, faba bean protein, rye bran, and semi-skimmed milk powder on printability The content of fat and carbohydrate present in milk powder when used as ingredient acts as an important factor to facilitate the flow of the material through the syringe tip where a higher fat content produces a greater easiness of flow. Similarly, the starch content plays a major role in allowing the food ink to exhibit shear thinning behavior in flow. The addition of protein alters the rheological property of food formulation where differences in composition, size, and shape of particles act as important factors. [33]   Potato puree Establish effect of the addition of different concentrations of soy protein isolate and agar to meet needs of dysphagia patients The rheological properties of the starch-based puree exhibit an improvement upon the addition of agar at low concentrations. The mechanical strength exhibits improvement with the addition of agar due to its characterization of strong hydrogen bonding interactions and generation of hydrophobic aggregates. The addition of soy protein was characterized with strong modifications in the texture and nutritional value of formulations [34]   Banana matrix Establish effect of different concentrations of pea protein isolate with banana paste on printability The G’ value (storage modulus) was at a higher level than G’’(loss modulus) for all formulations combining pea protein to banana matrix. Increasing the concentration of protein-based ingredients to a food matrix improves the printability, reduces the tailing effect, and maintains shape retention after printing [35]   rice starch (Qingtuan) Establish effect of the addition of different concentrations of soluble soybean polysaccharide on printability targeting dysphagia patients A positive correlation exists between the 2 variables of viscosity and SSPS where viscosity gradually increases upon the increase addition of SSPS. The addition of SSPS had no significant impact on color and did not alter the taste of the substance, deeming it suitable for dysphagia patients.

The calculation in productivity in tandem with its ability to produce more commodities in order to meet the growing demands of consumers has led to the unsustainability of the food industry. Accounting for over 26% of the global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), the food supply remains a measure of high carbon footprint which occurs mainly during the production process where large amounts of energy resources are consumed [1] . Moreover, studies report that food waste or loss is a common challenge reaching levels of one third of the total food production due to lack of progress in tackling the inefficiencies of handling storage and the limited infrastructure for food processing [2] . In addition to harmful environmental impacts, the cells of the human body have experienced many different challenges from this industry such as chronic illnesses caused by the excessive influence of chemical fertilizers, preservatives, and genetic modification induced in various food products. The profound effect of unsafe food can be observed in all ages of the spectrum from the infants to the elderly where risks such as illnesses affect one in ten people globally as well as a burden of 420,000 premature deaths is exposed annually [3] . The deterioration of health has allowed a shift in consumer behaviour into a healthier diet focused on nutritious valued food products. An example of this can be observed in the population of Latvia where currently the consumption of meat, bread, alcohol, and tobacco on average was greatly reduced compared to 10 years ago [4] . As a result, such food related challenges and trends have become the top priority of many organizations and governments across the globe. Through its numerous applications, 3D food printing (3DFP) offers a viable alternative solution to the methods of food production creating a renewable and efficient future of food all while providing a new and exciting food experience from this patented technology. This additive manufacturing (AM) technique allows for the fabrication of 3D printed food products using a computer aided design (CAD) model-based printer that simulates a layer-by-layer deposition process [5] . Despite its lack of maturity in the commercialization stage, the equipment can be found applied successfully in different fields of market settings such as in medical [6] , aerospace [7] , automotives [8] , construction [9] , and food applications [10] . The current progress of 3DFP focuses on its capability to revolutionize the food industry through its various applications. 3DFP provides a broad array of personalized nutritious commodities where an adjusted density, structure, and composition of such products falls in parallel with the health needs of individuals from all backgrounds. Recent research on this application has focused on the designed flexible performance of the technology that helps to supply meals that contain healthy ingredients and acquire soft pureed textures for the elderly that suffer from illnesses challenging their swallowing and chewing activities. In addition, there exists progress of this application targeting children by preparing and presenting nutritious snacks in fun and innovative shapes that helps to increase their willingness for consumption [11] . A major contribution for the technology stems from the promise of sustainability that it can expose to the system through its current movement in generating different goods and packaging from the valorisation of food waste accumulated from different industries. This application coincides with the recent upsurge in policies targeting such issues and concurrently contributes to the reduction of carbon footprint [12] . Furthermore, present studies were able to yield intricate and stable shapes and designs successfully with 3DFP by combining various macro and micronutrients in order to meet the consumer’s targeted customized dimensions while being able to control its nutritional value [13] . Despite these beneficial applications, further research is required to overcome the technological challenges that make the full launch towards the market slower. Studies reveal the technology has limited technical characteristics such as slow print speed that decreases the demand and adoption into the food industry. In addition, the process lacks consumer acceptance and knowledge, suffers from hygiene and safety problems, acquires short shelf life, and requires high costs financially. Moreover, limited regulations remain processed on this technology on both a national and industrial level. The profound significance of 3DFP can be witnessed through the testimony of ongoing and numerous research published as primary and secondary sources as demonstrated in Fig. 1  . It can be observed that the field of 3D printing established high characterization in the visualization map during the years 2018–2022 with strong correlations to subject matters in sustainability, personalized nutrition, rheological properties, food, and customized food fabrication. Despite the strong correlation with sustainability as shown in Fig. 1 , efforts being made in determining the contribution of 3DFP in achieving the “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDG) established by the United Nations (UN) remains in its infancy. The importance of SDG lies in its ability to prompt the sustainability values for all countries under three pillars, namely (i) prosperity, (ii) people, and (iii) the planet [14] . The technology possesses strong sustainability impact through its ability to achieve some of the 17 goals. The ability of 3DFP to provide personalized nutrition schemes, customized shape fabrication, and food waste utilization allows it to achieve some of the 17 SDGs. For example, personalized nutrition can be provided with textural modifications accustomed to the needs of dysphagia patients who normally suffer from swallowing challenges, facilitates in prompting the utilization of 3D printers in hospitals which in turn increases the health benefits of people and thus achieve its role in satisfying SDG3 successfully as can be seen in Fig. 2  . The objective of this study aims to evaluate the current prospect status of 3DFP under different applications including food waste utilization, personalized nutrition, and customized shape fabrication which lays the framework for the investigation of 3DFP in achieving SDG goals. The total number of the SDG’s it can achieve was determined which helps highlight the importance of this technology and its sustainable impact in revolutionizing the food industry. Moreover, the findings of this study will help underline the future image of the food industry by understanding the current limitations and challenges it faces today as well as the sustainable contribution it makes to the population at hand and the subsequent generations of people to arise, following the algorithm shown in Fig. 3  .  2 Methodology An integrative review was conducted in this study using the database Google Scholar . Under this database, the keywords used was broad targeting case studies related to the applications used in the research. An extensive number of secondary sources appeared in the search where a scope of 23 journal articles were selected excluding references from other sources such as books. The publication period used was specific to recent journal articles published in the last 5 years which falls under the range 2018–2022 excluding early publications in the year 2023 and articles which have yet to be published. Due to the nascent field of the topic 3D printing in the food industry, this time frame was deemed pertinent. This Integrative review uncovering the outcomes associated with the recent progress of 3DFP acted as a foundation for the analysis used to determine the research question which is whether the 3DFP was able to achieve the SDGs.  3 Application of food waste utilization for 3D printing A major relevance of 3DFP involves the reuse of food waste streams accumulated from industries as raw materials for formulations to produce a variety of food products. This allows the alignment with the increasing demand of wide range of products and therefore advocate in reducing world hunger. Some of these food waste includes products that is rich in prebiotics and dietary fibres which are known for their health benefits among consumers [12] . In addition, some of these streams such as plant-based wastes facilitate in reducing environmental challenges and animal cruelty associated with producing meat generated from conventional food processing methods. This promising application coincides with the enhancement of sustainability in food supply chains through decreasing the depletion of resources and the emissions associated with food waste. Despite the regulation of emissions and effectiveness in handling waste, 3DFP under the application of food waste utilization is limited in achieving a positive ideology from consumers. The current research utilizes different food waste to produce a variety of food products and packages. According to previous studies, an important factor that affects the compatibility of the extrusion process in 3DFP and the structural resistance from deformation is the rheology of the material supply. This can be observed in Jagadiswaran et al. [15]  study where the extrusion-based 3D printing of broken wheat from the milling industries as an innovative and sustainable way of providing flour for cookie dough was investigated. It was noted that grape pomace plays a major role in dough rheology where an increase of grape pomace percentage in formulations constitute higher shear thinning behavior and therefore limits the printability of the product due to the increase in consistency and viscosity. However, the composition of 6% grape pomace indicated a lower print speed and extrusion rate resulting in improved printability. This suggests that a balance between low and high concentration improves printability. Similarly, the rheology of the material was studied by Mena et al. [16]  through their examination on 3D printing of different concentrations of salmon skin gelatin gels (SGG) which is the byproduct of the salmon industry. It was shown that the outcome of the analysis fitted a stable printed model under extrusion-based printing using 8% concentration of the gel due to its ability to support the weight of the layers and maintain good shape retention. This falls in line with the results of [15]  where a balance between low and high concentration improves printability. It is noted that an inverse correlation exists between SGG concentration and extrudate hardness. Earlier studies had revealed the importance of the milling method and particle size on the food ink to promote enhanced printability. The effect of printability on rice husk fractions of different size with and without the addition of guar gum (GG) was investigated by Nida et al. [17] . The main idea of the study suggests that the method of milling plays a major role in the difference of printability where the milling method produces better flowability through the nozzle compared to mixer ground method due to the controlled heating effects that generates amorphous silica with more hydration capacity. Due to the challenge possessed by fibrous rich materials in printing, adding hydrocolloid decreases the viscosity and the binding capacity as well as the water absorptive power resulting in enhanced printability. The effect of particle size on printability can be observed in Muthurajan et al. [18]  study where a vegetable was used in combination with wheat flour (WF) to prepare and print nutrient rich noodles under extrusion-based printing technique. The main idea of the study suggests the influence of particle size on printability where a finer fraction of the powder peel yields smooth material flow and a stable structure. Although the addition of WF into fine-PP improved printability, a higher extrusion pressure is required for the mixture. It was noted an inverse correlation between swelling power of the product and the proportion of fine-PP indicating the importance of adding WF to the fine-PP. In addition, the finer-PP exhibit breaking after experiencing post-processing due to the absence of gluten in the wheat flour. Apart from converting waste into food products, several studies have utilized agricultural waste for food packaging applications where non-biodegradable products are formed that require less time and energy which in turn saves the environment from the detrimental effects of using commercial food packaging. Nida et al. [19]  evaluated the utilization of banana peel (BP) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB) with 1% guar gum (GG) for printing novel food packages. Consistent with the results of [17] , the addition of the hydrocolloid decreased the hardness of the samples due to the complex network formed between the polysaccharide of GG and the fibers of BP and SCB. Due to the large particle size of SCB, the extrusion process is made difficult indicating the importance of particle size on the influence of printability, which falls in line with the results of [18] . The addition of hydrocolloids in food inks have received great attention in research due to its ability to maintain the mechanical integrity of printed structures. Wong et al. [20]  investigated the cooking techniques of the jackfruit to produce food ink suitable for extrusion-based 3D printing. The main idea of the study suggests that the poor printability of the jackfruit seed is due to the high starch content present in the seeds. The author’s suggested the decrease of particle size which helps to influence printability which is similar to the results of [19]  and [18] . In addition, it was noted that the addition of hydrocolloid with pulverized jackfruit ink achieves modified viscoelasticity and high print resolution in comparison to conventional methods such as an oven or heat for dehydration which is consistent with the results of [17]  and [19] . Similarly, Tan et al. [21]  paved the way for sustainability from the 3D printing of durian husk ink which is commonly discarded as waste. It was shown through the analysis that by decreasing the particle size or adding hydrocolloids mainly xanthan gum as a rheological modifier positively affects the printability of the ink. This is consistent with the results of [20] . It can be concluded that it is preferable amongst researchers to acquire a somewhat mid-level range between low and high concentration in order to possess a viscosity characterized with an ease of flow through the nozzle without experiencing any clogging and maintaining the structural integrity of the final product. In addition, the introduction of hydrocolloids has a profound impact on materials that are known for their hardness during printing which results in improved printing. Moreover, decreasing the particle size of the food ink in powdered form promotes enhanced printability. Table 1   lists the literature findings of food waste utilization via extrusion processes.  4 Application of customized shape fabrication for 3D printing Another pertinence of 3DFP is associated with its capability to produce a variety of customized food shapes which helps to create a fun and innovative way to consume nutritious food products. Current research focuses on the addition of hydrocolloids, gelatin, and protein-based ingredients to help with the mechanical strength and shape fidelity of products after the printing process. Earlier studies had revealed the importance of adding protein-based additives on the food ink’s shape fidelity and printability. Scheele et al. [22]  investigated the effect of mashed potato under 3D printing through its addition with cricket and pea protein by varying the protein concentration and water to protein ratio prior to mixing with 100 g of mashed potato. It was shown that the water to protein ratio added to the food base material differs between the cricket and pea protein due to the difference in molecular nature and nutritional profile. The main idea of the study concludes a non-linear trade-off between shape fidelity and complex modulus (G*). Incorporating this rich protein-based additive into the material was found to achieve high fidelity prints at complex modulus values in the range of 15 to 25 Pa. It is noted that a decreasing trend in shape fidelity and printability as the concentration of additives increases, which seems to emphasize an existing indirect relationship between the two parameters. However, this opportunity leveraged by the 3DFP technology had considered only a small number of participants for evaluating the fidelity which could limit the precision of such ratings. A similar approach was reported by Liu et al. [23]  however using milk protein concentrate (MPC) where the applicability and printability of this additive when combined with whey protein isolate (WPI) upon extrusion-based 3D printing was investigated. Consistent with the results of [22] , it was shown that the difference in the type of protein used have different water binding capacity. It was shown that the increase of WPI into the MPC produced a paste with increased mobility and decreased apparent viscosity. In addition, the increase in WPI gradually increases the resistance to deformation and improves printability which was quite different than the results of [22]  where a decreasing trend of these parameters was observed. This may be due to the difference in properties between the starch based mashed potato in [22]  and the MPC. According to previous studies, an important factor that affects the compatibility of the extrusion process in 3DFP and the printability is the addition of gelatin as raw ingredient into the food material. A study evaluating the rheological properties of 3D printing for soy protein isolate (SPI) when combined with sodium alginate and different concentrations of gelatin was conducted by Chen et al. [24] . It was shown that 6% and 10% addition of gelatin to SPI exhibited good results in terms of fluidity as well as higher and lower values for tan σ and viscosity, respectively under temperature condition of 35 °C. In addition, incorporating gelatin into the material experienced high hardness and resilience, heat flow peak, lowered melting temperature. The main idea represents a positive effect of the samples in terms of printing behaviour and appearance as well as higher hardness when adding gelatin to the mixture at 35 °C. Similarly, the effect of gelatin on printability was investigated by Dankar et al. [25]  where the printability, internal strength, mechanical property, microstructure, and colour of potato puree when added to agar, alginate, lecithin, and glycerol during extrusion-based 3D printing was studied. Consistent with the results of [24] , the addition of the hydrocolloid alginate increases the tensile strength and hardness of the material making it difficult to push it out of the extruder. Similar to [24] , the gelling nature of the additive provides high yield stress and thixotropy values. Moreover, another important factor that affects the compatibility of the extrusion process in 3DFP and the printability is the addition of starch as raw ingredient into the food material. A study conducted by Anukiruthika et al. [13]  evaluated the printability of egg yolk (EY) and egg white (EW) powder using extrusion-based 3D CARK printer. It was shown that the addition of starch to the food material supply (EY and EW) enabled a strong and smooth characteristic in terms of mechanical strength and flowability, respectively that is suitable for printing. The main idea of the study lies in the comparison between EY and EW where the difference in solid, fat, protein content as well as the type of protein present in each sample act as important factors when determining the pasting values, hardness, cohesiveness, resilience, and printability. Due to the dense network of lipoprotein fractions, lower protein content, higher fat content, and higher solid content in EY compared to EW, the addition of polysaccharides (starch) results in a stable structure with easiness of flow for EY and thus better printability. Similarly, the effect of starch was investigated through Montoya et al. [26]  where the viscoelasticity and self-recovering behaviour of different starch mango and starch-arabinoxylans blend that undergoes extrusion-based 3D printing was studied. The main idea suggests that a high starch content blend tends to have higher gel strength (G′-G″ value) which increases printability with stable structure prints and improves thixotropic index. This is consistent with the results of [13] . A study investigating the extrusion printing of different formulated samples of cookie dough without the addition of gums or stabilizers using SOLIDWORKS software was conducted by Pulatsu et al. [27] . Incorporating a reduced sugar and milk content into the sample allows an improved flowability and a stable structure that is resistant to deformation. It is noted that the rheological properties depend on the physiochemical properties of flour where different types of flour produce different internal networks due to differences in protein type and content. It was shown that higher and lower values of a ′ and a ′′ as well as b ′ and b ′′, respectively constitutes favourable printing and post processing capacity. Wheat flour (WF) is a common additive used amongst researchers to change the effect of printability and stability of the structure. Keerthana et al. [28]  evaluated the printing of mushroom powder (MP) through the addition of wheat flour (WF) using CARK printer. The main idea of the study states that the addition of WF enhanced the printability of MP due to the synergistic effect between the wheat protein and the polyunsaturated fatty acids and fibre fractions of MP. Similarly, the effect of adding refined wheat flour (RWF) was explored further in Wilson et al. [29]  where the effect of RWF to ground chicken meat (GC) when undergoing extrusion-based 3D printing in order to develop customized chicken nugget shapes was investigated. The results indicate that an increase of RWF to GC increases the viscosity and improves consistency, which is favourable to achieve enhanced printability, which falls in agreement with [28] . It can be concluded that a high starch content in the food material enhances printability with an increase of mechanical strength and thus produces a stable structured construct. There seems to exist consistency in the results when adding sodium alginate to different food material where an increase of the hydrocolloid increases the tensile strength and hardness of the formulation allowing for difficulty of extrusion through the extruder. In addition, a gelling substance, whether agar or gelatin is used to increase the yield stress and thixotropy of the food product. Previous studies also emphasize that the type of protein plays a major role in its water binding capacity. Moreover, there exists difference in results when adding protein to different food material which may be due to the difference in properties for the type of protein used as well as its interaction with different formulations and therefore there exists a lack of correlation between the two parameters. Table 2   summarizes the literature reviews of customized shape fabrication.  5 Application of personalized nutrition for 3D printing The effectiveness of 3DFP in supplying food products high in nutritional value helps to promote health benefits especially to consumers that may suffer from certain diseases such as the case of dysphagia patients. This helps to prompt the promotion of 3DFP to tap into new markets and improve international cooperation. Current research focuses on creating products rich in healthy nutrients to help meet the nutritional value of children and dysphagia patients. In addition, research utilizes different ingredients such as hydrocolloids to help improve the printing of the formulations while maintain good mechanical strength post printing. However, this holds a challenge to consumers due to the furry/non-natural taste associated with hydrocolloids thereby limiting the utilization of the 3D printing technology. The effect of print speed and flow levels on 3D printing of fruit-based snacks with formulation designed to contain 5–10% energy, calcium, iron, and vitamin D in order to meet the nutritional value of children that fall under the age group of 3–10 years old was investigated by Derossi et al. [30] . It was shown that the samples experienced a growth rate in height by adjusting the print speed at a range of 30 and 50 mm/s. Meanwhile, an increase in flow level to a maximum value of 130% and change in print speed to 70 mm/s yields a maximum growth rate of weight holding value of 0.00362 g/s. It is noted that there exists a direct relationship between print speed and height change where an increase of print speed that is not significantly high (maximum) produces a sufficient growth rate in height. In addition, the flow level parameter plays a major role in altering the weight of the sample where an increase of flow level to a maximum produces a maximum increase of weight with limited porosity and therefore exhibits a stable increase in dimension and total volume. The study lacked to obtain a correlation between printing conditions and food formula which would facilitate a better understanding of the rheological properties of food formula. Apart from yielding good mechanical strength when producing customized shapes, the addition of hydrocolloid influences the viscosity required for printing and the taste of the printed product when meeting the nutritional needs of customers. A study evaluating the effect of 3D printing 3 vegetables namely garden pea, carrot and bok choy with the addition of different hydrocolloids (HC) for the purpose of meeting dysphagia patients’ perception of aroma, taste, and texture was conducted by Pant et al. [31] . It was shown that amongst the vegetables garden peas produces a thickening like consistency with high viscosity and yield stress and therefore renders them printable with good mechanical strength. It is noted that the difference of starch and water content present in each vegetable affects the amount of HC added and therefore provides an overview of the taste, texture, and aroma of the printed structure. This is important in meeting consumer perception for minimal amount of HC due to the furry/non-natural taste associated with it and therefore facilitate in the consumption of the 3D printed food. The effect of hydrocolloids on the viscosity can be observed in Dick et al. [32]  study where the extrusion-based 3D printing using the addition of xanthan and guar gum with pork paste was investigated. Consistent with the results of [31] , the addition of HCs to the cooked pork paste experienced no significant changes in the apparent viscosity of the samples indicating a good extrusion viscosity suitable for printing through the nozzle. Moreover, the HC influences the textural properties where it reduces the hardness of the samples after post-processing providing a state of chewiness and easiness of swallowing for dysphagia patient. A study investigating the extrusion-based 3D printing of food pastes holding constituents rich in protein, starch, and fibers in order to develop healthy foods rich in fibers and proteins as well as low in fat or sugars was conducted by Lille et al. [33] . It was shown that a food paste containing starch, skimmed milk powder, oat protein, faba bean protein, rye bran, and semi-skimmed milk powder with concentration values of 10%, 15%, 60%, 30%, 35%, 45%, respectively yielded an effective printability outcome with stability in the structure. The content of fat and carbohydrate present in milk powder when used as an ingredient acts as an important factor to facilitate the flow of the material through the syringe tip where a higher fat content produces a greater easiness of flow. Similarly, the starch content plays a major role in allowing the food ink to exhibit shear thinning behavior in flow. It is noted that the addition of protein alters the rheological property of food formulation where differences in composition, size, and shape of particles act as important factors. Similar to the results found in food waste applications, the addition of protein-based additives has a major role in the food ink’s shape retention and printability when meeting the nutritional value of customers. Mirazimi et al. [34]  evaluated the rheological and textural measurements of potato puree formulation reserved towards dysphagia patients upon the addition of soy protein and agar. It was shown that the rheological properties of the starch-based puree exhibit an improvement upon the addition of agar at low concentrations. In addition, the mechanical strength exhibits improvement with the addition of agar due to its characterization of strong hydrogen bonding interactions and generation of hydrophobic aggregates. The addition of soy protein was characterized with strong modifications in the texture and nutritional value of formulations. It is noted that the effect of sieving plays a major role in agar’s effect on mechanical properties where a decrease in physiochemical properties is exhibited from the utilization of sieving agar sample. Similarly, the effect of protein-based additives on shape and printability can be observed in Kim et al. [35]  study where the effect of different concentrations of pea protein isolate (PPI) on banana paste was investigated. Similar to [34] , the G’ value representing the storage modulus was at a higher level than G’’ which represents the loss modulus for all formulations combining pea protein to banana matrix. This is agreed upon by some researchers such as the case of [34]  where due to higher values of G’ compared to G’’ the structure exhibits proper shape retention as a result of the friction that occurs in the internal structure between the protein and banana mix. Consistent with the results of [34] , increasing the concentration of protein-based ingredients to a food matrix improves the printability, reduces the tailing effect, and maintains shape retention after printing. However, this is not achieved at an extremely high concentration suggesting the limit of increase. A study determining the feasibility of 3D printing glutinous rice starch (Qingtuan) when adding different concentrations of soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) targeted towards dysphagia patients was conducted by Kong et al. [36] . It is noted that a positive correlation exists between the 2 variables of viscosity and SSPS where viscosity gradually increases upon the addition of SSPS. This is due to the interactions between the 2 variables that result in reduction of water absorption of starch present in Qingtuan. However, a significant increase in SSPS leads to hardness of the material and thus 0.9% was found the best in terms of achieving extrusion printing and reducing hardness of the substance. In addition, the addition of SSPS had no significant impact on color and does not alter the taste of the substance, deeming it suitable for dysphagia patients. Based on the aforementioned literature review, it is clear that extrusion-based printing is the most commonly used technique in the food industry. The efficacy of adding protein to a formulation results in better shape retention where the G’ (storage modulus) is higher than the G’’ (loss modulus) value due to the strong interactions that occur in the internal structure of the mix. Although a negative consumer perception is associated with the addition of HC to foods, it helps to increase the viscosity and yield stress as well as provide textural modifications where hardness is reduced making it easier for dysphagia patients consumption. Table 3   summarizes the findings for personalized nutrition.  6 Limitations for 3D printing in the food industry With all reported Several benefits of the incorporation of additive manufacturing and 3D printing in various aspects of the food industry, there exist several roadblocks that require resolution. From technical limitations to issues rasing social and legal concerns, 3D printing have a long way to go in order to become an effective contender in the food market. The following sections offer a detailed insight on this. 6.1 Technical limitations Printing speed is a parameter of 3D printing technology acquires a slow response rate which could negatively affects the possibility of generating mass production. As a result, the situation will decrease the demand for this technology and hence slow the process of the launch into the market. Due to the requirement of post processing technique post-printing production, certain foods experience a shift in rheological, physiochemical, and textural properties which ultimately degrades the quality of the final product. An example of this can be witnessed in the printing of dough which experiences shape degradation when subjected to baking at high temperatures [37] . Another challenge involves the different printing performance generated from different raw materials where each possess a different rheological property and requires different printing conditions. As a result, more research is necessary to determine a link between the rheological properties of the materials and printing parameters on the efficiency of the system in order to achieve faster printed products [38] . Moreover, there exists the issue associated with limited textural varieties of the printed food products which is necessary to meet the specific needs of people that require the constructs to fit with their standards. Similarly, the situation will decrease the demand and prevent the launch of the machine into certain venues such as hospitals due to its inability to adhere to certain specifications [39] . These factors are summarized in Fig. 4  .  6.2 Social & environmental limitations The current software present in the technology lacks the consideration of an individual personalized nutritional needs including parameters such as age, occupation, and activity level of an individual. As a result, the situation will decrease the consumer’s acceptance of the machine due to not meeting their nutritional profile and therefore decrease the demand into the market [38] . Due to the lack of awareness and knowledge on the technology and its operations from consumers, the printed food utilized to meet their needs faces difficulty in acceptance. This case can be witnessed in printing of novel foods contained in the meal that may be culturally inappropriate and too arduous for people to try [38] . There exists the possibility of bacteria build-up originating from the machine’s parts or small cracks during the printing process. In addition, there is the susceptibility of bacteria and fungus accumulation due to the heating and cooling activity that takes place during post-processing. Consequently, this situation will prompt negative ideologies from consumers regarding the consumption of food products from the utilization of 3D printing.  6.3 Economic & financial A major challenge faced economically includes the cost per printed part associated with skilled labour that is required for the pre-treatment and post-processing procedures during the operation of 3D printing. During the increase of demand of the technology into the market, the cost of machines’ materials decreases however the labour cost will persist. There exists the challenge associated with the short shelf life of food products which is mainly due to the temperature fluctuations that occur during the extrusion process. The situation allows the development of microbial growth, bacteria, or fungus in the food products. An example of this case can be witnessed with dough production where the stability and rheological behaviour of the construct will exhibit deformations after 1–2 h post fabrication [40] . This will lead to waste production which is linked to cost as well as a loss of trust between the end-user and the venues which therefore results in loss of profitability from its perspective.  6.4 Regulatory & policy The present regulations for the 3D technology lags in enforcing specific rules and guidelines on the quality assurance, validation, and inspection technique that should be imposed on food items produced targeted towards different venues such as restaurants. An example of this case can be witnessed in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), where it experiences delay in the validity and adoption of 3D food printers globally as a result more emphasis must be pushed towards the clarification of policies which include personnel training, food shelf life, food safety, and facilities [41] . Product safety in the food sector is an important issue that must be tackled through the passing of regulations from the FDA or Food Standard Agency (FSA). During the launch of printed foods into the market, such constructs possess the ability to suffer from low shelf life, improper labelling, and unregulated temperatures due to several factors that occur during the printing process and the supply food chain. As a result, regulated limitations from such entities on foods will allow the prospect of long-term effects that is similar to that experienced by genetically modified products thereby increasing consumer scepticism on the final food product. A visual summary of these factors are seen in Fig. 5  .  6.5 Institutional & administrative Due to the health-related risks acquired on food products, regulation frameworks on a national level such as in certain countries should be enforced at this development stage of the technology and food products however this case is currently lacking due to geographical related codes of conduct. As a result, several nations lack the operation of printing from skilled personal and approval of commissioning the project from administrative entities.   7 Role of 3D printing in the food industry in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals The capability of 3DFP of generating food products through a myriad of applications where it has a positive significant influence on the social, environmental, and economic outlook, leads to the successful achievement in achieving 9 SDGs namely SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 17 out of the total SDG’s set by the United Nations as demonstrated in Fig. 6  . 7.1 Sdg 1 SDG 1 calls for the abolition of poverty in all its forms by 2030. Moreover, it seeks to provide the poor and vulnerable with social welfare, expand direct connections to basic facilities, and assist people affected by climate-related catastrophic events along with other financial, social, and environmental disruptions and crises [42] . A part of the challenges facing the world stem from the incapability to generate sufficient food for everyone at a low price. Many countries are currently lacking the potential to deliver inexpensive food where statistically over 700,000 people lack insufficient food supply which currently accounts to more than 10% of the global population [43] . This malnutrition value is expected to increase in the future due to the increase in global population which is expected to reach 9.5 billion by 2050 [44] . As a result of the absence of necessary farming land or a lack of farmland potential. However, 3D printing food could compete with traditional food production [45] . 3D printing significantly lowers the cost of purchasing components and supplies. It also allows for less expensive and simpler repairs due to the localized, low-cost production of replacement parts [46] . In terms of 3D food printing global market in 2018, North America represented roughly 36% of the global market, then Europe (31%), and Asia Pacific (22%). The Asia Pacific market is expected to expand further owing to a greater rate of aging and poverty, in addition to an inadequate supply of food to provide for the population [47] .  7.2 Sdg 2 SDG 2 is aimed at eradicating hunger, providing access to food for all, enhancing food nourishment, and promoting sustainable farming practices. Currently, global hunger is a major issue faced by many countries around the world and this can be witnessed in the year 2020 whereby about 8 hundred million people across the globe suffered from this chronic subject matter [48] . Global hunger is not just related to the availability of food, it is also influenced by other factors. Global hunger is an issue related to food availability, climate change, natural catastrophes, and other issues that might affect the supply and distribution of food. For instance, the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced the global food supply chain and limited food accessibility. As a result, SDG 2 was put forth to assess the causes that might lead to worldwide hunger. Moreover, SDG 2 seeks to promote nutrition and guarantee that everyone has access to safe and adequate food throughout the year [49] . The application of 3D food printing has the potential to tackle the issue of global food insecurity by integrating alternative protein sources or wild plant sources to produce healthier food alternatives. Additionally, it can help reduce waste in the food manufacturing process, foster culinary innovation, and enable customization of food products according to the nutritional requirements of individual consumers [50] . Various researchers attempted to 3D print different types of proteins, such as eggs and meats, and vegetables to enhance their nutritious value and enhance food security. For instance, Tsai and Lin [51]  used a combination of proteins, gums, and other additives to create a matrix that resembled a steak and could be 3D printed. The 3D printed steak could have the ability to enhance both food security and human welfare, alleviate animal cruelty, and address many of the environmental concerns linked to the production of meat. Generally, 3D food printing has the potential to broaden the range of food materials available for consumption. This technology can utilize non-conventional food sources such as high-fibre plants, insects, and animal residues, to produce a diverse array of food items [52,53] . As a result, 3D food printing has the potential to produce a range of alternative protein sources such as vegetables, insects, and algae. This application can decrease the heavy dependence on animal proteins while promoting a healthier diet. These printed proteins promote a healthier diet that are associated with low levels of cholesterol [47] .  7.3 Sdg 3 Before the COVID-19 pandemic, considerable progress had been made in improving the health of many people. Nonetheless, there is still a need for more efforts to fully eliminate the spread of diseases and address all health issues. SDG 3 is one of the 17 goals set by the United Nations in 2015, focused on enhancing the well-being and health of all people. The primary objective of SDG 3 is to guarantee healthy lives and promote well-being for individuals of all ages [54] . Compared to the Millennium Development Goals focused on child/maternal mortality and communicable diseases, SDG 3 is more comprehensive. SDG 3 consists of 9 main targets and 26 indicators that cover all health issues. These health issues include child health and maternal problems; environmental and easily spread diseases; accessibility to safe and high-quality medicine and vaccines [55] . Furthermore, SDG 3 also emphasizes the need for increased research and development, greater health financing, and improved capabilities in reducing and managing health risks for all countries. 3D food printing enhances the well-being and health of individuals by presenting healthy and nutritious food products [56] . Additionally, by employing 3D printing technology to create food, the need for cooking or microwaving is eliminated, thereby reducing the health risks related with exposing humans to toxic radio waves and carcinogens [47] . Similarly, 3D food printing has the potential to accurately manage people's diets by converting their nutritional and energy needs into a digital format, which can then be customized based on their physical and nutritional condition [52,57] . The concept of printing personalized food has the ability to address malnutrition issues and significantly enhance overall health and wellness [47] . Furthermore, 3D food printing promotes the wellbeing of elderly people who are suffering from dysphagia. Dysphagia presents challenges in the swallowing process for elderly individuals, as well as those who have experienced a stroke or undergone surgeries involving the head or neck. In order to address this problem, these individuals require a specific type of food that is easy to swallow, referred to as dysphagic diets [58] . 3D food printers can easily provide dysphagic foods that are easy and safe to eat and swallow [59] . Due to these benefits, nowadays, numerous nursing facilitates in Germany are employing 3D food printers to provide soft food products for dysphagia patients [50] . Consequently, 3D food printers deplete the risk of malnourishment in elderly people who are suffering from dysphagia [49] . Similarly, 3D food printing can be utilized in hospitals to provide food products that improve the nutrition of hospital patients. Therefore, the use of 3D food printers has been suggested as a potential solution for personalized nutrition, which involves customizing diets to meet the specific nutritional needs of individuals. This approach can aid in achieving various nutritional objectives, including managing diabetes and preventing non-communicable diseases in the long run [39] . On the other hand, 3D food printers present several health concerns due to the potential for bacteria to accumulate in the device's design. This can occur in areas where food becomes trapped in mechanical parts or small crevices and gaps, providing a breeding ground for bacteria to grow. Additionally, temperature variations during the extrusion process can pose further health concerns. The heating and cooling involved in the process can make the food more vulnerable to microbial growth, such as bacteria or fungus, which can pose risks to the human health [47] .  7.4 Sdg 7 The main objective of SDG 7 is supporting affordable, durable, sustainable, and modern energy. It is based on three goals: assuring global availability of electrical facilities (7.1), boosting the percentage of clean energy in the overall energy mix (7.2), and enhancing energy efficiency (7.3). Actions for pursuing SDGs 7 include increasing global cooperation and encouraging investment (7.a), as well as expanding infrastructure and upgrading technological advances in developing countries [60] . 3D food printing is directly related to SDG 7. The less input and output requirements of 3D food printing in high-value industries may lead to decreasing consumption of energy and reducing the continuous rise in carbon dioxide emissions which holds double the amount with respect to the past decade with value of 400 ppm [61] . Moreover, printing products closer to consumers' homes may have a beneficial effect on the environment. Based on sustainability research conducted, the utilization of 3D printing has a significant influence on the current carbon footprint concentration in the atmosphere which holds a value of 400 ppm where the operation of the technology could decrease the greenhouse gas emissions by 130.5–525.5 Mt by 2025 [61] . One more benefit of 3D printing is lower labour costs, which could be even lower in 3D food production. This is due to the fact that, unlike other industry sectors (such as aerospace and machinery), 3D food production does not necessitate workers with advanced skills. The reuse of waste by 3D printing can enhance the sustainability of plant- and animal-based supply chains for food. Printer advancements, reasonable activity organization, supply chain optimization, and logistic cost reduction can all help to increase the sustainability of 3D printing [62] . Improved customization options and accessibility throughout the whole supply chain can yield economic benefit for the online marketing economic system and stockholders, but consumer’s food market implementation of 3D printing is still in its early stages. Experts predict that the global production for completely prepared 3D printing food will grow significantly in the coming years, rising from $6,422.5 million in 2019 to $44,520 million by the year of 2026. According to research, the food sector might profit from 3D printing by utilizing automated food machines and predictive analytics to improve efficiency, performance, and cost-effectiveness [63] .  7.5 Sdg 8 SDG 8 aims to achieve economic growth that is both inclusive and sustainable while also ensuring job employment opportunities. The targets and objectives of SDG 8 related to the integration of the economy, environment, and society for decent work enable sustainable economic development. According to the UN, Decent work refers to the chance for all individuals to participate in employment that is both productive and provides a just income, workplace safety, and social safeguards for families, as well as improved opportunities for personal growth and social inclusion. SDG 8 encompasses traditional objectives of economic policy, such as GDP growth and employment. Furthermore, the targets outlined in SDG 8 surpass standard economic metrics, expanding them to encompass inclusive and sustainable growth and the promotion of decent work opportunities for all [64] . The market for 3D food printing is predicted to grow rapidly at a compound annual rate of 50% between 2017 and 2024, with an estimated value of $400 million by the year 2024. This demonstrates the swift development of 3D food printing technology. The market for 3D food printing is being propelled by significant factors, such as the rising need for personalized food products. The global 3D food printing market is mainly dominated by North America, consisting of the United States and Canada, which accounts for approximately 36% of the market share. Europe follows closely behind with 31% of the market share, while the Asia Pacific region holds 22% of the market share. The Asia Pacific market for 3D food printing is expected to witness further growth due to several factors, including the high rate of destitution and the shortage of sufficient food resources [47] . Furthermore, the processing of food ingredients, both in their raw form and after being cooked, can create opportunities for new markets in 3D food printing, as well as greatly affect social acceptance and the spread of the technology. Moreover, the ability of 3D food printing to offer alternative food sources, such as meats extracted from plants [65] , meals made from algae or insects [33] , in appealing shapes and flavours, presents an opportunity for the food industry to tap into new markets. As a result, the food industry will have the ability to create diverse food products using limited ingredients, which can increase the consumer’s insight of added value [66,67] . Consequently, even small volumes of these products can generate high economic returns [65,68] . On the other hand, the 3D food printing technology has the potential to eliminate the entire food production process and eliminate the necessity of grocery stores, chefs, or any related jobs [47] . Moreover, 3D food printing requires highly skilled employees for fully exploiting its potentials [65] . As a result, 3D food printing has the potential to significantly alter business models, affect the global economy, and transform current supply chains [69] .  7.6 Sdg 11 SDG 11 calls for sustainable cities and communities. It seeks to establish accessible, reliable, adaptable, and sustainable urban and human societies by reducing urban sprawl, increasing urban management engagement, enhancing cultural wealth management, and highlighting urban strength and environmental issues [70] . Cities worldwide are being developed to be smarter and more sustainable [71] . Despite some advancements created by Smart Cities designs, cities consume 80% of the earth's resources. In this regard, employing advanced technologies in urban food production has the ability to enhance food chain efficiency in the areas of supply, processing, and distribution, as well as logistics and food waste management, by leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution pillars. It is important to emphasize that present food production rates are unlikely to be sufficient to meet the approximated population's food needs in 2050, cities and urban facilities are the main base of this risk. Advancements in technology, such as 3D printing, have the potential to revolutionize the food industry by allowing anyone to be a food manufacturer, producing food as per their requirements and personal desires in terms of monitoring shapes, textures, colour, flavour, and diet. Since these procedures have environment and food safety processes, this flexibility in residential kitchens has the possibility of enhancing efficiency in providing high-quality, ready food products to consumers [72] .  7.7 Sdg 12 Globally, there is an estimated loss or waste of around 1.3 billion tons of food globally across the entire supply chain. This amount is accounts for one-third of the total available food [50] . As a result, one of the most pressing worldwide issues is to align environmental objectives with economic objectives to ensure sustainable practices and eliminate environmental deterioration. In order to promote sustainable patterns of consumption and production and facilitate the transition towards a more environmentally friendly and socially inclusive global economy, it is essential to implement both resource decoupling and impact decoupling strategies. These strategies involve reducing the use of natural resources while simultaneously minimizing the environmental impact of economic activities [73] . All these practices are promoted by SDG 12 which focuses on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns and includes targets to promote resource efficiency, reduce waste and pollution, and encourage sustainable practices throughout the entire supply chain [43] . Food waste is a significant challenge to the environment and food availability, as it depletes resources and increases emissions [20] . However, 3D food printing technology has the potential to offer creative solutions for repurposing various food waste and by-products, including materials like grape pomace and broken wheat. This technology has the capability to transform these materials into useful and valuable products, helping to reduce waste and promote sustainable production practices [74] . For example, a new Dutch company started recycling food waste by utilizing it as input to provide 3D printed snacks. Moreover, food items such as vegetables, fruits, and bread that are still edible but are not suitable for sale, as well as other food wastes from restaurants, can be used in 3D food printing for producing other food products [75] . Therefore, 3D food printing technology has the potential to address the issue of food waste by utilizing certain types of waste as input materials to create customized and personalized food products with appealing taste and aesthetic designs [20] . In general, 3D printing is seen as an eco-friendly manufacturing process that provides significant environmental advantages through three primary factors: efficient use of resources, effective handling of waste, and regulation of pollution. The resource consumption in 3D printing is attributed to the electricity used to power the system and the materials utilized for printing such as powders, polymers, and filaments. 3D food printing has a material efficiency rate of around 97%, which reduces the amount of waste generated in comparison to traditional food production processes [76] . Compared to conventional food production processes, the amount of food waste produced in 3D food printing is very minimal. This is because the 3D printer calculates and uses the precise amount of ingredients according to a predetermined recipe. Additionally, 3D food printing offers food reproducibility, which means that the same ingredients can be reused to create a similar food product again. Therefore, 3D food printing has the potential to promote sustainability in food production [59] .  7.8 Sdg 13 The primary global framework for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 13 is the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement and SDG 13 focus on keeping global temperature from rising below the 2 °C limit. This is because if the average global temperature increases by more than 2 °C, it will have severe consequences on the ecosystem. These effects will disproportionately impact vulnerable and marginalized communities. Moreover, the global temperature has risen to 1.1 °C beyond pre-industrial levels as a result of elevated greenhouse gas emissions. This increase in temperature has led to more frequent and expensive extreme weather events and a rise in sea levels. As a result, SDG 13 was established to take urgent action to tackle climate change and its impacts and minimize greenhouse gas emissions [77] . Methane and nitrous oxide are the primary greenhouse gases emitted from animal agriculture and are considered the most significant contributors to climate change. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is primarily produced through enteric fermentation and manure storage. It is estimated to have a global warming potential that is 28 times greater than CO2 [78] . In comparison with conventional food production processes, 3D food printing produces food without emitting harmful pollutants into the environment. Moreover, 3D food printing has significantly modified the food supply chain by removing several stages and enhancing its responsiveness [79,80] . Consequently, the use of 3D food printing technology has the ability to decrease the length of the food supply chain, while simultaneously reducing the time and distance between the supply and demand in comparison to traditional methods of food production [81] . As a result, 3D food printing reduces the carbon footprint of food production [65,75] .  7.9 Sdg 17 SDG 17 is dedicated to enhancing the ways of carrying out the entire SDG agenda and promoting international cooperation. To achieve sustainable development, it clearly points for the revitalization of the global partnership [82] . Food has the possibility of impacting the diet, especially for older people above the age of 65 who have swallowing disabilities. By using food shaping processes including 3D food printing, greater focus on the shape of the food introduced for utilization may greatly enhance the availability of food and nutrition. 3D food printing directly contributes to SDG 17 and its targets. Partnering with food science experts and food engineers to produce food that is not only eye-catching but also more manageable is critical to enhance the mealtime insights of older individuals with swallowing disabilities [49] . The food sector is a well-established industry with significant global economic value. It contributes to more than $4 trillion in yearly retail market. Researchers have noted that the potential to innovate commercialization practices, by partnership with different parties and the classification of the most appropriate methods (i.e., planning and business models (BMs)) for new products commercialization, may improve the likelihood of entering a market [83] . In 2016, the world-famous Italian pasta company Barilla collaborated with the Dutch company TNO to produce the first 3D printer for fresh pasta. They utilized it to produce not only high-quality pasta dishes, but also distinct shapes [84] . This is an example of a collaboration to produce a 3D food printer.   8 Limitations & future recommendations Despite its great potential in generating a variety of applications suitable for different customers, the technology has several technical limitations. For example, many studies have focused on creating textures, olfactory effects, and visual appearances suitable for dysphagia patients. As a result, further research is required to surpass monotonous textures available in order to provide multitude of textures that meet the requirements of different customers with diverse backgrounds. In addition, a major challenge is that the technology remains to print food constructs at a very slow pace and low efficiency due to the lack of correlation between the physical properties and printing parameters on the productivity of the technology. Therefore, more research is necessary to establish a strong affiliation between the rheology of different food formulations and output production. From an empirical perspective, there seems to remain a gap between customers and the business operations of 3DFP where limited individuals experience first-hand the procedures and raw ingredients involved in the utilization of the technology to produce certain food products. As a result, qualitative research such as observational studies are necessary to determine the reactions of individuals when in contact with the technology as well as perceived barriers for its adoption in different market settings. An important barrier for adoption of the technology involves the limited regulations and examinations of the safety risks associated with 3DFP. More research is required to determine ways to minimize the potential hazards that are not limited to the formation of heat generated compounds, microbiological risks, and physical risks that may pose a threat to the health of individuals and leave room for detrimental incidents to occur. Moreover, an important challenge involves the lack of focus on research on finding ways to modify the technology in order to prevent its nascent access into large scale systems. More research is required to the development of a new 3D printing technology or a modified version of the existing one in order to push its access into commercial applications while taking into account the up-to-date and emerging food value chains. Furthermore, future work should be stressed on further improvement of the technology’s sustainability impact in terms of the ecological, economic, and social welfare.  9 Conclusion The potential of 3D food printing (3DFP) is highlighted through its ability to significantly contribute to the sustainability benchmarks set out by the United Nations. The study reveals the significant advantage of 3DFP in providing an efficient and renewable future of food processing over present conventional means with its current track potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 130.5–525.5 Mt by 2025. Additionally, the topic of 3DFP supports the objectives of SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 17 which represent slightly over half of the total sustainability targets suggested by the United Nations. However, the sustainability of the technology still has further room for improvement despite the lower influence it has on climate change where more research is required to enhance its renewable feasibility. The study utilized the evaluation of the recent progress and limitations of 3 different applications for 3DFP namely food waste utilization, customised shape fabrication, and personalized nutrition as laying the framework for determining its achievement in meeting SDGs which highlights the promising impact of the technology in the food industry. Furthermore, continued development is necessary to mitigate the limitations associated with the technology to a minimum in order to unlock its full potential. Overall, the importance and promotion of 3DFP in the food industry is stressed through its ability to meet the sustainability goals.
