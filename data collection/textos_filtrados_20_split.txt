Man, like at his beginning as a species, is approaching a new turning point in his long way to keep on existence
About 1 billion people still live under the threshold for poverty set by the World Bank, and almost the same number do not have enough food for themselves
Agricultural production and human health have been among the mainstay sectors at the SDGs
The Developing World Is Poorer than We Thought,but No Less Successful in the Fight against Poverty
Unlike the MDGs, which were produced by a handful of experts of the UN, to define the SDGs, UN launched the largest consultation program of its history to probe the most largely accepted opinion on what the SDGs were to include
Thus, the SDGs intend to represent a new set of goals, targets and indicators that
Limiting ourselves to nutrition, it is now clear for example that our current consumption of animal meat is not sustainable from the energy and environmental viewpoint
Around 22 millions years ago, a monkey abandoned the relative safety of the trees of the tropical forest in East Africa to start an amazing adventure crossing the millennia
Today, we have the ability to change dramatically, for the better or worse, the environment and the ecosystems in which we live
Another promising source is – can you believe? – from insects, almost closing a circle in the human diet habits tracing back to far ages
In 2012 it was already indubitable that the MDGs would not be achieved
Other options are based on organic farming with lower environmental impact
Solving these challenges will not be easy and will rely on integration of political actions and advance of knowledge from different disciplines in order to strengthen the capacity to generate and share research data, not only within the scientific community but also within the industrial world and society in general
The biggest difference is that while the MDGs were considered development goals for the least developed countries, to be achieved thanks to the efforts of the “wealthiest” Member States, this time, each country is expected to work to comply with it
One of the sectors where these outcomes are more dramatically apparent is the food production system, which is currently experiencing increasing pressure both on the demand side (from growing population and consumer demands) and on the supply side (from greater competition for inputs and from climate change)
The SDGs acknowledge that developed countries have neither the capacity nor the right to direct the development policies on behalf of the developing countries, but decisions must necessarily searched by the involvement of interested countries and allocating on these priorities worldwide participation policies
The SDGs, in their aim replace and broaden the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) expiring last year with a less than satisfactory balance: about 1 billion people still live under the threshold for poverty set by the World Bank, and almost the same number do not have enough food for themselves
Seizing the new opportunities of nourishment offered by the savanna and learning to survive the threats to life, in a process extremely rapid in evolutionary terms, this monkey went forward our biped ancestors
For most of the following ages, its diet of consisted only of grasses, of fruits collected from prairie trees and of small animals hunted, and of insects
The SDGs shows that developed countries have neither the ability nor the right to direct the development policies on behalf of the developing ones, but these decisions and solutions must necessarily be shared by the greatest number of the political subjects
Most importantly, the tremendous advances in science and technology gathered in the last century have been unbalanced by the accurate evaluation of the impact of the human activity on nature, environment and the human society itself
The 17 SDGs replace, and broaden, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) expiring in 2015
The tools available to the smart monkey today are much more advanced than in the past, but also more sharp and dangerous, even without thinking to war weapons
On September 2015 the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in New York established the 2030 global agenda for sustainable development and defined a new list of objectives on which to focus commitments for the next fifteen years
As indicated by SDGs, food sustainability and security are the milestones of this path, in addressing the topical issues of, for example, the impact of climate change on food resources, biodiversity and global food security
From first appearance, its primary goal was securing food to its community and its descendants
Both these countries are considered developing nations, but they're increasingly influencing global food trade and policy, not the least of which because they house a large proportion of the world's population (
On September 2015 the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in New York established the global agenda for sustainable development until 2030 and defined a list of objectives on which to focus commitments for the next fifteen years
Novel technologies offer now the opportunity to replace meat (however I hope we will still enjoy a succulent steak from time to time to time) with other protein sources such as new legumes resilient to drought and salinity stress or to climatic change
However they are also introducing new challenges, for instance from the nutritional point of view: will the new legumes be as much productive as sustainable? Will insect proteins in the diet be a source a novel and unknown food allergens? The road to food security and sustainability is still long and windy, but the direction appear to be traced
The SDGs acknowledge that developed countries have neither the ability nor the right to direct the development policies on behalf of the developing countries, but these decisions and solutions must necessarily be shared by the greatest number of the political entities
The development, optimization, validation and application of novel technologies for food production and manufacture are a fine example and will be critical in securing nutrition to the whole mankind in a sustainable way
The SDGs replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) expiring in 2015
As a consequence, the delicate balance between human progress and exhausting of world resources appears today to be broken
The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) expressed by the Summit - with 169 related targets - are the result of a work of public consultation and multi-stakeholder involvement lasted two years
The vision placed into them is that of a world inclusive, equitable and ecologically friendly
Despite the commendable but isolated efforts, announcements and even signed agreements of governments, international organizations and agencies, effective and coordinated initiatives aimed at improving food sustainability and security remained at an early stage until now
A potential ‘game-changer’ in the scenario is the rising economic power of China and India
All these opportunities are of course in line with the objectives of the 17 SDGs
Therefore, during the Conference of Rio in 2013, it was decided to launch the UN Open Group, which last year unveiled the new master plan development for the planet
