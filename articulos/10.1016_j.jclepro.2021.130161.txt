These research topics emerged from the 6th International Conference on Low Carbon asia and beyond 2020 held in 2020. The purpose of this contribution has been to provide a brief introduction to the field and the research results included in this Journal of Cleaner Production Virtual Special Issue.    1 Introduction Nearly 5.8% of the decrease in the global energy-related GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions from 2019 to 2020 can be seen from the statistical data collected by International Energy Agency (IEA, 2021)  are due to the decline of the activities and related reduced fossil fuel consumption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As pandemic is slowly transforming into endemic and countries are slowly lifting restrictions, the rebounding of GHG emission is inevitable. The emergence of a new normal, accelerated by COVID-19 in 2020, has changed how practitioners and researchers across the globe are addressing the GHG emission issue (Chernick et al., 2020 ). This provides both unique opportunities and challenges in reducing emissions while maintaining the nations' rate of development. Several critical topics concerning sustainability and low GHG emission, including renewable energy (Hoang et al., 2021 ), waste as resources (Peng et al., 2021 ), cleaner production, circular economy (Saidani et al., 2021 ), are receiving high research attention recently. International conferences serve as a crucial platform for the science and sustainability community to come together in the face of these challenges. Over 200 well-versed and experienced professionals banded together at the 6th International Conference on Low Carbon Asia and Beyond 2020 (ICLCA′20), themed “Urban Sustainability towards Human Well-Being” on 1st and September 2, 2020. ICLCA′20 was held as an all-online virtual event. The conference series has been both a prime regional and international forum for academic scientists, researchers, and industry practitioners to share and exchange experiences and research results on the aspect of low-carbon development in Asia and beyond. It also provides a premier platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss and present the most recent trends, innovations, and concerns, as well as practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted for achieving carbon neutrality. The conference addressed the challenges outlined under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations, 2020 ).  2 Background ICLCA′20 was organized entirely online due to the consideration of relatively stringent pandemic measures in Asia and the critical waves during the conference. Thousands of conferences have been held worldwide annually, presenting various efforts to reduce environmental impacts in ICLCA′20. However, the impact of the conference organization itself receives less attention, as highlighted by Nevrlý et al. (2020)  in assessing the optimal location for the conference venue. The COVID-19 has altered our lifestyle. It stimulated the discussion of current practices, including e-heath, work from home, virtual conferences, are more effective and environmentally friendlier or to back to the norm, particularly in terms of energy consumption (Klemeš et al., 2020 ). Jiang et al. (2021)  highlight that the energy savings of virtual conferences are generally apparent and less likely to overturn by rebound effects. Jäckle. (2021)  stated that virtual events could reduce GHG emissions by up to 90% compared to a physical conference. However, it also depends on the assessed system boundary for the virtual conference (Obringer et al., 2021 ). An increment is expected nowadays, considering the higher definition of video streaming and efficiency improvement, which induced a higher demand (Masanet et al., 2020 ). ICLCA′20 is generally successful considering the difficulties and the participant rates. However, the interaction between participants for collaboration deserves more evaluation and brings to the discussion of a hybrid format for the future instead of entirely online (Tao et al., 2021 ). The event featured eight plenary speeches, 28 keynote speeches, six breakout sessions with 152 presenters from 14 countries. Contemporary issues, challenges, and the future of sustainable development in Asia were covered in the event. Six major topics were discussed in this joint conference, indicating its multidisciplinary and holistic approach for sustainable solutions. The topics included urban planning and smart cities, sustainable energy, waste and water management, sustainable agriculture and urban food supply, nexus and circular economy, and clean technologies. A Scientific Committee consisting of 31 world-leading personalities reviewed the 151 papers submitted for the oral and poster presentation for the joint conference. Following further selection procedures, 61 invitations have been sent to the authors to submit manuscripts to the Journal of Cleaner Production, and 39 articles were accepted.  3 Research work collected in this special issue Thirty-nine articles are classified into six categories in this Virtual Special Issue: Sustainable Energy System, Sustainable Waste Management, Sustainable Water Management, Sustainable Agriculture and Urban Food Supply, Nexus and Circular Economic and Cleaner Technology.
