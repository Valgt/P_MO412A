This Virtual Special Issue (VSI) is on “The Sustainable Development Goals, Organisational Learning and Efficient Resource Management in Construction” (VSI: Construction & SDGs).   Keywords Construction  Organisational learning  Circular economy  Resource management  SDGS  Built environment  SDGs    1 Introduction People have been able to thrive through the economic stages of the world through significant developments like industrialization, globalization, urbanization, green revolution and even digitalization (Madurai Elavarasan et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, most of these developments do not have sustainability approaches integrated into them, which have yielded in the negative impacts witnessed in the world (Madurai Elavarasan et al., 2021 ). According to Halkos and Gkampoura (2021) , sustainable development (SD) is the development that meet needs of the present generation whiles creating the opportunity for the future generation to meet their needs too. Furthermore, the focus of SD is on increasing environmental protection whiles providing socio-economic needs of both present and future generations. According to de Jong and Vijge (2021) , the discourse of SD has been and is still highly influential in national governance framework as well as the world's framework. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and its 169 targets were introduced by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 to direct people's actions that would aid humanity and the ecosystem to evolve as a single self-sustaining system (Halkos and Gkampoura, 2021 ; Madurai Elavarasan et al., 2021 ). These SDGs were adopted by about 193 UN member countries to achieve the aim of SD. Although the emphasizes of SDGs was to be achieved everywhere, the world has increasingly evolved in connectivity in socio-economic and environmental sustainability that little is known in the entirety of the goals and purposes of SDGs (Zhao et al., 2021 ). According to Wen et al. (2020) , SDGs provide a clear and comprehensive framework towards achieving global sustainability by 2030. This is because the construction industry gradually harbours activities that has made the realization of the SDGs to be considered. Again, Zhao et al. (2021)  revealed that the SDGs can be achieved everywhere and at every level (i.e., local, reginal, national and international) if more efforts are put into achieving these goals at all levels by creating socio-economic synergies. According to de Jong and Vijge (2021) , aside SDGs being a more comprehensive approach to SD, they are people-centred development agenda. The SDGs call for participation of all parts of society including the private sectors. Again, there has been many shifts off SDGs, nonetheless, the aim of the SDGs is still at promoting multilateral trade by increasing the market access that is consistent with the world trade organisation decisions. Furthermore, the construction industry has contributed immensely to economic growth but at the cost of high resource consumption and environmental issues that undermines the global ecology (Wen et al., 2020 ). Again, concepts, such as Green Building has been introduced into the economy to help achieve the goals of sustainability that were introduce over the years (Wen et al., 2020 ). Wen et al. (2020)  further stated that by properly comprehending the relationship between SDGs and certain economic sectors such as the construction sector, public awareness and policy development can be properly promoted. It is also therefore imperative that the approaches to transform the SDGs from the global to local and even project-specific levels are develop (Wen et al., 2020 ). According to de Jong and Vijge (2021) , the SDGs present a greater integrated approach to SD with a large focus on the core of SDGs (i.e., economic, social, and environmental dimensions of SD). According to Huan et al. (2021) , the performance of achieving SDGs from 2000 to 2018 has been regarded as a dynamic progress.  2 Organisational learning for sustainable development The link between Organisational learning and sustainability is receiving an increasing amount of attention in construction management research and practice (Opoku and Fortune, 2011 ). Organisational learning has been defined by Lopez et al. (2005)  as the process of creating, acquiring, and integrating knowledge with the aim of developing resources and capabilities that contribute to organisational performance. A learning organisation is one that continuously learns and develop itself. However, a learning organisation is supposed to effectively sustain innovation towards improved performance achievement (Tortorella et al., 2020 ). Organisational learning (OL), is seen as an improvement process rather than an event that links organisational cultures and the environment together (Tortorella et al., 2020 ). The emergence of OL capabilities have allowed business growth, impacted organisational knowledge, beliefs and behaviours that brought about innovative routines in businesses and organisations (Tortorella et al., 2020 ). There have been many misleading truths about OL such as OL being the sum of individuals learning in an organisation (Tortorella et al., 2020 ). However, Bašić (2021)  revealed that OL enhances an organisation's competitiveness to a market need aligned to the organisation's environment. Furthermore, to create a firm's core competences, there has to be availability, heterogeneity, and immobility of scarce and tangible resources to keep the firm in a competitive advantage. Again, Bašić (2021)  expounded that through OL capabilities, resource efficiency can be prolonged, and resource obsolesce can be prevented. According to Tortorella et al. (2020) , there were two main approaches to follow to allow OL to occur. The first was a type of learning that is gotten through trials and error situations which allow the organisation to accrue experiences and consolidate new knowledge, whiles the second comprised of work procedures and routines that were developed from stored knowledge in an organisation's memory applied to subsequent situations similar to situations experienced before. Learning that enhances innovation is vital to sustainability. However, Bašić (2021)  also revealed two types of knowledge crucial for successful innovation in OL. These were technical knowledge and market knowledge for exploratory and exploitative learning respectively. Furthermore, Tortorella et al. (2020)  stated that learning accompanied with sharing of knowledge across an organisation can improve its performance but to achieve effective OL, individuals, teams and the organisation as a unit would be significantly challenged in job routines and procedures. Again, literature has therefore, revealed that OL is vital for sustainable performance improvements. Nonetheless, the challenges and barriers that impair the widespread of OL ought to be severely comprehended (Tortorella et al., 2020 ). According to Silvius and Marnewick (2021) , matters of social, environmental and economic sustainability emerged in the early 18th century but only became pronounced until the late 20th century and broadly recognized as a managerial, societal and political challenge. Again, it was in the 20th century that the concept of sustainability was incorporated into businesses and organisation, thereby, creating a link between sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). According to Silvius and Marnewick (2021) , CSR opened the door for firms and businesses to assume roles that allowed social sustainability to thrive. Furthermore, changes in resources, products, services, policies, and processes were accommodated by firms and businesses to achieve sustainable development. In analysing other aspects of sustainability towards corporate performance, Tu and Wu (2021)  revealed that many studies had been carried out to examine the effect of green innovation on business competitiveness. It was revealed that knowledge-based view (KBV) emerged to provide insight into the sources of sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, with the help of OL, business strategies would be effectively understood, recognised, and executed within a firm. OL, which is a means of creating new knowledge and integrating resources in an organisation, is essential to carrying out business strategies and achieving sustainable competitive advantage. Tu and Wu (2021)  revealed that green innovation can positively affect enterprises’ competitive advantage through the underlying mechanism of KBV. It was further revealed that enterprises could combine exploitative and exploratory learning to mitigate the conflicts between green innovation strategies and existing business model. Also, OL at different organisational levels and with different characteristics improves employees’ recognition of new strategies, increase enterprises’ self-capability to cope with sustainable production requirements and also enhance corporate comparative advantage in catering to green consumption trend and ultimately boosting their competitive advantage (Tu and Wu, 2021 ). Opoku and Fortune (2011)  argue that the ability of construction organisations to cope with the journey towards a sustainable change requires organisational learning.  3 Efficient resource management in construction The reasons for the inefficient utilization of construction resources are the fragmented, project-based approach and the linear economy approach in which construction resources are sourced, utilised, and discarded with little re-use or recycling. Resource efficiency in housing construction was proposed to address the gap between housing demand and current construction methods (Kedir and Hall, 2021 ). According to Kedir and Hall (2021) , to measure resource efficiency in construction, most studies and scholars perform a life-cycle impact assessment of flows of materials, energy and water. The world has therefore evolved from the linear economic model of “take, make and dispose” with high levels of waste generation pressure to the circular economic model of utilizing the “R-principles” in a closed resource loop in an industrial ecosystem (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Material footprint reduction and achieving sustainable resources consumption remains very vital to climate change mitigation and adaption strategies, since materials usage continue to drive the global emissions and extreme levels of waste generation (Arora et al., 2020 ). However, Zhang et al. (2022)  revealed that the R-principles of circular economy operate to prevent the generation of wastes and also turning the wastes into resources. Again, the circular economic model originated from the “spaceship theory” introduced by Boulding (1966), which views the earth as a circular system where there is no exchange of matter with the outside environment. The circular economic model ultimately looks to decouple global economic development from finite resource and consumption (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Again, Zhang et al. (2022)  revealed that the R-principles of circular economy are highly related to the waste hierarchy. To a larger extent, both the circular economy and waste hierarchy consider the whole life cycle of a product from the pre-use phase to use phase and to post-use phase. According to Arora et al. (2020) , although one of the basic motivations of material stock assessment remains a sustainability of resources, there is a gap in linking in-stock and end-of-life resources with materials inflows for consumption and /or new construction. However, a significant understanding on grow consumption patterns and stocks accumulations inspired urban mining efforts and have since been accelerated with circular economy efforts at institutional and geographical scales in an attempt for environmental and /or material efficiencies (Arora et al., 2020 ). Zhang et al. (2022)  further corroborated that the circular economy and waste hierarchy have evolved over time emphasizing on designing and using resources efficiently before they reach the waste generation level. Also, the aim of the circular economy and waste hierarchy is to manage waste by rethinking, redesigning, and repurposing to achieve resource efficiency in product use and reducing the levels ad adverse impact of waste. Construction waste over the years have had great impacts on the environment through diverse aspects such as the ecosystem, natural resources, and environmental sustainability, whiles the recycling of construction materials from wastes can lessen the pressure on constrained natural resources (Yang et al., 2021 ). Construction and demolition waste (CDW) as a by-product of construction, demolition and renovation has become one of the most significant flows which amounts to about 30%–40% of the total urban waste generation (Wu et al., 2019 ). However, with enhancing the concepts of sustainability, the social and environmental impacts have been highlighted in assessing CDW management performance. Furthermore, as an essential aspect of improving CDW management performance, the effectiveness of the waste management systems ought to be critically evaluated (Wu et al., 2019 ). For example, construction and demolition activities generate large volumes of waste and this requires the adoption of practices that will reduce waste generated and maximise re-use with the aim of improving efficient resource use and reduce negative impact on the environment (Gálvez-Martos et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, studies have proven that the quality and completeness of data are very critical for the purposes of data analysis. However, when it comes to construction activities, some of the data is often incomplete. These ‘missing data’ serve as misleading values to major information barriers to the ever present challenges to the monitoring and evaluation in CDW management (Yang et al., 2021 ). Again, to make these CDW management more efficient, the construction industry has adopted various informatization technologies such as sensor technology, geographic information system (GIS), internet of things (IoT), computer vision and amongst others. Studies have also shown that some construction activities have applied diversified technologies, trades and complex processes in managing CDW (Yang et al., 2021 ). According to Yang et al. (2021) , issues that hinders efficient CDW management in the construction industry from digitalization and data-driven decision making is missing data as an aspects of information barrier. Furthermore, Ozkan-Ozen et al. (2020)  stated that there were so many contentions and pressures for companies to transition from industry 3.0 to industry 4.0 or digitalization. The progress on transition would be regarded as industry 3.5 and moving towards circular economy are two significant concepts for organisations that need to make wholesale alterations to their existing managing systems. Again, the transition stage of industry 3.5 can be seen as a hybrid strategy for technological transition in production systems and also managing disruptive impact like total resource management for sustainability (Ozkan-Ozen et al., 2020 ). Again, supply chain management is considered as a vital aspect within sustainable resource management, where circular economy which can be used to minimize resource utilization and waste reduction, can also be seen as a holistic and most appropriate approach of how to transform the supply chain in the age of industry 4.0 (Ozkan-Ozen et al., 2020 ). This implies that in the process of developing high technological manufacturing environment, it is now possible to integrate sustainable resource management (Ozkan-Ozen et al., 2020 ). According to Belmonte-Ureña et al. (2021) , in order to achieve efficient resource management in the construction industry towards the attainment of sustainable development, other conceptual approaches like circular economy, degrowth and green growth were developed. Whiles circular economy looks at advocating an economic system that dissociates environmental pressure from economic growth through the replacement of the traditional or linear economy of production for a circular production where waste becomes a vital resource, degrowth also assumes resource limitations and advocates smaller growth rates, even negative, to balance the natural and economic systems of production. Under green growth, the focus is on generating economic growth through investments in activities that protect or restore the natural environment (Belmonte-Ureña et al., 2021 ). Glass et al. (2012)  add that construction materials and products should be procured from responsible sources that can certify the origin of all materials.  4 Organisational learning and efficient resource management towards the SDGs Organisational learning, according to Agyabeng-Mensah et al. (2021) , has received much attention from scholars and also from several management disciplines, and has also resulted in many diverse definitions in literature. Most of the definitions focused the extent of OL as a process where experience obtained from performing a task is transformed into knowledge, which subsequently changes the firm and influences the future of the firm's performance (Agyabeng-Mensah et al., 2021 ). According to Dicle and Köse (2014) , OL is the pathway towards sustainable development, as SD cannot be achieved without innovation, and innovation is also achieved in a culture that embraces and nurtures learning and change. Also, in the private sector, companies are allowed to select and prioritize corporate sustainable issues and to align strategies towards specific sustainable goals. However, achieving the SDGs is hindered by a fundamental difficulty, that is, limited knowledge of the actual sustainability practices on SDGs (Calabrese et al., 2021 ). So, for an organisation to transition towards sustainability requires a cultural change in the form of new shared values, norms, procedures, and strategic renewal in which the organisation can integrate the people, planet and profit which can be attained from the concept of OL (Dicle and Köse, 2014 ). OL, according to many studies is very vital to the performance and progress of firms and businesses. According to Bašić (2021) , by adopting certain types of knowledge like technical and market knowledge, exploratory and exploitative learning would be acquired by the organisation to allow for successful innovation in OL to take place. According to Silvius and Marnewick (2021) , by incorporating sustainable developments into corporate firms and organisations, it allowed firms and businesses to assume roles that allowed social sustainability to thrive. According to Khaled et al. (2021) , firms’ progress toward achieving the SDGs from an impact point of view can be assessed by measuring the impact of SDGs on corporate sustainability performance. In addition, Calabrese et al. (2021)  stated that the role of the private sector in achieving SDGs should not be underestimated because of their ability to influence stakeholders, mobilise resources and to innovate. It has also been reported that the number of companies that contribute to SDGs through their reporting practices are increasing (Calabrese et al., 2021 ). According to Arya et al. (2022) , sustainability is the foundational block for continuous development. The extreme levels of waste generation and its management integrated with SDGs will lead to enhance social, economic and environmental improvements. Tabares (2021)  also stated that the SDGs agreed upon by the United Nation in 2015 consisted of 17 goals which aimed at integrating matters of humanity's most pressing problems. Arya et al. (2022)  further stated that the organic waste management integrated with SDGs were meant to reduce the burden of waste generation with other benefits. However, Arya et al. (2022)  further stated that adopting recycling organic waste as a friendly environmental approach, will aid in obtaining sustainable products which also attributed to achieving the SDGs. For instance, extended business opportunities will be created by recycling organic waste. Also, new markets in recycling will be unlocked, and scientific and technological aspects of attaining the SDGs such as SDGs 3,6,7,8,11,12 and 13, will be strengthened. Again, adopting sustainable and scientific methods coupled with the R-based principles of circular economy, could contribute to achieving the SDGs and its targets at a rapid pace. Also, supports of governing authorities can go a long way to affect the effective waste management plan (Arya et al., 2022 ). According to Dicle and Köse (2014) , on the path to a sustainable world, corporate firms and businesses have both the responsibility and resources to take necessary actions. Nonetheless, literature have revealed a lack of empirical studies proposing a strong linkage between OL and corporate environmentalism. By understanding the dynamics and interactions on these concepts can go long way to provide insights to guide management of firms and researchers in creating solutions to attaining sustainable development (Dicle and Köse, 2014 ). According to Belmonte-Ureña et al. (2021) , although a plethora of sustainable approaches have been introduced in the construction industry, yet these concepts have not been fully understood to the extent to which these concepts embrace the breadth of topics encompassed by the SDGs or whether the knowledge accrued can be used to achieve the goals and targets under the SDGs. However, the studies of Belmonte-Ureña et al. (2021)  revealed that with regard to the knowledge domains and SDGs examined in their studies, i.e., Circular economy, Degrowth and Green growth, each knowledge domain was skewed towards the attainment of a very few SDGs, notably, SDG 3, 12, 8 and 13. The other SDGs that were less addressed or were consistently low across the knowledge domains examined were SDG 1, 5, 14 and 17. According to Belmonte-Ureña et al. (2021) , several commentaries have been raised in literature to warn against the isolation treatment of the SDGs since they were created to be interdependent. However, to implement these goals on the industry level, businesses and governing bodies have adopted a “pick and mix” strategy for the implementation of the SDGs they feel were more confident to advance.  5 Contributions to this virtual special issue (VSI) The call for the VSI attracted over 40 abstract submissions and over 30 full paper submissions but unfortunately the resulted in the acceptance and publication of only 6 papers after a rigorous blind review and revision process as presented in Table 1  . Most papers were desktop rejected by the editorial team of the RCR due to the academic quality and relevance to the VSI. Lee et al. (2021) presents first paper on the “Analysis of industrial water–energy–labour nexus zones for economic and resource-based impact assessment ”. The paper analyses a framework for sustainable economic growth considering the trade-offs among economic inequality, resource security, and labour requirement through an industrial water, energy, and labour (I-WEL) nexus approach. It analysed the economic intensity of industrial water, energy, and labour in 47 prefectures in Japan and found that the more industrialized prefectures showed lower water but higher energy intensities than relatively less industrialized prefectures. The paper classified four I-WEL nexus zones—high efficiency, labour-intensive, water-intensive, and water- and energy-intensive zones—based on their economic intensities and by using the K-means clustering method. The paper also applied economic growth scenarios, weighted by I-WEL nexus zones, and quantified water, energy, and labour requirements by scenario at the local, regional, and national scales. The results of the study show that, by using weighted economic growth in the high-efficiency I-WEL nexus zones and relative to the baseline scenario (which assigns equal ratios of increased economic growth to all prefectures), a potential savings of 337 Mm3/year of freshwater and 184 PJ/year of energy can be realized. The second paper by Zhou et al. (2021) examine “A novel approach for recycling engineering sediment waste as sustainable supplementary cementitious materials ”. It discusses a novel green recycling approach where engineering sediment waste is recycled with mechanical treatment and calcination and used as supplementary cementitious material to partially substitute cement to prepare mortar for construction application. The study investigates mechanical properties of the prepared mortar and the mechanism behind the proposed recycling approach was discovered through microscale characterizations. The result of the study shows that, recycled engineering sediment can promote the secondary hydration in mortar, improving the compressive strength. The environmental impact of the proposed recycling approach and current landfilling method was compared through life cycle assessment (LCA). The proposed recycling approach can save 1204.1 MJ/t of energy consumption, and 326.1 kg CO2eq/t of global warming potential compared to those of landfilling method. The research provides an effective recycling scheme of engineering sediment waste on a vast scale and contribute to a sustainable construction waste management strategy. The third paper by Raiden and King (2021) is on “Social value, organisational learning, and the sustainable development goals in the built environment ”. The study examines clients’, consultant, local authority, and contractors’ social value organisational learning journeys towards sustainable development. The paper reveals how organisations have transformed their systems towards more sustainable production by collectively aligning to achieve social value and thus realise the SDGs beyond what any individual project or initiative would be able to deliver alone. The paper is based on transformative case study of social value in practice, which has a partnership model at its heart, and the potential to inform future methodologies for business and community engagement to improve social outcomes. The study shows that contractors play a central role in bringing together the different influences and managing agency-structure interplay within this social practice. The partnership approach explored in this paper offers a way to ensure more efficient use of resources in the hugely important development of the built environment. The fourth paper by Sezer and Fredriksson (2021) describe “Environmental impact of construction transport and the effects of building certification schemes  ”. The research investigates the environmental impact of construction transport and the influence of building certification scheme for a construction project on its transport arrangements. The paper is based on a multiple case study of 40 Swedish projects and the results show that construction projects with better environmental ratings generated less emissions from construction transport. However, among the ten projects with highest transport/m2, five were certified. This study contributes to a better understanding of construction transport patterns and reducing environmental harm of these transports. The results of this paper are beneficial for construction site managers, logistics consultants and transport companies, helping them to implement Construction logistics solutions (CLSs) in a more useful way, depending on the phase and type of project. Wang et al. (2021) paper on “Multi-participant construction waste demolition and transportation decision-making system ” present a BIM and cost-optimisation-based decision-making system for construction and demolition waste (C&DW) transportation. The system is capable of coordinating involved C&DW participants and suggest a cost-effective transportation and demolition plan. The model can determine the optimal demolition company, transport company and disposal company through cost analysis, and a demolition plan decision model was developed based on the work efficiency analysis of the selected participants. The decision-making system can also extract material type and volume information about C&DW emissions and emission types from BIM models. The system provides a cost-effective transportation plan and formulates a demolition plan that can avoid the accumulation of C&DW on site based on the decision models. Using a case study approach, the result of the study shows that, the system can realise the information flow of all links in the construction waste management and improve the efficiency of decision-making concerning construction waste. The final paper on the “Contributions of the circular economy to the UN sustainable development goals through sustainable construction ” is by Ogunmakinde et al. (2022). The paper argues that contextualising the Circular Economy (CE) as part of the discourse towards implementing the SDGs is crucial for managing the increasing amounts of waste generated by the construction industry. It provides a framework that establishes a detailed relationship between the SDGs, construction waste management and the circular economy to direct future sustainable development research, policies, and innovations. The study adopted a narrative literature review methodology using Scopus and Web of Science for relevant literature published between 2015 and 2021. The paper argues that an understanding of the SDGs-circular economy linkages in construction waste management is integral to establishing long-term innovative solutions for developing multi-sectorial measures for waste prevention, eco-design, and re-use of materials. These linkages increase competitiveness, stimulate innovation, and boost economic growth. This study proposes that all stakeholders who generate waste should apply new innovative technologies, methods and strategies leading to transdisciplinary and transformative change  6 Conclusion and future research direction The aim of this VSI was to bring together empirical research papers that explore the link between the sustainable development goals, organisational learning, and efficient resource management in construction. The VSI was focusing on topics such Sustainable construction & SDGs, Sustainable supply chain management, the role of business in achieving the SDGs, organisational learning and sustainability, sustainable procurement, construction & demolition waste management, sustainable consumption of materials & resources and construction and the circular economy etc. However, the limitation of VSI is that organisational learning towards the SDGs is still an emerging research area with limited research outputs to attract enough papers for the special issue. At heart of this VSI was the SDGs, and the expectation was that papers to the special issue will demonstrate the link between the topics under investigation and the SDGs. Most of the papers failed to fully present a comprehensive discussion on the theme of this VSI; “The Sustainable Development Goals, Organisational Learning and Efficient Resource Management in Construction”. Future research should explore how organisational learning in the construction industry fosters efficient resource management and contribute to the realisation of the SDGs. Despite the above limitations, this paper highlights the important role of the construction industry in adopting efficient resource management through organisational learning practices by collaborating with government agencies, industry peers and policymakers to integrate the SDGs into long-term business strategies and work towards the realisation of the world we want by 2030.
