               The seventh Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are to provide “Affordable and clean energy” to all by 2030. To achieve this, efforts should be made using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and thermal energy, particularly, in all developing countries to encourage power generation growth and help the environment. Renewable energy is free, abundant, and possesses non-polluting characteristics. Receiving energy from the above alternative energy sources has been around for a long time. In this chapter, the basic requirements and challenges of renewable energy-based power systems along with the role of the off-grid power system in achieving the seventh SDGs are discussed. Examples of several off-grid implementations are presented.

To achieve this, efforts should be made using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and thermal energy, particularly, in all developing countries to encourage power generation growth and help the environment. Renewable energy is free, abundant, and possesses non-polluting characteristics. Receiving energy from the above alternative energy sources has been around for a long time. In this chapter, the basic requirements and challenges of renewable energy-based power systems along with the role of the off-grid power system in achieving the seventh SDGs are discussed. Examples of several off-grid implementations are presented.   Keywords Off-grid power systems  Hybrid renewable energy system  Sustainable development goals  Clean energy   3.1 Introduction According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) 2019 report, global energy consumption will increase by 28% between 2015 and 2040; a large portion of this energy will be provided by fossil fuels. Fossil fuels such as coal and oil contribute significantly to carbon dioxide emissions, global warming, and air pollution. As a part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, governments around the world are engaged to ramp down greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the adverse effect of climate change. One alternative is to shift the generation of energy from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. A sharp decrease in fossil fuels reserve worldwide is also a reason to reduce dependency on these nonrenewable energy resources. Global access to electricity has been steadily rising in recent decades. In 2017, the total number of the population without electricity fell below one billion for the first time in decades. The data show that global access to electricity surpassed 87% in 2016 but still far from meeting the universal access goal by 2030. Thus, off-grid power systems can help meet the energy needs of the population in remote places. In addition, remote systems, such as repeater stations and radio telecommunication stations, depend on the off-grid power systems. Many factors must be carefully analyzed before deciding on a full-phase renewable energy-based off-grid power generation system. The majority of the population without access to electricity live in rural areas. Fig. 3.1   shows the percentage of electricity access in Asia, Africa, and Latin American countries. To provide electricity access in an environmentally sustainable manner to these remote population, the off-grid power system with minigird can be a solution. Access to electricity in the developing countries has improved over the years, and the share of renewable energy in the electricity sector has also increased [1] . Access to reliable and affordable electricity affects the quality of life, access to basic services, and livelihoods [2] . Table 3.1   compares the electricity access and related data for the years 2010 and 2017. Over the past decade, the deployment of off-grid power and minigrid systems has seen huge progress because technology cost has decreased and efficiency increased [2] . However, the systems depend on weather conditions which may hinder stable power supply and therefore the use of multiple renewable energy resources to produce power is required. One of the most challenging tasks of the off-grid power system is to balance the load demand and electrical load anomaly detection. Wang and Ahn [3]  proposed an electrical load anomaly detection framework, which includes a hybrid one-step ahead load predictor (OSA-LP), and a rule-engine-based load anomaly detector (RE-AD) to detect the load of the off-grid solar plant in Ngurdoto, Tanzania. Despite the challenges, according to the 2018 IRENA report [2] , nearly 133 million people in 2016 were served globally by off-grid renewable energy, a sixfold increase from 2011. This is evident from the number of recent publications highlighting the implementation of the off-grid renewable system in various countries and its socioeconomic impacts [4–7] . The attraction toward the off-grid system is also because of the engagement of diverse stakeholders such as local entrepreneurs, international investors, and financial institutions with customized financing models, such as pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and microfinancing [2] . This chapter reviews the background of renewable energy systems and the impact of off-grid systems in providing affordable and clean energy to un-electrified areas and finally discusses the role of the off-grid power system in achieving the seventh objective of the SDGs.  3.2 Types of power systems (based on the connection) A large portion of the global supply of electricity is generated by the fossil-fuel-based power system. However, because of the adverse effect on the environment, restrictions are implied to reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy generation. On the other hand, there is a global trend toward the use of renewable energy-based power systems for expanding, upgrading. and modernizing power systems. The decentralized power generation with renewable energies helps in reducing the dependence on fossil fuels, lower the investment for grid extension, and check various losses incurred during grid extensions. The main challenge in developing a renewable energy-based power system is that the power production fluctuates depending on the availability of energy resources, weather, and climatic conditions. The majority of the household without electricity live in remote and isolated rural areas, mostly in developing countries sparsely scattered over a vast geographic location. Because of economic and technical reasons, the governments often have difficulty in providing electric power to their entire citizen through the centralized grid. The off-grid power system is an alternative to grid extension in rural and isolated areas. 3.2.1 Off-grid or stand-alone power systems The stand-alone power system is also known as an off-the-grid power system that is not fitted with an electricity distribution system and is independent of the electric grid. Some of the popular electrical power generation systems are photovoltaic systems using PV panel, wind turbine, micro-hydro, and diesel or biofuel generator. An energy storage device such as a battery bank is typically implemented in a stand-alone power system which makes the system expensive. Remote and isolated power systems depend entirely on renewable energy systems such as repeater tower stations, radio telecommunication stations, etc. Depending on the resource availability at a particular location, two or more renewable energy sources with complementary characters such as Photovoltaic (PV) and Wind hybrid systems can be used to increase the reliability [8] . Such a system can range from a small home system to a large system that can power a village or an island. A minigrid is an independent distribution grid that operates in isolation from a centralized national grid. Minigrid serves a limited number of consumers with a small-scale electricity generation system. 3.2.1.1 A case of Lama Hotel village in Nepal Lama Hotel village is located at an altitude of 2478 m above sea level and is within the conservation area of Langtang National Park. It is surrounded by high mountains on the east, west, and the north, and it takes 8–10 h of trekking along the Langtang River to reach this place from the nearest motor-able road in Syafrubeshi. It has only seven houses, all in all serving as a temporary staying in for trekkers and a camping site for many dwellers as seen in Fig. 3.2  . For decades, the community of Lama Hotel lived without electricity and their life was centered on sun and firewood. Because of the difficult geographical location, there is a feeble chance of national grid extension to this area. Such is the place for an off-grid power system. A team of volunteers including authors designed 2.2 kW off-grid PV system in 2011 which is serving the villagers and thousands of tourists every year [9] . Fig. 3.3   shows the installed PV system with the battery house.   3.2.2 Grid-tied power systems On-grid or grid-tied systems allow the excess electricity generated by the system to be added onto the national-grid instead of storing it in batteries. Batteries are inefficient in storing energy and often degrades with time. Grid-tie inverter (GTI) is used in this type of power system to synchronize the phase and frequency of the current to fit the utility grid (50 Hz or 60 Hz). The output voltage is adjusted in such a way that the excess electricity flows outward to the grid. In the case of insufficient electricity production, electricity can be drawn in from the grid. Consumers only need to pay for what they consume after deducting the power they put into the grid. This scheme is called net-metering. Net metering is a national policy to promote private investment in renewable energy-based power production. Net metering uses a bidirectional energy meter (or net meter) which can measure incoming and outgoing current. The other scheme is called Net Billing where prosumers (producers + consumers of electricity) are charged/compensated based on the actual market value of electricity taking into consideration of what they consume against what they supply into the grid. 3.2.2.1 A case of New South Wales, Australia Most of the houses in Australia are connected to the electricity grid that is powered by large power plants using fossil fuels such as coal. Australian government's plan to tackle climate change and harness clean energy from the abundant solar renewable energy introduced solar home programs. That is why the majority of newly built Australian houses have solar panels on their roof and are grid connected without the need for the batteries. The house owners are attracted by the Australian Government subsidy scheme. According to the scheme up to Australian Dollar (AUD) 5000 or 60% rebate is provided by the Australian Government for grid-tied solar power systems. Majority of houses have 5kw - 10 kW PV installation. For example, the cost of 6.5 kW PV system installation is around AUD 7000, of which 60% is refunded as rebate by government needing only about AUD 3000 by the house owner. Fig. 3.4   shows a typical house with a grid-tied PV system in New South Wales, Australia.   3.2.3 Hybrid power systems Hybrid power systems combine the best of grid-tied and off-grid power systems. Hybrid power systems are less expensive than off-grid power systems because this eliminates the necessity of large battery storage capacity; however, it is expensive than the grid-tied power systems. Although the grid-tied system can generate power during the outage, the inverter will be shut off and the power produced can neither be sent to the grid nor be used by household because of inverter's anti-islanding protection safety function. The anti-islanding protection feature is an inverter function that senses the problem with power grid, such as power outage, and shuts itself to stop feeding power to the electric grid. The feature assumes that the workers are diapatched for fixing outage; thus, there should be no electricity flow in the grid for the workers’ safety. Unlike the grid-connected system, hybrid power system comprising battery backup can secure power even during grid outages. Hybrid power systems with energy storage can isolate from the grid (called islanding) and can supply power during blackout also. Fig. 3.5   shows the schematics of various types of the renewable energy-based power generation system. 3.2.3.1 Case study of California, United States Currently, in the USA, 37 states and Washington, DC offer net metering. Net metering offers the distributed energy producer to put excess power in the electric grid to be used by other consumers. The energy meter can rotate in both directions when the power is sent onto the grid, the meter “spins” backward and vice versa. Thus, net-metering means the total electricity used by consumer at the end of the month after deducting the power put to the grid from the power consumed from the grid. Modified version of net-metering is called “energy storage net energy metering” and is colloquially called “NEM-paired storage” which has battery storage. NEM-paired storage was codified into law in California in February of 2019 permitting customers to receive credits for stored solar energy sent back to the grid. [10]  California has lower rates for solar energy sent to the grid in the midday while it is higher in the evening. Therefore, grid-tied system (without battery storage) can only receive reduced payback who can export during the day. Contrary to that, hybrid power systems with energy storage can store midday generation and sell it to the grid at the peak time (in the evening). This can have a double benefit: first, it addresses the challenge of “duck curve,” and second, the distributed generator makes more money for the same energy pumped to the grid.    3.3 Off-grid power systems based on renewable energies The three end-uses of renewable energy are electricity, heat, and transport. The use of renewables for electricity has grown fastest, because of the rapid expansion of wind, solar, and hydropower technologies. As of 2016, the share of renewables in electricity generation was 24% [11] . Hydro, wind, and solar energy are the top renewable energy sources in terms of globally installed capacity. Because of the periodic nature of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, often hybrid renewable energy sources (HRES) are employed for better reliability and the need for smaller energy storage devices. Commercially viable off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems for electricity generation include PV-battery, PV-diesel, wind-battery, wind-diesel, PV-wind-battery, and PV-wind-diesel-battery systems. Bhandari et al. [12]  built the first off-grid hybrid power system comprised of solar photovoltaic, wind, and hydro energy sources in the remote mountainous village in Nepal. Development of off-grid renewables for other productive uses such as cooking, heating is also possible but it is beyond the scope of the present review. According to the IRENA report, the total off-grid capacity in 2017 was 6.6 GW. Solar PV contributes to the majority of use in commercial and residential use while bioenergy has maximum share in industrial use. The detailed end-uses of off-grid renewable power are shown in Table 3.2  . 3.3.1 Solar power system The solar power system or a PV power system converts sunlight directly into electricity. The power output of a PV array is based on solar irradiance and ambient temperature and is calculated as [13] (3.1) P pv  = η pvg  ⋅ A pvg  ⋅ G t  ,    where η pvg   is PV generation efficiency, A pvg   is PV generator area (m2 ), and G t   is solar irradiation in tilted module plane (W/m2 ). Fig. 3.6  . shows the voltage and current characteristics for various irradiation levels. In 2016, more than 124 million people accessed lighting and other electrical services in Africa using solar lights and solar home systems. In Asia, more than 70 million people benefited from solar light and solar home systems in the same year. Bangladesh alone deployed 4.1 million solar systems in 2017 to provide electricity to more than 18 million people in 2017.  3.3.2 Wind power system The wind turbine is designed to produce power at a wide range of wind speeds. Location plays an important role in the performance and efficiency of a wind turbine. The governing equation for calculating the mechanical power of the wind turbine is given by(3.2) P w  = 1 2  C p  λ β  ρ AV 3     where ρ  is air density (kg/m3 ), C p   is the power coefficient, A  is intercepting area of the rotor blades (m2 ), V  is average wind speed (m/s), and λ  is tip speed ratio. The theoretical maximum value of the power coefficient C p   is 0.593, known as Betz's coefficient [14] . Fig. 3.7   shows the wind turbine power curve for a range of wind velocity.  3.3.3 Hydropower system Modern-day hydro turbines originated from ancient water wheels. Hydropower provides about 20% of all electricity worldwide. The mechanical power generated by the turbine is given by(3.3) P = η total  ρgQH    where P  is mechanical power output produced at the turbine, η total   is hydraulic efficiency of the turbine, ρ  is the density of water (1000 kg/m3 ), g  is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2 ), and H  is effective pressure head (m). More than 6.4 million people were served by hydropower-based minigrid in 2016 as reported by IRENA. In Nepal alone, the installed capacity of off-grid micro-hydro is 50 MW from over 2500 systems in 2017 [2] .   3.4 Role of off-grid power systems in attaining sustainable development goals All United Nations (UN) member states in 2015 adopted 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) for peace and prosperity for people and the planet to attain by the year 2030 [15] . SDGs are intertwined together, that is, one goal contributes to achieving other goals. 7th SDG is to ensure global access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This highlights the importance of energy that contributes to other goals such as ending poverty and improving health, and to the development of education and gender equality. To achieve the goal by 2030, the current pace of electricity expansion must be accelerated. It is estimated that rural electrification using the off-grid systems will supply nearly 60% of the additional generation needed to achieve universal electricity access [16] . Easy access to electricity will stimulate economic and social development and will lead to an improvement in the quality of life by helping reduce extreme poverty and providing universal primary education. Bhandari et al. [4]  reported on the impact of the off-grid power system in the remote mountainous village in Nepal. The impact of electrification was measured on the household's lighting usage, education, social structure, environment, income, and level of satisfaction. Since 2010, 80% of the 800 million people in Asia gained access to electricity. According to the World Bank report [17] , Afghanistan, Nepal, and Bhutan are the three countries with the greatest increase in national electricity access rates from 2006 to 2016 where off-grid renewables have played a pivotal role in electrifying rural remote areas. The African continent has sharply increased the deployment of off-grid renewable energy in recent years too, and the population served by such systems grew rapidly from just over 2 million people in 2011 to over 53 million in 2016 [2] . However, African countries have uneven access to electricity, and the study suggests about 600 million people are still without access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa [18] . Accelerating off-grid installations toward achieving the SDGs requires collaborative actions across multiple elements such as financing models, policies and regulations, technology, institutional frameworks, capacity building, and cross-sector linkages [19]  as shown in Fig. 3.8  . Off-grid renewable energy supports basic services, such as health, water, education, and livelihoods through productive end-uses. For larger population coverage, power from the off-grid systems can be integrated into a single distribution grid known as minigrid that is independent of a national grid. These minigrids are considered to be the most economical long-term solution for electricity access as they are flexible in terms of sizing and resource utilization. Off-grid and minigrid solutions powered by renewables already provide electricity to nearly 90 million people [20]  which is evident that the off-grid power system has a bigger role to play in meeting SDGs objectives.  3.5 Conclusions As of 2019, globally 840 million people are without access to electricity, the majority are concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although a significant portion of those will have access to reliable electricity by 2030, SDC 7 is likely to be reached partially with the current trend. It has been projected that around 650 million people are likely to remain without access to electricity by 2030 [9] . A large majority of such people will be in Sub-Saharan Africa. The off-grid power system can play a significant role in providing reliable electricity without adverse environmental impact to the vast population living far from the national grid reach contributing to sustainability. The various options reviewed here offer opportunities to reach the 7th objective of SDGs.
