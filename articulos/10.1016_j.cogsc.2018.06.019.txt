                  Sustainable innovation is a key-objective for our Group that has recently integrated the principles of sustainable development into all stages of a product's life cycle, from its design to consumer use. The following ambitious commitment: 100% of its products should bring an environmental (or social benefit) by 2020, will be reached, in particular, by integrating and giving a constant privilege to renewable raw materials -or ingredients-that originate from sustainable resources that fully comply with the green chemistry rules. In this short review, integration of Green Chemistry principles by our Group, strategies to identify new performing ingredients through sustainable chemistry as well as illustrative examples of innovative raw materials will be presented. With regard to the crucial respect of the environment of our planet, sustainable chemistry has become an indispensable turning point for industrial groups highly devoted to innovation.

Introduction Sustainable innovation [1]  is a key-objective for our Group that has recently integrated the principles of sustainable development into all stages of a product's life cycle, from its design to consumer use. This fundamental goal, is a strict commitment to the support of the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact [2] . The latter strongly considers Green Chemistry as a paramount approach to improve the management of man-made chemicals. Hence, this thrusts us to explore new opportunities for innovation. It is indeed, for our group, an ambitious commitment: 100% of its products should bring an environmental (or social) benefit by 2020. This objective will be reached, in particular, by integrating and giving a constant privilege to renewable raw materials -or ingredients-that originate from sustainable resources that fully comply with the green chemistry rules. Chemistry, today, faces a huge challenge. “Green” chemists need to find renewable starting materials to develop new ingredients that, when formulated, should strictly fulfill the consumer needs and regulatory constraints. Sustainable chemistry is neither a tool nor a constraint. It is in fact a scientific “spur” to chemists, a true intellectual challenge and a strong commitment, from industrial companies, towards a greener planet via sustainable innovation. Our group of research considers a renewable raw material as a material that is sustainably sourced, i.e. traceable from known origin(s) and when its cultivation and harvesting activities are strictly assessed and managed, according to the following imperative 5 pillars:• To ensure decent and safe work for farmers and harvesters  • To guarantee equality between workers in the fields and areas of collection  • To promote economic empowerment through fair commercial relationships and provide economic feedback for farmers and harvesters  • To preserve the natural biodiversity by promoting sustainable agricultural and collection practices that do not threat ecosystem services, notably those linked to soil, water and forests.  • To take action against climate change to anticipate its impact on crops and to mitigate the emissions linked to agricultural practices.    The development of the principles of green chemistry, initially proposed by P.T. Anastas and J.C. Warner [3]  have been integrated by the Group since more than 10 years ago [4] . They are grounded on the full respect of 3 imperata :• Use of renewable raw materials [5] .  • Development of eco-respectful processes [6,7] , including enzymatic catalysis and fermentation processes.  • Innovation based on ingredients that present a favorable impact on the environment [8] .    These 3 conditions are inseparable. For example, adopting the development of eco-respectful processes alone, although necessary, is not sufficient for a full respect of the principles of green chemistry. As previously mentioned, our objective is to constantly increase the volume of renewable ingredients with regard to our numerous marketed formulae/products. Accordingly, transforming these ingredients firmly implies the use of synthetic processes that bring the smallest environmental impact. By chance, Mother Nature provides us a variety of sources as sustainable starting materials in view of a functional transformation. Chemistry, as mature science, has already provided a rich toolbox supplied with a high number of very efficient chemical transformations that can comply with green chemistry principles. Some highly efficient strategies were developed to identify new performance ingredients for our industry, through sustainable chemistry, aiming at operating beyond green chemistry rules:- In silico  tools to better predict human and environmental safety profiles of molecules  - In silico  tools to better design “cosmeto-friendly” molecules  - Using sustainable co-products to valorize useless wastes from other industries.  - Use of new methodologies and processes for a cost effective industrial production    From raw material design to finished good 1. Molecular design: In Silico  approaches to support the straightforward design towards human and environmental safety    R&I teams of our group have implemented in silico  methods for predicting human and environmental safety of defined chemical structures, allowing a proper upstream screening of the synthetic programs to exclude “bad guys”. More recently, these teams went one step further with a specific approach, not only using computational methods as a filtering tool, but as a key driver of an innovative eco-design strategy [9] . Hence, through a process of fragmentation, functionalization, and recombination of 274 marketed molecules approved for cosmetic usage, an in-house  virtual library of 92,000 compounds with putative skin benefits profile was customized. Virtual screening of this library, using a fragment-based cosmetophore [10]  approach, followed by a short and oriented hit-to-lead process, led to the discovery of new candidate ingredients with suitable properties vis à vis  skin applications.2. Biomass co-product valorization: Examples of Quinoa husk extract and lipophilic salicylic acid derivative from cashew nut shell liquid.    The use of natural plant extracts as cosmetic ingredients is not recent. It has not only existed for along time but has increased during the last three decades [11,12] . Among these, extracts from plants by-products have been gaining interest, as they do not compete/interfere with food applications and help to preserve natural resources. The husk of the quinoa, rich in saponins (Chenopodium Quinoa Willd.) represents 8% of the plant but is usually considered as a waste. The husk is being removed from the grain before quinoa is used as a food product. Based on the reported beneficial properties of quinoa seeds and in particular the high saponin content of its husks, an industrial extraction of quinoa husk was developed. Such extract was proven as a safe and soft exfoliating ingredient in skin care products, following many in vitro  and in vivo  evaluations. Furthermore, it was found to be easily biodegradable. Throughout the process development, from laboratory extraction procedure to industrial manufacturing, our attention focused on the reduction of the environmental impact at different levels: i) a partnership with Bolivian farmers was established for sourcing the husk to ensure its sustainability; ii) the extraction solvent used was a mixture of food grade ethanol and water integrating ethanol recycling; iii) the waste volume was minimized to reduce the environmental impact; iv) a high extraction yield was obtained by optimizing the temperature/duration of the extraction and vi) the solid/liquid separation, the clarification and the solvent evaporation processes were performed with low energy consumption technologies. To assess the ecological footprint and the performance of the extraction process from an environmental point of view, a unique system, the “EcoFootprint” [6] , was used during the industrialisation. Such tools allow the monitoring of continuous improvement and provide a technical and social overview of the benefit. Lipophilic salicylic acid derivative A  (Figure 1  ) is another new ingredient developed from a renewable feedstock through a green process. Its chemical structure is similar to that of LHA (Lipohydroxyacid), a well-known active ingredient used in various cosmetic applications [13]  (anti-aging, acne-prone skin [14] , exfoliating products). A natural source of such lipophilic salicylic acid was investigated and the cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) was identified as a natural, abundant source of these acids. This agricultural by-product of the cashew industry is known for exerting antimicrobial properties that protect the nut from invasion by microorganisms [15] . From the raw CNSL, an environmentally sustainable process was developed to obtain the targeted compound A . Optimization allowed the jump from successive unitary operational process to a one-pot process that comprises two unitary operations, with a decrease of the E-factor by 70% and a clear decrease of the production cost. In vitro,  Compound A  showed smoothing out properties on the skin surface as well as potential anti-aging properties through reinforcing the skin barrier function, the dermal extra-cellular matrix and the dermal epidermal junction (DEJ) [16] . A -based products have been recently successfully marketed.3. New methodologies and processes for cost effective production    Using green chemistry principles, various methodologies were used to produce new ingredients from chemically efficient reactions as well as combination of chemically and enzymatically driven transformations.a. Metathesis reaction to access new ingredients from biomass    In our quest for high performance anti-oxidant ingredients, the potential of polyhydroxystilbenes was explored, as structural analogues of a well-known anti-oxidant, namely resveratrol (compound B ). Accordingly, specific cross-metathesis conditions were developed to assemble a diversity of renewable aromatic moieties generating symmetrical or non-symmetrical polyhydroxystilbenes [7] . As shown in Scheme 1  , using β-methylstyrene C  (isoeugenol) as the starting material, product D  could be isolated in 81% on multi-gram scale, under solvent-free conditions and using a minute amount of Grubbs II catalyst. This green molecule is still under evaluation for skin anti-aging applications.b. Combination of Biotech and chemistry processes: example of carboxyresveratrol    Other original polyhydroxystilbenes were obtained from resveratrol B , resveratrol derivative E  resulting from hydrogenation of B  and oxyresveratrol F  by implementing the biocatalysis for the ortho -carboxylation of their phenol moieties [17]  (Figure 2  ), using potassium hydrogenocarbonate (KHCO3 ) as a CO2  surrogate and avoiding harsh conditions, such as those typically used in the Kolbe-Schmitt chemical procedure. Although compounds B , E , F  are challenging substrates for this biocatalytic transformation due to steric hindrance and potential regio-selectivity issues, three previously reported decarboxylases (2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Aspergillus oryzae , 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase from Rhizobium  sp. and salicylic acid decarboxylase from Trichosporon moniliiforme ) [18]  generated the corresponding products G , H  and I  with moderate to excellent yields and an almost perfect region-selectivity. As an illustration of the synthetic utility of this bio-carboxylation methodology, the carboxylated product G  was isolated with a 95% yield, as a single regio-isomer after a preliminary optimization of the reaction parameters, including co-solvent selection, catalyst loading, substrate and KHCO3  concentration and reaction time.4. Example of a new methodology that led to the industrialization of a “green” molecule for the cosmetic market    C-glycosylation is a reaction of choice to innovate in sustainable chemistry. A class of new C-glycosides was identified by l’Oréal scientists as efficient molecules. These stimulate the biosynthesis of GAGs (Glycosaminoglycans) and PGs (Proteoglycans) by skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. These syntheses contribute to largely improve or maintain the skin mechanical properties, which are compromised by the aging or photoaging processes. This discovery opened the door to a brand new class of anti-ageing molecules, which could then act on the synthesis of GAG's and PG's. Several methods are commonly used to synthesize C-glycosides. However, most of these C C linking reactions are burdened by the need for prior setting up of protective groups on each functional group of the carbohydrate. From the initial works by Lubineau [19] , a new method was successfully developed for the industrial production of C-glycosides using sustainable natural sugars as starting materials (Scheme 2  ). The scope and limitations of the Lubineau reaction was explored to optimize a powerful method to synthesize C-glycosides using environmentally friendly conditions relevant to ‘Green-Chemistry’ principles. To allow further structure-activity relationships studies, to enhance the structural diversity of this new class of C-glycosides, the reduction of the keto C-glycosides was given privilege. The full respect of the principles of green chemistry suggested the development of a catalytic hydrogenation. Accordingly, Ru/C was used as a catalyst as described in Scheme 2  on a model reaction based on the reduction of the keto C-xylose. The latter then confirmed that the reduced C-xyloside J  is a 50/50 diastereo-isomer mixture [20] . The different C-glycosides were evaluated as potential activators of the biosynthesis of GAG's using human fibroblast cultures. The C-xyloside J , later called Pro-XylaneTM  was identified as an efficient activator of the biosynthesis of GAGs, in vitro [21] . Its activity was further confirmed in vivo  in a clinical trial when topically applied in the skin anti-aging strategy. Many Proxylane™ based-products were marketed in 2006, and are still highly appreciated by consumers. The approach based upon bio-mimicking and green chemistry led us to identify a new active ingredient for skin anti-ageing [22] . This active ingredient respects the green chemistry principles including:• Sustainable origin of d -xylose from beech trees originating from renewable forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.  • A two-step process in water using Lubineau's C-glycosylation and a catalytic hydrogenation with an optimized E-factor of 5,3 [6] , zero step with extreme conditions (<-15 °C or >150 °C or >10 h), an atom economy over 75%.  • Low environmental impact of Pro-XylaneTM  since it is non-ecotoxic.      Conclusion The examples presented here illustrate both the will and the ability of our Research & Innovation group to support and develop a sustainable innovation. The latter aims at offering new cosmetic ingredients, the genesis of which strictly follows the rules of Green Chemistry. Current research programs actively follow these approaches, as long-term objectives, i.e. by no way a fashion-trend. This innovative chemistry in fact obeys or follows the ambition of the founding father of the L’Oréal group (circa 1905), Eugène Schueller (deceased in 1957), a creative chemist, highly devoted to innovation. With regard to the crucial respect of the environment of our planet, sustainable chemistry is an indispensable turning point, that has become a “DNA” of our Group and its scientists.
