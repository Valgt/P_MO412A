                  Biofuels are expected to play a pivotal role in developing economies' transition towards net-zero emissions. However, their promotion can cause multifaceted sustainability concerns. National biofuel policies often align with the optimistic discourse surrounding biofuels but may lack comprehensive measures to simultaneously address all sustainability risks. This study conducts a systematic review to evaluate the sustainability performance of biofuels and examines their implications for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A total of 12 sustainability indicators were identified as economic, social, and environmental priorities. Biofuel linkages with 8 SDGs, 21 targets, and 22 indicators were mapped. The analysis revealed a wider coverage of sustainability impacts associated with biodiesel compared to ethanol feedstocks for India. Notably, the sustainability effects of biofuels exhibited considerable variability across different spatial scales. Irrespective of the biofuel types, negative sustainability outcomes were found to be associated with socio-economic indicators related to food security, livelihood, and income, and environmental indicators like land use. Positive sustainability effects were observed for environmental indicators like water and soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. The study identifies policy gaps in addressing localized adverse effects of biofuels, emphasizing the need to align biofuel strategies with SDGs for more comprehensive and sustainable biofuel development in developing countries.

A systematic review Prantika Das ∗   Chandan Kumar Jha  Satyam Saxena  Ranjan Kumar Ghosh  Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, India Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad India  Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, India  ∗ Corresponding author.      Biofuels are expected to play a pivotal role in developing economies' transition towards net-zero emissions. However, their promotion can cause multifaceted sustainability concerns. National biofuel policies often align with the optimistic discourse surrounding biofuels but may lack comprehensive measures to simultaneously address all sustainability risks. This study conducts a systematic review to evaluate the sustainability performance of biofuels and examines their implications for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A total of 12 sustainability indicators were identified as economic, social, and environmental priorities. Biofuel linkages with 8 SDGs, 21 targets, and 22 indicators were mapped. The analysis revealed a wider coverage of sustainability impacts associated with biodiesel compared to ethanol feedstocks for India. Notably, the sustainability effects of biofuels exhibited considerable variability across different spatial scales. Irrespective of the biofuel types, negative sustainability outcomes were found to be associated with socio-economic indicators related to food security, livelihood, and income, and environmental indicators like land use. Positive sustainability effects were observed for environmental indicators like water and soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. The study identifies policy gaps in addressing localized adverse effects of biofuels, emphasizing the need to align biofuel strategies with SDGs for more comprehensive and sustainable biofuel development in developing countries.

Worldwide, countries have integrated biofuels into their energy strategies and climate plans, including India, which as part of its commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement has recognized the pivotal role of biofuels [3 ,4 ]. India initiated its biofuel program in 2009 with the implementation of the National Policy on Biofuels (NPB), mandating a 20 % blending of ethanol and biodiesel [5 ]. However, despite dedicated policies aimed at promoting biofuels, both production and consumption have fallen short of initial expectations, primarily due to feedstock shortages [6 ]. As of 2022, India achieved only 9.3 % ethanol blend and 0.07 % biodiesel blend [7 ]. To overcome these shortcomings, India revisited its policy in 2018, diversifying feedstock options, including second-generation feedstocks, in its pursuit of meeting the biofuel mandate by 2030 [8 ]. While India, and several countries of the global south such as China, have made steady strides towards their ambitious biofuel targets, the sustainability of biofuels has come under increasing scrutiny since the past decade. Recent empirical research has highlighted several risks associated with biofuels, giving rise to concerns regarding their sustainability. Notably, the expansion of crop-based biofuels has led to spikes in food prices resulting in food security vulnerabilities [9–11 ]. Furthermore, concerns have been raised over land use transformations and deforestation, amplifying the contentious ‘food vs. fuel’ discourse, which centres around the conversion of arable land for biofuel at the cost of food production [12–14 ]. Other land-related issues, including land grabbing, loss of biodiversity, and the adverse impacts on water and soil, have also been pointed out [15–17 ]. These potential adverse biofuel impacts can undermine the balance between multiple sustainability goals like, the SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SGG 15 (Life on Land) simultaneously [18 ]. Concerns have also been raised over their GHG mitigation potential [19 ,20 ] and the socio-economic benefits that biofuel aims to achieve, such as rural development, employment generation, and poverty alleviation [21 ,22 ]. These effects further complicate achieving goals like SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Most of these risks, such as food insecurity, trade-offs in livelihood, biodiversity loss, land use alterations, and land tenure disputes, often remain inadequately addressed in policy decisions, largely due to misguided expectations embedded within policies [23 ]. The production system for biofuels is intricate, frequently involving inter dependencies and trade-offs with other sustainability objectives that are not fully considered in policy formulation. Consequently, biofuel policies often downplay these risks, relying on uncertain presumptions of biofuel sustainability and potentially incorporating insufficient measures to manage all unsustainability risks. Literature provides evidence of specific biofuel impacts. For instance, Ahmed et al. uncovered significant adverse impacts of bioenergy on food security parameters, irrespective of feedstock edibility [24 ]. Robledo‐Abad et al. identified a scarcity of robust scientific evidence on the sustainable development impacts of biofuels, with the existing research primarily focussed on developed nations particularly emphasizing environmental and economic outcomes [25 ]. Götz et al. examined biofuel policies in relation to associated risks including food security, land rights and conflicts, and biodiversity, revealing ineffective policy mechanisms for large-scale sustainable biofuel development [26 ]. German et al. evaluated socio-economic impacts of biofuels, unearthing substantial trade-offs with policy objectives [23 ]. Furthermore, Vera et al. emphasized the interplay between SDGs and biofuels, highlighting both synergies and trade-offs [18 ]. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive sustainability evaluation considering a broad range of indicators encompassing economic, environmental, and social dimensions. This study addresses this gap by using the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) sustainability indicators to analyze the sustainability implications of biofuels within the context of India. To achieve this, an extensive literature review is conducted, synthesizing evidence and critically assessing its relevance to India's progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study presents a comprehensive exploration of sustainability indicators, emphasizing the intricate interplay between biofuels and sustainable development especially, in developing country context. As the Asian countries are expected to drive future growth in biofuels demand and supply, with India and China leading the growth trajectory, this study contributes towards a nuanced understanding of the synergies and trade-offs across multitude of sustainability goals. The next section outlines the methodology used for reviewing the policy documents and literature. Section 3  describes the key characteristics of the selected studies. Section 4  presents a comprehensive review of the sustainability effects for all identified indicators followed by the implications for achieving SDGs. The study concludes with interpretation of key findings for policy implications, and future research prospects.  2 Materials and methods The study employed a rigorous two-step process. The first step involved identifying a diverse set of indicators based on the sustainability criteria established by the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) [27,28 ]. These indicators were used to evaluate the sustainability of biofuel production and use on all spatial scales encompassing the three sustainability pillars i.e., economic, social, and environmental. After conducting an in-depth content analysis of India's biofuel policy documents [5 ,8 ], 12 key indicators closely aligning with the GBEP criteria were identified (as outlined in Table 1  ). These indicators serve as the primary policy objectives guiding India's efforts in biofuel development. In the second step, a systematic review of existing literature was conducted to evaluate the performance of biofuels across the three dimensions, using the indicators identified in the previous step. 2.1 Search strategy The study followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [29 ] for the systematic literature review. An extensive search was conducted with the help of two electronic databases, i.e., Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) employing various search term combinations to compile a database. Boolean operators ‘and’ and ‘or’ were used to connect the search keywords ‘biofuels’; ‘India’ and a third keyword determining the sustainability impacts of biofuels research, including keywords like ‘sustainability’; ‘impacts’; ‘effects’.  2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Initially, a total of 9844 articles were identified through a comprehensive search of the Scopus and WOS databases, comprising 1249 and 8572 articles, respectively. After eliminating 521 duplicate articles, 9323 articles remained for screening. Full text screening was conducted for 308 studies to determine their eligibility based on the predefined inclusion criteria outlined in Table 2  . The rigorous screening process culminated in the selection of 89 studies from which qualitative data was extracted (see Fig. 1  ).  2.3 Qualitative data extraction and analysis The extracted information encompassed various aspects, including publication details, author-provided keywords, biofuel types, feedstock sources, production technologies, spatial scope, study methodologies, data type, research objectives, and the impact of biofuels on sustainability indicators. The selected studies were categorized according to the type of liquid biofuel they focused on, namely ethanol, biodiesel, both ethanol and biodiesel, and ethanol originating from other countries (referred to as ‘ethanol-OC’). The ‘ethanol-OC’ category specifically addressed studies evaluating the influence of foreign biofuel policies on India. Furthermore, studies were grouped based on their primary feedstock type (such as sugarcane, jatropha, etc.) and production technology employed (first, second, and third generation). The spatial scope of the studies was also classified as regional, national, or multi-country, with the latter encompassing research evaluating the impact of biofuels across multiple countries, including India. Additionally, studies were differentiated based on their research approach (qualitative or quantitative) and the type of data sources (primary or secondary) used in their evaluations. To streamline the classification further, articles were sorted based on their primary research objectives, which included assessing biofuel impacts, gauging the potential and feasibility of biofuels, identifying drivers, barriers, and constraints in biofuel development, and exploring perspectives on biofuels. Upon review, the summary outcomes concerning sustainability impacts were extracted from articles that conducted impact evaluations. Any inconsistencies in identifying the overall effects were addressed through consultations with other contributing authors. Subsequently, these summary effects were organized according to sustainability indicators across all three dimensions of sustainability. To account for studies that evaluated multiple sustainability indicators, an additional category of ‘multiple effects' was introduced. Furthermore, to synthesize the research findings effectively, sustainability effects were categorized into four types: 1) positive, 2) negative, 3) both positive and negative, and 4) no discernible impact. Recognizing the multidimensional nature of biofuel impacts across various scales, feedstock types, and sustainability aspects, an effort was made to explore the intricate relationships among the qualitative attributes present in the reviewed articles. However, the scope of the review presented here is only limited to the Indian case which provides an extensive context for biofuel development in large developing country context.   3 Key characteristics of the reviewed studies In terms of spatial scope , out of 89 studies, 47 (53 %) articles evaluated biofuels at the national scale, while 33 (37 %) had a regional coverage, and nine (10 %) carried multi-country evaluation of biofuels (see Fig. 2  ). With respect to evaluated biofuel types, 44 studies (49 %) were solely focused on biodiesel, while 19 (21 %) exclusively examined bioethanol (Fig. 3  ). 25 (28 %) studies covered both ethanol and biodiesel and only one study evaluated the effects of other country biofuel policy on India. When considering research on feedstock diversity, jatropha has been the subject of the largest number of independent studies, totalling 27, followed by sugarcane with eight studies. Approximately 20 studies did not specify any specific feedstock. To further explore the diversity of feedstocks for both biofuel types, the intention was to identify the range of feedstocks considered, as depicted in Fig. 4  . The review indicates that a total of 10 different ethanol and seven biodiesel feedstock types were evaluated. For ethanol feedstocks, sugarcane emerges as the most extensively researched, with 17 mentions, followed by sorghum (6), crop and forest residues (5), molasses (4), pearl millet (3), bamboo (2), and others, such as switchgrass, miscanthus, sugar beet, and maize, each mentioned once. In terms of biodiesel feedstocks, jatropha garnered the highest research attention with 34 mentions, followed by other non-edible oilseeds including and excluding jatropha, with nine and three mentions respectively. Additional biodiesel feedstocks under research include waste cooking oil (WCO) (2), palm oil (1), pongamia pinnata (1), and micro-algae (1). As the challenges faced by the biofuels sector in India are often attributed to feedstock scarcity and limited diversification options, an assessment was conducted to gauge the progress in researching alternate biofuel feedstocks over the years. Fig. 5   illustrates that jatropha and sugarcane have consistently remained the primary focus of biofuel feedstocks in India from 2008 to 2021. Research on other non-edible oilseeds, excluding jatropha has seen increased attention since 2015. The exploration of cellulosic biomass as a feedstock gained momentum around 2017, coinciding with the introduction of the new biofuel policy, which emphasized the utilization of crop residues. In the past few years (starting from 2015 onwards) research efforts have also concentrated on alternative ethanol feedstocks, such as sorghum, bamboo, pearl millet, and sugar beet. In the biodiesel feedstock category, consideration has been given to waste cooking oil, pongamia, micro-algae, and palm oil. Further classifying the articles based on their study objectives and scope, as depicted in Fig. 6  , 36 out of 89 articles were primarily focused on assessing the impacts of biofuels, while 25 offered a broad overview on biofuels in India. Of the 20 articles that assessed the potential or feasibility of biofuels, only six reported outcomes related to the sustainability impacts of biofuels. Additionally, among the 15 articles that evaluated the drivers or barriers of biofuel production, only one reported sustainability effects. Fig. 7   presents the distribution of articles categorized by study and data types. Among the 41 quantitative studies, 56 % are based on primary data, while 44 % rely on secondary data analysis. In the case of the 48 qualitative articles, 19 % used primary data, 10 % used secondary data, and 71 % did not involve data evaluation. Of the 36 articles evaluating the effects of biofuels, 39 % assessed multiple sustainability pillars, while 31 % focused on social aspects, 8 % on economic indicators, and 22 % on environmental impacts (see Fig. 8  ). Table 3   provides a complete mapping of the impacts and sustainability indicators for all 36 studies.  4 Synthesizing the evidence: do biofuels in India deliver sustainability promises? To determine if biofuel performance in India aligns with sustainability expectations, it is important to analyze the connections between various sustainability impacts across diverse dimensions and indicators. Additionally, it is essential to meticulously delineate the salient characteristics of studies evaluating biofuel technologies, typologies, feedstocks, spatial scales, and data methodologies. To facilitate this analysis, an alluvial diagram (refer to Fig. 9  ) is utilized as a visual tool for elucidating the interrelationships among the 36 articles, which are categorized based on distinct typologies within each qualitative attribute. When interpreting the diagram from right to left, it effectively illustrates the intricate interplay of impact typologies (including positive, negative, both positive and negative, and no impact) with the various qualitative attributes underpinning the reviewed studies (see Figure 9 ). For instance, concerning economic sustainability, the findings suggest that articles delineating positive energy security impacts at the national level (depicted in purple) are intrinsically linked to both ethanol and biodiesel derived from mixed feedstocks. In terms of social sustainability, a predominant trend emerges wherein most articles, evaluating food security at the regional level using primary data, indicate negative effects (illustrated in green). This trend is particularly pronounced in the context of second-generation biodiesel sourced from jatropha feedstock. Moreover, at the regional level, articles investigating the consequences of jatropha biodiesel indicate adverse effects not only across various social indicators (such as food security, income, and employment) but also across multiple sustainability pillars. Additionally, investigations focusing on primary data assessments of ethanol sourced from coarse cereals like sorghum and pearl millet, conducted at the regional level, indicate predominantly negative effects on food security. Conversely, at the national scale, articles relying on secondary data to evaluate ethanol sourced from sugarcane and other sugar-based feedstocks (such as molasses) tend to suggest the absence of significant food security effects. At the regional level, studies assessing biodiversity, ecosystem services, and GHG mitigation potential demonstrate favourable outcomes, indicated by the violet streams. In contrast, research addressing LULUC impacts reveals negative implications concerning regional level jatropha biodiesel production. Some of the adverse effects related to LULUC are attributed to studies investigating first-generation ethanol production from sugarcane at the national scale. Studies examining biodiesel production from jatropha and non-edible oilseeds, including and excluding jatropha, report positive effects (indicated in violet) on multiple sustainability indicators and pillars, encompassing aspects such as GHG emissions, income generation, and energy security, across all spatial scales. While both positive and negative effects (indicated in pink) on food security, and multiple sustainability indicators is evident across diverse biofuel feedstocks and technologies, the actual effects vary based on the spatial scale and the specific feedstock under consideration. Of particular interest is the nuanced analysis of multi-country biofuel policies, revealing a juxtaposition of both positive and negative impacts (depicted in pink). These effects are notably associated with food security and livelihood and income dynamics, particularly in the context of India's sugarcane-based ethanol, and concurrently, the implications of other countries' ethanol policies involving corn. This effect type is also found to be associated with multiple indicators and pillars for studies conducting evaluation at national scale. Further, studies evaluating jatropha biodiesel at regional scale also suggest both positive and negative effects associated with multiple indicators. In essence, these findings underscore the intricate and multifaceted nature of sustainability impacts within the biofuel domain. They demonstrate that sustainability outcomes are not unidimensional but rather exhibit complexity, influencing various indicators within and across the three core pillars of sustainability. 4.1 Economic sustainability 4.1.1 Energy security Biofuels offer significant economic benefits such as enhancing energy security by replacing fossil fuels and diversifying the renewable energy mix. Long-term forecast-based studies, at the national scale, indicate increased penetration of biofuels from second-generation biofuels in India's energy mix up to 46 Mtoe by 2050, mainly from crop residues and jatropha on degraded land [3 ]. Lee et al. evaluation at a regional scale suggests that bioethanol blending from sugarcane juice can immensely contribute to achieving energy security [48 ]. However, Gunatilake et al. found that sugarcane-based ethanol may not be as effective at the national scale as jatropha biodiesel, which holds greater potential [45 ]. Although studies at the macro scale suggest enormous potential to generate energy security benefits, these effects are rather complicated at the regional, community, and household levels.  4.1.2 Gross domestic product (GDP) The contribution of biofuels toward economic development and growth is another primary sustainability goal. However, the extent to which biofuels can boost GDP depends on their economic costs relative to other fuel options. Studies evaluating these effects at the national level suggest that biofuels are a costly alternative. Biofuels, especially sugarcane ethanol, have a limited potential for mitigating the GDP losses arising from high oil prices [45 ,59 ].   4.2 Social sustainability 4.2.1 Food security Food security risks arise when biofuels compete for land and production factors such as labour, leading to increased prices and reduced supply of food baskets, including staple crops. Although policy makers have long held that jatropha can help meet biofuel mandates without compromising land used for food production when grown on wastelands, studies at the local and regional scales suggest otherwise. Even qualitative evaluation based on the availability of wasteland in India ascertains these promises [56 ]. However, regional evaluations of jatropha farming practices suggests that 56 % of surveyed farmers growing jatropha in Tamil Nadu experienced a reduction in availability and self-sufficiency of edible oils as these crops displaced groundnut thus, increasing farmers' reliance on market-purchased food [50 ]. Goswami and Choudhury report that while it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of land conversion for jatropha on food production, it raises the probability of reduced food production by 23.1 % in northeast India [42 ]. These findings call into question the assumption that jatropha cultivation on wastelands will not negatively impact food security. Furthermore, replacing subsistence crops with jatropha can have severe food and nutritional security consequences, particularly for smallholder farmers as jatropha is inedible and lacks nutritional value. In Tamil Nadu, for example, Rittenburg et al. found that 43 % of smallholders and 34 % of medium holders opt for jatropha monocultures [52 ]. Another case study highlights how jatropha monocultures replaced staple crops, like paddy and vegetables, which are also essential for meeting the daily dietary needs of farm households [51 ]. Jatropha-induced food security problems can also occur due to potential increases in demand for major agricultural factors such as capital and labour. Evidence suggests that diverting agriculture labour to jatropha production activities increases the likelihood of reduced food production by 18.2 % [42 ]. Moreover, jatropha cultivation can lead to loss of livestock feed and fodder availability. For example, in cases where jatropha was grown on government and private land, farmers faced a severe shortage in forage collection and loss of grazing land [39 ]. Similarly, in other cases where jatropha replaced crops like rice and groundnut on agricultural land, surveyed households experienced a significant decline in fodder, with 50 % reporting reduced availability of residues and groundnut feed [50 ,51 ]. Regarding ethanol, molasses was prioritized as feedstock to avoid direct competition with food products, particularly sugar. Studies evaluating biofuel performance with molasses as feedstocks suggest no significant food security effects in terms of production, prices, and trade of sugar [61 ,46 ]. However, as ethanol blending exclusively based on molasses is insufficient to meet the growing oil needs of the country, alternative and more diversified feedstock sources have been explored. Studies evaluating ethanol options directly from sugarcane juice point to positive food security effects by helping maintain stability in market prices of sugar [48 ]. However, the use of food-based ethanol feedstock options like sorghum, maize, and pearl millet may potentially lead to negative food security consequences since they are micronutrient rich food and also an important livestock feed resource [57 ,32 ]. Concerns about the impact of biofuels on nutritional security are supported by Patel et al. who found that over 75 % of households surveyed in Gujarat expressed concerns about the potential harm [54 ]. Reddy et al. also express concern about the use of staple crops such as sorghum and pearl millet for ethanol production, as it could exacerbate fodder insecurity in central India, given the large scale of production required [57 ]. For countries well connected to international agriculture markets, global and domestic biofuel production and use can influence the international and domestic food prices, which can impact the supply and demand of national food baskets. Modelling based studies at global scale suggest negative food security effects from sugarcane-based ethanol due to reduced food supply and increased imports. Even the possibility of an impact of other country policies on Indian food market is quite high under conditions where agriculture market is linked. Chakravorty et al. evaluating the effect of corn-based biofuel expansion in U.S. suggest negative food security effects due to high food prices impact on rural poor [54 ].  4.2.2 Land tenure and rights Land conflicts commonly arise due to competing interests over rights to use and manage land and generate income from its use. In the case of jatropha, a study by Baka and Bailis has shown that conflicts arises when access to wastelands is restricted [15 ]. Such disputes often stem from ill-defined property rights, particularly with respect to the categorization of land for jatropha cultivation, including available land, idle cropland, marginal land, and wasteland. The difficulty in distinguishing between these categories can lead to conflicts between farmers, private companies, and NGOs, as seen in Tamil Nadu, where tensions arose over the failure of jatropha cultivation to improve income and livelihoods as promised. Smallholder farmers with limited resources and reliance on rainfed conditions are disproportionately affected by such conflicts. Montobbio and Lele, have demonstrated that jatropha's profitability was high under irrigated conditions only, which in turn increased resource tensions at the village and household level [51 ]. Compounding these challenges, jatropha growers have lost hope due to the failure of promoters to provide income support during gestation periods, guaranteed buyback of feedstocks, and credit arrangements for managing resources such as water.  4.2.3 Livelihood and income Biofuels have been widely promoted as a means of generating new income streams and creating employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas of developing countries. However, our review suggests that studies have majorly focussed on evaluating livelihood and income effects at the household level, particularly in relation to non-edible oilseeds such as jatropha, and the findings are varied. A study evaluating biofuel agroforestry systems in Karnataka discovered that non-edible oilseed crops like pongamia (Millettia pinnata ), neem (Azadirachta indica ) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis ) could potentially boost the income of smallholders by 61 % over 25 years if high yielding variety seeds were used [33 ]. Another study conducted by Garg et al. found that Jatropha production provided farmers with a supplementary income source and increased their overall earnings [33 ], while Borman et al. found biofuel crops provided a means of income support for meeting minimum dietary needs [34 ]. However, the profitability and income derived from the plantations largely depend on the productivity of these crops, especially jatropha. The uncertainty surrounding income prospects from jatropha has been a major factor influencing farmers' decisions to adopt or not adopt biofuel crop production. Additionally, low market prices of jatropha seeds and uncertain profitability conditions can lead to limited income opportunities for small and marginalized farmers, potentially increasing their risk of food insecurity. Furthermore, due to the high opportunity costs of labour, lower returns from jatropha have discouraged farmers from engaging in seed collection. For instance, a study of 390 households in southern India found that 16 % of households cited low productivity and income as the main barrier to adopting biofuel plantations in small-scale agroforestry [36 ]. Another study conducted in four regions of northeast India revealed that 96.7 % of the 304 farmers surveyed expressed dissatisfaction with the market price of jatropha seeds [34 ]. The economic benefits of biofuels for small and marginal farmers depend on whether the income from feedstock production is enough to compensate for other livelihood options. Despite being promoted as a promising alternative energy source, jatropha yields poor economic returns to farmers [36 ]. Furthermore, another study by Findlater and Kandlikar suggest that establishing jatropha plantations has led to local communities in Rajasthan abandoning other livelihood options, such as soap-making, that were previously offered by local trees [39 ]. In addition, monoculture-based jatropha plantations, as observed in Tamil Nadu, tend to limit the diversity of livelihood options available from other crops, such as paddy, vegetables, and pulses, which can make farmers more vulnerable to adverse climatic conditions [51 ]. Farmers’ decisions to grow jatropha or other non-edible oilseed crops instead of food crops may be driven by the expectation of high economic returns or pressure from local authorities. However, evidence from Axelsson et al. indicates that lack of adequate information on crop growing conditions and water scarcity led 85 % of surveyed farmers who initially opted to grow jatropha in 2004 to stop producing the feedstock [37 ]. Moreover, the long growing period of jatropha crops can leave farmers without a guaranteed income source during the initial years of plantation, complicating local livelihood strategies and increasing farmers' reliance on off-farm activities. This is supported by evidence from southern India, where off-farm engagements increased for 33 % of surveyed households [50 ]. In contrast, the effects of ethanol feedstocks on local livelihoods are not so clear. Basavaraj et al. suggest that ethanol production from sorghum can potentially provide new income opportunities for farmers [32 ]. Modelling-based studies suggest that household incomes can increase with increased demand for ethanol feedstocks [35 ].  4.2.4 Employment Only a few studies have examined the employment effects of biodiesel feedstocks, indicating negative labour and employment impacts of jatropha plantations on wasteland. There are significant discrepancies in promoting jatropha biodiesel for employment benefits. While the government encourages jatropha cultivation to generate employment opportunities and promote rural development, private companies entice farmers to switch to jatropha from other crops to address labour shortages in agriculture. Research has shown that jatropha plantations in the Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu, which replace biomass like Prosopis juliflora on wastelands, generate more employment than jatropha [31 ]. Jatropha cultivation requires labour only during the initial planting stage. Its low labour requirements in the growing stages often lead to the migration of laborers to urban areas in search of new job opportunities rather than creating new employment prospects in rural areas. Therefore, instead of promoting employment, these plantations tend to increase rural-urban migration.  4.2.5 Energy access The strategy of promoting jatropha cultivation on so-called ‘unproductive’ and ‘unused’ wastelands in India has been challenged due to its negative impact on energy access. Baka and Bailis conducted a survey of 158 Prosopis juliflora users in Tamil Nadu and found that the plant biomass provides 2.5–10.3 times more useable energy than jatropha [15 ]. Therefore, replacing Prosopis with jatropha could undermine local energy security and economy options. Another survey of 42 stakeholders, including village representatives and biofuel companies, found that jatropha constrains the dynamic energy economy services provided by Prosopis for both rural and urban users of Sattur region in Tamil Nadu [31 ]. Since the 1970s, Prosopis grown on wastelands has fulfilled multiple energy needs of the local economy, serving as household fuelwood, electricity and charcoal production, pulp and paper industry, brick manufacturing, oil mills, and restaurants. Replacing Prosopis with jatropha can impair business operations due to reduced energy supplies, and the absence of any substitute for these local fuelwood options can negatively impact rural economies. In addition, farmers who replaced crops like pearl millet and cotton with jatropha lost household firewood, as these crops provided fuel for nearly five months for a family of five members [51 ].   4.3 Environmental sustainability 4.3.1 Land use and land use change (LULUC) To increase biofuel production, feedstocks must be grown either by altering cropping patterns on existing agricultural lands or by expanding agriculture onto other land categories, such as pastureland, forest land, or other land types. However, such changes in land use for feedstock production can have direct and indirect land use change effects, which depend on the availability of potential land for biofuel feedstock production [62 ]. Findings of the review suggests that the actual performance of biofuels in India undermines the policy restriction against using agricultural land for feedstock production. Several local cases of direct land use change where farmers replaced food crops with biodiesel feedstocks on agricultural land were observed. Although the national policy encouraged the cultivation of jatropha in “marginal” and “wasteland” areas, several studies have shown inconsistencies between the government's classification of wasteland and farmers' perceptions of waste and marginal land, resulting in the conversion of cropland for jatropha. About 78 % of 2.7 ha and 93 % of 6.9 ha of average area dedicated to jatropha cultivation by farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu were identified as cropland [37 ]. Jatropha replaced crops like groundnut and horse gram, as well as other land use practices such as grazing. Similarly, Rittenburg et al. found that most smallholder farmers in Tamil Nadu were repurposing previous cropland for jatropha, while only a small fraction of medium and large farmers were using cultivable wasteland [52 ]. Private croplands were frequently used for jatropha cultivation [50 ,51 ], revealing that a substantial 82 % of surveyed households used croplands. These findings were consistent with other studies conducted in north-eastern India [44 ], suggesting that a significant portion of jatropha growers used traditional cropland for cultivation. However, jatropha's lower productivity under no irrigation and fertilizer use conditions requires higher land requirements, as demonstrated by Lapola et al. in modelling-based studies [47 ]. Additionally, Das et al. suggest that jatropha-based biodiesel production cannot be fulfilled using only degraded lands as planned in India, and an additional 3–4% of total cropland will be required to meet biodiesel demands [37 ]. Studies investigating the use of sugarcane feedstocks for ethanol have highlighted the negative effects of land use changes. Model-based evaluation conducted by Lapola et al. and Scaldach et al. indicate enormously high land requirements for expanding sugarcane acreage to meet the country's blending targets, much of which comes from other natural lands [47 ,58 ]. Research on other ethanol feedstocks, such as bamboo, suggests that about 48.5 % of the 136 households surveyed in the Aravalli district of Gujarat believed that its cultivation for biofuels would impact agriculture [63 ]. Basavraj et al. suggest that assuming a 20 t/ha productivity, the land requirement for cultivating sorghum for bioethanol is only 1.16 million hectares [32 ].  4.3.2 GHG emissions The production of biofuels has raised concerns about their impact on GHGs emissions, particularly related to land conversions, which may hinder achieving the overall environmental sustainability goals. However, using degraded croplands and wastelands for biofuel development can also act as a valuable carbon sink. A study assessing the potential GHG emissions from six non-edible oilseed trees found that planting them on 28.29 million hectares of wasteland and 17.26 million hectares of degraded cropland could contribute 5.7 % to India's goal of creating a carbon sink of 2.5–3 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 [55 ]. While, another study evaluating the GHG emission potential of jatropha cultivation found that land conversions for jatropha production can lead to annual CO2 emissions of 41–334 Mt CO2 [56 ]. Another study by Patel et al. suggests that bamboo cultivation has the lowest GHG emissions (1.65 KgCO2eq) compared to sorghum (2.11 KgCO2eq & 0.75 GJ), and pearl millet (2.24 KgCO2eq & 0.49 GJ) per USD spent for ethanol [53 ].  4.3.3 Soil To maintain the productivity of land used for biofuel feedstock production, it is crucial to improve soil quality. Inappropriate crop and soil management practices during feedstock production can lead to soil degradation, including decreased soil organic matter, soil erosion, and nutrient loss. Existing research primarily concentrates on enhanced soil quality stemming from the cultivation of jatropha plantations. Field-based monitoring and assessment have consistently demonstrated positive outcomes in this regard. Notably, according to Wani et al. jatropha plantations established on degraded land within semi-arid tropical regions of India exhibit the potential to enhance crop management through carbon sequestration and nutrient recycling [60 ]. Garg et al. found that jatropha on wastelands in Andhra Pradesh reduced soil erosion and improved soil carbon content [33 ]. Another case study indicates that the optimal use of jatropha oilcake can enhance soil quality by recycling plant nutrients in three different sites in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Orissa [49 ]. It is, however, noteworthy that the existing literature does not furnish conclusive evidence regarding soil quality effects associated with ethanol feedstock production.  4.3.4 Water use The use of biofuels can significantly impact water availability, quality, and efficiency. Jatropha, a commonly promoted feedstock for its purported high yield potential with minimal water use, has been found to have a high water footprint and low water use efficiency, contradicting previous claims [47 ,60 ]. Though it has been touted as drought-tolerant, research shows that jatropha requires a significant amount of water (750–1000 mm) to be economically viable, potentially exacerbating competition for water resources in already water-scarce regions [51 ]. While jatropha can enhance green water use efficiency, large-scale cultivation may negatively impact downstream water availability by reducing erosion and nutrient run-off [33 ]. Similarly, extensive sugarcane production for ethanol production can strain water resources and compete with other crops for irrigation water [40 ]. However, conflicting claims have been made about the impact of sugarcane ethanol on water use [48 ], but further quantitative evaluation is needed to determine the true water effects of biofuel production.  4.3.5 Biodiversity and ecosystem services Assessments of biodiversity effects associated with biofuels in India primarily focus on jatropha and non-edible oilseed crops for biodiesel, while little attention is paid to ethanol feedstocks. Case studies show positive biodiversity impacts from jatropha plantations like improved habitat diversity from an increased presence of earthworms, lichens, peacocks, and other birds and Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus ) [49 ]. Additionally, agroforestry-based jatropha development has been found to support multiple provisioning and supporting ecosystem services, as reported by 92 % of surveyed households in Karnataka [36 ]. De Hoop [38 ] also confirms marginal positive changes in ecosystem services and biodiversity from planting Pongamia pinnata (a non-edible oilseed) in the Hassan Biofuel Park in the Karnataka region.    5 Key findings 5.1 Expectations and reality of biofuels sustainability performance India's biofuel policy aims to achieve multiple sustainability goals, but the review discovers wide mismatch between expectations and reality. The findings suggest that the strategic measures outlined in national policy are insufficient to mitigate all risks while some targets like energy security, biodiversity improvements, and ecosystem services can be achieved with non-edible oilseeds on waste and degraded lands, other targets like livelihoods, income, employment, food security, energy access, LULUC are impacted negatively by biofuel promotion. Although the policy aims to avoid all food security and land use change risks, several case studies illustrate that these effects have severely impaired the well-being of households by curtailing distributional benefits. Evidence shows that misinformed land allocation decisions by farmers have led to unfavourable cascading effects on household food self-sufficiency, local fodder resources, income, employment, and other livelihood options. In the case of land rights and disputes, policies promoting a consultative approach to engage local stakeholders like communities, private companies, local government bodies, and NGOs [5 ,8 ] fail to safeguard the property relations of biofuel crop growers and the risks associated with conflicting resource use like water for food and biofuel crops. There is also limited evidence of biofuels generating employment benefits. Rather, the evidence directs towards increased risks of rural-urban migration due to the changes in local livelihood strategies caused by biofuel crops. Overall, sustainability goals may appear achievable at the macro scale, but unsustainability risks at the regional or local scale may often remain unmanaged without adequate policy measures and governance.  5.2 Implications for achieving SDGs The systematic review carried out in this study also helps understand the implications of achieving SDGs for India. Linkages between biofuels and 8 of the 17 SDGs were identified, involving 21 targets and 23 distinct indicators, as depicted in Fig. 10  . Notably, the findings reveal a prevalence of trade-offs rather than synergies associated with biodiesel production. While national biodiesel promotion policies may help restore degraded wastelands (SDG 15), it is important to identify the significant trade-offs with several socio-economic targets. For example, although biodiesel based on jatropha and non-edible oilseed can provide higher income support contributing towards reduced inequalities (SDG 10) and poverty (SDG 1), especially during the lean-harvesting period [33 ,34 ], these benefits are provisional on agronomic conditions, economic costs, and profitability of the energy crops. In many cases, energy crop plantations (such as jatropha and non-edible oilseeds) appeared to compromise SDG 2 (target 2.4, indicator 2.4.1) by displacing areas under productive agriculture instead of wasteland [42 ,52 ,44 ]. The loss of agricultural activities causes additional socio-economic adversities that dampen the likelihood of achieving other sustainability targets. For instance, reduced availability of household and livestock food and feed in cases where jatropha plantations displaced subsistence food and fodder crops may increase the risks of undernourishment (indicator 2.1.1), malnourishment (indicator 2.2.2), and severe food insecurity (indicator 2.1.2) [52 ,51 ,37 ]. The negative impacts of biofuel production on local livelihood strategies, such as the decrease in local business opportunities [39 ] and increased off-farm engagements [50 ] may severely hinder ability to achieve SDG 10 (reduced inequality) by negatively affecting household expenditure and income (indicator 10.1.1) and depriving equal opportunities for all (indicator 10.3.1), thereby restraining their social, political, and economic inclusion (indicator 10.2.1). Studies have shown income and livelihood trade-offs (SDG 10) due to uncertainty in profits and income over lower market prices of jatropha crops. Moreover, resource allocation competition over land and labour for jatropha and food crops also hinders employment opportunities (SDG 8, target 8.3), especially among small and marginal farmers (SDG 2, target 2.3) [42 ,44 ]. This raises concerns about reducing poverty levels (SDG 1). Furthermore, if land used for dedicated energy crops causes adverse local energy security and access consequences, it simultaneously worsens achieving SDG 6 [15 ,31 ]. Concerning biodiesel feedstocks, most synergies were associated with environmental SDGs like biodiversity conservation (SDG 15), soil quality, and water quality (SDG 6). Research suggests that non-edible oilseed-based biodiesel can potentially contribute towards achieving environmental sustainability related to biodiversity and ecosystem services. For instance, it has been observed that biodiesel feedstock plantations on wasteland or degraded land have positive ecological benefits like habitat diversity and biodiversity conservation. It also helps provide multiple ecosystem services like recreation, pollination, and supporting services in the form of nutrient recycling and climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration [60 ,49 ,38 ]. These positive benefits enable achieving SDG 2 (target 2.4) by maintaining agriculture areas under productive and sustainable agriculture, SDG 6 (target 6.4) by ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all (SDG 6, target 6.4), and SDG 15 (target 15.3) by restoring degraded land, soil, and habitat diversity. Studies suggest no severe implications for sugarcane and molasses feedstocks for SDG 2, and SDG 6 [48 , 61 , 46 ]. However, ethanol from other feedstock sources like sorghum indicates a positive association with goals like SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and SDG 10 (reduce inequality) [32 ].  5.3 Future research direction This review identifies several research gaps in understanding the sustainability of biofuels in a large developing country context. Based on the study findings, although research on biodiesel is more mature and covers a diverse set of indicators, studies on bioethanol cover very limited set of indicators, mainly focusing on food and land use. Moreover, while expanding sugarcane acreage demands intensive water use, the current evaluation of sugarcane water use is not robust enough to completely understand the sustainability challenges of increasing sugarcane use for ethanol production in India. Therefore, there is a need for future studies to adopt a multi-criteria approach that integrates food, energy, and environmental aspects to develop high quality economic, social, and environmental indicators that inform decision-making for both biodiesel and bioethanol. While research on the effects of first-generation ethanol dominates the literature, there is a lack of evidence on the socio-economic and environmental impacts of second-generation ethanol from cellulosic biomass. Although the studies reviewed here are more focused on evaluating the potential and prospects of biofuel from lignocellulosic biomass, more research is necessary to understand the distributional and environmental effects of biomass-based biofuels. With policies promoting lignocellulosic biofuels already in place, robust sustainability evaluation of these biofuels is imperative. Future research should aim to address the uncertainties around biomass use and market conditions, such as farmers' expected income gain from biomass sale, optimal biomass prices, soil fertility trade-offs from residue removal and use, and GHG emissions abated from biomass use, by including multidimensional sustainability indicators.   6 Conclusions This review assessed the sustainability implications of biofuels in the global south by systematically reviewing the literature for the case of India. Results of the review reveal that the current research focuses on exploring biofuel potential and feedstock viability but has limited coverage of the impacts. There is a marked disparity between the objectives set forth in policy and the actual sustainability outcomes of biofuels in India. Majority of the studies confirm that the cultivation of jatropha plantations may not substantially contribute to sustainable rural development or poverty alleviation. Instead, such plantations tend to yield adverse socio-economic consequences, notably affecting food security, income levels, and livelihood. It alters agricultural land utilization that could impede the attainment of SDGs, particularly at the local level. While certain benefits, such as the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation are discernible, they may precipitate imbalances across a range of socio-economic dimensions and necessitate a prolonged timeframe for the realization of gains. However, to furnish a more comprehensive evaluation of sustainability outcomes across distinct spatial scales and divergent feedstock types, additional research is needed. This pertains specifically to sustainability indicators tailored to individual feedstock categories, with particular emphasis on cellulosic biomass-based biofuels. The existing body of knowledge concerning the performance of second-generation ethanol from cellulosic biomass is constrained, thereby engendering elevated levels of uncertainty. Consequently, a prerequisite for prudent investment decisions entails the prioritization of evidence-based research appraising the environmental and distributional socio-economic ramifications of biofuels. Lastly, to uphold the potential of biofuels as a sustainable substitute for fossil fuels, it is essential for policies and production activities to meticulously calibrate the socio-economic and environmental impacts across diverse scales over the long term. The outcomes of the review reveal a discernible paucity in the comprehension of synergies and trade-offs associated with biofuel impacts, compounded by a dearth of regulatory policies capable of effectively overseeing the biofuel sector, safeguarding its viability, and preventing adverse consequences. Therefore, it becomes pivotal for programs and policies geared towards biofuel expansion to embrace an integrative, long-term approach in pursuit of a confluence of sustainability objectives that align with multifaceted aims. In conclusion, India's experience with biofuels offers invaluable insights into the intricate trade-offs and challenges that necessitate resolution for overall sustainability of biofuel value chain, which can also be beneficial for other developing countries. Nonetheless, it is imperative to exercise caution in interpreting the findings of this study, as the review herein is circumscribed to the Indian context and is restricted to only the selected studies included in the analysis. The study furnishes a comprehensive and nuanced appraisal of the multifaceted sustainability impacts within the ambit of a large developing nation. However, a more expansive review encompassing diverse global regions, particularly those of developing countries, would offer a broader perspective. Although this study provides a relative assessment of positive and negative impacts through a comprehensive mapping, it does not provide quantitative justifications for the underlying determinants that yield differential effects across a diverse array of indicators [64 ,65 ]. Findings of this review broadly aligns with other study findings like Vera et al. [18 ] and supports findings of Robledo‐Abad [25 ] and Martinelli et al. [66 ], providing wider sustainability evaluation for developing countries.
