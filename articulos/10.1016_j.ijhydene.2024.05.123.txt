The main one is the study and gradual introduction of alternative energy. Hydrogen bioenergy is a promising area of sustainable development that has the potential to become a key component of the energy system of the future. The relevance of this scientific article is due to the need to study and review modern strategies for the development of hydrogen bio-energy in the context of achieving sustainable development goals. In the modern world, the problems of climate change, decreasing oil and gas reserves, as well as the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions pose the challenge to society of finding alternative energy sources. Hydrogen bioenergy is a promising and environmentally friendly direction that can become a key component of the future energy system. The study of modern strategies for the development of hydrogen bioenergy is of great importance for the scientific community, industry and decision-making at the public policy level. Analyzing the effectiveness of various strategies, identifying potential benefits and challenges, and identifying ways to optimize the development of this industry will provide the basis for the development of effective solutions that promote sustainable development and reduce dependence on traditional energy sources. Thus, the purpose of this work was to review current trends in the field of biohydrogen energy. To achieve the goal, the following tasks were put forward.1) Assessment of the current state of hydrogen and biohydrogen energy and its role in the energy cluster of the world economy.  2) Analysis of modern strategies for the production of biohydrogen.  3) Comparison of existing technologies for the production of biohydrogen from microalgae biomass and selection of the most effective technique.  4) Assessing the need for further research in the field of biohydrogen energy and identifying possible directions for development.

Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud  m3 /day cubic meters per day        2 Methods and materials According to the International Energy Outlook, global energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% until 2050 [1 ]. This energy demand is met mainly through the use of huge amounts of fossil fuels. Currently, fossil fuels provide 80% of global energy consumption. The Statistical Review of World Energy (2020) reports that fossil fuels, including crude oil, coal and natural gas, account for about three-quarters of total energy consumption worldwide [2 ]. The ability of fossil fuels to act as efficient energy carriers and their ease of conversion into various forms of energy have made them the engine of energy development [3 ]. However, on the other hand, the combustion of fossil fuels carries with it significant undesirable environmental and social effects, fossil fuels carry with it significant undesirable environmental and social effects, such as greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming and climate change [4–7 ], loss of biodiversity [8 ,9 ], pollution of land and water resources [10 ,11 ], as well as various undesirable health effects [12–14 ]. The production of greenhouse gases, which cause global warming and climate change [15 ,16 ], is one of the most important environmental problems associated with the use of fossil fuels [17 ], requiring immediate solutions [18–20 ]. According to the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016, it is necessary to limit the increase in average temperature to below 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels and to continue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C [21 ,22 ]. Achieving such ambitious climate goals requires sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net zero emissions [23 ], which in turn requires rapid reductions in fossil fuel production and use [24 ]. Using biofuels instead of fossil fuels would solve many environmental problems. According to Gielen et al., a transition to more energy-efficient methods and the use of renewable energy sources could potentially lead to a 94% reduction in anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 [25 ]. On the other hand, a study by Zheng et al., conducted in 30 provinces in China, shows that increasing the renewable energy industry by 0.01% could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.028–0.043% [26 ]. It is worth noting that in 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, global renewable energy capacity increased by 45% [27 ]. This is the fastest annual growth rate since 1999 [28 ].The gradual replacement of existing fossil fuels with clean biofuels is an ideal goal for the transition to a circular economy that meets the goals of sustainable energy development [29 ]. According to Davidson, sustainable energy is energy that provides affordable, accessible and reliable energy services that meet economic, social and environmental needs within the overall development context of the society for which these services are intended, under conditions of rational allocation of resources to meet these needs [30 ]. One of the popular environmental solutions within the framework of sustainable energy is the production of hydrogen. Hydrogen (H2) has the highest energy density (142 MJ/kg) [31–33 ], compared to gasoline (47 MJ/kg), methane (56 MJ/kg) and natural gas (54 MJ/kg) [34 ], which allows us to conclude that it is a promising and efficient energy carrier [35 ]. It is also quickly produced and transported [36–39 ]. However, the use of hydrogen as the main energy resource is currently associated with the following technological limitations.1) Modernization of process control systems [40 ].  2) Problems associated with the storage and transportation of hydrogen caused by metal corrosion [41 ,42 ].  3) Technical and economic difficulties of hydrogen commercialization [43 ].    According to many scientists, biological methods for producing biohydrogen can effectively eliminate these limitations [44 ].  3 Results Biohydrogen produced from biomass is often called green hydrogen due to its carbon neutrality. Biohydrogen can be produced by thermochemical [45–48 ] and biological methods [49–51 ]. Biofuels and synthesis gas, typically produced from wood chips, agricultural waste and municipal solid waste, are the main types of biofuels produced by thermochemical conversion. Biofuels produced from biomass have the potential to displace up to 27% of global transportation fuels by 2050, which could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 3.7 billion metric tons per year [52 ]. Thermochemical conversion technologies include roasting, pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal treatment. Drying has recently been explored as an alternative pretreatment for the synthesis of biohydrogen from corn chips. Torrefaction significantly increased sugar yield and biohydrogen production compared to untreated corn grits [53 ]. Biohydrogen can also be produced by gasification. Unlike combustion, in which biomass is burned to produce heat and electricity, gasification converts biomass into a gas called synthesis gas through controlled oxidation [54 ]. The gasification process involves heating biomass to high temperatures (700–1000 °C) in the presence of a limited amount of oxygen or steam, which causes the biomass to break down into a mixture of gases including hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane [55 ].Currently, the main problem of gasification is the formation of difficult-to-remove tar, which significantly reduces the hydrogen yield [56 ]. It is also worth noting that all thermochemical methods for producing biohydrogen have a serious environmental effect in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, which reduces the attractiveness of using alternative energy sources compared to fossil fuels. In addition, thermochemical processes are quite energy intensive and require careful control of temperature and other conditions to achieve optimal results. Biological technologies for the production of H2  are the most preferred due to the fact that they are less energy intensive and are the most environmentally friendly in terms of global reduction of carbon dioxide emissions [57–60 ]. Another important advantage of biological methods for producing biohydrogen is increasing energy security during production and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, if we take into account the possibility of obtaining biohydrogen from various wastes generated in production [61 ]. In recent years, the use of biomass as raw material for the production of valuable components, including bioenergy, biofuels, biohydrogen, bioethanol, etc. [62–67 ], is becoming increasingly popular. This is largely due to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels [68 ,69 ]. Biomass energy benefits from the variety of feedstocks that can be used to generate energy. Typically, energy from plant-based biomass is widely known to be carbon neutral, as greenhouse gas emissions from resource extraction are negligible. However, this statement is only true if the level of emissions from the production of alternative energy is equivalent to the level of carbon capture by the biomass that is used as a raw material (various plants). In this context, the use of microalgae biomass for energy production seems more effective and environmentally friendly [70–73 ], since to obtain this type of raw material there is no need to cut down plants and forests, and much smaller areas are needed for their cultivation. Land unsuitable for agriculture can be used as areas for growing algae [74 ]. Microalgae also have high specific rates of biomass growth [75 ,76 ] with a high level of photosynthesis. The efficiency of the photosynthesis process of microalgae (3%) exceeds the efficiency of biomass production by terrestrial plants (0.2–2%) [77 ]. To grow naturally, microalgae require light, carbon dioxide, and certain nutrients from the environment. This reduces the need for external sources of nutrients. Additionally, using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as a source of inorganic carbon helps reduce the carbon footprint. Another advantage of growing microalgae is that they are produced sustainably, eliminating the need for various fertilizers, avoiding competition with fertile agricultural soils, and requiring less water than land-based crops, promoting efficient use of freshwater resources. Currently, additives for intensifying anaerobic digestion of waste [78 ], biodiesel using extraction, transesterification [79 ], hydrothermal liquefaction, and biohydrogen [80 ,81 ] are obtained from microalgae biomass. Biohydrogen from microalgae biomass can be obtained by several methods [82 ], namely.• fermentation:  o photofermentation [83–85 ];  o dark fermentation [86–88 ];  • biophotolysis [89 ]:  o straight [90 ];  o indirect [91 ];  • electrochemical methods:  o electrolysis;  o photoelectrochemical method.    To identify the advantages and disadvantages of each method, the article provides a brief analysis of each biohydrogen production strategy. 3.1 Fermentation 3.1.1 Photofermentation Photofermentation is a process for producing biohydrogen, which includes the mandatory enzymatic processing of biomass by photosynthetic bacteria using light energy. To produce hydrogen using photofermentation, green non-sulfur bacteria (GNS) of the species Halobacterium, Chlorobium, Rhodobater, Rhodospirillum, Rhodopseudomonas and Chromatium are required [92 ,93 ]. The amount of biohydrogen produced is closely related to the light intensity. Increasing light intensity causes photoinhibition, which increases biohydrogen synthesis while reducing oxygen production. The advantages of this method are the high yield of H2 , high percentage of hydrogen and minimal need for organic materials. However, the process of converting biomass into biohydrogen through fermentation involves complex metabolic and biochemical processes. At the moment, the method requires quite a lot of modernization to enter the economic market. The main problem with fermentation is the low efficiency of converting biomass into biohydrogen. According to scientists, this problem is due to the fact that most organic components remain in the form of a dissolved enzymatic substrate [94 ].  3.1.2 Dark fermentation A more promising direction for obtaining biohydrogen from microalgae is the fermentation of microalgae biomass in the dark [95 ,96 ]. Dark fermentation is a biological process in which hydrogen is produced through anaerobic fermentation in the absence of light. This technology is gaining popularity due to its environmental friendliness, energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The main difference between dark fermentation and photofermentation is the absence of the need to process biomass with solar energy, which makes this technology more accessible due to a decrease in the required surface area [97 ], and also expands the possibilities of producing biohydrogen under various conditions [98 ]. To produce hydrogen using dark fermentation, green algae (GA) of the Chlorella species [99 ] and hydrogen-producing bacteria are required. In dark fermentation, many fermentative bacteria can produce biohydrogen using a diverse range of organic biomass or waste as substrate. The enzyme hydrogenase will help produce hydrogen during fermentation [100 ]. The highest hydrogen yield during dark fermentation depends on the type of substrate, inoculum and technological factors such as pH, temperature and others. Many reactor configurations have been used in dark fermentation, such as continuously stirred tank reactors, membrane reactors, packed bed reactors, and anaerobic fluidized bed reactors [101 ]. Temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the yield of biohydrogen. The most successful results were obtained with fermentation at 55 °C due to greater breakdown of glucose and formate [102 ]. In addition, most studies have determined the most optimal pH range in which the substrate must be maintained in bioreactors is from 5.5 to 6.5 [103 ]. It is also necessary to monitor the residence time of the substrate in the reactors. Recent studies have shown that reducing the holding time from 8 h to 3 h increases the yield of biohydrogen and the rate of its production [104 ]. Also, one of the recent innovations in the process of producing biohydrogen by dark fermentation is the introduction of nanoparticles into the fermentable substrate. For example, in a study by Rambabu et al. Nanocomposites with graphite-activated carbon coated with an iron oxide nanocomposite were introduced into the fermented biomass, which led to an almost threefold increase in the yield of biohydrogen [105 ]. Another popular direction is the use of residual microalgae biomass by dark fermentation [73 ]. It is known that microalgae are capable of absorbing CO2  [106 ] and also purifying wastewater [107 ,108 ]. It has been proposed to use the residual microalgae biomass formed after wastewater treatment and carbon dioxide utilization for the production of biohydrogen [73 ]. The maximum amount of biohydrogen (44.24 ml/l of suspension) was obtained under anaerobic fermentation conditions in the dark. Using residual microalgae biomass for production not only meets the principles of a circular economy, but also significantly reduces the cost of the process, creating an economically viable and environmentally viable source of energy. Combining the two methods described above is also a current innovative method for producing biohydrogen [109 ]. The technology of synergy between photofermentation and dark fermentation involves pre-treatment of biomass with microwave radiation, further heating of the biomass with dilute acid, treatment by dark fermentation using hydrogen-producing bacteria for 48–72 hours. Next, the residual biomass was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant liquid treated with zeolites to reduce ammonia concentration. Next, the treated liquid was used to obtain H2  by photofermentation for 96–120 hours with the addition of GNB. This method showed the highest yield of biohydrogen compared to the yield of H2  obtained using each method separately [110 ,111 ]. According to the authors of the above-described works, further research in this area should be carried out to optimize the conditions for pre-treatment of microalgae biomass, fermentation and methanogenesis, thereby increasing the efficiency of biohydrogen production. Fermentation has many advantages over other methods for producing biohydrogen. First, it is a low-cost, efficient process that produces high-quality biofuels from a variety of feedstocks. Secondly, it is an environmentally friendly method, the use of which in the energy sector can achieve sustainable development goals regarding carbon neutrality, and will also help reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The main disadvantage of producing biohydrogen by fermentation is the high sensitivity of the process to changes in temperature, acidity of the fermented biomass and other external factors affecting the process. In addition, the fermentation process is variable, which suggests that sufficient research on improving the process of producing biohydrogen through fermentation is necessary to enter the economic market.   3.2 Biophotolysis Biophotolysis is the dissociation of water molecules with the formation of hydrogen and oxygen in biological organisms under the influence of solar radiation. Bio-photolytic processes can be divided into two main categories: direct biophotolysis and indirect biophotolysis [112 ]. The general chemical reaction describing these 2 processes [113 ]:2H2 O + solar radiation → 2H2  + O2     3.2.1 Direct biophotolysis In the process of direct biophotolysis, the biomass absorbs light energy and transfers electrons to ferredoxin. This phenomenon leads to water reduction [114 ]. Reduced ferredoxin can transport electrons to hydrogenase. After this, hydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of a proton into biohydrogen [115 ] with additional formation of oxygen. This amount of oxygen inhibits the activity of the hydrogenase enzyme and is a major problem in the process of direct biophotolysis.  3.2.2 Indirect biophotolysis In indirect biophotolysis, electrons resulting from the splitting of water are first supplied for the synthesis of reserve carbohydrates (starch, glycogen), and then these organic reserves serve as electron donors for the formation of biohydrogen [116 ]. The advantage of indirect biophotolysis compared to direct one is that the stage of oxygen formation is separated from the stage of hydrogen release, so oxygen does not inhibit the release of biohydrogen. Biophotolysis is mainly used on a laboratory scale, since this method of producing biohydrogen, despite its high theoretical efficiency and economic attractiveness, has shown rather low practical results. In addition, the use of biophotolysis is associated with other associated problems, namely: significant energy consumption to maintain constant artificial lighting, which significantly affects the cost of the final product, as well as the constant production of oxygen, which interferes with the effective production of biohydrogen. Thus, at the moment, biophotolysis is the least promising method for producing biohydrogen due to its low productivity.   3.3 Electrochemical methods 3.3.1 Electrolysis Microbially catalyzed electrolysis cells produce biohydrogen during the fermentation of soluble organic matter contained in wastewater by passing a small amount of electrical current. The microbial electrolysis cell is a modern alternative option for biohydrogen production. Electrochemically active microalgae produce carbon dioxide and electrons, which are transferred through the anode to the cathode with an external voltage [117 ], combining with hydrogen atoms in solution and then releasing H+ . Therefore, the efficiency of biohydrogen production is enhanced in the presence of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic microorganisms inoculated into a biomass source such as wastewater in an electrolyser.  3.3.2 Photoelectrochemical method The microbial photoelectrochemical cell is an advanced technology that produces biohydrogen from organic waste through light-assisted synergistic microbial conversion. Semiconductors and sunlight are used directly in a photoelectrochemical process to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. During the photoelectrochemical process, water molecules are oxidized, which leads to the formation of oxygen and the reduction of biohydrogen, since the formation of H2 occurs at the opposite electrode [118 ]. Thus, it is believed that this method of producing biohydrogen is promising, but with the condition that some of its disadvantages are eliminated. The main limitations of this method are.• loss of electrons necessary for the process of methanogenesis,  • metabolic diversity and electrode (anode) resistance,  • complex connection diagram in the cell design, power supply,  • problems with membranes such as high cost, biofilm fouling, substrate and gas transfer, and long-term stability,  • cathode-related obstacles including long-term stability, high catalyst cost, side reactions, and electrode resistance.    The use of microbial fuel cells is currently low due to low power output [119 ] and high capital costs for production. Also, the main disadvantages of electrochemical methods are considered to be instability of operation, impossibility of scaling, and high losses of biohydrogen during its production. However, according to scientists, this is a fairly promising technology for producing molecular hydrogen based on the recycling of wastewater ingredients [119 ,120 ], combining a high theoretical yield of biohydrogen, as well as a high degree of biomass decomposition. Future research in this area should aim to improve the shortcomings identified above [121 ]. Microbiological electrolysis cells work effectively in combination with the dark fermentation method. The use of a combined method can provide an increase in biohydrogen yield by approximately 98% compared to a single-stage process [122 ], but at the moment this is not economically feasible.   3.4 Genetic engineering Genetic engineering is one of the promising and innovative areas for increasing the yield of biohydrogen. Currently, several approaches to genetic modification of microalgae have been developed to increase H2  yield [123 ,124 ]. To improve the ability of a microalgae strain to produce biohydrogen, various mutations, or genetic modifications through gene knockout, are used. However, these developments are associated with the risks of obtaining non-specific strains, which either do not affect or worsen the yield of a valuable product. Mutant strains are mainly studied by dark fermentation. The use of modified strains in the production of biohydrogen by dark fermentation made it possible to increase the yield of biohydrogen by 5 times [125–127 ]. Advances in genetic engineering technology are also helping to reduce the oxygen sensitivity of biomass enzymes while increasing H2  yield. However, more in-depth study of this method is necessary before it can be used on an industrial scale.  3.5 Comparison of existing technologies for the production of biohydrogen from biomass microalgae It was found that the most popular methods for producing biohydrogen from microalgae are fermentation and biophotolysis methods. At the moment, they are the most frequently encountered in the scientific literature, and various studies related to modifications of these methods for obtaining H2  prove a high level of interest in them. Therefore, in Table 1  , these methods were compared to determine the most effective way to obtain biohydrogen from microalgae. Analyzing Table 1 , we can come to the conclusion that at the moment the most effective technology for producing biohydrogen from microalgae is dark fermentation. The main advantages of this technology, which distinguishes it from others.• the process does not require oxygen and solar radiation, which makes it more efficient and less energy-consuming. This makes the technology more cost-effective and cost-sustainable.  • during the dark fermentation process, up to 135 ml of H2/g is released, providing the highest yield of biohydrogen among other methods. In this process, microalgae are decomposed by bacteria under anaerobic conditions, resulting in high biogas productivity.  • dark fermentation allows the use of different types of microalgae, which makes this method more flexible and versatile.    Overall, dark fermentation technology for producing biohydrogen from microalgae is considered to be the most effective technology due to its high productivity, cost-effectiveness, flexibility and environmental sustainability. It is also important to note that in this table only the most popular currently used methods for obtaining biohydrogen were considered. However, based on the literature review, it can be concluded that the method combining photofermentation and dark fermentation is, in the long term, the most effective and sustainable. Also an important trend in innovative discoveries in the field of biohydrogen production is the use of genetic engineering. Thus, it can be assumed that the most promising direction in the field of biohydrogen energy now is the use of microalgae strains modified by genetic engineering in a process combining photofermentation and dark fer006Dentation.   4 Discussion The process of producing biohydrogen from microalgae is a promising way to produce energy with the least environmental impact. However, most scientists agree that at the moment the technology requires certain improvements related to the following problems that arise in the process of producing biohydrogen.• low yield of biohydrogen [136 ]. Currently, the efficiency of biohydrogen production from microalgae is still relatively low compared to other hydrogen production methods. This means that large quantities of microalgae are required to produce significant volumes of biohydrogen and the process may not be economically efficient;  • low efficiency of biomass conversion;  • sensitivity of some biomass enzymes to oxygen [137];  • high capital costs for commercial scaling [138]. One of the main technological difficulties in producing biohydrogen from microalgae is providing optimal conditions for their cultivation, collection and decomposition. This may require significant investment in infrastructure and processing equipment;  • problems arising with the storage and transportation of the obtained biohydrogen [37 ];  • environmentally friendly disposal of by-products [37 ];  • bioreactors that can be depressurized [136 ].    Thus, if innovative discoveries in the field of biohydrogen production lead to significant reductions in capital costs at commercial scale-up, this technology could generate great interest in its commercialization and implementation.  5 Conclusion Biohydrogen production from microalgae represents a promising and environmentally sustainable solution for providing clean energy. The technology of dark fermentation of microalgae for the production of biohydrogen stands out for its efficiency, as it allows you to obtain the largest amount of biohydrogen at minimal cost. This method has the potential to become an important tool in the renewable energy sector and can meet clean energy needs while reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Another promising direction in the field of biohydrogen production is the use of mutant strains modified through genetic engineering during the dark fermentation process. One of the innovative directions for producing biohydrogen is the use of such strains in a process that combines the methods of photofermentation and dark fermentation. However, it should be noted that the practical implementation of this technology requires further research and development of engineering solutions. It is important to continue to work on optimizing the process for producing biohydrogen from microalgae, as well as developing methods to improve its efficiency and economic feasibility. Overall, the use of microalgae to produce biohydrogen represents a promising alternative for providing clean energy to society in the future.
