One of the goals, i.e. Goal 16, covers access to justice for all by buildings effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. For this reason, in the 2030 Agenda, fighting corruption is critical towards realising a sustainable future. In doing so, we must practise fairness, discontinue illegal financial flows, and prevent corruption. Corruption exists within the public and private sectors, and today, it also exists in international institutions, religious institutions, volunteer bodies and sports organizations. This is especially crucial in the public sector because of the trust and accountability in handling taxpayers'monies and public funds. The corruption problem needs to be resolved as there is a strong link between corruption and poverty. Corruption is a stumbling block in achieving SDGs. Other acute consequences of corruption are loss of national resources, unsustainable development, environmental deprivation, imbalanced allocation of wealth, increasing poverty, instable economy, poor delivery of public services, economic growth stagnation, loss of foreign investment interest, rising administrative and management costs, as well as political instability. One of the most valued human attributes that is constantly being attacked is integrity. This element of fundamental principle of ethics is preached but may not be practised sincerely by professionals or employees working in both public and private sectors. Since the global corporate scandals over the last few decades and the current arrests of corruption suspects, the term ‘integrity’ has always been negatively associated with corruption and lack of accountability. Transparency International (2016a)  concisely defined integrity as “ behaviours and actions consistent with a set of moral or ethical principles and standards, embraced by individuals as well as institutions that create a barrier to corruption”. Meanwhile, the term ‘public sector’ refers to the government and its dispensed components that use public monies for providing services and improving the quality of the citizens' lives without any profit motives. Integrity is a substance of good governance and its management is a precondition for carrying out proper public-sector activities (Maesschalck, 2009 ). The integrity framework is an overall approach that consists of instruments, processes, and structures for improving integrity and reducing corruption in government agencies. As well, Maesschalck (2009)  systematized four main functions, namely, determining and defining integrity, guiding towards integrity, monitoring integrity, and enforcing integrity. In this way, policy makers and managers in government agencies benefit from the framework in terms of gaining the support to implement the policy and the support data to implement the integrity instruments. Lacking integrity has many consequences including a tarnished image, encouraging fraudulent activities and corruption, as well as public distrust. Political, economic, social and environmental are among the aspects which are badly impacting the society as a result of corruption (Transparency Perception Index, 2016a ). In a self-governing system, organizations evade their legitimacy when they are mistreated for personal interest. From the economic position, corruption weakens a nation's wealth. On the other hand, from the social perspective, corruption lessens people's trust on the institution and political leadership. An integrity system is vital in ensuring accountability and transparency for government agencies to conduct public matters, manage public monies and comply with laws and regulations (Said et al., 2015 ). This integrity system can be strengthened by having a transparent risk management framework, which is aligned to good governance (Maizatul et al., 2016 ) that spells out clearly the responsibilities of public officials and bodies (Said et al., 2016 ). In the private sector, good corporate governance plays a key role in maintaining corporate integrity and managing the risk of corporate fraud, as well as combating against management misconduct and corruption (Agyei-Mensah, 2017 ). The transparency mechanism allows disclosure of information, which enables the evaluation by investors on the organizations’ allocation of resource management (Agyei-Mensah, 2017 ). One way to improve communication regarding the integrity framework is via disclosure as asserted by Midin et al. (2017) , whereby the study stated that disclosure is an essential element in achieving good governance. Both internal and external stakeholders (Joseph et al., 2016 ) need to be informed on the organizations' anti-corruption practices (Coonjohn and Lodin, 2011 ). Thus, the local authority's integrity framework should be accessible, relevant and consistent with other policies (IBAC, 2015 ). In this paper, local authorities were used as the sampled organizations due to the resources and responsibilities entrusted to them, which indicates the importance “to operate efficiently and effectively and continuously seek to improve their capacity to prevent corrupt conduct” (IBAC, 2015 , p.3). This study examines the local authorities' integrity disclosures via websites in Malaysia and Indonesia. Both Malaysia and Indonesia were selected as the unit analysis in this study because they are one of the most important bilateral countries in Southeast Asia (Clark and Pietsch, 2014 ). It is also widely known that Malaysia and Indonesia are highly regulated countries with similar cultures, in particular their governments to curb corruption activities. Both countries are now still combating corruption and stand to increase integrity. One of the efforts to achieve higher integrity as a nation is to also improve integrity in local authorities. Fletcher (2015) , a local government minister of Australia, stated that as a nation, the local authority has a key role to play a significant contribution, including establishing integrity to support sustainability. Hence, this provides motivation for this paper – that is to examine the extent of integrity framework information disclosed on Malaysian and Indonesian local authorities’ websites, as integrity is an essential element towards achieving SDG 16, i.e. providing just, peaceful and inclusive societies. Local authorities in Indonesia are based on Constitution No. 32 in 2004. Based on this Constitution, Indonesia is divided into one autonomous region consisting of The Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia, which is subdivided into provinces. Provinces are then divided into districts and cities. In Malaysia, there are three types of local authorities, namely, city councils, municipal councils, and district councils. These criteria are based on the Secretary General Circular, The Ministry of Housing and Local Government No 4/2008 and issued on 1 July 2008 (Ministry of Housing and Local Government, 2008 ). As part of Malaysia's efforts in combating corruption and promoting integrity in the society, a number of initiatives have been undertaken by the government. Almost four decades, several reform initiatives have been introduced to promote a good governance system. The Anti-Corruption Agency and the Public Accounts Committee are examples of the major institutional establishments (Siddique, 2010 ). In the Government Transformation Program (GTP) agenda introduced in 2010, the fighting of corruption is included in the National Key Results Areas (Pemandu, 2015 ). The establishment of Integrity Unit also took place under the GTP initiative (Ismail et al., 2016 ). The Prime Minister's directive was announced that gives mandate of the Integrity and Governance Committee set up in all departments of ministries and states in June 2014. In collaboration works with the Ministry of Higher Education, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) held talks on integrity and prevention of corruption as a module in the higher education curriculum (Bernama, 2017 ). “Client's Charter's”, “Integration of Islamic Values”, “Excellent Work Culture”, “Code of Work Ethics” and the setting up of National Institute of Integrity (Said et al., 2015; Kapeli and Mohamed, 2015; Maizatul et al., 2016 ) are examples of the initiatives that provide service quality, improve accountability, and instil positive values. The SDG principles are entrenched in every facet of Malaysia's development carried out under the 11th Malaysia Plan from 2016 to 2020 (Arumugam, 2017 ). Notwithstanding all the public sector's reform agenda, this sector is yet the focus of blames and criticisms due to (among others) unsatisfactory performances and weak accountability (Maizatul et al., 2016 ). These formal measures are condemned to be deficient in reducing society's illegal transactions and wrong-doings (Siddique, 2010 ). Apparently, there has been no significant improvement in the number of corruption cases, which potentially becomes a stumbling block towards realising the SDGs in the public sector. For example, as at June 2018, the total number of arrests in Malaysia comprised 31 cases with 13 cases involving government servants. The statistics showed that 41.34% of the total corruption offenders involved government officials. Transparency International-Malaysia (TI-M) released the findings of the 2017 Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Asia Pacific Region, which surveyed the public's perceptions of corruption and the government's effectiveness in tackling corruption. As highlighted by Transparency International Malaysia (2017) , the institutions which were perceived to be involved in corruption in Malaysia were the following: the police department (57%), local government, and councillors (48%), tax officials (48%), business executives (46%), government officials (45%), representatives in legislature (41%), Prime Minister and his officials (41%), judges and magistrates (33%), as well as religious leaders (31%). Corruption cases are probably caused by the lack of awareness and appreciation on institutional mechanisms, such as the National Integrity Plan, (Abdullah and Abdullah, 2016 ), indicating a likelihood of poor communication on the integrity framework throughout the organization. For this reason, Joseph et al. (2017)  suggested on the reassessment of all institutional mechanisms due to the critics of the Malaysian public sector's reform initiatives in combating all unethical practices. Rules, regulations, and directives in relation with integrity system initiatives and implementation in the public sector from the Corruption Eradication Commission, the Republic of Indonesia's official website are as follows:a. Constitution No. 8 in 1981- about Constitution Book of Criminal Procedure Law  b. Constitution No. 28 in 1999 - about Clean and Free Country Enforcement from Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism  c. Constitution No. 31 in 1999 - about Combating Criminal Act of Corruption  d. Government Regulation No. 71 in 2000 - about Enforcement Procedures of Citizen Participation and Award Granting in Preventing and Combating Criminal Act of Corruption  e. Constitution No. 20 in 2001 - about Amendment of Constitution No. 31 in 1999 - about Combating Criminal Act of Corruption  f. Constitution No. 30 in 2002 - about Commission of Combating Corruption Criminal Act  g. Constitution No. 8 in 2010 - about Criminal Act of Money Laundering  h. Constitution No. 46 in 2009 - about Court of Corruption Criminal Act    (Source https://www.kpk.go.id/id/tentang-kpk/Constitution-pendukung ). One effective way to share the integrity initiative information, such as anti-corruption practices (ACP) is via the organization's website. Apart from having an engagement with stakeholders using the website, to cultivate good governance, ethics and integrity need to be exhibited in the government's activities. At the same time, the reports need to be publicly available to give awareness on the government's initiatives in reducing delinquency among public officials. It is maintained in this paper that the integrity framework information disclosures on the local authorities' websites is necessary in enhancing good governance, that is in line with the public-sector reform agenda. This could be possibly explained using the coercive isomorphism under the institutional theory. Many cases involving integrity, such as corruption among government employees of several local authorities have put the Malaysian government on limelight around the world and tarnished the nation's image. This scenario has motivated us to study on how proactive are Malaysian and Indonesian governments in optimizing the current technology, that is using websites to communicate their integrity initiatives to internal and external users. By having regular dissemination on websites will enhance the public-sector integrity and accountability in line with the analysis made by Transparency International (2009)  and Gordon and Wynhoven (2003) . Further, the use of websites can be one strategy in intensifying public engagement and data sharing by local authorities in conjunction with the SDG 6. One of the SDG 6 targets, i.e. target 16.10, is related to the enactment and implementation of the right to information laws in realising the people's right to search, receive and impart information. The United Nations’ introduction to SDG 16 notes that corruption, bribery, tax evasion and related illicit financial flows deprive developing countries of around US$1.26 trillion per year (Transparency International, 2016b ). This goal obliges the member states to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”. In relation to this paper, there are three targets under SDG 16 which are connected to each other, namely:• Target 16.5: substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms  • Target 16.6: develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels  • Target 16.10: ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms in accordance with national legislation and international agreements (Transparency International, 2016b , p.8).    This paper specifically examines the extent of integrity framework being reported that is essential in combatting corruption (target 16.5), which needs to be communicated or disclosed in line with Target 16.6. In addition, target 16.10 could be possibly achieved via local authorities’ websites. In achieving SDGs, harmonized with the public-sector reform agenda and various institutional efforts undertaken by the public sector agencies in Malaysia and Indonesia, the following research questions are formulated:1. What is the extent of integrity framework information disclosed on Malaysian and Indonesian local authorities' websites?  2. What are the external forces under coercive isomorphism that explain the extent of integrity framework information disclosure?    The corresponding objective of the paper is to determine the extent of integrity framework (IF) information disclosure on Malaysian and Indonesian local authorities’ websites using the coercive isomorphism tenet. This paper is significant for the following reasons. Firstly, there is little published research examining the level of integrity framework disclosure in developing countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia. The findings would assist in helping regulatory authorities and policy makers to strengthen their mechanisms in upholding integrity. Secondly, this paper considers the institutional theory of isomorphism mechanism, namely, coercive, to enhance the understanding of integrity framework disclosure and add to the pool of literature. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2  presents the literature review; Section 3  explains the theoretical framework; Section 4  discusses the research methodology; Section 5  and Section 6  provide the analysis of results as well as discussions, respectively; and finally, Section 7  presents the concluding comments of the research.  2 Literature review Good governance requires that an organization is mindful of the interest of the surrounding community whilst at the same time strives to accomplish its organizational goals (Hess, 2009 ). It requires the organization to exhibit visible accountability and transparency in rendering its services. According to Said et al. (2016)  good governance refers to a guideline that spells out clearly the manner on how public officials discharge their responsibilities. To achieve good governance, disclosure is an essential element (see Midin et al., 2017; Bakar et al., 2011 ). Common criticisms faced by the public-sector organizations are deficient performance and ineffective accountability (Tooley et al., 2010 ). Bakar et al. (2011)  asserted that it is not possible to achieve performance measurement objectives in promoting greater transparency and accountability if their development is not being disclosed. Similarly, in this paper, integrity details need to be disclosed to enhance transparency and accountability of government agencies. For example, in Australia, there was a report on the implementation of anti-corruption measures of 50 largest Australian public companies (ACCA, 2008 ). However, reports on bribery and corruption are often superficial and incomplete, such as inadequate public information on anti-corruption programs and procedures. Similarly, Joseph et al. (2016)  found that the anti-corruption practice (ACP) in Malaysian and Indonesian companies is still at its infancy stage. It is interesting to note that codes of conduct and whistle-blowing practices were the most reported items in both countries. Disclosure on anti-corruption strategies to the public complements a company's actual engagement and commitment in anti-corruption initiatives. This can increase credibility of the company in fighting corrupt practices. Likewise, ethic and integrity need to be exhibited in the government's activities and the reports need to be publicly available to give awareness on the government's initiatives in reducing delinquency among public officials to cultivate good governance (Maizatul et al., 2016 ). Anti-corruption efforts (including disclosure) are recognised as a crucial part of delivering sustainable development that underpin the achievement and sustainability of all other SDGs (Transparency International, 2016b ). Published studies in Malaysia (see Aziz et al., 2015; Said et al., 2015; Said et al., 2016 ) made an effort to associate accountability with integrity. Aziz et al. (2015) , for instance, concluded that there are associations between accountability with the integrity system, internal control system, and leadership qualities. This study asserted that these elements will not only enhance public-sector accountability but also build up confidence among stakeholders and reduce accusation against government officials on the abuse of powers, such as cronyism and favouritism. Said et al. (2016) , in a similar note, found that in the Malaysian public sector, strategic planning, audit and fraud control are the determinants of integrity practice. The study stressed that significant attention must be given to these factors in improving integrity and efficiency of the public sector. The study also suggested that corporate ethics and integrity systems should be institutionalised to dent on corruption. In an earlier study by Said et al. (2015) , it was found that about 87.3% of departments and agencies in Malaysia practised accountability. This signifies that the government is on the correct pathway to restore public trust, but the emphasis on accountability factor differs across the service schemes. In understanding corruption risk and corruption prevention mechanisms, it was found that 80% of the effort was on detection and investigation, and only 20% on prevention (ARI, 2016 ). The finding of the study was not in line with the slogan ‘Prevention is better than cure’. Therefore, it is suggested that such strategy must be changed to focus more on preventive measures in order to effectively mitigate the risk of corrupt practices. This can possibly be supported by social accountability via transparent website disclosure, which is the main subject of this paper. One commendable initiative regarding the integrity framework is the one created and developed by Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission (IBAC) and agencies in Victorian Public Service in Australia. The main purpose of this framework is to provide a guideline on public sector officials in discharging their responsibilities. Government staff and the public can use this framework to understand Victoria's integrity system and use it to identify and remedy unethical and corrupt practices. According to IBAC (2015) , an effective integrity framework must have the essential elements of risk assessments, policies, procedures, and good organizational cultures that can help a council minimize corruption risks as well as mechanisms to help it detect possible corrupt practices at the earliest possible stage. Other important elements are community accessibility and awareness of the council's ethical standards to hold the council's employees to be more accountable and committed in combating unethical and corrupt practices. In relation to advancement in information technology (IT), Said et al. (2015)  highlighted that website disclosure could enhance integrity. One of the benefits of reporting on the web is that it enables a two-way communication between the government and citizens (Wescott, 2001 ). It has been found that the use of IT in e-government improves efficiency and is cost-effectiveness, as well as provides convenient services, greater accessibility and accountability. It has also been confirmed that corruption can eventually be reduced through e-government (Lupu and Laz, 2015 ). Social scrutiny, where digital citizens can request for information and seek legal litigation against government officials for non-compliance with stipulated rules and regulations published in the websites, can make the mechanisms very transparent (Mungiu-Pippidi and Dadaso, 2016 ). There are a few studies pertaining to the disclosures on ACP using websites (see Transparency International, 2009; Gordon and Wynhoven, 2003; IBAC, 2015 ). Transparency International (2009)  analysed the ACP disclosure by the Forbes Global 250 companies that related to overall organizational practices and concluded that firms frequently reported high-level of strategic commitments to anti-corruption efforts. Meanwhile, Gordon and Wynhoven (2003)  reported that 43% of the top 100 non-financial enterprises disclosed anti-corruption information on websites. The findings by IBAC (2015)  on Victoria's councils revealed that all the six councils published information about their protected disclosure procedures on their websites and annual reports. The extent of disclosure was varied. One council published more information including its risk management framework, staff code of conduct and policies in relation to fraud prevention, compliance and enforcement and reimbursement of expenses. A range of other policies were published on its websites by one council. Media releases in relation to grants and donations were also issued by the same council, which raised public awareness and ensured transparency. Publication of staff code and a range of other policies online by one of the councils were considered as its ‘contracts with the community’. Institutional theory can be used to explore and examine the reporting on a firm's engagement with corruption process (Barkemeyera et al., 2015 ), which will be explained next.  3 Theoretical framework Institutional theory links an organization's practices to societal values. The theory provides an explanation on why organizations tend to take on similar characteristics, forms and processes including similar reporting practices (Deegan, 2013 ). The concept of ‘institution’ is something that is central to the institutional theory. According to Scott (2011) , an institution comprises ‘regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive elements that, together with associated activities and resources, provide stability and meaning to social life. The regulative pillar is maintained through various ‘coercive’ mechanisms, many of which are enforced by the government or powerful constituents that organizations are dependent upon. On the other hand, the normative pillar is maintained through processes, such as accreditations, professional endorsement, and formal education. This cultural-cognitive pillar is maintained by the mimetic mechanisms in which organizations tend to imitate (or copy) others (Deegan, 2013 ). There are two dimensions of the institutional theory: isomorphism and decoupling. Isomorphism, i.e. a conception used in this paper, refers to ‘a constraining process that forces one unit in a population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions’ (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983 , p.149). There are three types of isomorphism under the institutional theory: coercive, mimetic, and normative. Coercive isomorphism change involves pressures from other organizations in which they are dependent upon and by cultural expectations from society, such as governmental mandates, contract law and financial reporting requirement (Deegan, 2013 ), as well as political influence and public at large (Amran and Devi, 2008 ). Under the institutional theory, organizations will adopt particular practices, such as disclosure practices because of institutional pressures. The institutional theory is related to the legitimacy theory, whereby organizations seek to ensure they operate based on society's expectations (Deegan, 2007 ). Legitimacy theorists often rely on the notion that there is a ‘social contract’ between the organization and the society in which it operates. In gaining legitimacy for the society's acceptance, big organizations are more visible and receive greater attention from the state, media, professional groups and the general public (Luoma and Goodstein, 1999 ) and they are inclined to exhibit fabrications about their social activities. By integrating an external formal structure, commitment of internal and external stakeholders will be improved (Meyer and Rowan, 1977 ). An organization's formal structure is “highly institutionalised and functions as myths” (Meyer and Rowan, 1977 , p. 344). To establish corporate legitimacy, public information disclosure is important (Deegan, 2013 ). An example of the strategic behaviour in adhering to institutional environment is integrity framework disclosure (Oliver, 1991 ). In this study, coercive isomorphism is used to examine the integrity framework disclosures on the Malaysian and Indonesian local authorities' websites.  4 Research methodology The data collected in this study were based on a content analysis of inclusion or exclusion of integrity framework information disclosed on the Malaysian and Indonesian local authorities' websites. The disclosures in the website were analysed as websites provide the most publicly available information which can be used as a reliable source of data. Further, both Malaysia and Indonesia are still practicing voluntarily disclosures for integrity information in their local authorities’ websites. Content analysis has long been applied in disclosure studies, such as, Amran and Devi (2008), Krippendorff (1980), Hackstone and Milne (1996) , and others. Content analysis is one of the powerful methods to quantify the qualitative information which helps us analyse the practices through disclosures (Krippendorff, 1980 ). Hence, it is useful and relevant in measuring the extent of integrity framework information disclosures by applying the content analysis technique. The Integrity Framework Disclosure Index (IFDi) was developed by Joseph et al. (2017)  based on the following: i) the Malaysian government circular – “Pekeliling Ketua Setiausaha Kementerian Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan (KPKT) Bil. 1 Tahun 2008, Penggredan Sistem Penarafan Bintang Pihak Berkuasa Tempatan (SPB-PBT) “, ii) the IBAC(2015) and the Public Sector Integrity Management Framework for Republic of South Africa, iii) the analysis of hard copies of integrity policies of several local authorities available from websites or the internet, i.e. Sibu Municipal Council, Ampang Jaya Municipal Council, Subang Jaya Municipal Council and Sabak Bernam District Council, and iv) the analysis of websites of two local authorities in 10 states (excluding Federal Territory, Perlis and Penang). The final IFDi instrument consists of 13 categories and 47 items. The 13 categories are selected because an integrity framework is an overall approach that consists of instruments, processes, and structures for improving integrity and reducing corruption in government agencies. In addition, according to IBAC (2015) , an effective integrity framework must have the essential elements of risk assessments, policies, procedures, and good organizational cultures that can help a council minimize corruption risks as well as mechanisms to help it detect possible corrupt practices at the earliest possible stage. The categories and items in each category are defined by referring to the actual disclosure on websites and the national and international guidelines relating to the integrity practices in local authorities. The details of each category are as follows:1) Definition of Integrity – a general statement about the meaning of integrity  2) Objectives – statements of organizational goals relating to efficient administration, integrity and transparent; integrity and excellent service; practicing positive values; issues and problem solving; improve awareness level, commitment and cooperation among staff; inculcate ethical and integrity culture; improve the integrity management and administration  3) Integrity Policy – a set of guiding principles that consist of understanding and appreciation; improving awareness and commitment; encouraging the spirit of responsibility; contributing towards efforts and ethical values; directives and circulars; positive attributes, National Integrity Plan  4) Integrity Commitment – assurance statements which cover core values of society; a set of moral values; organization's code of conduct  5) Elements in Code of Ethics – specific elements, i.e. commitment, teamwork, competence, professionalism, integrity  6) Scope and Responsibility – include tasks under the integrity management, i.e. establishment of procedures, guidelines and circulars; compliance with values and ethics; commitment to the implementation of service delivery with efficiency; reporting unethical act to relevant authority; prevent misconduct activities and corruption  7) National Integrity Plan – a general plan that will be the catalyst for the attainment of the objective in enhancing integrity which consists of a strategic action plan; strategic integrity plan; and strategic integrity approach  8) Strategic Action Plan – a specific strategy to uphold integrity, i.e. enhancing the effectiveness of governance; enhancing the effectiveness of service delivery system; conducting awareness programs to combat corruption, embezzlement and abuse of power; strengthening justice and disciplinary management system; strengthening human resource management; and strengthening the monitoring system  9) Strategic Integrity Approach – a specific technique to uphold integrity, i.e. education; enforcement; internalization of values; monitoring; counselling and rehabilitation; client's charter  10) Vision - A fundamental statement of an organization's values, aspirations, and goals that include integrity concept or implementation.  11) Mission – A more specific statement than the vision that includes integrity concept or implementation.  12) Integrity Reporting Channel – any mechanism set up to encourage the staff to blow the whistle or report any irregularities in the organization.  13) Type of Activities-any activities organized to improve the awareness on integrity, for example, a public forum on the anti-corruption culture.    In this study, coders in the respective countries carried out the data collection separately by awarding score 1 for appropriate disclosure and 0 for absence of disclosure. However, the analysis of data was combined for both countries. To reduce subjectivity and boost reliability, two coders performed the content analysis in each country. The information from the website was downloaded and printed from 1 November 2016 to 31 December 2016. A comparative analysis of the frequency of sub-categorizations was tabulated and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.0. The sample selection of this research was based on Indonesia's official government websites from Indonesia's 34 provinces (http://www.mikirbae.com/2015/11/kedudukan-dan-peran-pemerintah-daerah.html ) and Malaysia's 51 city and municipal councils (http://jkt.kpkt.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/15 ). In relation to organization's size, as stated by Luoma and Goodstein (1999, p. 556), “large organizations are more visible and hence subject to greater attention from external constituencies, such as the state, media, professional groups and the general public”. This supports the basis of the sample selection in this paper, namely, large organizations that are highly visible to different groups of stakeholders.  5 Analysis of data 5.1 Descriptive analysis The website disclosures of integrity framework were examined based on the 13 aspects and the results are descriptively presented in Table 1   through Table 3  . Briefly, the disclosures range from the definition of integrity to types of activities that promote an integrity culture. To answer the first research question posited in this paper, based on the website disclosures, the 34 Indonesian local governments or provinces outperformed Malaysia's 51 city and municipal councils' disclosures. The average website disclosure for Indonesia was 28.62 (29) items out of 47 items under study as compared to just 4.29 (four) items disclosed in Malaysia (see Table 3 ). For Indonesia, the average is derived from the total disclosure score 973, which is divided by 34 provinces. Whereas, for Malaysia, the average is derived from the total disclosure score 217, which is divided by 51 councils. As can be seen in Table 1 , vision, mission and reporting channel were widely disclosed in Indonesia's 34 provinces. Almost all 33 out of 34 (97%) of the provinces disclosed these three items on their websites. This was followed by integrity reporting channel (94%) and type of activities (88%). Strategic action plan and objectives also registered commendable disclosure patterns. In Malaysia, only two items, i.e. objectives and elements of ethics, were fairly disclosed on the local authorities' websites. The details of disclosures by the provinces or councils for Indonesia and Malaysia are presented in Table 2   and Table 3 , respectively. It was clearly observed that the Indonesian local authorities disclosed more integrity information as compared to their counterparts in Malaysia. As can be seen in Table 2 , ten (10) out of 34 provinces or 29.41% scored more than 38 items or 80% of IFDIs items and seven (7) or 20.59% scored between 34 and 37 items or 70–80%. The overall scored of all the provinces or councils for Indonesia was 973 IFDi items or 60.89%. In Malaysia, website disclosure on the issue of integrity was still very much lacking as indicated by the low counts of integrity items under investigation. Results in Table 3  reveals the range of IFDi disclosure items as well as the average of disclosure per city council or municipal council. The highest IFDI disclosure was by Johor with 71 items or an average of 10.14 and two city councils did not disclose anything. As can be observed in Tables 2 and 3 , the Indonesian provinces disclosed much more integrity information as compared to their Malaysian counterparts in all the categories when the research was conducted. It was apparent that majority of the Indonesian provinces disclosed not less than 18 items out of 47 items, whereas the Malaysian counterparts disclosed less than 18 items. In Malaysia, all, except the local authorities in the State of Johor, disclosed less than 18 items of the integrity information on their websites.  5.2 Group comparison using Kruskal Wallis Test The difference in integrity framework disclosure index based on the websites between these two countries was further analysed using the Kruskal Wallis test. The Kruskal-Wallis test results as depicted in Table 4   and Table 5   revealed a statistically significant difference in the integrity framework disclosure index between these two different groups (Group 1 Indonesia, n = 34, Group 2 Malaysia, n = 51). The mean ranks showed that the Indonesian group registered a higher score of 65.35 as compared to the Malaysian counterparts, which was 26.96.   6 Discussion This study shows that Indonesian local authorities provide more comprehensive disclosures in integrity framework compared to Malaysian respectively. This section attempts to provide insights to discuss the external forces under coercive isomorphism which is also answering the second research question. The first force under coercive isomorphism that explains the extent of integrity framework information disclosure by Indonesian local authorities is related to legitimacy. Legitimacy concept is often used to explain the practice of corporate social responsibilities, and very limited discussions are applied in the context of local government institutions. However, according to Barkemeyer (2007) , in developing countries, the common practice is that, organizations or groups of organizations adapt to their institutional environments in order to manage legitimacy. Legitimacy is not seen as an operational resource, but rather as a set of external constraints, forming the actions of the organization (Patten, 1992; Hahn, 2005 ). Institutional branch of organizational legitimacy theory is seen to be well suited to contribute insight discussions of the higher amount of disclosures in the Indonesian local governments’ websites compared to those in Malaysia, which is closely tied to the coercive isomorphism tenet under the institutional theory. The second force under coercive isomorphism that explains the extent of integrity framework information disclosures by Indonesian local authorities is related to public visibility. The Indonesian local authorities are more proactive in their integrity initiatives implementation, which is translated into reporting as they would like to create a good image for the public. This phenomenon seems similar to the Indonesian companies, which like to disclose positive information in order to establish their positive image (Gunawan, 2015; Gunawan, 2016 ). Further, every Indonesian local authority has its autonomy in disclosing the activities or any principles independently, so the competition to be ‘looked good’ in different areas is quite high (see Table 2 ). The stiff competition, i.e. to be more visible in the public's perspective, creates higher disclosure in integrity reporting. The finding was consistent with the study by Joseph et al. (2016) , who carried out a comparative study on anti-corruption practice (ACP) disclosures between the Malaysian and Indonesian best practices companies. It was found that the Indonesian companies significantly disclosed higher ACP information in CSR stand alone and annual reports compared to the Malaysian companies. Therefore, it can be maintained that regardless of any research setting (private or public-sector organizations) or unit of analysis examined (websites versus hardcopy reports), Indonesia appears to be more proactive in combating unlawful transactions, which in turn results in greater transparency and accountability that is in line with Target 16.6 under SDG 16. The third force under coercive isomorphism that explains the extent of integrity framework information disclosures by the Indonesian local authorities is related to public sector reform, which is closely associated with isomorphism (Midin et al., 2017 ). In line with the public sector reform agenda, several management practices are being applied, including decentralization. Decentralization that creates autonomy in every area in Indonesia is considered as an important element of participatory democracy, and thus, there is freedom for each local authority to disclose its integrity on the website. This high amount of disclosures may show that the local authorities seek to gain legitimacy from the public as their primary stakeholders, while electronic media, namely, websites are often viewed as the right place to report ‘good things’. Firman (2010)  addressed that the implementation of Indonesia's decentralization reform has resulted in a fragmentation of regional development, in which many of the local authorities consider themselves as their own ‘kingdom of authority’. This attitude could be a reason to describe the rapid growth in regional proliferation in Indonesia that has turned into high disclosures on their websites. The fourth force under coercive isomorphism that explains the extent of integrity framework information disclosures by the Indonesian local authorities is related to the institutional support structures. The government of Indonesia has introduced the Open Government Data (OGD) to promote public sector's transparency, accountability, integrity and performance. Indonesia's central open data portal is reflected as one of the country's current OGP commitments and is intended to provide a better approach to important data sets and improve transparency of key public sector activities (OECD, 2017 ). Indonesia has been proactive in undertaking initiatives to realise the governance targets as laid out in Goal 16 and to support the processes for inclusive design, implementation and monitoring of all SDGs; for example, through its creation of the National SDG Secretariat in 2016 and the establishment of the National Open Government Secretariat in 2015 (which was built on previous government initiatives to support open government reforms). This relates to the regulative pillar, which is maintained through various ‘coercive’ mechanisms, in which many aspects are enforced by the government or powerful constituents that organizations are dependent upon (Scott, 2011 ). In this way, in the collaboration between National SDG Secretariat and National Open Government Secretariat, website can be used to encourage the SDG achievement and promote participation from the public (www.oecdinsights.org ). There are several reasons that possibly contribute to lower disclosure of integrity framework in formation by Malaysian local authority websites, which are not merely explained by different levels of coercive factors. Firstly, the lack of disclosure of integrity information on the websites by Malaysia's local authorities can be perceived as not capitalising on the current internet technology to disseminate integrity information to the Malaysian public. Similar to the Malaysian private sector setting, it can also be construed as less transparent and lacked coercive factors to influence the disclosures (see Joseph et al., 2016 ). This observation was confirmed by one of the city councils, whose IFDi score was not quite satisfactory. If all their integrity initiatives were to be reported via the websites, their scores could easily show a very good disclosure index. Further investigation including interviews and reviews of documents revealed that there was a lot more information yet to be reported on the websites. Secondly, people nowadays do not quite prefer queuing up at government counters for information that they can obtain by other means, such as websites. The only issue regarding website disclosure is perhaps reliable internet connection and well-maintained websites. Information must be constantly updated to render its usefulness for the public. This type of disclosure is certainly appreciated by the educated public (Cheng, 1994 ), who normally demand for more information and be explained as a source of coercive isomorphism. However, in this paper, low disclosures on integrity framework were possibly due to the lack of pressures by stakeholders to disclose on such information. Thirdly, as can be observed from Table 3 , the integrity disclosure index by city/municipal councils in Malaysia based on the websites was very low. This was due to the fact that Sabah and Sarawak and the Peninsular of Malaysia are governed by different ordinances, therefore, different rulings apply to these regions. In Sarawak, the councils are not autonomous as compared to their counterparts in the Peninsular of Malaysia. In Sarawak, policies and budgets for councils are decided and controlled by relevant ministries in Sarawak. Thus, the councils have limited resources to innovate (Joseph, 2011 ). The capability to innovate is also hindered by the lack of competent personnel to manage the websites (Joseph, 2011 ). In addition, in line with Joseph and Taplin (2011) , different states would impose on different policies on information technology, which might affect the different levels on website disclosures. Thus, the different levels of coercive pressures imposed by different states would have diverse impacts on the disclosures. Fourthly, poor website disclosures by the Malaysian city and municipal councils over the years have actually shined some insights on their unwillingness of the government to promote integrity. If the government publishes integrity information on the websites, such as awarded projects to companies or contractors based on open tenders, then the stakeholders might have fewer queries against the government mechanisms in awarding the contracts. The negative perceptions on the government in mishandling public fund may also improve. Lack of transparency and integrity information accessible to the public may have perpetuated the problem of kleptocracy. Most government agencies have key performance indicators (KPI) embedded in their visions and missions as a motivation to deliver their services. However, the current study found that there is a lack of commitment and confidence to uplift the value of integrity amongst the agencies. This may be due to the lack of support from the top management (Joseph, 2011 ), unclear policies, and possible conflict of interest among the implementing officials. Finally, with the latest advancement of information technology (IT), the current disclosure of integrity information is certainly not adequate to satisfy stakeholders’ expectations, and possibly hinder to advance SDG 16. If such information is already published in the pamphlet form, then there is a requirement to convert it into an IT-related disclosure. Publishing their integrity initiatives in a hard copy form has limited accessibility for the city councils as compared to publishing them online. In other words, online publication has wider readership which is in line with the expectation of new generations of people who always want those in governance to be transparent and accountable for what they are implementing in accordance with Target 16.6 under SDG 16. One of the reasons why the ruling party machineries or agencies are not quite willing to disclose everything on their website is because they are scared that the integrity information might be misused by the opposition parties for their political mileage and is best referred to as political competition. Krasa and Polborn (2012)  described political competition as a competition for political party for the ability to shape and control the content and direction of public policy, which is also a source of coercive isomorphism. This should not be a problem if those in powers are able to provide reasonable justifications for non-performance. This is consistent with the study of Gandia and Archidona (2008) , where political competition has a significant effect on website disclosure of information by Spanish local councils. The summary for low or high integrity framework disclosure is summarized in Fig. 1   below.  7 Conclusion, implication and future study The objective of the paper is to determine the extent of integrity framework information disclosures on Malaysian and Indonesian local authorities’ websites using the coercive isomorphism tenet by integrating three targets under SDG 16. In answering the first research question, the Indonesian provinces disclosed more integrity information as compared to their Malaysian counterparts in all the categories when the research was conducted. The average website disclosure for Indonesia was 29 items out of 47 items under study as compared to just four items disclosed in Malaysia. Even though this disclosure might not reflect the reality on the ground, nonetheless, the information obtained from the website analysis offers certain significance and is worthy of reporting. To answer the second research question, a few reasons for the low website disclosures by the Malaysian councils include: lack of information technology capitalization to disclose integrity framework information, lack of coercive factors (educated stakeholders), different state policy relating to information technology and lack of personnel to manage the websites, lack of support from the top management, and political competition. On the other hand, coercive factors which explain the extent of integrity information disclosed on the Indonesian local authorities’ websites include legitimacy, public visibility, public sector reform, and institutional support structures. There are managerial and practical implications from the findings of this study. Under the institutional theory, it seems that the managers of Malaysian local authorities need to improve their integrity disclosures on the websites in order to show how they apply integrity behaviour as trusted authorities who provide public services. Since the integrity disclosures were found to be low (an average of four items out of the total 47 items), it is important for the managers of Malaysian local authorities to improve their integrity by disclosing this information on their websites, and at the same time, this will help support the nation in achieving sustainability. Disclosing the information shows transparency, which enables them to improve their credibility from the public that will help achieve Target 16.6 under SDG 16. On the other hand, this study implies that the Indonesian local authorities need to demonstrate real actions to show their integrity as supports to the findings that the disclosures of this information were quite high (an average of 29 items out of the total 47 items). The information disclosed in the websites should provide trust and transparency, and this needs verifications. The public will know the local government's activities in building integrity, and therefore, the information should be reliable and not only for the purpose of gaining a good image. Real actions need to be shown, supported with reliable data and figures. Thus, the findings from this research can be used by the managers of local authorities to improve public perception on integrity and promote transparency and accountability by disclosing more information on the websites. What is worthy of reporting about the Indonesian local governments is that they are currently optimizing the use of information technology, which is relevant and appropriate to current generations who always want to be well-informed about the government's initiatives and policies. Hence, it is fair to conclude that the managers of Indonesian local authorities are more far-sighted, as well as transparent and competent in information technology due to the OGD policy. Other countries can learn from Indonesia's experience, and Indonesia itself can expand upon its success specifically in linking the open data and SDG initiatives. The current study is mainly based on website disclosures. It does not reflect the actual practice of the councils. In addition, some if not all the councils' websites are not updated with the latest information. Low disclosures by these Malaysian councils are due to the lack of competent human resource imply that there is an urgent need to recruit more Information Technology's personnel. This problem requires managers of the councils to make financial commitment in providing IT-related trainings or education to the staff concerned so that these staff will be more competent and confident in managing IT-based disclosures on integrity issues. In addition, there is also a need for the Malaysian government to have a clearer and better policy on website disclosure. To minimize negative perceptions about the council, it is important to act proactively in addressing the issues of accountability and transparency as expected by the stakeholders. By doing so, the stakeholders will have a favourable assessment about the councils, thus indirectly will improve the image of the councils. A good council cannot be effective if it is taking corrective actions just in response to complaints lodged by the unhappy stakeholders. Proactive attitude is vital for continual quality improvement. Continual quality improvement too also demands personal commitment of the top management of the councils to excel. At the organizational level, efforts should be made continuously to instil integrity and ethical values because people with integrity are unlikely to get involved in corruption in whatever circumstances. Basically, implementing and maintaining an effective anti-fraud bribery and corruption programme remains a prudent and recommended course of action to reduce the risk of violating anti-corruption statutes. Also, regular dissemination on anti-corruption policies, codes of ethics, rewards and punishment information must be done from time to time. This will help prevent, detect and respond to improper conducts as well as lessen the risk of fraud. These efforts are crucial to achieve the SDGs. Previously the Malaysian government has ‘Yang Menurut Perintah”  (According to Orders) as a slogan for any official letter issued. This is found to be no longer appropriate by the current Malaysian government at the federal level because the subordinates just implement the tasks as instructed without much question and less innovative ideas to solve problems effectively. The current Federal Government of Malaysia has proposed to change to slogan to ‘Yang Menjalankan Amanah’  (Running Trust), which is more reflective of their responsibility and accountability. This new slogan, to some extent, will push the officers to act responsibly and accountably. Future research can be conducted on the level of disclosures of integrity framework information based on coercive isomorphism due to changes in the ruling government of Malaysia after the 14th general election. In the same vein, at the higher level, the Malaysian government can learn from OECD on ways to raise awareness of the benefits of open data policies and initiatives in fighting corruption and increasing public sector transparency and integrity, which in turn, will lead to the achievement of SDGs. The OECD recommendation on public integrity provides policy makers with the blueprint for a public integrity strategy. In this manner, it is timely for the institutions to revisit the existing policies in curbing corruption in this country. This can be done by referring to policies of other countries that take corruption matters seriously, for example, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom. This paper is not without limitation. Content analysis method always addresses the issue of subjectivity (Gunawan, 2015 ) and this is inevitable. However, since this study applied not only one coder to awarding score, the subjectivity could be lower and the reliability in awarding score had been improved. As the scope of study only examined disclosures from the websites, the interpretation of results should only be based on the period of this study during its undertaking, considering that information in websites changes time to time. Future studies may need to continue this research by developing more updated disclosure lists by conducting a pilot study based on countries. A more detailed analysis could also be considered by applying interviews to gain more understanding in reasons for disclosed or non-disclosed information. Factors relevant in influencing the extent of disclosures in integrity information will also be interesting to be provided in future research.
