                  Rapid urbanization poses great challenges to China's urban land use sustainability (ULUS). Land is the essential space to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, so SDGs provide a new guide to evaluate land use sustainability. However, there is still a lack of SDGs-oriented assessment of urban land use at national level. Moreover, there is still a need to address the problems about the randomness and fuzziness within evaluation, which tends to cause more uncertainties. Here we developed a SDGs-oriented evaluation framework based on the cloud model and derived the spatial and temporal patterns of urban land use sustainability for China at the prefecture-level from 2004 to 2019. Then, we used the McKinsey matrix to classify the types of urban land use sustainability, and examined their main drivers using the Geodetector method. The results showed that the development level of ULUS in China was high in the east and low in the west. High-value hotspots were mainly distributed in primary and secondary urban agglomerations in China. From 2004 to 2019, the development level of ULUS in China gradually increased, but the growth rate slowed down. In 2009 the value of central China exceeded that of the northeast. In contrast, the coordination level of ULUS had declined in more than 50% of Chinese cities during the study period. The high values were in southern China, northeast China, and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, while the low values were in central and southern Liaoning and the urban agglomeration in the Central Plains. The development level was mainly controlled by anthropogenic activities and urban development, while natural conditions constrained the improvement of the coordination level. Combining the development and coordination, we found that cities with higher development level often had a wide range of coordination level, and suggestions were put forward for different regions to achieve sustainable land use. Our research provides scientific guidance for China's territory planning and sustainable urban development.

Table 2    Specific regions  Key ULUS results  Guidance for improving ULUS    Northeast China After 2009, the increase of the DI level slowed down caused by pollution-intensive industries. Strictly protect farmlands; adjust industrial structure, advocate cleaner production, and reduce urban resource consumption; develop ecological economy based on rich forest resources.  Eastern China The increased trends of DI have reversed in China's first-tier urban agglomerations from 2014 to 2019. limit the disorderly expansion of urban area, intensify land use, and build smart cities.  Central China Unbalanced allocation of land resources and extensive land use. Soil pollution and salinization exists in the north. Introduce emerging industries and developing advantageous industries; improve public services and enhance the city's attractiveness to labor; improve agricultural facilities to increase water use efficiency.  Western China Scarce land resources and low land productivity are the main limiting factors of land use sustainability. Conserve land resources; invest more capital, technology, talents, and labor through regional cooperation.  Southern China The life benefits of the land were not fully utilized. The DI level of this region was lower. Alleviate income disparity between urban and rural regions and achieve a fair and reasonable allocation of land resources; enhance infrastructure construction without destroying land-carrying capacity.  Southwest forest, Loess Plateau, northern desert The fragile land ecology and poor coordination were observed. Priority should be given to ecological preservation by carrying out ecological restoration projects, such as returning farmland to forests, and restoration of natural forests.

Rapid urbanization poses great challenges to China's urban land use sustainability (ULUS). Land is the essential space to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, so SDGs provide a new guide to evaluate land use sustainability. However, there is still a lack of SDGs-oriented assessment of urban land use at national level. Moreover, there is still a need to address the problems about the randomness and fuzziness within evaluation, which tends to cause more uncertainties. Here we developed a SDGs-oriented evaluation framework based on the cloud model and derived the spatial and temporal patterns of urban land use sustainability for China at the prefecture-level from 2004 to 2019. Then, we used the McKinsey matrix to classify the types of urban land use sustainability, and examined their main drivers using the Geodetector method. The results showed that the development level of ULUS in China was high in the east and low in the west. High-value hotspots were mainly distributed in primary and secondary urban agglomerations in China. From 2004 to 2019, the development level of ULUS in China gradually increased, but the growth rate slowed down. In 2009 the value of central China exceeded that of the northeast. In contrast, the coordination level of ULUS had declined in more than 50% of Chinese cities during the study period. The high values were in southern China, northeast China, and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, while the low values were in central and southern Liaoning and the urban agglomeration in the Central Plains. The development level was mainly controlled by anthropogenic activities and urban development, while natural conditions constrained the improvement of the coordination level. Combining the development and coordination, we found that cities with higher development level often had a wide range of coordination level, and suggestions were put forward for different regions to achieve sustainable land use. Our research provides scientific guidance for China's territory planning and sustainable urban development.

According to the dominant functions, land can be categorized into three types: production space, living space, and ecological space, reflecting the three attributes of the economy, society, and environment in sustainable development (Wang et al., 2021 ). The goal of land use sustainability is to ensure that the quantity and quality of land meet the demands for land resources of a growing population and rising living standards without exceeding the carrying capacity of the land system (Lu et al., 2021b ) through maximizing the production, living and ecological benefits of land resources. With the rapid socio-economic development and urbanization, global land is increasingly facing the crisis of resource scarcity and quality decline (Bryan et al., 2018 ; Xie et al., 2020a ), and the problems are more severe in urban areas of developing countries. China has experienced rapid urbanization over the past decade with an urbanization rate from 49.68% in 2010 to 63.89% in 2020, The rate is predicted to be 75%–80% by 2035 (Liu, 2021 ). Urban land use sustainability (ULUS) has been the key component of regional sustainable development. In 2015, the United Nations put forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which aim to deal with development issues in economy, society, and environment during the period 2016–2030, such as poverty, biodiversity loss, and so forth. The SDGs pose new research questions for the communities of sustainability science and land use science: how can we include the SDGs into land use sustainability assessment to inform our land use planning and policy-making for achieving sustainability (Xie et al., 2020b ). There are numerous studies on land use sustainability theoretically and practically, but to our knowledge, few have accounted for the UN SDGs, especially at the national level. Land use sustainability has been explained from the theories of sustainable development (Sandrine et al., 2011 ), ecological economics (Xu and Zhang, 2020 ), system science (Garrity, 1993 ; Han et al., 2021 ), and human-land coordination (Li and Tang, 2018 ). Accordingly, the diverse theoretical explanations have led to a variety of assessment frameworks. In 1993, FAO constructed an index system to evaluate land use sustainability from the aspects of productivity, safety, protection, economic feasibility, and social acceptability (FESLM, 1993 ). In practice, the index system was adjusted (Fu et al., 1997 ; Chen, 2002 ; Zhang et al., 2011 ), and several new frameworks were developed such as the Pressure-State-Response framework (PSR) (Cheng et al., 2022 ), Triangular model (Cheng et al., 2020 ), Ecological Footprint model (EF) (Li et al., 2022 ), Projection Pursuit model (Lu et al., 2021b ), and Full Permutation Polygon Synthetic Indicator method (Deng, 2020 ). Although studies have been conducted to evaluate China's progress in achieving SDGs (Wang et al., 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ), integrating the UN SDGs into land use sustainability is still lacking (Zhang, 2019 ; Xu and Zhang, 2020 ), and there is no such a framework developed for urban land use. The problems about urban land use have continued to appear with rapid urbanization, such as shortage in land resources, unreasonable structure, and environmental degradation (Lu and Ke, 2017a ), which are closely linked to the SDGs such as improving agricultural productivity, ensuring urban housing and transportation, and preventing land degradation. Therefore, including SDGs into index system to make ULUS evaluation could well track the progress towards sustainable goals over urban land. The land system is a complex system with multiple coupling factors. When evaluating land use sustainability, selecting and quantifying index is often an indispensable step. How to grade index and treat its random errors remains elusive, which further affects the reliability of results. First, urban land use shows high spatial complexity due to multiple land-use types and complicated topological relationships between different land patches (Papadimitriou, 2020 ). Therefore, the impact of evaluation indicators on land use sustainability is non-linear. Second, Land use sustainability assessment is a multi-dimensional decision-making process with many uncertainties. The evaluation index from different data sources contains random errors and the contribution of a specific indicator to different ranks of land use sustainability is not hard but fuzzy. Previous methods often cannot solve the above problems well at the same time. For example, traditional membership functions can consider the fuzzy characteristics of indicators but cannot characterize the randomness. The cloud model is an effective statistical model used in fuzzy and stochastic systems to realize the mutual conversion of uncertain relations between qualitative concepts and quantitative values, and overcome the uncertainties faced in LUS evaluation (Zuo et al., 2021 ). It has been successfully applied to artificial intelligence (Xiao et al., 2021 ), simulation prediction (Wang et al., 2021 ), comprehensive evaluation (Cui et al., 2019 ; Ruan et al., 2021 ), land resource utilization (Lu et al., 2021c ), and so forth. Currently, urban land use sustainability in China is plagued by several problems such as loss of cultivated land, shortage of reserved land resource, severe land pollution, and deteriorating land quality. The spatio-temporal changes in the China’ ULUS are still poorly understood. On the one hand, the current evaluation does not account for the SDGs of the new era (Xu and Zhang, 2020 ). For example, energy decarbonization and regional coordination (Sachs et al., 2019 ) in SDGs are rarely considered in the previous evaluations. On the other hand, existing studies on China's LUS have been conducted at the provincial scale (Zhao et al., 2014 ; Lu et al., 2021b ), but research at the city level is rare. In view of these limitations, we applied the cloud model to construct an SDGs-oriented framework for evaluating ULUS in China from three dimensions of production, living, and ecology. Then we analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of ULUS, and examined their main drivers using the Geodetector model.  2 Data 2.1 Study area We chose the prefecture-level cities and municipalities in the Chinese mainland as the evaluation unit, and analyzed the results by region and urban agglomeration (Fig. 1  ). The total evaluation units consist of 4 municipalities and 293 prefecture-level cities. The analysis regions included Northeast, East, Central, and West. The eleven major urban agglomerations in China are (1)Harbin-Changchun Urban Agglomeration, (2)Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration, (3)Central Plains Urban Agglomeration, (4)Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, (5)Urban Agglomeration in Middle Reaches of Yangtze River, (6)Hohhot-Baotou-Ordos-Yulin Urban Agglomeration, (7)Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration, (8)Lanzhou-Xining Urban Agglomeration, (9)Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration, (10)Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, (11)Beibu Gulf Agglomeration. The topography in China is high in the west and low in the east, and the landforms are diverse. Controlled by climate and topographic differentiation, land resources are unevenly distributed. Cultivated land is concentrated in the plains and basins in the east; forests are mainly distributed in the northeast, southwest, and southeast mountainous areas; grasslands and deserts are distributed in the west. With population mitigation and industry development since the reform and opening up, three major urban agglomerations have formed including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and the Greater Bay Area. Socioeconomic development has posed pressure on the development and utilization of land resources, and the shortage and degradation of land resources and the loss of cultivated land caused by urban expansion have become the primary urban land use problems in China (Wang et al., 2018 ). To facilitate sustainable development, China has successively implemented a variety of policies including revitalizing the old industrial base in northeast China, promoting the development of western China and central China. Meanwhile, various ecological protection and restoration projects were implemented such as returning farmland to forests and grasslands and protecting natural forests. These measures have played an essential role in promoting regional economic growth and environmental protection. However, different regions in China are still facing various land-use problems due to the intense conflict between socio-economic development and environmental protection (Cheng et al., 2022 ), which prevents the achievement of sustainable goals.  2.2 Data sources and processing We collected data for indices from multiple sources. The statistical data at city level were collected from public municipal statistical databases, including China City Statistical Yearbook (2005–2020) and China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook (2004–2019). We supplemented the missing data from the Statistical yearbooks of provinces and cities and China's economic and social big data research platform of China National Knowledge Internet (https://data.cnki.net/ ). Ecological sensitivity data (1-km spatial resolution) were available from China Ecosystem Assessment and Ecological Security Pattern Database (http://www.ecosystem.csdb.cn/ ). Land use data (1-km spatial resolution), normalized difference vegetation index (1-km spatial resolution), and DEM data (90-m spatial resolution) were downloaded from the Resource and Environment Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/ ). The slope was calculated from DEM data. The precipitation data was acquired from the daily data set of China's surface climate data (http://data.cma.cn/ ), which was interpolated into grid with a 500-m spatial resolution using the IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting) method (Khouni et al., 2021 ). Nighttime light data were derived from an extended time series (2000–2018) of the global NPP-VIIRS-like nighttime light data through a cross-sensor calibration (Chen et al., 2021 ). All raster data were summarized by city extent to get an average of the city using the zonal statistics tool in ArcGIS software. Due to the missing data for 11 cities in Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Hainan, and the limited data availability for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taipei, we finally selected 286 cities.   3 Methods 3.1 Constructing ULUS evaluation framework 3.1.1 Developing index system In 2014, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit put forward the SDGs for 2030, including 17 goals and 169 targets (UNITED NATIONS, 2014 ). Different countries have quantified the SDGs to keep track of the progress towards sustainability, and China has also established localized index systems based on SDGs (Zhang, 2019 ; Wang et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). Given that land is the essential space for achieving the SDGs, we identified 11 goals and 19 targets from SDGs that were related to land use and sorted out the 19 targets into three dimensions: production intensification, life harmony, and ecological balance (Fig. S1 ). Such classification was also supported by literature (Xu and Zhang, 2020 ; Lu et al., 2021b ). To further characterize the 19 targets, we established an index system of ULUS including 18 indicators (Table 1  ). Most indicators were directly described in the SDGs, although we used proxies for some indicators which were not applicable to China's conditions or whose data were not available directly. The dimension of production intensification represents the economic benefits of land use, including industrial structure and output, efficiency and energy consumption, facility optimization, and technological improvement. This dimension aims to characterize the extent to which the land has sustainably reached a state of efficient and intensive production. The dimension of life harmony reflects human life quality, service provision, and well-being protection that depends on land use, including habitat governance, public services, and equality of rights. This dimension aims to characterize the ability of land to sustainably provide services and guarantee the harmonious development of human society. The ecological balance dimension indicates the protection, governance, and stable development capabilities of the land system, including land quality, space protection, energy pollution, waste disposal, and landscape stability. This dimension is to characterize the ability of land to provide sustainable development for humans without destroying ecosystems. Most indicators can be derived from the Statistical Yearbook through direct calculation, we showed the calculation process of some complex indicators in the supplementary materials. In addition, the combined AHP and entropy method was used to determine the weights of indices, which has also been shown in the supplementary materials.  3.1.2 Evaluation based on normal cloud model The Cloud model could well address the fuzziness and randomness of evaluation objects when converting qualitative concepts into quantitative expressions (Li et al., 1998 ). The normal cloud model is a cloud model expressed by expectation (Ex ), entropy (En ), and super entropy (He ). Ex  is the central value of the qualitative concept domain; En  measures the fuzziness of qualitative concept, reflecting the range that can be accepted by the concept in the domain; He  is the entropy of En , reflecting the discrete degree of cloud drops. Let U  be an indicator set U  = {x }, C is the qualitative description concept on domain U , that is, the evaluation levels set. If x  conforms x  ∼ N (Ex , En 2 ), while En ’∼ N (En , He 2 ), and to membership function μ(x) of C:(1) U ( x )  = exp [ − ( x − E x  )  2  / 2 ( E n  )  2   ]       The distribution of x  in domain U was considered as a normal cloud (Fig. 2  ).(1) Determining the threshold of indicators    Three sets were defined in the evaluation: the indicator set U  = {u 1 ,u 2 ,u 3  … u 18 }, remarks set C  = {c 1 ,c 2 ,c 3 ,c 4 ,c 5 ,c 6 }and weight set W  = {w 1 ,w 2 ,w 3  … w 18 }. U represents 18 indicators in ULUS evaluation, C indicates that each indicator is divided into six levels, and W indicates the weight of each indicator. We divided ULUS into six levels: I (strongly unsustainable), II (moderately unsustainable), III (weakly unsustainable), IV (weakly sustainable), V (moderately sustainable), VI (strongly sustainable). The mean-variance classification method was used to divide the indicators into 6 levels (Cui et al., 2019 ): Ⅰ[0,‾x-s )，Ⅱ[‾x-s,‾x-s/2 )，Ⅲ[‾x-s/2,‾x )，Ⅳ[‾x,‾x  + s/2 )，Ⅴ[‾x  + s/2,‾x  + s ) Ⅵ[‾x  + s,x  + 3s ), where‾x  is the mean value and s  is the standard deviation of each indicator. Since there is only one boundary value for level Ⅰ and VI, x  + 3s  was set as the expected boundary.(2) Calculating cloud parameters    Ex  can be calculated by Eq. (2)  (Li et al., 2012 ):,(2) E x i j   = ( x i j  min  + x i j  max   )  / 2     Where x i j  max     andx i j  min     are the upper and lower boundary value of index i  on level j , respectively. The membership degree in the junction of two adjacent levels should be equal, and is set to 0.5 Eq. (3) :(3) exp [ − ( x i j  max  − x i j  min   )  2  / 8 ( E n i j    )  2   ]  ≈ 0.5      We can derive En ij   as is shown in Eq. (4) :(4) E n i j   = ( x i j  max  − x i j  min   )  / 2.355      He  reflects the thickness of cloud, which is often set empirically based on fuzzy characteristics. The smaller the value, the thinner of the cloud layer and the smaller the uncertainty. The value of He  in this study was set to 0.5 (Cui et al., 2019 ).(3) Calculating membership    Based on the parameters of cloud model, we derived the normal cloud for 18 indicators (Fig. 3  ). The distribution of cloud drops can reflect the fuzziness and randomness of each indicator at different levels. A forward cloud generator was established in MATLAB 2020 (Han et al., 2021 ). To improve the reliability, we input data and repeated 10,000 times to calculate membership matrix Z(5) Z = [ z 11   ⋯  z 1 m     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   z n 1    ⋯  z n m      ]      where, n indicates the number of indicators whose value is 18, and m represents the divided levels, whose value is 6. The membership degree is calculated in Eq. (6) (6) R = W ⊗ Z     where W is the weight set determined by combined AHP and entropy method, and R =(r1 ,r2 ,r3 ,r4 ,r5 ,r6 ) indicates membership degrees belonging to sustainability levels I-IV, respectively. 3.1.2.1 Defuzzification We used the center of area method (COA) (Rouhparvar and Panahi, 2015 ) to defuzzify the result of the cloud model using the formula below:(7) v = ∑ k = 1  m  k r k    ∑ k = 1  m  r k        where k = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, r k   is the membership degree at level k . Through this, production-intensification index (v PI  ), life-harmony index (v LI  ) and ecological-balance index (v EI  ) were calculated.    3.2 Analyzing spatio-temporal patterns of ULUS Based on the evaluation results, we calculated development index (DI) and coordination index (CI) to assess the degree of ULUS (Wang et al., 2020 ). DI was calculated as the weighted sum of v PI  , v LI   and v EI   as below.(8) D I = v P I   × w P I   + v L I   × w L I   + v E I   × w E I        DI indicated the development rate of ULUS, and was divided into six levels (levels I-VI) using the natural break method. CI represented the coordination of production, living and ecology, which was calculated as below:(9) C I = 1 − S / E     (10) E = ( v P I   + v L I   + v E I    )  / 3     (11) S = 1 3  [ ( v P I   − E  )  2  + ( v L I   − E  )  2  + ( v E I   − E  )  2   ]        where E  and S  are the mean and standard deviation of v PI  , v LI   and v EI  , respectively. Based on previous studies, CI was divided into six levels: level Ⅰ(0,0.20], level Ⅱ(0.20,0.40], level Ⅲ(0.40,0.60], level Ⅳ(0.60,0.70], level Ⅴ(0.70,0.85], level Ⅵ(0.85,1.00]. We used the McKinsey matrix to classify the types of ULUS, which has been successfully applied to urban management (Shen et al., 2015 ). We established the McKinsey matrix of ULUS (Fig. 4  ), with the y-axis being DI, and the x-axis being CI. This resulted in nine types with different combinations of DI and CI levels: (1) LL type (cities with low DI and low CI), (2) LM type (cities with low DI and medium CI), (3) LH type (cities with low DI and high CI), (4) ML type (cities with medium DI and low CI), (5) MM type (cities with medium DI and medium CI), (6) MH type (cities with medium DI and high CI), (7) HL type (cities with high DI and low CI), (8) HM type (cities with high DI and medium CI), (9) HH type (cities with high DI and high CI).  3.3 Identifying spatial driving factors for ULUS We identified drivers of ULUS using the GeoDetector model (Wang et al., 2010 ), a spatial statistical method to quantify the impact of drivers underlying the spatial heterogeneity of geographic phenomena. The method was implemented using the Excel Geo-detector software, which was downloaded from the website (http://www.geodetector.cn/ ). Geo-detector includes four modules: factor detector, ecological detector, risk detector and interaction detector. We used the factor detector to analyze the spatial driving factors of ULUS, whose principle was to compare the total variance of the indicator in different stratums with that in the whole study area. The model was expressed as follows:(12) q = 1 − ∑ h = 1  L  N h  σ h 2   N σ 2        where, q  is the explanatory power of the independent variable X  to ULUS, whose value ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the value, the stronger the explanatory power of the factor X. h = 1,2, …,L  is the stratified levels of the independent variable X . N  andσ 2   are the sample size and variance of the whole study area and N h   and σ h  2   are the sample size and variance of layer h . The spatial distribution of ULUS might be driven by anthropogenic activities, natural conditions and land use structure (Cheng et al., 2020 ). Here we selected nine potential driving factors including: per capita GDP (yuan/person), population density (person/km2 ), night light index, slope (°), precipitation (mm), normalized vegetation index, the proportion of agricultural land (%), the proportion of ecological land (%), and the proportion of construction land (%). We examined the driving factors for the spatial distribution of DI and CI in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019.   4 Results 4.1 Spatio-temporal patterns of ULUS by dimension Overall, ULUS showed an upward trend in China from 2004 to 2019 for production-intensification (PI), life-harmony (LI), and ecological-balance (EI) index (Fig. 5  a). We quantified the coefficient of variation among regions for each year to indicate regional disparity (Fig. 5 b). The coefficient of variation for production-intensification index gradually increased, while that for the life-harmony and ecological-balance index continuously declined. We showed the spatial distribution of PI, LI and EI of ULUS in China cities in 2019 (Fig. 6  a). All three indices showed a decreasing trend from east to west. The production-intensification index was more agglomerated in the eastern region, especially in China's first-tier urban agglomerations, including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and the Greater Bay Area. China's second-tier urban agglomerations, such as the Shandong Peninsula, Central and Southern Liaoning, and Central Plains Urban Agglomeration also showed high production-intensification index. The high level of life-harmony index was mainly distributed in large cities (e.g., provincial capital) and their surrounding areas (Fig. 6 b). The ecological-balance index in the southern region was higher than that in the north (Fig. 6 c), and showed pronounced spatial clusters.  4.2 Spatio-temporal patterns of development index Overall, the patterns of DI showed a significant positive spatial autocorrelation with the range of global Moran's I value from 0.354 to 0.508 (Fig. S3 ). From 2004 to 2019, the overall DI in China showed an upward trend, and exhibits evident differentiation among different regions (Fig. 7  ). The DI of the eastern cities was highest with significant H–H cluster type, concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta and the Greater Bay Area, while that of the western cities was lowest with L-L cluster type (Fig. 8  a). DI of Northeast China was overtaken by central China after 2009 with the L-L clusters occurred in 2019. The difference in DI within regions enlarged over time as indicated by the increased ranges, especially in the east and west. We showed temporal changes in DI (Fig. 8 ). During 2004–2009, there was a widespread increase in DI, and the eastern China showed larger magnitude of increase with a growth rate of more than 20%. In contrast, the growth rate in central and western was relatively low, and few western cities showed a decline in DI. From 2009 to 2014, the growth of DI in cities of the eastern China slowed down, with a growth rate of below 20%, while the western cities and some northern cities experienced a greater growth rate in DI. From 2014 to 2019, the growth rate of DI continued to decrease, and only some cities in the central and western China had a growth rate of more than 20%. Notably, DI declined slightly in some cities in the urban agglomerations of Yangtze River Delta, the Greater Bay Area, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei.  4.3 Spatio-temporal patterns of coordination index The overall level of CI was relatively high. During the study period, the CI in China changed dramatically (Fig. 9  ). 26.6% of the cities showed an increased level of the CI, and 51.7% of the cities showed a decreased level. The overall CI in China exhibited a downward trend from 2004 to 2019. (Fig. 10  ). We presented the temporal change in CI across China (Fig. 10 ). In 2004, the overall coordination of ULUS in China was relatively high, with high-value clusters occurring more frequently in the south than in the north. From 2004 to 2019, there were more cities with low CI levels across China (Fig. 10 ). In 2019, the high CI included southern China, northern Northeast China, and Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration and low-value areas occurred at the Central and Southern Liaoning and Central Plains Urban Agglomerations.  4.4 Overall spatial pattern of ULUS We used the McKinsey Matrix to classify China's ULUS into nine types (Fig. 11  ). The results showed that there is a positive correlation between the development level and the city hierarchy (Fig. 11 a), and the average value of the DI dropped with decrease in city scale (Fig. S4a ). In contrast, the correlation between the coordination level and the city hierarchy is not significant (Fig. S4b ). Among the 35 key cities, the DI values of 31 cities were more than 0.5, but their CI were distributed across low, medium, and high levels. The cities, Nanjing, Xiamen, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Dongguan, and Zhuhai had higher land use sustainability level with both higher DI and CI. In contrast, Tianjin, Shanghai and some northeastern cities including Changchun, Shenyang and Liaoning had lower CIs. Most cities in China belong to three types: types LL, LM, and MM with medium or low DI and CI (Fig. 11 b). Type LL with low DI and CI was concentrated in Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces and some cities in the southwest and northeast. The cities with the types LM and LH (low DI and medium or high CI), are often small in the northeast, northwest, and south. The number of cities with types ML and HL (medium or high DI and low CI) was relatively small, mainly in key cities of North China and Northeast China. Types MM, MH, HM, and HH with medium or high DI and CI were mainly located in the eastern coastal economic belt and the Yangtze River economic belt with large cities.  4.5 Spatial drivers of ULUS The q-values for DI, which indicated the explanatory power of driving factor, ranged from 0.05 to 0.67, while those for CI were between 0.01 and 0.23. From 2004 to 2019, the spatial driving factors of DI mainly include GDP per capita, nighttime light index and the proportion of construction land (Fig. 12  a), and the influence of nighttime light index and the proportion of construction land gradually increased. This indicated that urbanization level and intensity of anthropogenic activities have always been the primary influencing factors of ULUS. The increased influence of population density and NDVI over time suggested that land carrying capacity and ecological carrying capacity have gradually become the constraint of ULUS. From 2004 to 2019, the spatial driving factors of CI mainly include the proportion of agricultural land and ecological land, followed by slope and precipitation (Fig. 12 b). This suggested that the spatial distribution of CI was controlled by the natural conditions and land use structure. Specifically, spatial differentiation of slope and precipitation results in different land resource utilization, which in turn forms different land use structures, the proportion of agricultural land and ecological land in different land use structure directly bears food security and ecological security, thereby affecting the coordination of land use sustainability. Over time, the impact of natural driving factors on the CI of ULUS gradually decreased, while the explanatory power of per capita GDP and population density increased, which indicated that the interference of human production and living activities on the coordination of sustainable land use gradually strengthened.   5 Discussion Our research developed a novel framework based on the cloud model to derive the spatio-temporal patterns of ULUS in China, and explored their driving factors. This framework included the UN SDGs into index system, which could well track the progress towards SDGs for urban land use. Our results are consistent with the evaluation results of China's land use sustainability at the provincial scale (Zhao et al., 2014 ; Lu et al., 2021b ), and evaluation results of land ecological security (Cheng et al., 2022 ). We found that urban development level was highly correlated with DI of ULUS but did not directly affect the CI (Fig. 11 a). The CI for large cities showed big difference. Some large cities, such as Guangzhou, Beijing, and Chongqing, have a high level of CI. Some developed cities (e.g., Shanghai, Tianjin) showed low level of CI because of the low ecological security level (Cheng et al., 2022 ). In addition, the changes in DI in China are also closely related to the stage of urban development (Fig. 8 ). The DI for cities with a developed economy and a high degree of urbanization increase gradually at first, and level off or decline slightly. This kind of trajectory has witnessed in the cities of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and the Greater Bay Area, which might be explained by the cycling of urban sustainability (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Our research revealed the spatio-temporal patterns of production, living and ecological dimensions of ULUS in China, which was useful for tracking the progress towards SDGs including efficient and intensive land use (SDGs 2,6,8,9), provision of harmonious living space (SDGs 4,7,8,10,11), protection and improvement of the eco-environment (SDGs 3,7,11, 12, 15), and providing guides for policies for regional sustainable development and land use based on the results. The sustainable land use guidance for different regions is as follows (Table 2  ): Our research highlights the successful use of the cloud model to develop evaluation model. Compared with the commonly used evaluation methods, the cloud model has the following advantages in solving the ambiguity and randomness of evaluation. First, compared with comprehensive evaluation methods with hardly classified indicator (Wang et al., ，2020), the cloud model well accounts for the fuzziness by calculating the membership degrees of indicator to different levels, which is more in line with reality. Second, previous fuzzy evaluation methods rarely consider randomness within measured indicator values, which often used a single value to show the calculated membership of each level (Cheng et al., ，2022). In contrast, the cloud model can represent the randomness of the membership of each level by adjusting the thickness of cloud. Third, the cloud model is suitable for incremental algorithms. In traditional fuzzy evaluation, the range of attribute values is a specific interval. If the value of a new sample exceeds this range, the model is no longer applicable. But the curve of the cloud model extends infinitely to both sides, which provides the possibility to add new samples. There are still some limitations in our study. First, we examined the dynamics of ULUS for different discrete periods due to limitation of data availability, continuous time series analysis might be better to capture the details of the evolutionary process, enhance the accuracy and stability of the model and make predictions (Deng, 2020 ). Second, there are still some potentially important indicators that are not selected due to data limitation, such as the number of land cases and the proportion of effective agricultural irrigation areas. Third, we quantified the drivers of ULUS for different periods separately. For the various urban development factors that affect land use sustainability, more specialized research of their spatial autocorrelation should be conducted by using spatial panel data model or geographically weighted regression to examine driving mechanisms from spatial and temporal data or get localized explanatory power of drivers (Cheng et al., 2020 ).  6 Conclusion We developed a new framework to evaluate ULUS by integrating the SDGs and using the cloud model, and got the spatio-temporal patterns of ULUS for 286 cities in China from 2004 to 2019. We identified its spatial driving forces based on the Geodetector method. The main conclusions are as follows:(1) From 2004 to 2019, the production-intensification, life-harmony, and ecological-balance index of ULUS in China exhibited an upward trend. High-value clusters of production-intensification index were concentrated in major urban agglomerations, areas with high life-harmony index were distributed in provincial capitals in China, and areas with high ecological-balance index were in southeastern China.  (2) DI of ULUS was higher in the east, and lower in the west. During the study period, the growth rate of DI slowed down. The rate was high in the eastern China in the early stage, but in the later stage the rates in the central and western regions were higher. After 2014, the overall DI of ULUS stabilized.  (3) The overall CI declined. From 2004 to 2019, more than half of cities experienced a decline in the CI. The high-value areas were distributed in South China, northeast China, and Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration, and the low-value areas were distributed in the Central and Southern Liaoning and Central Plains Urban Agglomeration.  (4) There were three main types of ULUS in China including LL, LM, and MM with medium or low DI and CI. DI of 35 key cities was relatively high, but the CI varied. Population size was more related to the DI but did not directly affect its CI level.  (5) The driving factors of DI of ULUS in China included per capita GDP, night light index, and the proportion of construction land, which were related to the urban development and anthropogenic activities In contrast, the CI was influenced by the proportion of agricultural land and ecological land, slope and precipitation, which were related to land use structure and natural conditions.
