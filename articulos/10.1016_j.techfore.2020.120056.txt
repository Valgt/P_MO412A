                  Leading the world towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is an ambition of the European Union (EU) and an important objective of the European Commission's proposal for Horizon Europe: the EU framework programme for Research and Innovation (R&I) 2021–2027. The new orientation of the framework programme requires a new sustainability-oriented thematic agenda and a new approach to governance. Following the perspective of transition management, the paper argues that i) the success of EU R&I policy in its pursuit of SDGs will depend on the reflexivity of its governance, and ii) that foresight can build reflexivity into the governance of EU R&I policy. The paper provides insights in the shaping of Horizon Europe through the BOHEMIA project, a major foresight exercise that supported the preparation of the Commission proposal. The BOHEMIA project aimed at strengthening reflexivity in the policy preparation process and provided advice on both governance and potential thematic orientations for Horizon Europe. Its influence on the proposal and the extent, to which future oriented-reflexivity will characterize the implementation of Horizon Europe, can be seen as precursors of the prospects of the policy to contribute to sustainability transitions in Europe and the world.

The preparation of the proposal coincided with the rise of a literature on the directionality of public support to R&D (Mazzucato 2018 ; Schot and Kanger 2018 ; Weber and Rohracher 2012 ). Largely building on the argument of Freeman and Perez (1988) about the layered succession of socio-technical paradigms, this literature tells the story of the importance of policies and the public sector for the generation and rise of the currently dominant socio-technical regimes (Mazzucato 2011 ). Accordingly, these need to be explicitly and consciously directed towards goals of environmental sustainability and social inclusion (Mazzucato and Perez 2014 ; Mazzucato 2018 , Perez 2016) which are broadly seen as key constituents of sustainable development. This literature has a strong normative orientation towards research and innovation policy and relies on a research- and technology-centric perspective on innovation, which underestimates social and systemic dimensions of change. For example, a number of sustainability-challenges do not result from a lack of new technologies but from the persistence of established technologies, techniques and infrastructures. The assumption that directing investment towards new technology will lead to the disappearance of the old technologies, techniques and infrastructures certainly underestimates the systemic nature of the required change, including its political aspects (see Hausknost and Haas, 2019 ). The steam engine did not make sails disappear. Information and communication technology eliminated neither paper nor travel. Achieving sustainability is not only about investing in particular innovations or in particular classes of innovations with “green” characteristics (Mazzucato and Semieniuk, 2018 ; Owen et al., 2018 ; Steffen, 2018 ). It is about a systemic change that ensures that a) all investment is “green” and b) that being “green” is the object of competition between investment projects. Whether this kind of change is an evolution or a revolution is a matter of debate (see Rotmans et al., 2001 ; Shove and Walker, 2007 , 2008 ; Rotmans and Kemp, 2008 ). However, it is well understood that this kind of change requires reflexive governance (see Stirling, 2006 ; Voß, Rotmans and Kemp, 2006 ). Foresight is a core function in the reflexive governance of science and technology (Stirling, 2006 ). The recent proposal of the European Commission for Horizon Europe (EC, 2018 ) was the first proposal for a European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation that was prepared using an important foresight exercise: the BOHEMIA project. The BOHEMIA project was instrumental in bringing the Sustainable Development Goals into the programme preparation debate. But the link between foresight, EU research and innovation (R&I) policy, and the SDGs does not stop with the events that led to the drafting of the proposal. In this paper we argue that the link is much broader and deeper and rests in the need for reflexivity (Stirling, 2006 ). Foresight contributes to reflexivity in policy, and this reflexivity is necessary for the transition to sustainability. Since their launch in the early 1980s, European framework programmes for research and innovation have aimed at strengthening Europe's competitiveness and economic growth. In the course of the past decades, the pursuit of economic growth has been complemented with wider policy orientations associated with the provision of public goods like health and environmental protection. Horizon 2020 - the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014–2020 - addresses broad grand societal challenges.1  1 See Biegelbauer and Weber (2018)  for a review of policy frames guiding the EU framework programmes.   So, the recent incorporation of the SDGs in the global challenges to be addressed by Horizon Europe - the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2021–2027 - can be seen as an evolution in a historical trajectory of widening the set of targets the programme addresses. We hope, and we argue, that it is more than that. Up to now, sustainability issues in EU R&I policy have been viewed through an oversimplified understanding of technology, of the way technology works in society, of how emerging socio-technical pathways are shaped, and most importantly of the role of R&I policy in these processes. An R&I policy in the pursuit of sustainability goals would address problems that are at best partially understood, and therefore would require a reflexive approach, which “calls into question, envisions alternatives, reinvents, shapes, and probes the foundations of governance itself, i.e. the concepts, practices, formal and informal institutions by which societal development is governed” (Voß and Kemp, 2006 ). In line with Stirling (2006) , we see foresight at the heart of such an approach. The BOHEMIA foresight project, launched by the EC to help prepare the next European framework programme for research and innovation, was an opportunity to introduce reflexivity in the process of preparing a major policy initiative. Here, foresight was used not only to anticipate future technological developments but also to explicitly reframe the normative orientations of the future framework programme (what is it for?) in light of growing uncertainties in the global context. Thus, BOHEMIA played an important role in placing the SDGs in the normative orientations of the Commission's proposal for Horizon Europe. We argue that for the R&I policy of the EU to be effective in its pursuit of the SDGs, it needs to be founded on a new, more sophisticated and systemic understanding of socio-technical change and adopt a new approach to governance. This requires high levels of future-oriented reflexivity in order to explicate the possible interactions between four dimensions of change, namely (1) emerging technological developments, (2) new forms of usage and changes in organisational and institutional framework conditions, (3) changes in the global context, and (4) consequences for the normative orientations pursued, with all these dimensions being subject to high degrees of uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (Renn et al., 2011 ). Sustained reflexive efforts, from policy design to implementation, are needed to reduce the uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity associated with these four dimensions of change. Addressing them jointly in a reflexive governance process requires involving a wide range of actors - well beyond the range of usual stakeholders in R&I funding - in the development of R&I policy strategies. Against this backdrop, the objectives of this paper are threefold. First we want to sketch a framework and formulate a set of requirements for reflexivity in future R&I policy; a framework that is compatible with the new ambitions of R&I policy of contributing to SDGs rather than only to growth and competitiveness. Second, we want to revisit the BOHEMIA project in order to discuss how it contributed to enhancing reflexivity in the process of preparing Horizon Europe. More specifically, we show how the interactions between the four dimensions of change have been addressed in the BOHEMIA project as part of the preparation of the proposal for Horizon Europe and assess to what extent the need for reflexivity has been taken up in the Commission's proposal. Third, we call for reflexive efforts not only in the design phase of the policy initiative but throughout its entire lifetime and in particular in its implementation. The Commission's proposal creates space for reflexive policy practice that could have a real influence on the pursuit of the SDGs. The question is whether the Commission will implement this reflexivity. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2  describes the evolution of the concept of sustainability in the context of the EU Framework Programmes. Section 3  discusses the transition management perspective towards an EU R&I policy addressing the SDGs, and in particular the need for reflexivity in such a policy. Section 4  discusses the BOHEMIA project as an effort to bring reflexivity into the processes of EU R&I policy-making, and as the source of the reflection that brought the SDGs into the range of targets of the Commission's proposal for Horizon Europe: the EU programme for Research and Innovation 2021–2027. Section 5  looks at the provisions of Horizon Europe in light of the experience with the BOHEMIA project. Will Horizon Europe make a difference for the Sustainable Development Goals? Will it lead Europe and the world towards sustainability? The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  2 EU R&I policy and sustainability: a brief history The word ‘sustainable development’ appears for the first time in the EU R&I vocabulary in the 4th FP (Framework Programme) (1994–1998). Following the wording of the Maastricht Treaty, FP4 addressed sustainable economic development in general and sustainable growth in particular. Sustainable development in EU discourse comes closer to the language of the Brundtland Commission2  2 World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) .   in 1997, when the Amsterdam Treaty explicitly mentions the objective and the principles of sustainable development. In FP5 (1998–2002) the adjective ‘sustainable’ is mentioned 47 times, placed before the objectives of about half the “key actions” - the main thematic orientations of the programme. Key actions were meant to address important economic and social “systems”, and in their descriptions one found sustainable health, sustainable agriculture, sustainable cities etc. This pattern repeats itself in FP6 and FP7, where the adjective ‘sustainable’ is found 37 and 44 times respectively, until Horizon 2020, where there are 117 mentions. There are considerable challenges in deciphering what exactly is meant by sustainable development as an objective for the impact of a research project, or as a criterion for selecting research projects. But this has been the approach of EU Framework Programmes. Faced with two project proposals differentiated only by claims as to their impact on sustainability, the one claiming more impact would be preferred. Substantiating and peer reviewing a claim as to the future impacts of research on something as abstract as the rights of future generations is not an easy task. As Collingridge (1980)  seminally argued, the impact of technology cannot be predicted until the technology is well entrenched in society. In fact, the views that dematerialization trends will create an environmentally benign post-industrial society (Herman et al., 1989 ; Stahel, 1994 ), that teleworking will reduce mobility demand (Moos et al., 2006 ), and that information technology will lead to a paperless society (Lancaster, 1978 ) are examples of predictions of future impact of technologies that were manifestly wrong. It is thus not surprising that the contributions of FPs to sustainable development have not been explicitly and thoroughly addressed, neither in ex post evaluations, nor in any ex ante assessments. The absence of appropriate conceptual frameworks, established indicators, and stakeholders that could demand and help undertake such exercises was determinant. Yet things are changing: The European Union's 7th Environmental Action Programme (2014–2020) associated sustainability with “living well within the limits of the planet”. The notion of the limits of the planet can build on ecological systems’ analyses (Rockstrom et al., 2009 ; Steffen et al., 2015 ) to create a more operational framework for incorporating sustainability in EU policy, than the Brundtland report. Building on these analyses, the European Environment Agency has been increasingly making the case that sustainability requires social and ecological transitions (EEA 2015 ; EEA 2018 ).3  3 Transitions – and transformations – describe important changes in society, the economy, policy and technology. We see transitions and transformations as closely related concepts. Transitions are relatively smooth transformations, while the category transformations includes also more abrupt changes.    3 EU R&I policy and transition management Over the past twenty years, an extensive body of literature has discussed economic, social and ecological transitions (See Köhler et al., 2019 ). Deepening our understanding of long-term processes of transformative change and demonstrating how longer-term transformative strategies can be put in practice, this literature has stressed the importance of reflexive governance and deliberative politics for managing transitions in a smooth, rather than in an uncontrolled and disruptive manner (Voß and Kemp, 2006 ). Transitions are too complex and uncertain to be managed within traditional blueprints of command-and-control planning. They require continuous adjustments and learning processes at multiple levels, from local to global, and across different fields of action and policy. Transition management has roots in evolutionary economics - in particular innovation systems research - and in science and technology studies (see Geels, 2002 , 2004 ; Markard et al., 2012 ). In evolutionary views of the economy (Metcalfe, 1998 ; Lundvall, 1992 ) a competitive market produces variety that in turn drives economic growth. Heavy-handed government intervention to direct technology could restrict variety-generating competition and damage economic performance. Transition management argues that government policy can maintain economic variety and technological diversity whilst directing technology towards societal goals such as sustainability (Kemp et al., 2007 ; Rotmans et al., 2001 ). The key argument is that transitions can be managed without losing the performance advantages of a competitive economy. This gives transition management a strong appeal for EU policy-makers because of its fit with the social market economy and values-based politics, which are called for in Art 3 of the Lisbon Treaty. However, actually managing sustainability transitions has defied politicians and policy-makers across the globe. Stirling (2006)  and Voß and Kemp (2006)  argue that sustainable development requires above all, reflexive governance. Reflexive governance is essential in R&I policy because it places policy-makers firmly and appropriately within the system of actors involved in a problem and its solution, in order to enable a continuous adjustment of problem perceptions, policy goals and intervention strategies. To paraphrase Stirling (2006) , we can distinguish between three types of policy-making (and hence of governance):• non-reflective, where the policy is a response to an indication of a problem without much reflection on the scope and nature of the problem;  • reflective, where the policy is a considered response to a perceived problem, including conscious effort to understand the nature and scope of the problem;  • reflexive, where the policy is formed on the basis of the realisation that the understanding of the problem by policy is part of the problem.    In reflexive policy-making the problems become internalized by the policy-mechanism which solves the problems from within. While reflective policy makes recourse to expertise and technical solutions, reflexive policy can only be practiced through engagement, and the broader the engagement the better the practice is. Voß and Kemp (2006) , understand governance as the processes and structures, through which society handles its problems and shapes its transformations. It includes processes for system analysis, goal formulation and strategy development. Sustainability transitions pose specific challenges for such processes. System analysis needs to address complex phenomena such as heterogeneous interaction, uncertainty and path-dependency. Goal formulation is challenged by the ambiguity resulting from the diversity of stakeholder interests and the intricacies of the Collingridge dilemma. Strategy development in a distributed multi-actor context needs continuous adjustment to the realities of implementation.4  4 Kemp et al. (2007)  have called these iterative and vision-oriented strategies “goal-oriented modulation”.   On this basis Voß and Kemp suggest five principles to guide the design of reflexive governance in practice:• Integrated (transdisciplinary) knowledge production, in order to be able to draw on multiple perspectives for addressing complex and co-evolving issues;  • Adaptivity of strategies and institutions – drawing on thorough monitoring systems and processes of co-learning - to handle uncertainty and ambiguity with regard to values, problem perceptions and possible solutions;  • Anticipation of long-term systemic effects of action strategies, taking into account complex feedback dynamics within widely stretched system boundaries (such as path-dependencies) as well as external factors, for instance with the help of scenarios development;  • Iterative participatory goal formulation, as a means to elicit value trade-offs as well as potential synergies between different actors’ and stakeholders’ ambitions, and to adjust goals accordingly; and  • Interactive strategy development, in order to take into account the resources and (potentially conflicting) interests of different stakeholders from a range of areas of social, economic and political activity.    These principles of reflexive governance, we argue, are doubly important for a European R&I policy for a transition towards the SDGs. Reflexive policy-making is necessary not only for the normative ambitions and orientations of an R&I policy associated with SDGs, but also for dealing with the uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity inherent in emerging technological developments, new forms of technology-use, in changes in organisational and institutional framework conditions of innovation, and in developments in the socio-economic, global and political context. These are formidable challenges to the ability of government policy to steer change processes in a targeted and goal-oriented manner. Policy can enable problem-solving but cannot ensure that the problems will be solved. This is not only due to the technical uncertainty involved in R&D - which on its own is an important source of principal-agent problems in R&I policy (see Caswill, 2003 ), but also because not all that is feasible materializes. Existing economic, societal and institutional structures, barriers to entry, lack of access to complementary assets and competencies are amongst the many reasons why many possible innovation and innovation directions do not get attempted, and of all those attempted few prevail (Teece 1986 ). A reflexive R&I policy needs to deal with multiple sources of, and substantive and temporal variations in, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, including the diversity of expectations of actors in relation to change. Foresight as reflexive practice has a particular role to play in aligning future-orientations, thus reducing uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity for all actors involved.  4 Bringing the SDGs into EU R&I policy: the BOHEMIA study In July 2017 the “Lamy Group”, a group of personalities set up to advise the European Commission on how to “maximise the impact of EU research and Innovation programmes, published its report “Lab, Fab, App” (Lamy et al., 2017 ). This report called upon the Commission to connect its Research and Innovation Policy to the SDGs. The report stood on three “building blocks”, summarized in its annex 3. One of those building blocks - the only one making explicit reference to the SDGs - was the BOHEMIA project.5  5 The other two building blocks are the interim evaluation of Horizon 2020 and a study modelling of the economic impact of framework programmes.   The BOHEMIA study was a foresight exercise aiming to support the preparation of the Commission's proposal for the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021–2027). It was the first time that such an exercise was launched at the European level, following the advice of the European Forum for Forward Looking Activities (EFFLA), which was established as part of the Innovation Union Initiative of the Europe 2020 Strategy6  6 See the Europe 2020 flagship initiative ‘Innovation Union’ (EC 2010 ). https://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/pdf/innovation-union-communication-brochure_en.pdf    The EFFLA advice framed foresight as part of an early reflection phase, which involves “strategic intelligence” and “sense making”, and precedes the formal policy-making stages, enabling relatively disinterested engagement between actual and potential stakeholders on the substance of the policy without any commitment or prejudice on the results of formal policy-making phases (EFFLA, 2012 ). This is how the BOHEMIA project was constructed. Based on the recommendations of EFFLA, the Directorate General for Research established a foresight hub supporting an internal network across all Commission departments (EFFLA, 2014 ). The network was the main interface with the BOHEMIA study, and enabled the Commission to really involve foresight in its reflection, which, however, were early, informal, and non-committal towards the later more formal policy-making processes. The study involved three phases which were set-out to provide analyses and intelligence according to the needs of the EU policy cycle. The first phase aimed to provide a substantiated overall vision for the usefulness of European Union research and innovation in relation to the long term challenges faced by Europe and the world.7  7 See the BOHEMIA Scenarios Report (Ricci et al. (2017) . https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b2d78a84-3aae-11e7-a08e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en    This was the phase that provided evidence to the Lamy Group. The second phase of the study used a Delphi survey to offer more detailed insights into future trends in science and technology, society and policy. It built a library of expert forecasts and arguments8  8 See the BOHEMIA Delphi Report (Gheorghiu et al. 2017 ). https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d1ea6c83-e538-11e7-9749-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-60761593    that has been used extensively to discuss research and innovation agendas between the services of the European Commission, especially in relation to ideas on how to implement the directions of the Lamy Group. The third phase of the study used the results of the Delphi to develop a number of future scenarios relating to likely disruptive technological and social trends. The study carried out an open public consultation on the implications of these scenarios for EU R&I policy. The recommendations of the public consultation have been used to critique and strengthen the directions proposed in the pillar “global challenges and industry competitiveness” of Horizon Europe. 4.1 The first phase: scenarios and transitions The first phase of the study started in 2015 seeking to identify the scientific-technological and socio-economic challenges that Europe will possibly be confronted with in the 2030s (and beyond), and to which the outcomes of the next framework programme could be expected to provide answers. Those future challenges would then be used to help develop ideas for the content of research and innovation agendas to be pursued in the 2020s. The challenges of the 2030s were seen as shaped by the changing global context for Europe, socio-economic developments in Europe, and emerging ideas for new solutions, which could be fuelled as much by technological research as by social innovation. Context scenarios of global developments captured the spectrum of global changes and challenges. These were developed on the basis of analytical insights into the evolution of global challenges from “megatrends” (OECD, 2016 ; Gore, 2013 ; EEA, 2015 ) as well as the global normative orientations of the SDGs. A debate about the role of the framework programme was launched against the backdrop of the global context scenarios, which were addressing seven main areas of future concern.9  9 There areas were: (i) global political and socio-economic context, (ii) climate and energy, (iii) environment and ecosystems resources and services, (iv) health, (v) security and resilience, (vi) accelerating innovation, and (vii) towards a world of cities.   In each area a “perseverance scenario” (in which the future is driven by current megatrends and the basic principles and structures of the operation of our economies and societies remain stable) was confronted with a “change scenario” (in which Europe and the world change in the directions of the SDGs). The strategic choice presented to the European Union was whether to lead or to follow transformations towards or against the directions of the SDGs. The EU and its member states individually having been signatories to the SDGs, “the future we want”, both in BOHEMIA and in the Report of the Lamy group is one in which Europe leads the world towards the SDGs and its science, technology and innovation efforts underpin this positioning. Leading the world towards the SDGs involves at least two elements. One relates to the performance of Europe in the different SDG related indicators. Whilst these are many and a lot of them are still to be defined (see Rothen, 2017 ), nonetheless Europe performs well enough to consider itself the current world leader (EC, 2019 ). The other involves actual leadership that convinces the other parts of the world to converge towards the goals. Achieving this convergence may require active socio-technical leadership. This means not only developing the cutting edge technologies and skills that it needs, but also ensuring that these technologies and skills are suitable for use, and are actually used in Europe and the rest of the world. Pursuing regulatory convergence so that the regulatory environment that defines the framework for technology use is similar across countries is an important part of this strategy. But on its own this does not suffice. Other countries may resist the regulatory convergence or seek to impose their own standards. For the world to pursue and achieve the SDGs there is a need for important international aid that would have to have a strong technology transfer element to it (Ricci et al., 2017 ). Here we must explain that the standing of “world leader” in sustainability indicators is less important than the direction of travel: the transition. Evaluating the direction of travel in a multi-goal multi-indicator system is as much an analytical problem as it is political. The weight of each indicator and of the weight for each goal would vary according to the level of analysis - e.g. for different localities, economic sectors social groups, according to their conditions, interests and objectives. These problems cannot be solved by an external policy-maker who additionally faces a dilemma whether to punish or support not performing actors. Resolving such problems requires reflexive policy-making, at a more aggregate level than the 17 SDGs and their more than 260 indicators (Kastrinos, 2018 ). In the context of BOHEMIA we aggregated the direction of travel into four interdependent and overlapping transitions, i.e. transformation processes that “entail the simultaneous occurrence of far-reaching institutional, organisational, technical, social and political changes in and of sociotechnical systems.”10  10 Adapted from Markard et al. (2012) .   These four transitions address the following:• Social needs: providing for the needs of people, to ensure a better life for all;  • The biosphere: safeguarding a hospitable planet, to ensure the survival of the species;  • Innovation: harnessing the forces of change, to improve change and the mechanisms that bring change;  • Governance: joining forces for a better world, to establish the conditions for successfully managing transitions.    Fig. 1   depicts the four transitions in a graphical form, and relates them to specific SDGs and to the specific areas in which the BOHEMIA study developed scenarios.11  11 For detailed description of the transitions and the scenarios see Weber et al (2018) .   The four transitions framework developed in BOHEMIA has similarities with the framework of Rockstrom et al. (2009)  who discuss economic, social and environmental transitions. Both define broad overlapping transitions and group the SDGs, aiming to provide a meta-narrative for resolving the complexity of achieving sustainability. The BOHEMIA transitions framework is more adapted to the needs of R&I policy. According to Weber et al. (2018 , 31–32)“The four transitions framework developed in BOHEMIA can act as a focussing device as well as a framework for priority selection in EU R&I policy. We can imagine the four transition domains as an evaluation grid that enables the European Commission to screen each proposed area of research in terms of its potential impact on one or more transitions. We can also imagine programmes on each of the four transitions, following different organizing principles, appropriate for the transition in question. A programme on harnessing the forces of change would place emphasis on fast technological innovation, strengthening innovation capacities and creativity across the board. A programme on safeguarding a hospitable planet, would place emphasis on the planetary boundaries and their implications for R&I. A programme on the needs of people would place emphasis on R&I that enables understanding and solutions for social problems, and a programme on governance would place emphasis on the information needs of managing transitions. These organising principles would be programmatic, rather than thematic. This means that each discipline or thematic area could be appropriate in each of the four programmes. It would be the considerations and criteria for selection and evaluation that would be different.”   As reported by Kastrinos (2018)  the four transitions were indeed the starting point for the policy discussions that resulted in the clusters of the part of Horizon Europe that is dedicated to global challenges.  4.2 The second and third phases of the BOHEMIA study After the publication of the Lamy Group report the services of the European Commission began their policy preparation work, and the BOHEMIA study turned towards more specific questions about future technologies and policy goals. A large scale Delphi survey (Gheorghiu et al., 2017 ) was carried out to look at the plausibility of a set of wishes and concerns associated with EU R&I policy and its links with other EU policy areas which were represented in the network of foresight correspondents. The survey put forward 147 propositions and asked about each of them: a) when it will be realised and, why, as well as b) about its importance in the context of EU R&I policy and why. The survey data were very useful in the discussions of the concept of EU missions (see Mazzucato, 2018 ) where questions of technical feasibility and ambition are key elements of the policy. Moreover, in the context of BOHEMIA the survey data were used to build scenarios around statements that were seen by the respondents as likely to materialize by 2040, while being at the same time quite demanding and ‘radical’ in technological, social or economic terms. In total, 19 such scenarios were developed. Each scenario involved a description of the issue, its relevance for Europe, the SDGs and the relevant EU policies, and finally its implications for future EU R&I policy directions. An open consultation asked how necessary EU R&I investment is in the light of each scenario, and what should be the main directions of this investment. The consultation was carried out on the Delphi platform and respondents could vote for directions already present or add new ones. By way of illustration of the scenarios and the analyses carried out, Fig. 2   presents them mapped in relation to the perceived need of EU R&I investment and the degree of disruption that the realization of the scenario would entail.12  12 The 19 scenarios with the most cited implications for future EU R&I policy directions were also published. See https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/support-policy-making/support-eu-research-and-innovation-policy-making/foresight/activities/current/bohemia_en    These parts of the project were used to further “future-proof” the proposal for Horizon Europe. By that we do not mean that it is possible to foresee all possible future surprises and build responses into the programme. It means however that there is some awareness of possible surprises and an expectation that the policy is prepared for them. In fact during the policy preparation process two important questions were explicitly posed:• Have all possible areas of Research and Innovation that have European Added Value been considered?  • Have all the likely futures pointed out by the Delphi and all the consensual recommendations provided by the public consultation been considered?    The first question is just an invitation for openness. There will always be more innovations possible in the future than are currently possible. And there will always be gaps and unknown unknowns. But simply asking the question opens up the agenda to new possibilities and to new views. Asking such questions in the European Commission is an act of reflexivity, recognising that flexibility and adaptivity are essential in order to be able to take on board new R&I challenges and options once they arise. Considering the important position of SDGs in BOHEMIA, this reflexivity made an indirect contribution to bringing the SDGs into the R&I policy of the European Union. The second question is an assurance of openness. The Commission's awareness of these views creates an obligation for preparedness. This does not mean that there is an obligation to include all those views in the programme. There is however an obligation for a considered response to the question why area X and not area Y. The formal policy-making phase has to justify its choices as compared to the alternatives brought up in the foresight process.   5 Beyond foresight: towards an EU R&I policy for the SDGs While foresight caught early with the appeal of the SDGs as normative framework for EU R&I policy, the association between the policy and the goals has had a great deal of support from actors that were not involved in the process such as Member States administrations, think tanks and stakeholder communities. As we saw in the previous section the policy preparation process of Horizon Europe did not have to comply with the frameworks developed during the BOHEMIA foresight. It simply used them for inspiration. And as the Horizon Europe programme is still under negotiation amongst the EU institutions, it is difficult to even speculate ex ante about its effects on transitioning Europe and the world towards the SDGs. But what we can do is examine the coherence between the recommendations of BOHEMIA, the principles of reflexive governance and the proposals of the European Commission for the Horizon Europe programme. The first recommendation of the BOHEMIA project was to step up the ambitions of European R&I policy to become the engine of European and global sustainability transitions. From a transition-management perspective, the recommendation may appear odd. Transitions happen and they are managed as they unfold. There is no requirement for a stated policy to manage transitions. In fact, Shove and Walker (2007 , 2008 ) accuse the transition management school of hiding the political nature of their views. However, being open about the objectives of a policy is not in contradiction with transition management or with reflexive governance. The programmatic nature of EU R&I policy is such that its objectives need to be stated, and so does Article 3 of the proposed Horizon Europe Regulation:“The Programme's general objective is to deliver scientific, economic and societal impact from the Union's investments in research and innovation so as to strengthen the scientific and technological bases of the Union and foster its competitiveness, including in its industry, deliver on the Union strategic priorities, and contribute to tackling global challenges, including the Sustainable Development Goals” (EC 2018 )   The explicit association of the programme with global challenges and the SDGs should not detract from the absence of any reference to transition or transformation. Compared to the previous framework programme, Horizon Europe is more open to world challenges, where Horizon 2020 was focussing exclusively on Europe. At the same time the discourse in Horizon 2020 was marginally more akin to a programme managed reflexively.“The general objective of Horizon 2020 is to contribute to building a society and an economy based on knowledge and innovation across the Union by leveraging additional research, development and innovation funding and by contributing to attaining research and development targets, including the target of 3% of GDP for research and development across the Union by 2020″ (Art 5) (EU 2013 ).   One could argue that the frame to “contribute to building a society” is more transition friendly than “to deliver impact”, but the difference is small. However, at the level of objectives, Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 do not embed themselves firmly in transition management. Another recommendation of BOHEMIA was to put preparedness at the centre of policy implementation. Foresight and anticipation are at the heart of reflexive governance processes. At least two elements contribute to this. First, anticipating the future creates a different perspective on the present, changing people's view on what is doable and worth doing. Reflexivity results from this iterative nature of the relationship between the future and the present. Second, anticipating the future can be a medium for engaging with parties who would otherwise be unwilling to engage with the policy, or who would behave strategically towards it. Ideally, foresight can contribute to aligning future expectations and thereby reduce the uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity in R&I governance for sustainability. The broader the engagement the more reflexive the policy process can be. In fact, another recommendation of BOHEMIA was to promote a new sense of ownership through new forms of citizens’ engagement in agenda setting and R&I. Overall, a broadly engaging, iterative and forward-looking process of priority setting is essential for reflexive governance, which in turn is essential for managing the transition towards the SDGs. The Commission's proposal on Horizon Europe includes provisions for foresight activities together with monitoring and evaluation activities, and for citizen engagement, which are very similar to those of Horizon 2020:“With the aim of deepening the relationship between science and society and maximising benefits of their interactions, the Programme should engage and involve citizens and civil society organisations in co-designing and co-creating responsible research and innovation agendas and contents, promoting science education, making scientific knowledge publicly accessible, and facilitating participation by citizens and civil society organisations in its activities….. The engagement of citizens and civil society in research and innovation should be coupled with public outreach activities to generate and sustain public support for the Programme.” (EC 2018 , p 20).   These provisions could be used for developing public engagement processes that would lead to reflexive governance, but they do not on their own ensure it. One significant question here is whether responsible R&I agendas are a subcategory of possible activities or whether all R&I agendas in Horizon Europe have to be responsible. Where Horizon Europe is clearly different from Horizon 2020 is in relation to missions, which did not exist in Horizon 2020 and now serve in Horizon Europe as element connecting higher-order ambitions (i.e. SDGs) with specific R&I agendas:“Alongside the regular calls for proposals, a limited set of highly visible missions will be introduced. These will be designed in the context of a strategic planning process. Missions, with ambitious but time-bound and achievable goals, should speak to the public and engage it where relevant. They will be co-designed with Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens” (EC 2013, p 10).   The little paragraph above contains the two key elements of the Horizon Europe proposal: the strategic planning process and the missions. According to Art. 6“The implementation of the specific programme shall be based on a transparent and strategic multiannual planning of research and innovation activities …. following consultations with stakeholders about priorities and the suitable types of action and forms of implementation to use. This shall ensure alignment with other relevant Union programmes” (EC 2018 , p 30).   Improving the alignment with other Union programmes was another one of the BOHEMIA recommendations. In that context, BOHEMIA also argued that policy alignment is very challenging in practice, and that policy experimentation was needed to understand what is feasible and what works. Policy experiments were seen as solutions for important but poorly understood or rapidly changing challenges. The possibility of trying many solutions on a problem, seeing how each of them works and learning from the experience is essential for a fast changing world (see Tuomi 2012 ). This is essentially what reflexive governance is all about. With its emphasis on engagement and interactive knowledge creation in policy and in society simultaneously, reflexive governance describes a situation in which every policy is an experiment and lessons from it are continuously reassessed. Policy experimentation is not mentioned in the proposal for Horizon Europe, but this does not mean that it is excluded. Policy experimentation, together with broad engagement, foresight and interactive agenda setting are about policy implementation and there is enough scope in the Horizon Europe regulation to allow them to take place, and to make them core characteristics of the Union's R&I policy-making. The notions of flexibility in implementation and a broad and inclusive strategic planning process make it possible for Horizon Europe to become an engine of European and global sustainability transitions. However, what is possible is not always achieved. The key question here is whether the European Union is responsible and accountable for sustainability transitions in the EU and across the world. The Union's response to this question is that it is committed to achieving the UN SDGs (EC, 2016 ) and, according to Art 3 of the Lisbon Treaty it is committed to promoting sustainable development worldwide. It is also currently in a leading position towards the SDGs in the world, and it is increasingly bringing the SDGs into its range of policy targets (ibid). The need to experiment with policy mixes implies that there is no single best policy instrument or mix thereof to move onto a transition pathway towards SDGs. A mix of actions and instruments at different levels and in different fields of policy should be mobilised, improved and adapted, reflexively. The portfolio of policy options includes: R&I funding to nurture novel solutions; green finance and other new financial instruments to enable scaling and incentivize investors; regulation, standard-setting and public procurement to guide change from the demand side; new educational curricula with important skills and values; trade and international policy initiatives to enrol global partners; and participatory approaches to help align the activities for public, private and third sector agents, and, not least, re-gain the confidence of Europe's citizens in their ability to trigger transformative change towards a sustainable future. While all this goes far beyond the realm of established R&I policy, it must be said that traditionally conceived R&I policy, as an exercise of correcting market failures by spending public funds in research, cannot achieve the SDGs. A new conception of R&I policy is required, one that focuses on the policy design and implementation mechanisms across the board, that shares agendas with policies that have responsibility for developments in the economy and society (transport, energy, health, agriculture, education, social security etc.) and that involves continuous reflexive interaction among policies, and between policies and society at large. This new conception of policy must go beyond setting goals and objectives. It must include issues of agency and programme implementation, authority, responsibility and accountability (Braun, 2003 ; Caswill, 2003 ) and must position itself in the context of other goal oriented finance structures (Mazzuccato and Semienuk, 2018 ; Steffen, 2018 ). This is a tall order for a public R&I programme which promotes itself as “evolution, not revolution”.13  13 See https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/horizon-europe-presentation_2018_en.pdf ; also see https://mita.lrv.lt/en/news/from-horizon-2020-to-horizon-europe-evolution-not-revolution    At the same time, we are not aware of any other policy scheme with the ambitions of Horizon Europe, and we hope that Horizon Europe will pioneer a better EU policy for a better world.  6 By way of conclusions In this paper, we have drawn on recent work on transition management in order to capture what reflexive governance of R&I policy for SDGs will require. We have argued that the five design principles of reflexive governance provide suitable guidance. The BOHEMIA project was an attempt to introduce novel elements of reflexivity into the preparatory phase of the EU R&I policy for the period 2021–2027. The results of the project played a role in the formation of the proposal for Horizon Europe, in particular as regards the importance of research for addressing long-term challenges faced by Europe and the notion of transitions as the ‘theory of change’ underpinning the rationales of the new framework programme. BOHEMIA also triggered the inclusion of novel elements in the Horizon Europe proposal: attention to SDGs as normative orientation, the importance of preparedness and adaptivity, the need for ownership and participation and for giving room for alignment and experimentation. With these cross-cutting principles, Horizon Europe, the new framework programme has become more future oriented and more likely to be an effective policy. BOHEMIA provided also some suggestions for spaces of opportunity, which can be benchmarks for cross-checking and validating alternative priority directions. More importantly BOHEMIA represents a new approach to policy preparation that opens up a space for early-stage forward-looking reflexive deliberation amongst Commission services, combines exploratory, analytical and normative considerations, and engages with external experts and stakeholders. If there is a criticism to be levied at BOHEMIA from the perspective of reflexive governance, then it is that the engagement of outside stakeholders happened only through the online Delphi platform, and that internal stakeholders were far more prominent. But the aim of BOHEMIA was to not replace reflexive governance but rather to prepare the way for a reflexive turn in EU R&I policy. We hope that this has been signalled through the provision for an open and engaging strategic planning process in the Commission's proposal. Whether the reflexivity space will be effectively used will depend on the implementation of Horizon Europe, but the proposal of the European Commission has made some important first steps, which include the inclusion of the SDGs as challenges that the programme must address.
