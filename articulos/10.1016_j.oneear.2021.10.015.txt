                  Urban dwellers globally are experiencing systematic and intersectional inequalities—heightened by the COVID-19 crisis. In this regard, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) have a key role in guiding sustainable and equitable urban planning and development. Yet enduring contradictions across the goals, siloed approaches, or the complexities of implementation, means that SDG localization may fall short of the transformative aim to “leave no one behind.” In this perspective, we provide a practical framework for mobilizing “urban equality” through the 2030 Agenda. We present a content analysis of the intersections between “urban” and “equality” references across the 17 SDGs, and associated targets and indicators, drawing out four key areas for accelerating an urban equality agenda. This framework is presented with the aim of identifying clear opportunities for mobilizing the SDGs through an urban equality lens—and shaping further research, policy, and practice, which ensures that we “leave no urban citizens behind.”

Introduction Within a rapidly urbanizing world, the role of urban citizens and policymakers in driving global sustainable development aspirations—through locally specific initiatives linked with environmental sustainability, to shared prosperity, to wellbeing—is clear. This is an important agenda in social as much as economic and environmental terms, and one made more pressing by the hour, literally. Recent UN world urbanization prospects compellingly showed how fast our many urban areas are growing; for instance, with 77 new dwellers joining Lagos, Nigeria, every hour.1   The challenge of grappling with the size of urbanization is compounded by its inequality: the World Bank estimates the COVID-19 pandemic crisis is set to add at least another 49 million urban poor to the vast numbers of those living in extreme conditions, compounding challenges faced by the one billion residents of informal settlements.2   In the meantime, cities have progressively become frontlines of the global biodiversity crisis, and borne the brunt of climate-induced natural catastrophes.3   In parallel to these challenges, thousands of local governments have pledged to implement major global commitments such as the Paris Agreement , or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction . This focus goes beyond the global recognition of cities as the primary planetary domain for consumption and production. Rather, it is driven by an emerging “global urban agenda,”4   espoused not just by cities, but many states and non-governmental organizations, which reconceptualizes cities as sites of sustainability potential—in recognition of their connectivity, sociocultural, and economic diversity. The UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  is foremost among these global commitments, momentously aiming to “transform our world” by 2030 through 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). The successor to the Millennium Declaration  (similarly built upon eight millennium development goals), the 2030 Agenda  broadened the scope of global development, advocating for a universal approach beyond socioeconomic objectives, to couple the needs of “people” with those of the “planet.”5   In addition to outlining key planetary carrying capacities such as climate stability, biodiversity, or ecosystem services, the SDGs emphasize the ethical imperatives of human development, encapsulated in the overarching principle to “leave no one behind.”6   However, set against these aspirations is evidence of rising urban inequalities. Within cities across the Global North and South alike, residents experience differentiated access to social, spatial, environmental, and political entitlements, underpinned by intersectional exclusions related to gender, age, ability, class, ethnicity, and other critical identity affiliations.7   This urbanization of inequalities represents an enduring challenge which will shape progress toward the 2030 Agenda , even as cities increasingly embrace global commitments.8   Crucially, the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened these challenges;9   from inequitable vaccine distribution, to a lack of vital infrastructures,10   to policy formulations that disadvantage casualized and informal workers, to increased gendered burdens and violence;11   not only disrupting progress toward the SDGs, but entrenching the divides these goals seek to counter.12   Moreover, as a politically negotiated and universal document, the SDGs represent a plethora of ideological divergencies and motivations, with noticeable silences on some of the important drivers of urban inequalities. These tensions mean it would be possible for SDG localization to fall short of the transformative aim to “leave no one behind,” despite the wider ethos of the 2030 Agenda.  These challenges and opportunities animate our discussion, in which we demonstrate a novel, systematic approach to considering urban equality within the 2030 Agenda  (Figure 1  ), as a strategy to “leave no urban citizens behind.” We present here the results of a coding exercise, with two aims: to reflect on the potentials and challenges of adopting urban equality as a “lens” to action the SDGs and to develop a more explicit heuristic and applicable framework, as a way to identify points of leverage, key considerations, and gaps of the 2030 Agenda.  This exercise has generated a framework which can be applied by urban advocates as an overlay to existing localization processes—offering guidance on key goals, targets, and indicators that speak to urban equality concerns. At the same time, we also discuss the gaps, omissions, and silences of the 2030 Agenda , with key reflections on how to broaden advocacy and action on urban equality concerns. In presenting this framework, we hope to offer a practical reading for how the SDGs might be leveraged by city officials, activists, civil society groups, or researchers, to center the aspirations of urban equality through the 2030 Agenda .  Challenge: Leaving no urban citizen behind In this perspective, we start from the position that the SDGs offer the opportunity to develop a common urban  agenda toward the ethical imperatives of socioeconomic inequality, in tandem with the transformative structural shifts needed to stay within planetary boundaries. Although primarily framed as a mechanism for implementation by UN member states, the 2030 Agenda  also emphasizes the need for partnership with non-state actors, such as local authorities, communities, civil society groups, and businesses. City governments in particular are accelerating the uptake of the SDGs, “localizing” the 2030 Agenda  by adapting its goals, targets, and indicators to local planning, such as through processes of “voluntary local reviews” (VLRs).13   Likewise, a range of urban actors are increasingly focusing on adapting the 2030 Agenda 's rallying call to leave no city,14   or more directly—no urban citizen—behind, with clear resonance for the four billion urban dwellers today.15   However, it has also increasingly become clear that SDGs remain an imperfect tool, beset by internal contradictions and omissions, with deep implications for urban inequalities. Critiques have emerged, for instance, on contradictions between different goals, such as the “growth-first” imperatives of the agenda and ecological planetary limits, or if growth is compatible with labor rights for the most vulnerable.16   For example, historically the call to “significantly increase exports” (target 17.11) has been associated with the suppression of wages of local workers to produce goods cheaply for international markets. This process has inevitably been gendered—as globally the lowest paid work is traditionally held by women.17   In other words, export competitiveness—a key recommended pathway for growth—has been linked with producing gender inequalities. Likewise, despite the holistic nature of the agenda, in both policymaking and practice, its complexity has often resulted in siloed goals and their constituent targets and indicators. For instance, a siloed approach has broadly occurred across institutional alignments (i.e., water utilities focusing exclusively on SDG 4 and SDG 14) or through areas of topical interest (such as climate action and SDG13, or cities and SDG11). This tendency not only reflects the biases and interests of actor groups and organizations seeking to deploy the 2030 Agenda  at a sub-national level but also is reinforced by the language of the goals, targets, and indicators. This has critical implications across the 2030 Agenda  but is especially significant for cross-cutting agendas, such as urban equality, which are not immediately addressed through a singular “goal.” Others have highlighted gaps between the “politically negotiated” goals and targets, and the “technical” approach to indicator development, which may flatten ideological battles between contested concepts such as sustainability and resilience.18   It is telling, for instance, that indicators linked with the “inequalities" goal (10), maintain a focus on economic dimensions, losing the more complex discussion of the multidimensional drivers of inequalities. Still others have highlighted that, while the agenda has a strong focus on “inclusion”—advocating for access to crucial infrastructures, food security, or education—it is noticeably silent on the global relations which structure inequalities, such as global debt, tax havens, or the privatization of services.19   For example, it has been well documented that the privatization of vital infrastructure, such as water, has served to exclude the most vulnerable groups from access.20   As such, achieving important distributional aims linked with water provision cannot be achieved through market mechanisms alone, and will not reach the poorest without addressing the commodification of resources. Grappling with deeply political legacies of socio-spatial segregation, institutional exclusion, and the maldistribution of environmental risks is crucial to more just and sustainable futures, yet these issues are not always explict within the 2030 Agenda. 21   Despite these limitations, the SDGs have been enthusiastically taken up and defended by local authorities, urban activists, and scholars. It is this “convening power,” we argue, that offers significant value in global efforts toward sustainable development, with much depending on the negotiation of policy processes, and the ability to leverage on the powerful potentials within the agenda, while orienting decision-making toward equality aims.22   It is this gap that motivates our dual inquiry—to both reflect on the potentials and challenges of mobilizing urban equality through the SDGs, and develop a practical framework to support urban actors in advocating and activating these claims.  An urban equality methodology: Beyond SDGs 10 and 11 The framework presented here represents a coding exercise to identify “urban” and “equality” terms, and their overlaps, within the 2030 Agenda . Urban equality is often discussed through the lens of two standalone goals: “sustainable cities” (SDG 11);23   and “reduction of inequalities” (SDG 10).24   However, we argue that the SDGs contain references to urban equality throughout  their goals, targets, and indicators, which can be leveraged to guide development. As such, we adopted a two-phased approach, drawing on a multidimensional25   and relational26   understanding of urban equality. The conceptual framing was done collaboratively and iteratively by the team, starting with a collective review of relevant literature drawing on concepts of justice, equity, and inclusion, followed by rounds of coding undertaken by one member of the team, through which different dimensions were identified and discussed with the others (Figure 2  ). First, we coded for each term (“urban” and “equality”) across the 17 SDGs, 169 targets, and 231 unique indicators. This step relied upon “direct” or “implied” variations, as shown in the two inner rings of Figure 2 . An analysis of the intersections generated four categorizations: “very strong” (two direct overlaps), “strong” (one direct/one implied), “likely” (two implied), as well as “single” references (in which either  urban or equality terms appeared, without overlaps). Then, a broader suite of urban equality goals, targets, and indicators was identified through a second phase, building upon a wider thematic review of urban equality literature. This phase was informed by the normative framing of our conceptual framework, knitting together work on social justice and environmental sustainability27   as a way of more explicitly articulating the aim to “leave no one behind.”28   This entailed, for instance, work outlining the distributional  dimensions of urban inequalities: including traditional economic measures of poverty and income,29   as well as the ability to access vital infrastructural services,30   and associated environmental risks.31   However, beyond these well-articulated tangible issues, we also take inspiration from justice-oriented work32   that has also outlined recognitional  aspects of inequalities—in acknowledgment of the intersectional deprivations,33   stigma, or exclusions faced by diverse social groups34  —as well as representational  aspects, outlined in literature on voice and citizen participation in urban decision-making processes,35   substantive citizenship,36   and rights and claims-making processes.37   These additional codes were organized through four principal “domains of action”: socioeconomic status, identity groups, rights and justice, and land and urban services (Figure 2 ). Together, these codes draw out these multidimensional facets—reflecting both explicit and implied references, as well as a broader swathe of codes directly linked with our normative conceptual framework—in recognition of how urban development processes have been unevenly experienced across social groups.  Opportunities and tensions for embedding urban equality through the 2030 Agenda  Before outlining the specificities of this coding exercise, we will speak directly to the first aim of this perspective, highlighting three overarching reflections that shape the possibilities for adopting urban equality as a “lens” to read and action the 2030 Agenda . Firstly—despite two clear goals focused on sustainable cities (SDG 11) and inequalities (SDG 10)—our coding revealed zero “very strong” overlaps between “urban” and “equality.” This is important, as while it is well acknowledged that the 2030 Agenda  should be read holistically, it is not always clear in practice how to navigate the various synergies and trade-offs contained within this complex framework.16   As will be explored, without explicit efforts to center the aspirations of urban equality, it is entirely possible to pursue policy, planning, or practice that undermines the claims of urban poor or marginalized groups.38   Nonetheless, our wider coding of urban equality issues also demonstrates that the broader spirit of the 2030 Agenda  could be geared toward issues of urban equality—if this is acknowledged as a guiding principle for decision-making. Secondly, direct or implied references to “urban” issues were found to be more limited (34 coded references) compared with those of equality (60 coded references). We argue that this reflects the fact that references to cities are still relatively narrow; not only in the 2030 Agenda , but within global frameworks more generally.39   We suggest that reflecting on the specifically urban  dimensions of inequality is valuable for thinking more broadly. Indeed, this suggestion is supported by the wider ethos of the SDGs, which calls for data disaggregation across a range of features, including geographic location. Yet, as we will argue, reading calls for inclusive access to urban services, education, or public health in urban areas also requires more than simply measuring impacts and gaps across urban and rural areas. Rather, this requires an attention to the specific processes through which inequalities are produced in urban areas.40   Finally, distinguishing between the goals and targets of 2030 Agenda —determined through lengthy multilateral negotiations—and indicators, subsequently set out through a technical process by the “Interagency and Expert Advisory Group,” is of crucial importance.18   Important distinctions may exist between what might be seen as more ambitious goals and targets, and perhaps more reductive indicators.41   Likewise, as will be discussed, it is crucial to remain cognizant of those gaps or omissions across the SDGs, reflective of the enduring political challenges of a universally negotiated framework.19   However, as we argue, there is an opportunity to use an urban equality lens to re-think these gaps through ongoing localization approaches, toward the “transformative” aims of the 2030 Agenda .  For an explicit urban equality mandate With these broader lessons in mind, the core of our framework is based on “strong” overlaps—with a direct acknowledgment of either urban/equality, and an implied mention of the other. These links are illustrated by the “overlapping” of pink and orange shading, and the linking pathway to the targets and indicators below (Figure 3  ). From this perspective, key intersections sit within only ten references, distributed across four goals. First, and predictably, is SDG 11 (sustainable cities). In addition to a wider goal focused on “inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable human settlements,” there are specific targets that call for “equal access for all” to fundamental urban services, housing, and public space (11.1) and “inclusive” participatory urban planning (11.3). Second, within SDG 4, education, are calls for “equal access” to education (4.5.1), with explicit calls for disaggregation across identity—with particular reference to disabilities, indigenous groups, and children in vulnerable situations. Third, SDG 5, gender equality, includes direct reference to ensuring inclusion “at all levels” of governance, with a specific focus on ensuring women's full and effective participation (5.5), and opportunities in leadership and decision-making. Likewise, means of implementation target 5.c is focused on the adoption of sound policies and legislation, at the “local” level. Finally, it is also worth highlighting an additional (albeit weaker) overlap—between two implied mentions. Within SDG 16 (just, inclusive institutions), is the call for “responsive inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making, at all levels” (16.7). This target echoes the importance of building inclusivity into institutions of urban governance, whether situated at the “local” level or other levels of policymaking. These direct/implied and implied/implied overlaps within four goals (sustainable cities, inclusive education, gender equity, and just institutions) generate important reflections for policymakers and practitioners. They remind us, firstly, of the necessity of strengthening access to the distributional  elements required to participate in the public realm, especially equitable access to services, housing, and public space. Secondly of strengthening participation  in governance processes, requiring not only participatory structures of decision-making, but also strengthening civic education to support diverse groups to engage meaningfully within such spaces. Finally, important recognitional  aspects, expressed through goals on gender equity, as well as more broadly acknowledged when it comes to disaggregating data across identities. Taken together, we argue that these goals speak to vital dimensions of just urban governance ,32   which we see as a critical focal point in leveraging the existing goals and targets to advocate for a more holistic reading of urban equality.  Expanding a holistic understanding of urban equality Beyond these strong references to urban equality, are several single  direct or implied references, without overlaps, but which might be fit for urban equality considerations. These are depicted in Figure 3  through orange (urban) and pink (equality) lines, with solid lines indicating a direct mention, and dashes an implied. There are 71 single mentions across 9 goals (1-3; 6-10; 16). While engaging with each goes beyond the scope of this perspective, we will illustrate the value of this exercise through the examples of SDGs 11 and 10, as the two focal points within the 2030 Agenda  on urban and equality issues. Notably, SDG 11 is framed around “inclusivity,” suggesting that this ethos should inform each of its 10 constituent targets and 11 associated indicators. This interpretation is supported through the advocacy leading to the establishment of this “urban goal,” which was focused around wider aims of equality, sustainability, and resilience.42   Crucially, however, many of SDG 11's targets and indicators do not contain specific references to equality. We argue that this lack of recognition may be a stumbling block through localization, as without those explicit references within the discrete targets, policymakers or practitioners could adopt a siloed approach, seeing the achievement of particular targets without reference to equality. For instance, target 11.4, which centers upon the “preservation of cultural heritage,” could in certain circumstances result in adverse results in urban equality terms. That is, the preservation of heritage sites—particularly to harness tourism revenue—has across a range of contexts been the basis for evictions of urban poor groups.43   We argue that the adoption of an equality lens is thus crucial as an orientation to guide decision-making, particularly where diverse targets may entail trade-offs, or might generate contradictory outcomes. Outside of SDG 11, the majority of “single” mentions are to equality. Inverting our call for an equality lens to “read” SDG 11, we also argue for a deeper focus on the urban processes  which have generated inequalities. For instance, within SDG 10, the emphasis on both equality of opportunity and outcomes (10.3) suggests the need not only for supports for vulnerable groups, but also to address broader structural factors shaping inequalities.29   Yet these targets are diluted by their indicators, which revert to traditional income-based measures and self-reported discrimination—measuring the experiences, rather than the drivers, of inequalities. In contrast, urban scholars and practitioners have highlighted the critical impacts of urban processes that have a key role in shaping (in)equality opportunities and outcomes—such as informality,44   migration,45   the financialization of housing,46   or privatization of services.20   A deeper attention to measuring and addressing these wider drivers of urban inequalities is crucial to action the intentions of SDG 10, and better articulate an agenda that “leaves no urban citizen behind.” Adopting a broad swathe of “single” mentions significantly increases the variety of coded targets and indicators. Beyond calling for greater disaggregation between rural and urban areas, we argue that adding an urban  lens can reveal new categories, considerations, or measurements to better address or monitor the drivers or specifically urban contexts of inequalities. Likewise, adopting an equality  lens for urban focused targets can help navigate trade-offs or contradictions, and offers a normative framing to support a holistic implementation of the various goals of the agenda.  Unlocking the potential for equitable development in cities As a final step, we identified a suite of “potential” urban equality references, split into four “domains of action”: socioeconomic status; identity and inclusion; rights and empowerment; and land and urban services. As outlined, these categories link with our conceptual framing of urban equality as a multidimensional phenomenon. A summary of this second stage is shown below (Figure 4  ). Coding these “domains of action” reveals several key issues for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. Firstly, most references are focused within the two domains of socioeconomic status and land and services. These references relate to calls for “equitable” access to land and services, housing, energy, education, health, and social protection systems. Likewise, specific references to socioeconomic status (especially vulnerable, marginalized, or poor communities) are emphasized within a range of poverty-focused targets (SDG 1), as well as in reference to climate change planning and management (13.b), disasters (11.5), transport (11.2), water and sanitation (6.2), education (4.5), health (3.8.1), and hunger (2.1). Taken together, these two domains of action suggest a clear mandate for a focus on “excluded” groups throughout various sectors. While these references are vital touchpoints for advocating for greater attention to excluded groups, they are particularly powerful when coupled with target 10.3, aimed at enhancing equality of outcome and opportunity. That is, a focus on not just enhancing access, or “inclusion,” but also on challenging inequitable structures and processes that shape the uneven access to wealth, services, knowledge, or decision-making authority,25   is key to achieving the deeper aims of urban equality. Secondly, is the critical recognition of social identities in shaping inequalities, focused especially on gender, age, and ability. This commitment is supported through a specific target within the means of implementation of the “partnerships” goal (17.18), which calls for capacity building in producing fine-grained data around identity. There are also connections within SDG 5 (gender equality), including targets aimed at re-valuing care work (5.41), responsibility in the household (5.4), and work undertaken in the “private sphere” (5.2), reflective of critical structural inequalities.17   This acknowledgment of how social relations structure opportunities opens possibilities for advocacy on the compounded ways discrimination is experienced in daily life.6   However, while “gender” is referenced directly in SDG 5, indicators are more likely to be focused on “women,” which can silence other important forms of gender expression; likewise, there are other missing identity affiliations, such as sexual orientation, citizenship status or ethnicity.38   While there is a clear emphasis on data disaggregation across the indicators, in practice, only 39 indicators contain some reference to monitoring across a limited set of identity dimensions. Finally, the domain of rights and empowerment appears largely within references to citizen engagement in planning, calls for equal rights to land, labor, and economic resources, and in representation in institutions of global governance. However, this domain is the least articulated, perhaps reflective of the continued political sensitivity of embedding rights-based approaches within global frameworks.24   Leveraging and broadening a focus on “rights” and human development would require work to move beyond existing indicators focused on the procedural elements of equality (linked with policies and laws), to also capturing aspects such as self-determination, discrimination, belonging, or political agency, as a part of moving toward “substantive equality.”29    A blueprint for leaving no urban citizen behind We present this framework as a guide through which local authorities, researchers, or citizen groups could better leverage, monitor, and advocate to “leave no urban citizen behind,” through a wide reading of urban equality across the 2030 Agenda . In doing so, we see this as a tool to support localized processes of analysis, advocacy, action, and measurement—taking urban equality as a guiding framing—but in ways which allow for reflection on the specificity and diversity of contextual conditions. The imperative of anchoring urban equality aims throughout the SDGs is apparent not only given the rise of urban inequalities globally but also in the current period to guide processes of COVID-19 pandemic recovery, given the clear connections between intersecting inequalities and health outcomes for different social groups. In presenting this framework, we argue that this three-tiered classification of “direct,” “implied,” and “potential” urban equality considerations can support progressive urban actors to not only track urban equality progress within their own contexts but also enhance the subject and ambition of thetargets and indicators through the addition of locally relevant domains of action and implementation. For instance, there is potential to enhance the focus on urban equality through the localization of targets by modifying or adapting their scope, subject, or scale, as is common practice in the development of city-level VLRs,47   while indicator disaggregation at a sub-national level is a similarly effective process for emphasizing unequal progress.48   As such, this framework offers a way of tracking and guiding action on those areas that most resonate with urban equality aims. Such process could support leadership across academia, government, business, or civil society groups to advocate on global processes that are shaping equality outcomes locally, as is already occurring in relation to varied issues, such as the environment49   or migration.50   At the same time, this framework can also be used to navigate through the complexities, contradictions, or gaps of the 2030 Agenda . The core of our framework draws attention to issues of “just urban governance”—represented by access to key services, participation in planning, civic education, enabling rights to land, and fair treatment within the justice system. Nurturing these processes can therefore be understood as instrumental to achieving aims across all 17 SDGs, given the now well-acknowledged internal contradictions of SDG 11,51   as well as the inherent role urban settlements play in many other goals, such as those on health, climate, justice, or sustainable consumption.52   In other words, this framework calls local authorities, researchers, businesses, or civil society groups to focus and invest in these explicitly outlined areas of just urban governance, as a route to enabling other urban equality aims, which may only be implied, potential, or absent within the SDG framework. Likewise, while the 2030 Agenda  acknowledges the necessity of disaggregation at the urban level, this coding reveals the majority of the “means of implementation” indicators are focused at the national level, often simultaneously reducing complexity. However, we argue that localization efforts present a key opportunity to better “adapt” these metrics and targets toward urban equality aspirations. In particular, methodologies, such as citizen science,53   grassroots indicator development,54   or other knowledge co-production processes, can support the localized articulation of contested concepts within the SDGs, while strengthening the capacities of marginalized groups to act as political agents. Finally, we argue that an urban equality lens allows progressive actors to think more holistically about the drivers and manifestations of inequalities in urban areas. Mapping existing points of leverage within the SDGs is more powerful when combined with research and advocacy which highlights those silences within the 2030 Agenda ; for instance, as linked with non-discrimination and stigma, agency, confidence, or collective action, or on the global relations which have driven inequalities in urban areas—which may be impeding action across the goals and targets.  Conclusions Within a rapidly urbanizing, and deeply unequal world, this perspective sets out the value of adopting an urban equality lens to guide the transformative aims to “leave no one behind.” We see the adoption of this holistic lens as holding the power to both navigate internal contradictions within the 2030 Agenda  (for instance, between “inclusion” and “growth-first” imperatives), while also broadening the consideration of these determinants as part of a transformative trajectory. Through a close reading of the goals, targets, and indicators, we have revealed a nuanced picture of equitable urban development as set out either explicitly, implicitly, or potentially within the 2030 Agenda . For progressive urban actors, the framework proposed here can be used to leverage those goals and targets within the 2030 Agenda , while also opening up new dimensions or considerations in advocacy, policy, and practice. In doing so, we acknowledge that there are still persistent inequalities that did not “make it” past the complex UN negotiations—with this neoliberal stamp built into some SDGs crucially shaping the possibilities for the overarching implementation toward transformation.55   These gaps suggest the need for continued advocacy aimed not just at “including” the most vulnerable but also in regulating those urban processes that have produced inequalities over time, and in building the capacities of and possibilities for marginalized or excluded groups to collectively articulate pathways to equality. Future research might entail applying this framework to monitor progress on key areas pertaining to urban equality, as well as to continue advocating for citizen voices, particularly of excluded groups, to articulate the links between these critical and missing dimensions to the existing goals and targets of the SDGs. However, even where there are gaps and omissions—particularly in relation to the unequal political economy of the city—we argue that the mandate to focus on strengthening the distributional, recognitional, and representational aspects of urban governance give us the tools to address these unequal relations through other means. Overall, we have sought to construct a “deep” framework that deploys targets and indicators, not just aspirational goals, as a guide for tangible action. We do so in acknowledgment of the clear interest and emphasis on the use of the SDGs to guide development processes—by citizens, businesses, activists, and researchers as much as by local and national authorities. In doing so, we hope to highlight continued value of adopting a complex, intersectional, and multi-sectoral sustainable development agenda, through the lens of urban equality.

First, the framework was coded for all “direct” mentions to urban and equality, using the explicit keywords identified in the innermost ring of Figure 2 . The overlaps between these were identified and coded separately during this phase, and single mentions (no overlaps) noted. Second, the terms in the middle ring were used to identify “implied” mentions across both urban and equality separately, with the overlaps again coded, and single mentions noted. Finally, in the third round, a broad swathe of codes was generated, as linked with the conceptual framework and broad multidimensional reading of urban inequalities drawn from the relevant literature in urban studies, development studies, planning, and geography. As these codes spanned across urban and equality dimensions, they were not coded as either “urban” or “equality,” but instead categorized into four broad “domains of action” to further support nuance in the overall analysis.
