Yet until 2018, about 2.6 billion people worldwide still use traditional biomass fuel (such as dung, fuelwood or straw) for cooking [1 ]. Specifically, about 7 million nomadic people living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau including Tibet, Qinghai, Western Sichuan, Northern Yunnan, Southern Xinjiang and Western Gansu in China, still rely primarily on dung for household cooking and heating. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region spans over 2.57 million km2  (26.8% of Chinese total area), with an average elevation of over 4000 m above sea level [2 ]. The high elevation and cold weather lead to a heating need for nearly 11 months over the course of a year, including up to 20 h per day during the cold season and no less than 10 h per day during the warm season. Due to the lack of conventional fossil fuels that are available locally, for thousands of years the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau pastoralist society has been using dung, mainly from yaks, as the primary energy source. Multiple characteristics of yak dung make it a convenient fuel source for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau pastoralist, such as easy access, long combustion time, low ignition point and relatively high heat value. To date, about 60%–80% of pastoral household energy consumption still relies on yak dung [3 ,4 ]. Based on data from literature [3 ,5 ,6 ], the per capita consumption of yak dung for energy use in pastoral areas is 1.5 ± 0.2 ton per year, and the total amount of dung burned annually on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau reaches 10.7 ± 1.6 million tons. However, collecting and processing yak dung is labor-intensive. One family needs to spend 1.5 to 2.0 people-hours per day in collecting fresh yak excrement, kneading it into a large ball, then dividing it into chunks or slices, and finally drying and storing it for future use (Fig. 1  A and B). Meanwhile, the sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region have become an increasingly critical concern globally [7 ]. Between 1961 and 2012, the temperature of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased at a rate of 0.3–0.4 °C per decade, twice the global average level [8 ]. In addition, nine major rivers in Asia, including the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lancang River, originate from this region. Approximately, 64% of the land area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is covered by alpine grassland, which plays an important role in livestock production, nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability by providing services to water supply, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration [9 ]. Through thousands of year, a delicate balance has been established between human and nature along the so-called “Herder-Grass-Livestock” cycle the is the dynamic equilibrium of material flow and energy metabolism among the interfaces: grassland and livestock, and grassland-livestock system and socio-economic management [10 ]. Over the past twenty years, the population of livestock, namely yak and sheep, increased by 181% in response to growing local and outside demand for livestock products [11 ,12 ]. During the same time period, the lifestyle on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau transitioned rapidly from a primarily nomadic mode to an increasingly settled one. However, household income still depends mainly on livestock husbandry. More settled lifestyle engenders increased demands for energy, which nevertheless continue to be supplied by yak dung. Traditional balance has been disrupted in the past twenty years. Increased consumption of yak dung leads to a wide range of negative impacts, including depletion of soil nutrients [13 ], grassland degradation [14 ], health damages [15 ] and climate risks [16 ], described in the next section. These conditions invite alternative solutions for supply of sustainable energy in the region.  2 Negative effects of yak dung use 2.1 Grassland degradation Alpine grassland maintains its productivity through natural cycling of essential nutrients, including nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Until recently the alpine grassland ecosystem was stable, as the influences of herding activities had not surpassed its environmental tolerance capacity [13 ,17 ]. Over recent decades, rapid increase in energy demands from local household use and food supply on the Qinghai Tibet-Plateau and non-Qinghai-Tibet Plateau regions have led to increased removal of yak dung from the alpine grassland ecosystem, preventing essential nutrients from being returned to the soil. By multiplying the carbon (C), N and P concentrations of yak dung [3 ,13 ] by the total amount of dung burned annually obtained by survey from 2011 to 2018, results showed that the annual amounts of nutrients removed by dung combustion from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine grasslands are 0.18–0.27 million tons of N and 0.02–0.04 million tons of P, accompanied by 2.49–4.26 million tons of C released to the atmosphere (Table 1  ). If all combusted dung were returned to the grassland, the gross primary production would increase by approximately 2.5 million tons per year. These calculations highlight the potential contribution of reduced dung removal to grassland restoration.  2.2 Public health issues Both the preparation and consumption of yak dung have adverse impacts on the health of the resident pastoralists on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. When manually processing raw yak dung, the herders usually have direct contact with dung-borne pathogens, such as brucella (the cause of brucellosis), tapeworms (echinococcosis), and aphthae epizooticae (foot-and-mouth disease), which increases the risks of infectious and chronic diseases [18 ,19 ]. In addition, the combustion of yak dung emits particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC), leading to severe indoor exposure that can increase the risks of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [15 ,20 ]. A previous study of Tibetan households indicated that the 6-h average concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5 ) could reach as high as 191 μg/m3  and 1243 μg/m3  in tent dwellings with or without chimneys respectively, and 873 μg/m3  in stone houses with chimneys [15 ]. The lowest indoor PM2.5  concentration was still 5.5 times higher than the national standard (35 μg/m3 ) for indoor environments. Extensive indoor activities, especially of women, children, and the elderly, imply a long exposure time to fine particulate matter that can lead to high health burdens on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.  2.3 Threats to climate change BC, a carbonaceous particulate matter emitted from partial combustion of yak dung, is the second most important anthropogenic global warming component after carbon dioxide and has important implications for the cryosphere [21 ]. Through multiplying the total amount of yak dung burned annually obtained by survey from 2011 to 2018 with the associated BC emission factor (0.3 g/kg) reported by Xiao et al. (2015) [15 ], yak dung combustion is estimated to emit approximately 3.2 Gg/year of BC on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. Because of the relatively dark color of black carbon, its deposition on nearby glaciers tends to increase the absorption of solar radiation, reducing the surface albedo and accelerating the melting of snow and ice [22–24 ]. The impacts of BC emitted from increasing combustion of yak dung would be significant in such a climatically sensitive region [25 ].   3 Sustainable energy for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region 3.1 High wind and solar resource potential Luckily, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region is abundant in wind and solar resources. These sustainable energy resources offer an opportunity for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region to address the aforementioned challenges by replacing yak dung with renewable sources of energy. Over two thirds of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region have an annual average wind speed higher than 8.0 m/s, which is favorable for wind energy development in China [26 ]. The region also receives strong solar radiation, with an average value of 7950 MJ/(m2 ·a), which is 60% higher than the threshold for productive solar photovoltaic deployment classified by the China Meteorological Administration (i.e., 5040 MJ/(m2 ·a)). Following the methods in Lu et al. [27 ] and Chen et al. [28 ] (see supplemental information), this perspective evaluated the potentials for solar and wind power for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region based on an hourly meteorological database derived from version 5 of the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System (GEOS-5) by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [29 ]. The results suggest that the annual potentials for wind and solar power reach as high as 15 PWh and 46 PWh (Fig. 2  ), accounting respectively for 185.8 times and 569.8 times the combined electricity consumption of Qinghai and Tibet in 2018.  3.2 Barriers in bringing renewable energy to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region Solar and wind power are distributed resources. Their electricity-generating capacity is influenced by weather and geography and thus exhibits seasonal and diurnal variations. The solar power potential peaks in summer, while the wind potential peaks in winter. Meanwhile, solar power is only available during the day, while wind conditions are most favorable at night. The unique geography and complex climate condition on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increase the variability or intermittency of either wind or solar power alone, which hinders the development of wind/solar power generation system to some extent. In addition, the existing poor infrastructure of pastoral and the scattered herdsmen's residence on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau raise a critical need to customize renewable energy solutions tailored for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.  3.3 Design for microgrid systems To take advantage of the complementary features of wind and solar power supplies, this perspective proposes to install microgrids coupled with energy storage for a typical local community with 100 households (Fig. 3  ). The operation of such a microgrid system can be optimized to address the variability or intermittency of either wind or solar power alone and to exploit their complementary features of seasonal and diurnal power outputs [28 ,30 ]. The remaining excesses or shortages of power relative to local electricity use can be stored and supplied by battery energy storage in order to meet the unique lifestyle of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau pastoral areas. Integrated technologies for microgrid systems are commercially mature and have been widely demonstrated in other part of the world, such as Germany, Greece, Ireland and Japan, to provide electricity in a stable and reliable fashion [31–33 ]. Replacing yak dung for cooking and heating would require about 6.8–11.6 kWh electricity per day for a typical household on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. Including electricity for lighting, a TV, a refrigerator, cell phone charging, and other minor demands, each household would require a daily supply of approximately 7.8–13.6 kWh of electricity. An installation of a 240 kW coupled wind-solar system, which includes a wind turbine, photovoltaic (PV) modules, controllers, inverters and an energy storage system (Fig. 3 ), could satisfy the electricity demand for a typical village of 100 households at the total cost of 0.31 million US dollars (0.26–0.37 million US dollars). Such systems are expected to become increasingly cost-effective over time with rapid declines in the costs of wind, solar, and power storage technologies [34–36 ]. Electricity production from these sustainable energy resources can not only meet basic household energy requirements such as cooking, heating and lighting, but also facilitate improvement of living standards by powering electric appliances and smart phones.   4 Transition from yak dung to renewable resources: the implementation pathway A multiphase implementation strategy from diagnosis, intervention, demonstration to large-scale deployment is proposed in this perspective. 4.1 Phase I: diagnosis About 2000 households can be randomly selected as a representative sample for survey in order to understand: (i) the extent to which the pastoralist residents recognize the negative effects of yak dung combustion on the environment and human health; (ii) their knowledge of renewable energy technologies and the willingness to use clean energy; and (iii) the most important considerations for them to adopt renewable energy.  4.2 Phase II: intervention Based on the diagnosis, a series of small-scale pilots in pastoral community can be implemented to tackle the primary barriers of renewable energy promotion identified in the Phase I. Different types of interventions will be introduced, with an emphasis on disseminating the information of coupled wind-solar system technology, national renewable energy policies, subsidies and finical support, and institutional partnerships. Phase II will explore what types of interventions influence the residents'preference on energy choices the most.  4.3 Phase III: demonstration According to the feedback from pastoralist residents, a control group with continued dependence on yak dung and a test group that shifts to the new energy system (Fig. 3 ) will be chosen for comparison. Each group will consist of 50 househods with similar family background including population, income and the total amount of yak dung burned. The differences in the potential social and eco-environmental impacts between the two groups will be investigated after one year demonstration.  4.4 Phase IV: large-scale deployment Based on prior experiences, a business model can be developed for large-scale deployment of the sustainable energy system, which fully considers the real needs of pastoralist residents and leverages the support from government policies.   5 Strategies to transition from yak dung to sustainable energy The transition from yak dung to renewable sources of energy may face a few potential challenges. The first challenge is behavioral inertia. For thousands of years, yak dung has been used as the main energy source for local herders, making it a big challenge to change such habit [14 ,37 ,38 ]. The second challenge is the low education level, which prevents adequate understanding of risks of current approach and advantages of new technologies. In fact, our investigation showed that while women often take more responsibilities with respect to dung collection, heating and cooking, many of them are poorly educated at present. In addition, the low awareness of sustainable energy alternatives and lack of understanding of environmental and health benefits from replacing manure by renewable energy may hinder large-scale promotion of sustainable energy. The third challenge is the economic consideration. Compared with the use of yak dung, the high cost of hardware installation and maintenance as well as the high electricity price one needs to pay may limit herdsmen's choice to shift towards renewable energy. The fourth challenge is inadequate policy support. Although the local government has a strong intention to promote sustainable energy, the current support and subsidy policies are not enough to overcome the behavioral and economic barriers as discussed above. 5.1 Developing innovative solutions customized for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region The lack of existing infrastructure on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region requires customized energy solutions tailored for local conditions, such as coupled wind- and-solar PV power generation system. It hence requires coordination among multiple stakeholders, including the government, enterprises, research institutes and local residents. In response to the 13th 5-year plan on renewable energy in China, a number of programs and projects have been lauched to support research institutes and enterprises to work together towards targeted power generation system designs that can leverage the complementary nature of wind and solar sources on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region [39 ,40 ]. During an initial experimental stage, experience can be gained to accelerate incremental technological improvements that can overcome the disadvantages of coupled wind and solar power generation systems on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region and improve the system efficiency and reliability. At a subsequent demonstration and diffusion stage, through learning by doing, coupled wind and solar energy service systems have the potential to become economically viable for wide-spread deployment in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.  5.2 Improving public awareness and social acceptance of new technologies In order to enhance environmental education and strengthen local acceptance of sustainable energy use [41 ,42 ], a public training platform should be built to provide interactive experience in practical operations of renewable energy systems. Government-supported technicians can help build local understanding of the ecological benefits of shifting away from yak dung (e.g., improved grassland productivity) through channels such as on-the-ground instruction and site-specific investigations. Documentary videos can guide herdsmen to understand the benefits of sustainable energy compared to dung combustion in terms of supply, reliability, and cost, as well as avoided health damages from indoor air pollution and climate change. In addition, government organizations could deliver training courses on daily maintenance and operations of the coupled wind and solar facilities, to ensure they can continue to operate effectively.  5.3 Leveraging financial resources from other governmental programs and providing policy support At present, a number of government financing programs are available to advance the agenda proposed here [43 ]. These include the “Solar Energy for Poverty Alleviation Program” [44 ,45 ], the “Township Electrification Program” [46 ] and the “Ride the Wind Program” [47 ], which have played important roles in promoting the application of solar power for lighting, cooking and other daily use in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. However, these programs are mostly for small-scale demonstration purposes, with a focus on promoting one specific type of renewable energy, not as an integrated solution to replace combustion of yak dung. In addition, “ecological subsidies” designed to compensate for the costs for ecological protection could be another source of financial support for local communities [48 ]. In summary, financial resources from multiple sources should be integrated to provide continuous support for the type of sustainable energy infrastructure proposed in this perspective.   6 Conclusion Yak dung is the main energy source for local residential heating and cooking on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. However, yak combustion potentially causes negative impacts on the grassland degradation, global climate, air pollution and local public health. A primary goal of this perspective is to lay out a pathway to replace yak dung use with a coupled wind-solar-storage system via utilizing locally abundant wind and solar power resources. The analysis further indicates that the alternative option for the pastoral regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region can supply electricity for household use in a sufficient, affordable, reliable, and environmentally friendly manner. This perspective further analyzes the measures to overcome the potential barriers identified for the proposed energy transition on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. Through a multiphase implementation strategy that engages a range of key stakeholders, promoting sustainable energy to replace yak dung on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region can be promising with the support of national and local policies. The wide-spread deployment of sustainable energy provides an opportunity for the local pastoralist residents to access modern energy services, which is crucial for achieving multiple benefits of climate change, public health and terrestrial (e.g., grassland) ecosystem balance. This effort is expected to have important reference value for sustainable energy transition in other developing countries to simultaneously address health, climate change and economic concerns [49 ]. It also facilitates action from China and other developing countries to collectively achieve the 2030 United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.
