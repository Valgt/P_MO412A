                  Arsenic (As) is a highly abundant metalloid with detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health. Several research works have focused on the development and application of suitable materials capable of removing arsenic effectively from water. In this regard, nano-materials have been given considerable importance due to their unique properties. In addition to nano-materials, single, multi and doped metal oxides have also received substantial attention because of their high surface-to-volume ratio, increased magnetic properties, catalytic properties, etc. These metal oxides have been developed using several methods like solid state reaction, vapour deposition, chemical precipitation, etc. among which chemical precipitation is quite user friendly. Single and mixed metal oxides have been applied widely in arsenic removal since they usually have high arsenic adsorption capacity. Several biomaterials including biochar showed promising results in arsenic removal from water. Desorption studies showed that NaOH, KOH were effective in regenerating the adsorbents from the nanomaterials. Graphene based materials usually show very high surface area due to their open structure, thus, they are effective materials in arsenic removal from water. Water treatment using nanomaterials can be one of the sustainable solutions and in synchrony with Goal 6 in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims to ensure availability and sustainable water management and sanitation for the global population. Nevertheless, there is a significant research gap between the application of these nano-materials in laboratory settings and their real-world field conditions. Additionally, only a limited number of studies have investigated the potential effects of these nanomaterials on the environment and living organisms. However, by carefully selecting appropriate materials and conducting thorough environmental risk assessments, we can overcome these challenges and move towards successful implementation of long term arsenic remediation.

Guan and co-workers 50.08 pH 4–9  CFS-NZVI  Fe3O4-ZIF-8 core-shell composites 170.48  Amine-rich Fe3O4/bacterial cellulose nanocomposite (BC@MH nano-composite) was able to remediate 90 mg/g of As(V) from water (Nata et al., 2011). FeOx composite can remove 10 and 12.5 mg/g, of As(III) and As(V), respectively (Thakkar et al., 2015). Iron-oxide nano-composite (CINs) modified with Chitosan can remove 267.2 mg/g of As(III) at pH 6.0 from water (Gerard et al., 2016). Electro spun polyacrylonitrile modified super paramagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPION) were developed which were used for As(V) ions removal from water (Morillo et al., 2016). Batch studies with porous charred granulated attapulgite-supported hydrated iron oxide showed maximum As(III) and As(V) removal capacity of 3.25 and 5.09 mg/g respectively (Yin et al., 2017). More recently, mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT)- functionalized SiO2@Fe3O4 nano-composite have shown 93% As(V) remediation under optimum conditions (Sheikhmohammadi et al., 2018). Other nano composites that have demonstrated intense affinity towards arsenic having higher capacity for adsorption and are easily separable includes γ-Fe2O3/SBA-15 nano-composite (Peng et al., 2018), manganese iron oxide (MnFe2O4) (Qi et al., 2018), and Fe3O4-ZIF-8 core-shell composites (Huo et al., 2018), calcium-based magnetic biochar (Ca-MBC) (Wu et al., 2018b). Yttrium-doped iron oxide magnetic adsorbent was found to have maximum adsorption capacity of 170.48 and 84.22 mg/g for As(III) and As(V) respectively (Yu et al., 2018). clay-activated carbon composite beads modified by iron oxide have been found to be efficient for arsenic remediation (Pawar et al., 2018).Arsenate sorption on nano active alumina was reported by X.H. Guan and co-workers (Guan et al., 2009). The average particle size of the material was 2.99 nm, with a specific surface area of 359 m2/g. Effect of initial solution pH study on As(V) sorption showed that the sorption capacity depends on the initial loading of arsenic. W. Li also reported an arsenic sorption study of highly ordered mesoporous alumina (Li et al., 2011b). The team synthesized different alumina samples having pore sizes ranging from 3.8 nm. to 6.6 nm. The mesoporous alumina has a wide pH range at which it can remove arsenate ions (pH 4–9). The material showed arsenate and arsenite sorption capacity of 19.8 mg/g and 5.0 mg/g respectively at low concentration range. Mesoporous γ-Al2O3 sized between 2 and 10 nm showed excellent results when employed for removal of arsenic from water (Patra et al., 2012). Various types of activated nonporous alumina with large surface area (200–300 m2/g) are used for arsenic remediation; the large surface area increases the sorption sites. Recently Prabhakar and Samadder (2018) constructed a cheaper Al2O3 NP and observed an adsorption capacity of 500 μg/g at 25 °C. Alumina supported iron nanoparticles was reported to totally remediate As(III) from water at optimal concentrations (Jain and Agarwal 2017), having maximum adsorption capacity of 15.50 mg/g.Recently, a nanoscale polyaniline/Fe0 composite was developed which showed As(III) and As(V) ions removal capacities of 232.5 mg/g and 227.3 mg/g, respectively (Bhaumik et al., 2015). The montmorillonite-supported core-shell Fe(0) nanostructured composite showed maximum adsorption capacity of 59.9 and 45.5 mg/g, for As(III) and As(V), respectively (Bhowmick et al., 2014). Similarly, fuller's earth immobilized NZVI, and removed 50.08 and 91.42 mg/g of As(III) and As(V), respectively, from aqueous solution (Yadav et al., 2016). Starch-derived mesoporous carbonaceous material after modification with NZVI resulted in the removal of 27 mg/g As(III) (Baikousi et al., 2015). Similarly, chitosan after NZVI modification was able to remove 115 mg/g and 87 mg/g of As(III) and As(V) respectively (Su et al., 2016). Horzum et al. (2013) and Liu et al. (2016b) reported arsenic remediation by using chitosan fiber supported NZVI (CFS-NZVI) and chitosan modified NZVI supported pumice (CS–P-NZVI) respectively. For large scale applications nanobunches (NBZI) have been put forward for arsenic removal and have shown 60 times greater As(III) removal capacity than NZVI at pH 7 (Tang et al., 2017). Wang et al. (2017) found that a stabilizer needs to be used for NZVI since its aggregation affects the As(V) removal capacity. Also, nowadays various modified nano-composites of NZVI like hydroxyl-functionalized TiO2@SiO2@Ni/NZVI nano-composite (Huang et al., 2018), and Zeolite-supported NZVI (Li et al., 2018) have showed better results compared to virgin NZVI.Graphene oxide has been used as a substrate to support zirconium hydroxide (ZrO(OH)2) nanoparticles and it removes both As(III) and As(V) from contaminated media. It displayed high adsorption efficiency for both arsenic forms (Luo et al., 2013).  https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-017 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-037 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-012

Arsenic (As) is a highly abundant metalloid with detrimental effects on ecosystems and human health. Several research works have focused on the development and application of suitable materials capable of removing arsenic effectively from water. In this regard, nano-materials have been given considerable importance due to their unique properties. In addition to nano-materials, single, multi and doped metal oxides have also received substantial attention because of their high surface-to-volume ratio, increased magnetic properties, catalytic properties, etc. These metal oxides have been developed using several methods like solid state reaction, vapour deposition, chemical precipitation, etc. among which chemical precipitation is quite user friendly. Single and mixed metal oxides have been applied widely in arsenic removal since they usually have high arsenic adsorption capacity. Several biomaterials including biochar showed promising results in arsenic removal from water. Desorption studies showed that NaOH, KOH were effective in regenerating the adsorbents from the nanomaterials. Graphene based materials usually show very high surface area due to their open structure, thus, they are effective materials in arsenic removal from water. Water treatment using nanomaterials can be one of the sustainable solutions and in synchrony with Goal 6 in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims to ensure availability and sustainable water management and sanitation for the global population. Nevertheless, there is a significant research gap between the application of these nano-materials in laboratory settings and their real-world field conditions. Additionally, only a limited number of studies have investigated the potential effects of these nanomaterials on the environment and living organisms. However, by carefully selecting appropriate materials and conducting thorough environmental risk assessments, we can overcome these challenges and move towards successful implementation of long term arsenic remediation.

Unfortunately, its use has resulted in numerous cases of illness and even fatalities due to its toxic nature. Arsenic exposure occurs in humans through multiple routes, including ingestion of contaminated water, consumption of contaminated food, inhalation of arsenic in air particles, and contact with arsenic-contaminated soil (Mondal and Suzuki, 2002 ). In terms of abundance, arsenic is the 20th most found element in earth's crust. It is more abundant in seawater (14th) and even more abundant in the human body (12th) (Mondal and Suzuki, 2002 ). There are more than 200 naturally existing mineral forms of arsenic in the form of arsenates, sulphides, arsenides, sulfosalts, oxides, etc. (Bissen and Frimmel, 2003 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2012 ). Contamination of groundwater by arsenic is mainly reported from South Asian countries like China, India, Taiwan, etc. and several North and South American countries (Bhattacharya et al., 2012 ). In these countries, the situation of arsenic contamination is severe, with arsenic concentrations in specific regions exceeding the permissible limits prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2001 ). Arsenic has bioaccumulated in the food chain as a result of contamination in irrigation water (Bhattacharya et al., 2012 , 2021 ). Numerous methods exist for arsenic removal and treating contaminated water, and their effectiveness largely depends on the chemical state in which arsenic is present in a particular area (Ray and Shipley, 2015 , Alka et al., 2021 ). Metals, metal oxides and nanoparticle-based materials are commercially available for arsenic removal. Some low-cost nanotubes, nanoparticle impregnated adsorbents, and other nanocomposites are also available commercially for use (Ray and Shipley, 2015 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2013 , 2021 ; Maity et al., 2021 ; Türkmen et al., 2022 ). Arsenic removal from water and other environmental sources requires multiple separation processes and adsorbents. Membrane separation processes are regarded as viable alternatives for the removal of arsenic (Moreira et al., 2021 ). Adsorption is commonly utilized for removal, especially in economically poor countries. The use of natural, easily accessible adsorbents in diverse processes provides multiple benefits to impoverished countries, including cost-effectiveness, increased accessibility, and lower carbon dioxide emissions (Asere et al., 2019 ). Scientific research has examined several types of arsenic-removing adsorbents. Activated carbon can adsorb a wide range of pollutants, including arsenic, due to its large surface area and porosity (G.-S. Zhang et al., 2007 ). Iron oxides, aluminium and hydroxides can also adsorb arsenic (Giles et al., 2011 ). Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are porous and adjustable, can be optimized for arsenic removal (Wang et al., 2015c ). Zero-valent iron (ZVI) efficiently removes arsenic and converts it into less hazardous molecules (Mamindy-Pajany et al., 2011 ). Arsenic can be taken up by graphene-based adsorbents and their derivatives because they have a large surface area and are capable of adsorption (Tolkou et al., 2020 ). These adsorbents may reduce arsenic in water, improving water quality and human health. Nanoscience is the study and application of materials at the nanoscale dimension (1–100 nm) (Rotello, 2003 ; Gregory, 2008 ). It involves the systematic development of two- or three-dimensional structures (nanomaterials) from molecular scale building blocks (Rosi and Mirkin, 2005 ). Nanoparticles (NPs) can be of two major types: engineered and non-engineered. Engineered nanoparticles can be synthesized in the laboratory conditions, with a general size range of 1–100 nm. and having quite different properties from the bulk material of similar composition (Auffan et al., 2009 ). NPs could be classified as carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes (SWNT, MWNT), graphene; inorganic nanoparticles and polymer nanocomposites (Mauter and Elimelech, 2008 ). Inorganic nanoparticles include pure metal oxides, quantum dots, mixed metal oxides and pure metals (Shah and Ahmed, 2011 ; Savage and Diallo, 2005 ). Different nanomaterials have diverse morphologies and shapes like tubes, thin films, spheres, rods, prisms, buds etc. The materials can execute various enhanced properties (catalytic, optical, electric, magnetic etc.) in the nanoscale range (Roco and Brainbridge, 2001 ). Researchers from different parts of the world have given considerable attention to these unusual and enhanced properties of nanomaterials. Government organizations and Industrial sectors are also giving attention and raising research funds to develop this prospective research area. Nanomaterials have diverse fields of application, including electronics, biosensors, pharmaceuticals, biomedicines, environmental monitoring tools, catalysis, cosmetics, agricultural products, optics and photography, sports, textiles etc (Schmid, 2004 ; Shan et al., 2009 ). Several factors are responsible for the development of special properties in the nanomaterials:1. Size: Nanomaterials are nearly the molecular dimension that affects the mean free path of electrons or phonons, a coherency length, or screening length. These size factors control the electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of the materials.  2. Surface area: Due to their minuscule dimensions, nanomaterials usually have large surface area which makes them useful in the field of catalysis.  3. Structural defects: Different types of structural defects in the nanocrystals control the properties of the materials (Khan et al., 2019 ).    However, such factors predominate in nanocrystals containing different atoms or molecules from several phases rather than single-phase nanocrystalline materials. Several methods are available for the synthesis of size-regulated and well-defined nanomaterials, though the synthesis processes are not easy for standardization and execution (Shah and Ahmed, 2011 ; Savage and Diallo, 2005 ); many of these techniques are low-yielding. Researchers have made several modifications to the techniques to increase the production of materials, making them more applicable in field conditions. Nanomaterials possess various properties, such as a large surface-to-volume ratio, high catalytic potential, self-assembly ability, and high reactivity. These unique attributes make nanomaterials suitable for pollution control and environmental protection measures, as they offer promising capabilities to safeguard the environment (Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ). Several papers have been published previously which demonstrated the applications of novel materials in arsenic treatment. However, the present article brings the holistic view of arsenic remediation by including both the conventional and recent technologies, including the cutting-edge techniques which have emerging very recently, highlighting their usefulness and economic feasibility in application. The paper has an objective to show the gradual development in arsenic mitigation technologies, their comparative performances and how these approaches are synchronized with some of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Among all other reviews published in recent times, this paper, for the first time, established the connections between arsenic mitigation and SDGs.  2 Conventional arsenic removal technologies Several technologies are available for treating drinking water with arsenic contamination which have been tested both under laboratory and field conditions. The chemical form in which arsenic exists in water is an important factor that needs to be considered before water treatment (Singh et al., 2015a ). Since arsenite (As+3 ) is uncharged at pH below 9.2, most of the available technologies are efficient in removing arsenate (As+5 ) (Johnston and Heijnen, 2015 ). Some commonly used techniques for arsenic removal are (i) oxidation followed by precipitation, (ii) ion exchange, (iii) coagulation/electrocoagulation/co-precipitation, (iv) membrane technique and (v) adsorption onto sorbtive media (Nicomel et al., 2016 ; Ghosh et al., 2019 ; Kumar et al., 2019 ; Yadav et al., 2021 ). 2.1 Oxidation followed by precipitation This method is a simple, low-cost process of in situ  removal of arsenic (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Samuel et al., 2022 ). Since arsenic is mostly present as arsenite near neutral pH, oxidation is an important step in remediation. The oxidizing agents may be oxygen, ozone, free chlorine, hypochlorite, permanganate, and Fenton's reagent (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Nicomel et al., 2016 ). An important factor that needs special consideration before the selection of an appropriate oxidant is the presence of other interfering substance/s which have an influence on the kinetics of As(III). The oxidation process, particularly of drinking water, may be problematic due to t chemical residue of oxidant, by-product formation from oxidation of the organic and inorganic matters present in water, and operational complication (efficient control of pH and oxidation step). Therefore, oxidants should be selected carefully to remove arsenic efficiently from a solution by oxidation (Nicomel et al., 2016 ).  2.2 Ion exchange In this physiochemical method, an equivalent number of ions from the aqueous substrate are exchanged for solid-phase ions (Paul and Sarkar, 2016 ). The ion exchange process generally extracts arsenite from water, not arsenate (Jadhav et al., 2015 ). Efficacy of arsenic removal in ion-exchange process is hindered by dissolved salts (Jadhav et al., 2015 ), competitive ions (Litter et al., 2010 ), concentration of arsenic, and high sulphate (salts) (Sarkar and Paul, 2016 ). Ion exchange resins are cross-linked polymer matrix to which charged functional groups (carboxylate, sulphonate, tertiary or quaternary amines) are attached by covalent bonding. Anion exchange resins are categorized into two types: strong base and weak base, depending on the adhered functional groups. Strong base anion exchange resins are quite effective over a wide range of pH. On the other hand, weak base anion exchange resins function in acidic range. Several factors influence ion exchange among which pH, resin type, arsenic concentration and other competing ions are the major determinants (Paul and Sarkar, 2016 ). The metal-loaded resins are more efficient in arsenic removal (Dambies, 2005 ). Costly resins, costly and skilled operation, higher maintenance cost and disposal of toxic wastes are some of the drawbacks of this method (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ). The removal of arsenic from potable water by ion exchange resin was reported by Karakurt (2019) . Arsenic remediation below the permissible limit was achieved using Hybrid Ion Exchange/Electrodialysis (IXED) method (Ortega et al., 2017 ), similarly, Rivero et al. (2018)  also conducted the same for arsenate ion removal using a laboratory scale IXED found satisfactory results. Dong (2019)  reported about a Hybrid Ion Exchange Process (HIX-CO2 ) which can remove contaminants from brackish water without the requirement of a semi-permeable membrane.  2.3 Coagulation/electrocoagulation/co-precipitation Coagulation and precipitation (by chemical processes) and filtration (by physical processes) are very cost-effective and user-friendly. Iron salts and aluminum sulphate have been commonly used for coagulating arsenic. Treatment of water using alum and ferric salts can remove arsenic effectively from contaminated water (Bissen and Frimmel, 2003 ). However, both ferric and alum are more efficient in As(V) removal than over a wide range of pH. Removal efficiency is strongly dependent on the solution pH, not on the coagulant dosage or initial As(V) concentration. In case of As(III), the removal is independent of solution pH and strongly dependent on the coagulant dosage and As(III) concentration (Happer and Kingham, 1992 ). Ferric chloride has been found to be the most effective arsenic coagulant. Though it is an efficient method for arsenic removal, this method suffers from the problem of sludge disposal and dose control in rural condition are extremely difficult. Additionally, this method enhances total dissolved solids plus anions like chloride in treated water. Alum coagulation has also other implications like the production of toxic sludge, low removal of arsenic, and requirement of pre-oxidation (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Samuel et al., 2022 ). Electrocoagulation (EC) involves complicated and interdependent mechanisms with compact treatment facility, complete automation, and high-efficiency removals, though it possesses some pitfalls like electrode passivation, EC reactor design optimization, and huge power consumption (Mohora et al., 2018 ) but can remove both arsenate and arsenite with efficiency in the range 93–99.9% (Demirbas et al., 2019 ). Metals like iron, aluminum, titanium can be used for As removal by electrocoagulation (Kumar et al., 2004 ). Various authors reported complete arsenic remediation by the EC process (Ucar et al., 2013 ; Vasudevan et al., 2010 ) also removal of arsenite can be achieved by oxidizing to arsenate through EC method (Kumar et al., 2004 ). Adding an oxidant like hypochlorite oxidizes arsenite to arsenate which improves the efficiency of EC process (Flores et al., 2013 ). With the progression of time the EC process can rapidly remove As contamination owing to floc formation (Kumar et al., 2004 ). Recently, an alternative technique called Metal-Air Fuel Cell EC (MAFCEC) was proposed to resolve various drawbacks relating to high energy requirement in conventional EC process (Kobya et al., 2020 ; Maitlo et al., 2019 ), the integration of air-fuel cell with EC cycle is a fruitful way for As remediation without electricity requirement (Kobya et al., 2020 ; Maitlo et al., 2019 ).  2.4 Membrane technique Membrane techniques, including ultra-filtration, nano-filtration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), and electro-dialysis can remove various contaminants dissolved in water, including arsenic (Wiesner, 1993 ). Membrane technology is popularly regarded as the most effective technology for arsenic removal with efficiency around 96%. The membrane operational requirements are negligible, and no chemical is required (Ungureanu et al., 2015 ). Factors that significantly affect membrane performance are pore size and their distribution, surface charge, degree of hydrophilicity, flow of solution and presence of any functional groups (Abdullah et al., 2019 ). Generally, it was seen that As(V) removal is more effective than As(III). RO and NF remove As(V) with 91–99% efficiency, however, in case of As(III) only 20–55% removal efficiency is observed. Membrane techniques have high efficiency in diverse contaminant removal (including arsenic) without producing any harmful solid wastes during the process. However, the techniques are of high cost and consume considerable time for functioning (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Samuel et al., 2022 ). Of all the processes employed for arsenic remediation from water viz. microfiltration, nanofiltration, ultra-filtration and reverse osmosis, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are the most promising (Figoli et al., 2016 ). Membrane distillation (MD) is also an efficient process for the remediation of arsenic-contaminated water. The partial pressure developed over the hydrophobic microporous membrane facilitates the removal of water vapour and volatiles leaving the impurities below, for example, Arsenic (Criscuoli and Figoli, 2019 ). An adsorptive membrane was developed by membrane support layer modification by Fe3 O4  microspheres immobilization through reverse filtration followed by dopamine polymerization, which showed higher arsenic adsorption capacity compared to virgin and blended membranes (Zhang et al. 2018 ).  2.5 Adsorption method Adsorption technology has advantages over other methods and is widely accepted by different researchers across the world. This method can remove various contaminants from water including heavy metals and offers some advantages like high removal efficiency, low energy and technical requirement, and minimal chances of secondary pollution (Burakov et al., 2018 ). Absorbent should possess some desired characteristics like a larger specific surface area, high mechanical strength, greater thermal stability, environmental friendliness, controlled morphology, and easy processing, which would result in greater performance in terms of adsorption capacity and efficiency, selectivity, cheap cost, and reusability. This method can be applied conveniently in low-income countries because of its cost effectiveness (Bhattacharya et al., 2012 ). pH is an important factor for arsenic adsorption. As(V) removal is more efficient than As(III) at pH below 7 (Grafe et al., 2001 ; Wilkie and Hering, 1996 ; Zhu et al., 2013 ; Raven et al., 1998 ). Competing ions are also a limiting factor as they have competition with arsenic for accessing the adsorption sites (e.g. phosphate, silicate, HCO3  and Ca2+ ) (Zhu et al., 2013 ; Kanematsu et al., 2013 ; Giles et al., 2011 ). Adsorption by carbon :   Temperature, ionic strength, pH and activated carbon influence the adsorption efficiency of materials (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Samuel et al., 2022 ). Commercially available activated carbons are reported to adsorb up to 2860 mg/g in the case of commercial coal-derived carbon (Navarro and Alguacil, 2002 ; Lorenzen et al., 1995 ). Both As(III) and As(V) are adsorbed by activated carbon at different pH although the two forms may be adsorbed differently (Eguez and Cho, 1987 ). Activated carbon having a high amount of ash is more effective in As(V) removal (Navarro and Alguacil, 2002 ; Lorenzen et al., 1995 ). Recent research focused on the use of iron oxide and activated carbon composites which showed an adsorption efficiency of 95% for arsenic. This is achieved due to the magnetic properties of iron and the adsorption properties of activated carbon (Gallios et al., 2017 ; Yao et al., 2014 ). Adsorption by inorganic materials and biomaterials :   Because of their biocompatible and environment-friendly nature, bio-composites are considered useful materials in arsenic removal from contaminated water. Composite materials are composed of matrix and activated components (Samuel et al., 2022 ). In certain cases, agricultural waste and its byproducts like rice husk have been reported to be used for arsenic adsorption (Asif and Chen, 2017 ; Amin et al., 2006 ; Pillai et al., 2020 ). Inexpensive agricultural waste when used for removing arsenite from contaminated water showed good adsorption capacities (Mohan et al., 2019 ). Similarly industrial wastes like coals and chars have also been utilized (Allen et al., 1997 ; Sharma et al., 2022 ). Char from different plant species shows differential adsorption of arsenic with pine bark char showing maximum efficiency (Mohan et al., 2007 ). Compared to non-loaded biochar, the birnessite biochar has the potential to enhance arsenic adsorption in soil and water (Zhu et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, red mud also exhibits arsenic adsorption properties with favorable As(III) removal at high pH and As(V) removal at acidic pH (Wu et al., 2017 ; Altundoan et al., 2002 ). Treated and coated sands have also been used for removing arsenic (Devikarani et al., 2006 ). Coated sand with iron oxide is highly efficient in arsenic adsorption. Further modification by sulphate enhances its property to adsorb both As(III) and As(V) at alkaline and acidic pH respectively (Devi et al., 2014 ; Vaishya and Gupta, 2003 ). Both natural as well as synthetic zeolites also display As(III) and As(V) adsorption properties (Chutia et al., 2009 ; Khatamian et al., 2017 ). Hydrous iron (III) oxide incorporated with calcium ion shows 90% arsenite removal efficiency and this occurs through a chelation mechanism (Ghosh et al., 2019 ). An Adsorption-Ultrafiltration (UF) process was applied based on arsenic-spiked water by Hao et al. (2018) , the resulting adsorbent after six adsorption-regeneration cycles retained extremely high adsorption using the combined adsorption-UF method with a 10 wt percent NaOH and NaCl eluant. Researchers also studied the adsorption of arsenic from water by applying eucalyptus bark fibers (hybrid of Eucalyptus urophylla  and E. grandis ) and aquatic macrophyte leaves. Treated eucalyptus bark has good efficiency in adsorption of arsenic anions, and can be considered as a promising, cost effective and ecologically sustainable material in arsenic removal (Guisela et al., 2022 ). In recent researches, fly ash was collected from several coal power stations and its arsenic removal capacity from contaminated water was studied. Lignite based fly ash showed higher efficiency in arsenic removal at pH 4.0 compared to pH 7.0. The maple wood ash adsorbent was efficient in remediating more than 80% arsenic in dynamic column experiments (Samuel et al., 2022 ). However, due to issues related to permeability, stiffness, thermal stability, crystallinity and processing issues, these compounds cannot be applied effectively in some cases. Further research is required to increase the efficiency of bio-composites in heavy metals and arsenic removal from contaminated wastewater (Samuel et al., 2022 ). The arsenic sorption mechanism on bioadsorbent is shown in Fig. 1  . Possible chemical interactions like electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, chelation, surface oxidation, ion exchange, precipitation etc. are shown on the surface of the bioadsorbent. Adsorption by metal oxides :   Metal oxides can adsorb both As(III) and As(V) from contaminated water (Min et al., 2009 ; Violante et al., 2009 ; Wen et al., 2014 ; Yamani et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 2015b) . Manganese dioxide (MnO2 ) can oxidize As(III). This also leads to MnO2  surface alteration resulting in higher adsorption of As(V) (Wen et al., 2014 ; Manning et al., 2002 ). Similarly, titanium dioxide can oxidize As(III) to As(V) (Lata and Samadder, 2016 ; Nicomel et al., 2015 ). Iron oxides as discussed previously are similarly very effective in adsorbing both As(III) and As(V) at different pH (Guo and Chen, 2005 ; Wang et al., 2015c ; Basu et al., 2015 ). Several factors determine the efficiency of arsenic adsorption. For example, goethite nanoparticles adsorb As(V) maximally at pH 3.0. The pattern of adsorption was monolayer, as evidenced by the Langmuir isotherm equation. An adsorbent dose of 6g L−1  in 50 mg L−1  As(V) containing solution removed 99% As(V) (Ghosh et al., 2012 ). Amorphous FeO(OH) has a high surface area resulting in its high adsorption capacity (Li et al., 2017 ). Cai et al. (2022)  reported the removal of As(III) by iron-manganese composite coupled with sulfite (FeMnOx/S(IV)). Almost all of As(III) was oxidized to As(V) in a 10 min time frame. Recently an iron/olivine hybrid was employed for arsenic adsorption, together with an artificial neural network and surface response approach (Ghosal et al., 2018 ). Calcined polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate present in alum sludge was also employed column studies, batch-test capabilities and adsorption kinetics for enhancing arsenic remediation kinetics (Kang et al., 2019 ). Adsorption by activated alumina :   The large surface area of activated alumina (AA) due to its micro and macro pores makes it a suitable material for arsenic adsorption (Singh and Pant, 2004 ; Das et al., 2013 ). As(V) adsorption is quite effective at a pH range of 6–8 on positively charged AA. Manganese oxide or ferric hydroxide modification of AA surface further enhances AA adsorption efficiency (Lescano et al., 2015 ; Maliyekkal et al., 2009 ). The high iron content of groundwater is a major setback to the adsorption method since it clogs the filters and reduces its lifespan (AIIH, 2001 ).   3 Synthesis and applications of nanostructured materials in arsenic removal Nanoparticles (NPs) and nanocomposites are more efficient in removing arsenic in comparison to micro sized materials (Lata and Samadder, 2016 ). The synthesis and applications of nanostructured materials in arsenic removal have gained significant attention in recent years. Nanostructured materials, characterized by their unique properties at the nanoscale, offer enhanced surface areas, high reactivity, and improved adsorption capacities, making them promising candidates for efficient arsenic removal from water sources. The synthesis of nanostructured materials for arsenic removal involves various methods, such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, co-precipitation, and chemical vapour deposition. These techniques allow precise control over the size, shape, and composition of the nanomaterials, enabling the tailoring of their properties to suit specific arsenic removal requirements. Some common nanostructured materials used for arsenic removal include:1. Metal Oxide Nanoparticles: Metal oxides such as iron oxide (Fe3 O4 ), titanium dioxide (TiO2 ), and aluminum oxide (Al2 O3 ) nanoparticles have shown excellent arsenic adsorption capabilities due to their high surface area and surface reactivity.  2. Carbon-Based Nanomaterials: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) have been explored for arsenic removal due to their large surface area and strong adsorption interactions with arsenic species.  3. Nanocomposites: Hybrid materials, such as metal oxide-graphene composites, have demonstrated synergistic effects in arsenic removal, combining the advantages of both components.  4. Biomaterials: Several adsorptive materials derived and developed from biological materials (including biochar) are cost-effective materials useful in arsenic removal from water.    The applications of nanostructured materials in arsenic removal include both batch experiments in laboratory settings and continuous flow systems in field conditions. Some advantages of using nanostructured materials for arsenic removal include higher removal efficiencies, rapid kinetics, and the potential for regeneration and reusability. However, challenges remain in implementing these nanomaterials on a larger scale. Issues such as material stability, cost-effectiveness, and potential environmental impacts require further investigation. Moreover, careful consideration of the risks and benefits associated with nanotechnology in arsenic removal is essential to ensure safe and sustainable applications. Research efforts are ongoing to bridge the gap between laboratory-scale success and real-world field conditions, bringing these promising nanostructured materials closer to practical and effective arsenic removal solutions. As discussed earlier, nanoparticles have a have a high surface to volume ratio with other special properties of high catalytic efficency, reactivity, etc. (Qu et al., 2013 ; Hristovski et al., 2007 ) which makes them suitable materials of choice as adsorbants (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Nicomel et al., 2016 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ). 3.1 Metal-based nanomaterials Several metal-based nanomaterials were synthesized and tested for their efficiency by different researchers and many of them were found to be useful in arsenic remediation. Hydrated Cerium Oxide nanoparticle was synthesized by precipitation method and applied for arsenic sorption study (Li et al., 2012 ). A kinetic study using the adsorbent showed that 87% As(III) and 83% As(V) were removed from the solution in the first 30 min of contact time. It was found that the adsorbent was highly effective in arsenic removal even at very low concentrations. α and δ-phase manganese dioxide nano-adsorbents were synthesized and studied for their As(V) adsorption behavior (Singh et al., 2010 ). α-MnO2  nanosphere having diameter within the range 1–3 μm was synthesized by the process of catalytic oxidation of Mn(II) acetate (Zhang and Sun, 2013 ). The maximum monolayer As(V) sorption capacity of the adsorbent was 14.5 mg/g 56% of adsorbed As(V) was desorbed with 1 mol/L NaOH solution. As(V) sorption on the adsorbent surface took place by inner-sphere surface complex formation. The MnO2  sphere could be effectively recovered by the microfiltration process and reused (Zhang and Sun, 2013 ). Hierarchical nanostructure CuO had been synthesized and high arsenic adsorption capacity was found (Cao et al., 2007 ). The mono-layer As(III) sorption capacity was 5.7 mg/g. The CuO adsorbent could be successfully regenerated by rinsing the material with arsenic-free water and could be reused for arsenic sorption. CuO nanoparticles were synthesized and arsenic removal from groundwater was studied (Martinson and Reddy 2009 ). Arsenic adsorption happened in a short period of time and CuO nanoparticles were able to remove both As(III) and As(V) efficiently between pH 6 and 10, having a maximum adsorption capacity was 26.9 mg/g and 22.6 mg/g for As(III) and As(V) respectively (Martinson and Reddy 2009 ). Cylindrical shape CuO nanoparticles were efficient in arsenic removal from groundwater samples containing different ions like silicate, sulphate, phosphate, nitrate etc (Martinson and Reddy 2009 ). The adsorbent could be regenerated by using NaOH (Reddy et al., 2013 ). A novel photo-oxidation and adsorption-based CuO–Fe3 O4  magnetic material has been synthesized for As(III) removal. Under light irradiation, The nanoparticles are able to oxidize As(III) to As(V) completely through photo-oxidation within 60 min (Sun et al., 2017 ). Subsequently As(V) is adsorbed on the nanoparticles efficiently. Fig. 2   shows the synthesis pathway of novel photo-oxidation and adsorption based CuO–Fe3 O4  magnetic material for As(III) removal.  3.2 Mixed oxide and multi-metal nanomaterials Nano-agglomerates of mixed oxides like iron-titanium, iron-chromium, iron-cerium, iron-manganese, iron-zirconium, cerium-aluminium, cerium-manganese etc. have been applied to remove arsenic from contaminated groundwater (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ; QL Zhang et al., 2007 ; Gupta et al., 2011 , 2012 ; Gupta et al., 2011 ; A. Gupta et al., 2012 ). The characterization of these oxides was done using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and BET surface area analysis. The thermodynamic properties for sorption, the effect of pH and sorption kinetics of these materials have also been studied (Stanić and Nujić, 2015 ). Gupta et al. synthesized and characterized ceria-associated manganese oxide nanoparticles. TEM images of the nanoparticles showed garland-like chain structure with void space, with varied particle sizes of 70–90 nm. and 15–20 nm. in two different samples (Fig. 3  ). SEM images showed that the particles were interconnected in a sheet-like structure (Fig. 4  ). Cerium manganese nanoparticles demonstrated their efficiency in arsenic (V) adsorption (Gupta et al., 2011 ). Multi-metal oxide nanomaterials were synthesized and studied for arsenic remediation. Several experiments proved that multi-metal oxides have greater sorption capacity than individual metal oxides. The underlying reason may be due to the increase of surface energy, number of active sites per unit volume, surface area etc. In many studies, multivalent metal oxides show magnetic properties which make the separation process easier during the sorption process. Several nanostructured binary metal oxides like iron-titanium, iron-zirconium, iron-manganese and cerium-manganese mixed oxides were synthesized, characterized and applied for arsenic removal from groundwater (Gupta et al., 2008a,b , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 ; Gupta and Ghosh, 2009 ; Gupta et al., 2012 ). All of these metal oxides executed very high capacity of arsenic removal (>90%) in both As(III) and As(V). Desorption studies showed that NaOH and KOH were effective in regenerating the adsorbents. Nanostructured Fe(III)–Cu(II) binary oxide was synthesized by a simple precipitation method and was applied for arsenic removal (Zhang et al., 2013 ). The effect of solution pH showed that the material could be effectively used within the pH range 6.5–8.5 for the removal of both forms of arsenic. The adsorbent could be regenerated by NaOH application. Micro and nano multi-functional polymeric adsorbents doped with bimetals like Fe, Al was synthesized and studied for arsenic removal from contaminated water. As(V) sorption capacity of these materials was found to be very high (40 mg/g). Several metal oxide nanomaterials had been utilized in fixed bed columns for arsenic sorption from groundwater. All the nanomaterials showed very high As(V) adsorption (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Kumar et al., 2011 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ). A synergistic approach of molecular imprinting and metal–organic ligand chemistry was applied for synthesizing a new polymer-based nano-adsorbent specific for As(V). The imprinted polymer with nanopores (nano MIP) displayed high arsenic adsorption capacity with an efficiency of 98%. Washing with 0.1 M HNO3  solution regenerated the material, leading to its reuse for up to 10 consecutive cycles (Mankar et al., 2020 ). Combustion synthesis of iron oxide/iron-coated carbons like As activated carbon, cellulose fibre, anthracite, and silica are also efficient nano-materials in arsenic sorption (Hristovski et al., 2007 ). Alumina crucibles are applied for performing chemical reactions. The arsenic removal percentage varied between 25.8% and 96.7% for different samples (Hristovski et al., 2007 ).  3.3 Iron-based nanomaterials Iron-based compounds and its oxides and hydroxides have been successfully used for arsenic removal. Various forms of iron used for the purpose include goethite, hematite, iron-based LDHs, iron nanoparticles, activated carbon doped with iron, mineral oxides doped with iron, etc. (Maity et al., 2021 ). Due to the existence of unpaired electrons in Fe(II) and Fe(III), their oxides exhibit magnetic behaviour, this property is exploited for the remediation of arsenic from water. Various iron oxide derivatives like magnetite (Fe3 O4 ), hematite (α-Fe2 O3 ), maghemite (γ -Fe2 O3 ), goethite (α-FeOOH), and amorphous hydrous ferric oxide (Fe(O)–OH) assist in Arsenic remediation (Bach et al., 2010 ; Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003 ). High-gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) is a useful method to separate iron nanoparticles from other solutions like water (Yeap et al., 2017 ). Additionally, the high surface-to-volume ratio, ease of surface modifications as per need, and low toxicity make iron nanoparticles and their derivatives a material of choice for arsenic removal (Mohmood et al., 2013 ). Iron compounds like maghemite (γ-Fe2 O3 ), hematite (α-Fe2 O3 ), goethite (α-FeOOH), ferrihydrite (Fe5 HO8 ·4H2 O), akaganeite (β-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (δ-FeOOH) are widely used for arsenic remediation. All these materials have a low leaching property (Ghanizadeh et al., 2010 ; Feng et al., 2012 ; Nassar, 2012 ). Magnetite nano-particles were synthesized by different researchers and used for the purpose of both As(III) and As(V) removal (Khodabakhshi et al., 2011 ; Yavuz et al., 2006 , 2010 ; Mayo et al., 2007 ; Yean et al., 2005 ; Chowdhury and Yanful, 2011 ). Magnetite nano-particles can be separated from the liquid phase after adsorption by the application of an external magnetic field column separator. The percentages of As(III) and As(V) removal depend on the size of the particles. Nanosized Hydrated Ferric Oxide (HFO)-Loaded Polymeric hybrid sorbents were synthesized for arsenate removal (Zhang et al., 2008 ). The sorbents were very efficient in removing arsenic in the column experiment. A mixture of 4% NaCl and 8% NaOH was used to regenerate the sorbent (Zhang et al., 2008 ). Many researchers reported that nano-sized iron oxide is much more efficient in arsenic removal than micro sized iron oxide (Raven et al., 1998 ; Siddiqui and Chaudhry, 2017a , 2017b ; Mayo et al., 2007 ). Tang et al. (2011)  used a solvent thermal technique to create sphere-shaped ultrafine iron oxide, α-Fe2 O3  NPs having size of 5 nm. On particle aggregation, a highly porous structure with a large surface area was formed, where the surfaces of the NPs were coated by hydroxyl groups, which aided in the removal of arsenic. Fe2 O3  NPs (90 mm) can remediate 60–80% of As(III) from contaminated water (Prasad et al., 2011 ) having 1.94 mg/g of highest monolayer removal success. Iron oxy hydroxide NPs having highly porous structure (δ  -FeOOH) showed efficiency for arsenic remediation, with a size of 20 nm, surface area of 135 m2/g, pore diameters of 18 nm, and zero charge potential of 8.4 (Faria et al., 2014 ) with highest adsorption capacity in non-ideal monolayer formation was found to be 37.3 mg/g. However, arsenic (AsIII and AsV) decreased to 50% from 90% under anoxic conditions. Liu et al. (2016a)  used graphene-like super paramagnetic γ - Fe2 O3  nano sheets, reported adsorption of 100 and 39 mg/g for As(III) and As(V) respectively. Ferrihydrite particles of nano sized have potential to become suitable absorptive substance. Similarly, naturally occurring iron oxide minerals like α- Fe2 O3 , Fe3 O4 , α-FeOOH and iron-rich laterite soil have been utilized to remediate arsenic at pH levels ranging from 4 to 11 (Aredes et al., 2012 ), with efficiencies in the order α-FeOOH > Fe3 O4  > α-Fe2 O3 . Raul et al. (2014)  used non-magnetic polycrystalline iron oxide hydroxide NPs for remediation of As(III) contamination in drinking water with highest removal efficiency of 475 μg/g for As(III). Various report findings indicating that granular Fe(OH)3  offers promise in the field of arsenic water remediation, Badruzzaman et al. (2004) , Banerjee et al. (2008) , and Westerhoff et al. (2005)  found that it has a substantial removal capability of granular Fe(OH)3  for arsenic. In both natural waters and model systems, GFH has a high potential for adsorption (Hassan, 2023 ). Other iron oxides, such as akaganeite, feroxyhyte, and lepidocrocite, had also been studied for arsenic removal from water. Because akaganeite has a larger surface area than α-FeOOH and ferrihydrite and a hollandite-like crystal structure with a tunnel, it has a higher adsorption capacity than α-FeOOH and ferrihydrite. Kolbe et al. (2011)  calculated akaganeite's maximal adsorption capacities for As(III) and As(V) to be 45.5 and 108.3 mg/g, respectively. Amine-rich Fe3 O4 /bacterial cellulose nanocomposite (BC@MH nano-composite) was able to remediate 90 mg/g of As(V) from water (Nata et al., 2011 ). FeOx  composite can remove 10 and 12.5 mg/g, of As(III) and As(V), respectively (Thakkar et al., 2015 ). Iron-oxide nano-composite (CINs) modified with Chitosan can remove 267.2 mg/g of As(III) at pH 6.0 from water (Gerard et al., 2016 ). Electro spun polyacrylonitrile modified super paramagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPION) were developed which were used for As(V) ions removal from water (Morillo et al., 2016 ). Batch studies with porous charred granulated attapulgite-supported hydrated iron oxide showed maximum As(III ) and As(V) removal capacity of 3.25 and 5.09 mg/g respectively (Yin et al., 2017 ). More recently, mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT)- functionalized SiO2@Fe3 O4  nano-composite have shown 93% As(V) remediation under optimum conditions (Sheikhmohammadi et al., 2018 ). Other nano composites that have demonstrated intense affinity towards arsenic having higher capacity for adsorption and are easily separable includes γ-Fe2 O3 /SBA-15 nano-composite (Peng et al., 2018 ), manganese iron oxide (MnFe2 O4 ) (Qi et al., 2018), and Fe3 O4 -ZIF-8 core-shell composites (Huo et al., 2018 ), calcium-based magnetic biochar (Ca-MBC) (Wu et al., 2018b ). Yttrium-doped iron oxide magnetic adsorbent was found to have maximum adsorption capacity of 170.48 and 84.22 mg/g for As(III) and As(V) respectively (Yu et al., 2018 ). clay-activated carbon composite beads modified by iron oxide have been found to be efficient for arsenic remediation (Pawar et al., 2018 ).  3.4 Nanostructured alumina Arsenate sorption on nano active alumina was reported by X.H. Guan and co-workers (Guan et al., 2009 ). The average particle size of the material was 2.99 nm, with a specific surface area of 359 m2 /g. Effect of initial solution pH study on As(V) sorption showed that the sorption capacity depends on the initial loading of arsenic. W. Li also reported an arsenic sorption study of highly ordered mesoporous alumina (Li et al., 2011b ). The team synthesized different alumina samples having pore sizes ranging from 3.8 nm. to 6.6 nm. The mesoporous alumina has a wide pH range at which it can remove arsenate ions (pH 4–9). The material showed arsenate and arsenite sorption capacity of 19.8 mg/g and 5.0 mg/g respectively at low concentration range. Mesoporous γ-Al2 O3  sized between 2 and 10 nm showed excellent results when employed for removal of arsenic from water (Patra et al., 2012 ). Various types of activated nonporous alumina with large surface area (200–300 m2 /g) are used for arsenic remediation; the large surface area increases the sorption sites. Recently Prabhakar and Samadder (2018)  constructed a cheaper Al2 O3  NP and observed an adsorption capacity of 500 μg/g at 25 °C. Alumina supported iron nanoparticles was reported to totally remediate As(III ) from water at optimal concentrations (Jain and Agarwal 2017 ), having maximum adsorption capacity of 15.50 mg/g.  3.5 Nanoscale zerovalent iron Zerovalent iron (nZVI) has the ability to adsorb several toxic metals which includes arsenic. Due to its high capacity of adsorption, nZVI is a good material of choice for treating arsenic-contaminated water (Li et al., 2006 ; Morgada et al., 2009 ). nZVI has greater efficiency to adsorb arsenic in comparison to sorptive media and granular iron particles (Li et al., 2006 ). A combination of ZVI with potassium permanganate and ferrous ions (Fe(II)–KMnO4 -ZVI) is highly efficient and is able to remove toxic As (III) at a broad pH range and concentration (20–100 mg L−1 ) (Deng et al., 2017 ). However, the mechanism associated with nZVI immobilization is unclear. Arsenic removal by nZVI involves surface precipitation, reduction, adsorption, co-precipitation with different iron corrosion products like ferric/ferrous oxides and hydroxides (Mak et al., 2009 ). Recently, green routes have been followed for synthesizing low cost nZVI. Leaf extracts of cherry, mulberry and oak have been used for the preparation of nZVI (Sofija et al., 2016 ). During green synthesis of zZVI, as reducing agents, extracts of Vaccinium corymbosum  leaves and shoots have been used (Cerda et al., 2017 ). However, green nZVI is less efficient than chemically synthesized nZVI. Now-a-days nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) is successfully used to remediate contaminants due to their low cost and high remediation efficiency. Due to the low particle size and high surface area of very low amount of NZVI can effectively and safely remediate arsenic (AsIII) from water (Rahmani et al., 2011 ). NZVI is also successful in removing As(V) in acidic environment (Visanu et al., 2011 ). Presence of phosphate (PO4 3− ), Bicarbonate (HCO3− ) and Humic Acid (HA) inhibits AS(III) remediation by NZVI while Chloride (Cl− ) and Calcium (Ca2+ ) enhances AS(III) remediation, Chloride (Cl− ) and Bicarbonate (HCO3− ) slightly affects removal of As(V) (Haoran et al., 2012 ). 100% arsenic removal was achieved from smelting wastewater using NZVI with average removal capacity of 239 mg/g (Li et al., 2014 ). Li et al. (2017b)  obtained 100% As(III) concentration reduction. Plant leaf extracts have been used to manufacture NZVI for cost reduction (Sofija et al., 2016 ), which showed good results (Adio et al., 2017 ). But, green NZVI are slower than chemically synthesized NZVI (green NZVI optimum time 120 min against 60 min of chemical NZVI) though the performance can be improved by addition of oxidants in the solution like persulfate (PS), peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and hydrogen peroxide (HP) for As(III) removal (Kang et al., 2018 ). Recently, a nanoscale polyaniline/Fe0 composite was developed which showed As(III) and As(V) ions removal capacities of 232.5 mg/g and 227.3 mg/g, respectively (Bhaumik et al., 2015 ). The montmorillonite-supported core-shell Fe(0) nanostructured composite showed maximum adsorption capacity of 59.9 and 45.5 mg/g, for As(III ) and As(V), respectively (Bhowmick et al., 2014 ). Similarly, fuller's earth immobilized NZVI, and removed 50.08 and 91.42 mg/g of As(III) and As(V), respectively, from aqueous solution (Yadav et al., 2016 ). Starch-derived mesoporous carbonaceous material after modification with NZVI resulted in the removal of 27 mg/g As(III) (Baikousi et al., 2015 ). Similarly, chitosan after NZVI modification was able to remove 115 mg/g and 87 mg/g of As(III ) and As(V) respectively (Su et al., 2016 ). Horzum et al. (2013)  and Liu et al. (2016b)  reported arsenic remediation by using chitosan fiber supported NZVI (CFS-NZVI) and chitosan modified NZVI supported pumice (CS–P-NZVI) respectively. For large scale applications nanobunches (NBZI) have been put forward for arsenic removal and have shown 60 times greater As(III) removal capacity than NZVI at pH 7 (Tang et al., 2017 ). Wang et al. (2017)  found that a stabilizer needs to be used for NZVI since its aggregation affects the As(V) removal capacity. Also, nowadays various modified nano-composites of NZVI like hydroxyl-functionalized TiO2 @SiO2 @Ni/NZVI nano-composite (Huang et al., 2018 ), and Zeolite-supported NZVI (Li et al., 2018 ) have showed better results compared to virgin NZVI.  3.6 Carbon nanotubes Due to their superior adsorption capability, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their composites have received considerable interest in recent times (Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ). High metal enrichment and detection sensitivity, and selectivity are characteristics of CNTs. CNTs can directly interact with water pollutants through various interactions due to their carbonaceous nature and highly reactive surface area (Hasnain and Nayak, 2019 ). Their surface can be modified easily by processes like acid treatment, metal impregnation, and functional molecules/group grafting. Although CNTs are challenging to remove from adsorption solutions, the introduction of CNTs-based magnetic hybrids has solved the issue. Iron nanoparticle-enriched modified activated carbons and zeolites showed increased heavy metal adsorption capabilities (Stani, M.H., Nuji, 2015 ). Cerium oxide supported on carbon nanotubes (CeO2 -CNTs) was created as a unique sorbent having a high surface area (189 m2 /g), and a high capacity for removing arsenic. Ca2+  and Mg2+  eliminated 81.9 and 78.8 mg/g of As(V) respectively (Peng et al., 2005 ). Magnetite-coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Fe3 O4 -MWNTs) was synthesized which was capable to remove both As(V) and As(III) (Mishra and Ramaprabhu, 2010 ). The removal of arsenic (As(III), As(V)) and selenium (Se(IV), Se(VI)) from aqueous solutions was studied in batch experiments by applying magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MIO–MWCNTs) as adsorbents (Lee and Kim, 2016 ). Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles combined with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MIO-MWCNTs) were capable of adsorbing As(III) at pH 1.6 to 6.8 and As (V) at pH 1.7 to 7.9 (Li et al., 2016 ). As(III) and As(V) were more readily absorbed by a nanocomposite synthesized by trapping iron oxide within a carbon nanosphere compared to activated carbon, mesoporous carbon and CNTs (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b ). An important advantage of CNTs is that they can be functionalized for increasing their metal ion removal efficiency. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalization of CNTs results in its improved capacity to remove As(V) from contaminated water. Metal ion adsorption on PEG CNTs shows strong pH dependence (Nicomel et al., 2016 ; Velickovic et al., 2013 ). As(V) removal efficiency of Ti-loaded basic yttrium carbonate (BYC) from contaminated media was studied. The composite showed high capacity of adsorption in a wide pH range of 3–11 (Lee et al., 2015 ).  3.7 Titanium based nanomaterials Research has indicated that titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) and TiO2 -based materials are quite potent in arsenic removal (Ashraf et al., 2019 ; Nazari et al., 2021 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2021 ). TiO2  has strong photo-oxidizing power and redox selectivity which is helpful for the oxidizing step for As(III) oxidation and their nanofibers have also demonstrated arsenic adsorption capability (Demirel et al., 2017 ; Jegadeesan et al., 2010 ; Yan et al., 2016 ). It has been observed that equilibrium adsorption of As(III) and As(V) by nanocrystalline TiO2  follows pseudo-second-order kinetics (Guan et al., 2012 ; Peng et al., 2005 ). It is reported that 70% of trivalent arsenic is adsorbed in 30 min by crystalline hydrous titanium dioxide (Manna et al., 2004 ). Fe3 O4 –TiO2  nanoparticle which displays super paramagnetism, has the ability to remove both As(III) and As(V). These nanoparticles removed about 100 μg/L of As(V) with complete efficiency and 100 μg/L of As(III) with 93% efficiency (Beduk, 2016 ). Fe2 O3 –TiO2  porous ceramic (Fe/TiPC) beads are extensively reusable and within 2 h, remove up to 90% As (V) and As(III) by UV irradiation. These nanomaterials exhibit photocatalytic properties (Su et al., 2017a, 2017b ). Crystalline TiO2  adsorbed As(V) better while amorphous TiO2  showed partial oxidation of As(III) (Jegadeesan et al., 2010 ), Xu et al. (2010)  successfully remediated As(III) using highly porous, hydrous TiO2  NPs (3–8 nm). Anatase (a form of TiO2 ) has shown maximum adsorption of 16.98 mg/g for arsenic (Kocabas and Yurum, 2013 ). TiO2  nano-crystals show maximum adsorption efficiency between pH 8 and 4, while at pH 12 adsorption capacity was lowest for both As(III) and As(V) (Wei et al., 2016 ). Chitin hydro-gel with reinforced TiO2  NPs showed 3.1 mg/g of maximum arsenic removal capacity (Ramos et al., 2016 ). nano-composite of TiO2  polymer was reported to remediate 150 mg/g of As(V) (Urbano et al., 2015 ). cysteine@ZnS:TiO2 NPs modified molecularly imprinted biofouling-resistant 3D filtration membrane is able to remediate 95% of As(III) and As(V) ions (Roy et al., 2016 ). High As(III) adsorption capacity of 114 mg/g was shown by Granular TiO2 –La composite (Yan et al., 2017 ). Muñoz et al. (2017) found higher oxidation rate of As(III) onto TiO2  + zero valent iron (ZVI) compared to ZVI. Fe3 O4 @SiO2 @TiO2  nano sorbent showed maximum adsorption capacity at pH 9 of 31.4 mg/g and 10.2 mg/g for As(III) and As(V), respectively (Feng et al., 2017 ). Nano-TiO2 /feldspar embedded chitosan composite was able to adsorb arsenic via linear and nonlinear modelling (2 and 2.02 mg/g) respectively (Yazdani et al., 2017 ). Recently, for photocatalytic oxidation and subsequent adsorption of arsenic various materials were utilized namely microscopic TiO2  and TiOF2  materials (Gomaa et al., 2018 ), hydroxyl-functionalized TiO2 @SiO2 @Ni/NZVI nano-composites (Huang et al., 2018 ), cerium-doped titanium (Li et al., 2011a ), and g-C3 N4 /TiO2  (Jiang et al., 2018 ). Fe-TiOx magnetic NPs was developed on surface of pineapple-peelings (CPa-Fe/TiOx) which showed 40 mg/g of adsorption (Rosales et al., 2018a ). MgO/TiO2 /Ag composite also showed excellent affinity for As(V) having maximum adsorption capacity of 90.66 mg/g at pH 7.0 (Zhang and Jia 2018 ).  3.8 Zirconia and zirconia-based nanomaterials Zirconia nanoparticles were applied for both As (III) and As (V) removal (Ma et al., 2011 ; Zheng et al., 2012 ). Granular activated carbon media impregnated with zirconium dioxide nanoparticles (Zr-GAC) is quite effective in arsenic removal from contaminated water (Sandoval et al., 2011 ). Though limited literature is available, but ZrO2  NPs are stable, more suitable to regenerate, and have high adsorption capacities for arsenic compared to iron or aluminium NPs. ZrO2  NPs have shown high absorptivity especially for arsenic, and can effectively remediate As(III) without the need for any pre-oxidation step (Zheng et al., 2012 ). Dual pore structured nano-sized ZrO2  spheres having large surface area (98 m2/g) were more efficient compared to ZrO2  NPs for remediation of As(III) and As(V) (Cui et al., 2013 ).  3.9 Graphene Distinct features of graphene materials are their large surface area and presence of surface functional groups which make them great choices for water remediation (Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ). Additionally, it is reusable, can be separated magnetically, has a high removal efficiency and kinetics. Graphene sheets have been developed  by hydrogen-induced exfoliation of graphitic oxide. This is followed by functionalization to further improve its arsenic binding properties  (Mishra and Ramaprabhu, 2011 ). The sheets are very efficient in removing As(III) and As(V) from both contaminated fresh water and sea water. Nanohybrids of graphene oxide and manganese ferrite (MnFe2 O4 ) magnetic NPs have also been developed and their efficiency in arsenic removal been evaluated (Kumar et al., 2014 ). In a study, graphene nanoplate-supported CuFe2 O4  composite (GNPs/CuFe2 O4 ) adsorbed up to 58 mg/g at various different pH conditions (La et al., 2017 ). A nanocomposite of Cu-exchanged zeolite A (Cu-ZEA), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3 O4 ) has a high surface area and removes 50.51 mg/g arsenic (Khatamian et al., 2017 ). Graphene oxide has been used as a substrate to support zirconium hydroxide (ZrO(OH )2 ) nanoparticles and it removes both As(III ) and As(V) from contaminated media. It displayed high adsorption efficiency for both arsenic forms (Luo et al., 2013 ). Arsenic removal efficiency was studied by using two–dimensional and three-dimensional graphene-based nanomaterials from contaminated water. Removal of arsenic was studied as a function of varying pH, temperature, co-existing ions and loaded metal or metal oxide. Maximum removal capacity for As(III) was 138.79 mg/g and that of As(V) was 183.11 mg/g respectively (Yang et al., 2016 ). Kumar and Jiang (2017)  have studied b-cyclodextrin decorated functionalized graphene oxide as a material for As(III) and As(V) adsorption. In the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of graphene oxide modified magnetite (Fe3 O4 ) nanoparticles, this adsorbent shows high adsorption capacity for As(III) and As(V). It is also separable magnetically which is an added advantage. Another advantage is that the adsorbent is reusable as it can be regenerated by NaOH (Kumar and Jiang, 2017 ). Magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) has also been synthesized in order to remove As(III) from aqueous solutions. It is reusable and does not significantly lose its performance even after 4 adsorption cycles (Sherlala et al., 2018 ). Chitosan-magnetic-graphene oxide (CMGO) nanocomposites’ adsorption isotherm has shown that the adsorption data fits well to Langmuir isotherm model, suggesting that the adsorption is a homogeneous process. Thermodynamic analysis has indicated that As(III) adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous. The superparamagnetic properties of the nanocomposite assist in magnetic recovery (Sherlala et al., 2019 ). Macroporous 3D GO hydrogel (MGOH) was effective in adsorbing both the arsenic species, having a sorption capacity of 74.2 mg g−1 and 25.1 mg g−1 for for As(V) and As(III), respectively (Liang et al., 2019 ). By using a sol-gel process technique, iron/iron oxide (Fe/FexOy) core-shell structured iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) have been coated on the surface of graphene oxide to create a graphene oxide iron nanohybrid (GFeN) (GO). In the instance of GFeN, removal capacities of 306 mg/g for As(III) and 431 mg/g for As(V) have been observed. About 99% arsenic is removed in less than 10 min using this nanohybrid. It has been suggested that electrostatic interaction and surface complexation are involved in arsenic removal by GFeN (Das et al., 2020 ). Materials based on Graphene oxide have also been used in heavy metal remediation (Liu et al., 2019 ) also graphene in its reduced from is successfully used for water treatment (Saikia et al., 2019 ; Upadhyay et al., 2020 ). Barik et al. (2020)  created a mesoporous silica 3D scaffold doped with graphene oxide flakes (GOFs) and showed its ability to remove Pb2+  and As3+  ions from groundwater samples. A novel nanocomposite adsorbent material was synthesized by a group of researchers, using graphene oxide (GO) and a zirconium-based metal–organic framework (Wang et al., 2015c ), i.e., UiO-66-NDC [Zr6 O4 (OH)4 (1,4-NDC)6 ]n. The adsorbent was applied as an adsorbent to remove As(V) from water. The UiO-66-NDC/GO showed good performance in As(V) removal across a wide pH range of 1–10; the best adsorption efficiency was noted at pH 3. At the ideal pH, UiO-66-NDC/GO showed extremely high efficiency in As(V) removal (147.06 mg/g), which is the highest arsenate adsorption capacity recorded so far (Singh et al., 2022 ).  3.10 Nanocellulose materials For removing hazardous compounds from waste water, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), cellulose fibres (CF), and nanocellulose (NC) are all thought to be particularly effective adsorbents. Owing to the functionalization of its surface O–H groups it can be used for a wide range of applications (Abou-Zeid et al., 2018 ; Curvello et al., 2019 ; Norrrahim et al., 2021 ). Dialdehyde nanocrystalline cellulose grafted with diethylene triamine (DETA-g-DA-NCC) was effectively used for adsorption of As(III) and As(V). The results showed 92.84% removal for As(III) and 97.86% removal for As (V) respectively at equilibrium (Singh et al., 2015b ). Nath et al. (2016)  showed the application of a bimodal nanocomposite fabricated from Zno, CeO2 : nanocellulose and polyaniline exhibiting arsenic removal efficiency of about 95% along with antibacterial properties. So, dual properties involving arsenic removal and antimicrobial properties was demostrated using this novel bio-nanocomposite. Nanocomposite synthesized using hydroxyapatite-bentonite-clay-nanocrystalline cellulose was used to remove As(III) from water solution with a removal efficiency of 95% within 5 min (Hokkanen et al., 2019 ). Likewise, Chai et al. (2020) synthesized pH-sensitive nanomaterials based on nanocellulose (NC) crosslinked with polyethylemeimine (PI) using the crosslinker glutaraldehyde (GA). This adsorbent was pH sensitive and achieved an adsorption capacity of 255.19 mg/g for As(V) in 10 min time at pH 3. Along with its enhanced adsorption in acidic pH, it also showed improved adsorption properties after undergoing eight regeneration cycles. Thus, pH sensitive nanomaterial based on nanocellulose executed high efficiency in removal of arsenic from wastewater. Iron impregnated micro-fibrillated cellulose (FeNP/MFC) and chitosan beads (MICB) both showed arsenic adsorption capacity. FeNP/MFC remediated As(V) by 2.46 mmol/g (Hokkanen et al., 2015 ) while MICB capacity to remediate As(V) and As(III) was 35.7 and 35.3 mg/g, respectively (Wang et al., 2014b ).  3.11 Biochar materials Biochars are sustainable, cost-effective and efficient materials for remediation of toxic metals including arsenic from contaminated water. Biochar is synthesized by the process of thermochemical conversion of biomass in oxygen-deprived or oxygen-free conditions (Lee et al., 2019 ). Biochar is generally produced by using biological wastes generated from wood, leaves, manure, agricultural by-products and residues, sewage sludge etc., which are easily available and cheap. Use of various organic wastes to produce biochar can be a useful strategy in waste management (Alkurdi et al., 2019 ). Biochar has various oxygen-containing functional groups and minerals, which play significant roles in arsenic removal by adsorption and oxidation mechanisms (Deng et al., 2020 ). However, pristine biochar has limited capacity to adsorb arsenic, as its negatively charged surface limits arsenic adsorption because of the electrostatic repulsion between biochar and As oxyanions (Sun et al., 2022 ). Several modification processes were experimented in order to improve arsenic removal or immobilization by enhancing both chemical and physical properties of biochar. Such modification processes include acid and alkali modification, iron modification, multi-metal modification (Sun et al., 2017 ). Biochar coating with metal oxides, carbon nanotubes or graphene were recently developed to enhance the properties of biochar for the removal of selected contaminants including toxic metals. Coating of metal oxides with different particle sizes (micro to nano scale range) was applied to improve arsenic removal potential. Pristine biochar is found to be is comparatively less efficient in arsenic sorption from contaminated media than modified or engineered biochars (Amen et al., 2020 ). The modified biochar has better capacity to retain arsenic because of the higher porosity of the materials, higher surface area and presence of the useful functional groups, which are capable of removing comparatively more arsenic from contaminated media (Amen et al., 2020 ; Sun et al., 2022 ). Biochars which are pyrolyzed at high temperature are comparatively more efficient in removal of arsenic from contaminated water than those synthesized at lower temperature, which may be because of the high aromaticity and porous structure, as well as abundant presence of mineral-phases (e.g., CaPO4 , CaCO3 ) (Amen et al., 2020 ). Adsorption on biochar can be increased during or after the initial manufacturing processes. Ni/Mn modification in post-pyrolysis phase can lead to higher capacity of adsorption (6.52 g/kg) than modification in pre-pyrolysis phase (0.549 g/kg). Chemical, physical, steam activation, impregnation of metals or their oxides, gas purging, and other methods are applied to improve sorption capacity of biochar, based on the target pollutant (Hassan, 2023 ). Fig. 5   illustrates the possible mechanisms for arsenic removal on biochar-based materials. Various feedstock materials are applied in biochar synthesis to study their usefulness in arsenic removal, such as cotton wood, mulberry wood, coconut shell, corn stem, poplar wood, pinewood, pine bark, rice straw, perilla leaf, Japanese oak wood, oak bark, grape seeds, peanut shell, even sewage sludge materials (Sun et al., 2017 ; Alkurdi et al., 2019 ). Application of biochar materials can help in developing more effective management of wastes, leading to the reduction of greenhouse gas emission from the landfills. However, more research works are required to study the utility of biochar materials in natural field conditions, their cost-effectiveness and environmental risk assessment (Amen et al., 2020 ). Wang et al. (2016)  developed two composites from biochar for arsenic remediation from water, one through Ni/Mn oxide-modified pinewood feedstock (NMMF) pyrolysis and another one by Ni/Mn-LDHs (NMMB) precipitation. The maximum adsorption capacity of the two composites NMMF and NMMB were found to be 0.549 and 6.52 g/kg of As(V), respectively. Wang et al. (2015a)  developed Fe–Mn binary oxide onto pinewood biomass (FMM) and pinewood biochar (FMB) for removal of arsenic from water, having As(V) adsorption capacity of 3.44 and 0.50 mg/g for FMB and FMM respectively. (Fe)-impregnated biochar (FBC) was manufactured by pyrolysis of corn straw treated with FeCl3  and showed As(V) adsorption efficiency of 6.80 mg/g, which was more than unmodified biochar (He et al., 2018 ). Recently, researchers applied a spectral induced polarization (SIP) method for monitoring of As adsorption on Fe-modified biochar, synthesized from date-palm leaves. The technique was sensitive to the interfacial conductivity and adsorption properties of biochar, and can be a novel technique to monitor wastewater treatment (Kirmizakis et al., 2022 ). Several mechanisms have been studied and explained for As(III) and As(V) adsorption by nanomaterials (Sun et al., 2017 ; Samuel et al., 2022 ). Most of the research works established the prominence of electrostatic interactions followed by the redox reactions between the As species and the adsorbent material. General schematic diagram of As sorption on the surface of agglomerated nanoparticles by different pathways like H-bonding, electrostatic interaction, surface oxidation, complex formation, pore diffusion are demonstrated in Fig. 6  . An overview of various methods (like adsorption, ion-exchange, phytoremediation, Nano phytoremediation, phytobial remediation, reverse osmosis, chemical precipitation membrane technology, electrocoagulation etc.) applied for arsenic removal is shown in Table 1  . Comparative arsenic removal capacity of different adsorbents is shown in Table 2  .   4 Nanomaterial applications in arsenic treatment for achieving SDGs Cost-effectiveness of the nanomaterials is essential for wide applications in the low income and lower middle-income countries around the world. Many of these regions suffer from resource poor conditions, which further affect the livelihoods of the local inhabitants. This is also in synchrony with one of the significant goals (Goal 6) in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Especially, target 6.a. under Goal 6 mentions “By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water-and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies” (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, 2022 ); water treatment using nanomaterials can be one of the sustainable solutions in this regard. The utilization of nanomaterials for arsenic removal plays a direct role in advancing Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of clean water. The removal of arsenic from water sources provides communities with the opportunity to access water that is safe and suitable for consumption, thereby mitigating the potential health risks associated with arsenic exposure and fostering overall well-being (UNDP, 2023 ). Moreover, the implementation of nanomaterial-based arsenic removal techniques can contribute to the advancement of Sustainable Development Goal 12 by promoting the adoption of responsible production and consumption practices. The proposed methodology aims to mitigate waste generation and enhance resource efficiency through the utilization of nanomaterials possessing exceptional adsorption capabilities and regenerative properties (Popescu et al., 2021 ).  5 Sustainable approaches towards selecting nanomaterials for arsenic treatment Nanomaterials are always given more preference for filtration than the bulk materials due their very high sorption capacity. Certain approaches are indispensable for the synthesis, selection and application of nanomaterials in arsenic treatment, as follows:(1) Nanomaterials need to be synthesized by applications of greener technologies in order to achieve more efficiency.  (2) The nanomaterials need to be designed in such ways that the materials can have high permeability with improved dynamic spots via the attachment of several metal organic functional groups;  (3) Formulations and modifications of several functional groups on the nanoadsorbents, depending on the requirements.  (4) Synthesis path of the nanostructured materials is expected to be simple. Large quantity of nanomaterials is expected to be synthesized in a single set of synthesis process, which is a difficult task till date.  (5) Ingredients should be of low cost in order to maintain a reasonable production cost.  (6) Nanomaterials tend to disperse in aqueous medium due to their minute particle sizes. Precautions need to be taken and techniques need to be followed in order to prevent nanomaterial dispersion in water.  (7) Nanomaterials need to be regenerated and reused for the convenience of using multiple times (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ; Nicomel et al., 2016 ).  (8) Iron oxide nanoparticles have demonstrated remarkable adsorption capabilities for arsenic. The capacity to efficiently eliminate arsenic from water, even when present in low concentrations, has been demonstrated (Diephuis et al., 2022 ).  (9) The use of nanomaterials with additional treatment procedures like as membrane filtration has the potential to improve overall efficacy while lowering costs (Kotia et al., 2020 ).  (10) Synthesis and applications of multifunctional nanomaterials; focus should be on developing novel nanomaterials capable of removing two or more contaminants effectively.    Several initiatives tested the efficiency of different arsenic removal technologies. In West Bengal, ten different arsenic removal technologies were evaluated at the community level (Nadagouda and Lytle, 2011 ). In Bangladesh, nine technologies for removing arsenic from household levels were tested and evaluated (AIIH, 2001 ). Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR) initiated and approved several technologies of arsenic treatment to be marketed, like ZVI (Sono), granular iron oxide (Neelima, SIDKO), activated alumina (MAGC/ALCAN), Ethylene–vinyl alcohol copolymer-born hydrous cerium oxide (Read-F), and Shwadesh (Bamwsp, Dfid, W.A.B., 2001. ). The utilization of nanomaterials in the process of arsenic removal holds promise for enhanced environmental sustainability compared to conventional methods. The utilization of nanomaterials and the implementation of green synthesis processes can effectively mitigate adverse impacts on ecosystems and diminish the overall carbon footprint associated with the treatment process (Feng et al., 2012 ). It is imperative to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) on the process of arsenic removal using nanomaterials in order to comprehensively assess the environmental consequences associated with each stage of its life cycle, encompassing material extraction up to disposal. The utilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) enables the identification of areas that require improvement and facilitates the informed selection of sustainable nanomaterials and treatment processes. There is a need for future life cycle assessment of arsenic removal using nanomaterials.  6 Risk factors and limitations of nanomaterials in arsenic treatment Nanoparticles can be discharged into the environment because of unsustainable environmental activities and introduction of new technologies without proper risk assessment. Studies related to assessment of their possible environmental threats should be performed, focusing on the mobility, bioavailability, toxicity and persistence of these nanoparticles (Jawed et al., 2020 ). It is still unclear whether nanomaterial exposure can affect aquatic and terrestrial organisms significantly. Engineered nanoparticles are being employed more in urban water systems, in addition to their quick expansion in purification of wastewater and treatment of drinking water. This raises the issue of how to get rid of these nanoparticles. It might be necessary to remove nanoparticles once their saturation point is reached. In case of metals and organics, combustion is a reliable method for their removal (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Bhattacharya et al., 2013 ). However, the major risk associated with combustion is that the volatile arsenic oxides will find their way out into the atmosphere and result in health hazard in a wide area (Khan, 2010 ). Solidification of arsenic contaminated material followed by proper disposal in sealed landfills can be a better way of disposal. However, it must be ensured that the landfill is not leaky (Mohan and Pittman, 2007 ; Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska et al., 2009 ; Saiz et al., 2014 ; Nicomel et al., 2016 ). The best alternate seems to be the use of recyclable adsorbents which have a higher recycling frequency. Studies have highlighted that several adsorbents (discussed through the sections of this review) can be recycled form any cycles without losing their properties (Leist et al., 2000 ; Tuutijärvi et al., 2012 ; Hu et al., 2005 ; Hu et al., 2006 ). Use of nanomaterials for arsenic removal from ground water is widely applicable since it produces small amount of sludge with less disposal problem. However, indiscriminate and unscientific use of nanomaterials for water treatment may cause environmental pollution (Banerjee and Chen, 2007 ). Nanoparticles like nanoscale zerovalent iron shows very high mobility into water, which may cause transportation of adsorbed arsenic into water. Nanoparticles, due to their minute sizes, can pass through the cell membrane by endocytosis which is very harmful to all biological systems. However, detail study is needed on the nature and degree of toxic effects of different nanoparticles. Nano titanium dioxide, fullerene, carbon nanotubes etc. were found to be harmful for different species of fishes (Karn et al., 2009 ; Cheng et al., 2007 ). The fate of nanomaterials in the environment after use should be studied and analyzed thoroughly. There is also a chance of leaching of nanoparticles in the treated water; however, there are no such record documented so far. However, thorough investigations on the leaching of sorbents are required to examine the application of various sorbents on a commercial basis. Arsenic adsorption is effectively prevented by phosphate, carbonate, and bicarbonate ions, which can increase arsenic leaching from mineral surfaces (Handy et al., 2008 ). Fig. 7   shows a schematic representation of the risk factors associated with nanomaterial application in arsenic treatment and possible mitigation options to minimize the risk.  7 Conclusions Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the newest and widely used buzzwords in recent times. As shown by the growing trends in research, this area has enormous potential to be evolved into an effective way in water treatment in the 21st century. Developing flexible, mechanically stable and multi-functional nanomaterials is a real challenge, yet could be a major driver in water and wastewater treatment processes, if applied and implemented successfully (Siddiqui and Chaudhry, 2017 ; Siddiqui et al., 2019 ). This article provides a summary of diverse absorbents reported (both chemical and biological) by various studies for treatment of arsenic-contaminated water. According to the experiments, nanomaterials are far superior to bulk materials at removing arsenic (both As III and AsV) from water. However, many of the techniques of arsenic treatment involving nanotechnology have only been investigated in laboratory scales, and yet to be studied in natural conditions. Natural conditions are much more complex and interactive, in which the efficiency of these particles need to be proved, especially in a long-term and sustainable manner. Another significant obstacle faced by the hydrologists is the inclusion of nanomaterials into the current arsenic purification technologies. More laboratory research works and pilot scale testing are required to incorporate innovative nanostructured membranes into conventional arsenic purification systems. Combining both inorganic and biomaterials shows promise in enhancing the effectiveness of arsenic removal procedures. Additionally, the application of different metal oxide nanomaterials to decorate graphene oxide can offer improved results. However, while nanotechnology presents opportunities for arsenic purification, potential hazards must be carefully addressed and monitored to ensure long-term sustainability and environmental safety. Vigilance in assessing the benefits and risks of using nanotechnology in arsenic purification is crucial for successful and responsible implementation.
