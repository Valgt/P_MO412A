                  Objective
                  This article aims to analyse the evolution of 40 Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs) health-related indicators in Brazil and Ecuador from 1990 to 2019.
               
                  Study design
                  Epidemiological study of long-term trends in 40 SDGs’ health-related indicators for Brazil and Ecuador from 1990 to 2019, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study.
               
                  Methods
                  Forty SDGs’ health-related indicators and an index from 1990 to 2017 for Brazil and Ecuador, and their projections up to 2030 were extracted from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Burden of Disease website and analysed. The percent annual change (PC) between 1990 and 2019 was calculated for both countries.
               
                  Results
                  Both countries have made progress on child stunting (Brazil: PC = −38%; Ecuador: PC = −43%) and child wasting prevalences (Brazil: PC = −42%; Ecuador: PC = −41%), percent of vaccine coverage (Brazil: PC = +215%; Ecuador: PC = +175%), under-5 (Brazil: PC = −75%; Ecuador: PC = −60%) and neonatal mortality rates (Brazil: PC = −69%; Ecuador: PC = −51%), health worker density per 1000 population (Brazil: PC = +153%; Ecuador: PC = +175%), reduction of neglected diseases prevalences (Brazil: PC = −40%; Ecuador: PC = −58%), tuberculosis (Brazil: PC = −27%; Ecuador: PC = −55%) and malaria incidences (Brazil: PC = −97%; Ecuador: PC = −100%), water, sanitation and hygiene mortality rates (Brazil and Ecuador: PC = −89%). However, both countries did not show sufficient improvement in maternal mortality ratio to meet SDGs targets (Brazil: PC = −37%; Ecuador: PC = −40%). Worsening of indicators were found for violence, such as non-intimate partner violence for both countries (Brazil: PC = +26%; Ecuador: PC = +18%) and suicide mortality rate for Ecuador (PC = +66%), child overweight indicator for Brazil (PC = −67%), disaster mortality rates (Brazil: PC = +100%; Ecuador: PC = +325%) and alcohol consumption (Brazil: PC = +46%; Ecuador: PC = +35%).
               
                  Conclusions
                  Significant improvements are necessary in both countries requiring the strengthening of health and other policies, particularly concerning the prevention and management of violence and alcohol consumption, and preparedness for dealing with environmental disasters.

Study design Epidemiological study of long-term trends in 40 SDGs’ health-related indicators for Brazil and Ecuador from 1990 to 2019, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study.  Methods Forty SDGs’ health-related indicators and an index from 1990 to 2017 for Brazil and Ecuador, and their projections up to 2030 were extracted from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Burden of Disease website and analysed. The percent annual change (PC) between 1990 and 2019 was calculated for both countries.  Results Both countries have made progress on child stunting (Brazil: PC = −38%; Ecuador: PC = −43%) and child wasting prevalences (Brazil: PC = −42%; Ecuador: PC = −41%), percent of vaccine coverage (Brazil: PC = +215%; Ecuador: PC = +175%), under-5 (Brazil: PC = −75%; Ecuador: PC = −60%) and neonatal mortality rates (Brazil: PC = −69%; Ecuador: PC = −51%), health worker density per 1000 population (Brazil: PC = +153%; Ecuador: PC = +175%), reduction of neglected diseases prevalences (Brazil: PC = −40%; Ecuador: PC = −58%), tuberculosis (Brazil: PC = −27%; Ecuador: PC = −55%) and malaria incidences (Brazil: PC = −97%; Ecuador: PC = −100%), water, sanitation and hygiene mortality rates (Brazil and Ecuador: PC = −89%). However, both countries did not show sufficient improvement in maternal mortality ratio to meet SDGs targets (Brazil: PC = −37%; Ecuador: PC = −40%). Worsening of indicators were found for violence, such as non-intimate partner violence for both countries (Brazil: PC = +26%; Ecuador: PC = +18%) and suicide mortality rate for Ecuador (PC = +66%), child overweight indicator for Brazil (PC = −67%), disaster mortality rates (Brazil: PC = +100%; Ecuador: PC = +325%) and alcohol consumption (Brazil: PC = +46%; Ecuador: PC = +35%).  Conclusions Significant improvements are necessary in both countries requiring the strengthening of health and other policies, particularly concerning the prevention and management of violence and alcohol consumption, and preparedness for dealing with environmental disasters.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Agenda 2030  Health status indicators  Global burden of disease  Global health  South America    Introduction The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (ASD) adopted in 2015 by all United Nations (UN) member states is an action plan to eradicate poverty and hunger, reduce inequalities, protect the environment and promote social and economic development.1   The ASD promotes international cooperation and prioritises commitments for structural changes to promote development with the aim of ‘leaving no one behind’.1   Among the priorities for structural action, health stands out, as the direct target of Goal 3, ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’, and as a key outcome that cuts across many of the targets and indicators of the other 16 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).2   Monitoring SDGs targets at the national and sub-national levels poses operational challenges because official data for the indicators are not always available or of sufficient quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) report on monitoring health statistics in the framework of the 2030 SDGs showed that, for most targets, only a limited number of indicators could be assessed, owing to a lack of systematically collected and high-quality data, which can lead to disaggregated and incomparable results.3   This challenge underscores the importance of large-scale initiatives using standardised techniques to monitor the SDGs, such as the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), whose model-based estimates provide an overview of health-related indicators across countries. Brazil and Ecuador are two upper-middle-income Latin American countries with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita  of US$ 8876 and US$ 6,223, respectively, in 2019,4   in addition to having immense inequalities in income distribution, expressed by the Gini coefficient of 0.535 for Brazil and 0.457 for Ecuador, in the same year.5   Both were colonised by European countries—Portugal and Spain—at the beginning of the 16th century and presented an accelerated economic and social growth in the 21st century. Both countries’ colonial legacies of violence and structural racism6   have resulted in stark economic and social disparities that translate into worse health for minoritized groups, especially the black and indigenous populations.7  , 8   The 2030 Agenda call for alliances among nations in which the South–South Cooperation is a key tool. Such type of development cooperation encompasses the exchange of experiences, technical and political knowledge between countries in the Global South, aiming to forge solutions for sustainable development, and achieving the SDGs targets. Using data from the GBD Study, this article aims to analyse the evolution of 40 of the SDGs' health-related indicators in Brazil and Ecuador from 1990 to 2019. There is a lack of studies on health-related SDGs indicators comparing the performance among Global South countries and discussing it in light of country-specific actions adopted in the field of public administration, such as policies, programs and regulatory measures in a temporal perspective. In this sense, the findings of this study will add to the assessment of the progress and help to identify persistent gaps in Brazil and Ecuador in the achievement of the SDGs’ health-related indicators.  Methods Study design Epidemiological study analysing the evolution of 40 SDG health-related indicators between 1990 and 2019 for Brazil and Ecuador, using estimates from the GBD Study.  Indicators, definitions and data sources The 40 SDGs’ health-related indicators and the index for Brazil and Ecuador were downloaded from the GBD Study webpage (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2017-health-related-sdgs-1990-2030 ). The GBD Study leverages all available data sources (i.e., including both official governmental and unofficial data and estimates) to calculate the prevalence, incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years of health outcomes in a standardised and comparable way for 204 countries and territories during each year since 1990.9   These estimates are disaggregated by age, sex and geographical units. More details on the general methods used in the GBD study are described elsewhere.9   The indicators are presented as rates, incidence, prevalence and risk exposure, and each one is described in Table 1  . The methods to estimate each SDG indicator were reported in detail in a previous GBD publication.10   To generate projections of the SDG indicators and the index from 2018 up to 2030, the IHME used forecasting methods developed by Foreman et al.10  , 11   Briefly, IHME generated the projections for the indicators by calculating the annual change in each country and year from 1990 to 2017 in logit or natural-log space and then computing weighted annualised rates of change.10   When the weights were closer to zero, annual rates of change were more equally weighted across years; when the weights were closer to higher values, recent years were more heavily weighted than the earlier ones.10   These weights were selected through out-of-sample predictive validity tests.10   IHME also transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0–100, reflecting worst to best performance, to enable comparison across different indicators. The 0 corresponds to the 2.5th percentile value and the 100 to the 97.5th percentile value of 1000 observed or projected draws over the period 1990–2030.10   Additionally, we presented the ‘SDG index’, which is a summary measure of all of the 40 health-related SDG indicators and represents overall performance on those indicators (see in Table 2   and Fig. 1  ). For rate-space indicators, IHME first transformed the values to natural log space with the exception of the proportion indicators, which were not transformed.10   The resultant indicator distributions were then rescaled to a 0 to 100 scale. The 0 corresponded to the 2.5th percentile and the 100 to the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of indicator values over the time period 1990 to 2030.10   The ‘SDG index’ was then calculated by determining the geometric mean of each rescaled health-related SDG indicator for a given target and then taking the geometric mean of the resulting values across all the targets. This approach weights each of the health-related SDG targets equally.10   Further details on definitions, additional information on data sources and estimation methods have been previously described.9  , 10  , 11    Data visualisation To visualise data, the untransformed indicators for 1990 and 2019, respective uncertainty intervals and percent changes were presented in Table 2 . The scaled or transformed indicators and the SDG index were arranged in Table 3  , using colour coding representing three ranges of values: (a) darkest shade of grey for values from 0 to 49 indicating low performance; (b) medium shade of grey for values from 50 to 69 indicating medium performance; and (c) lightest shade of grey for values between 70 and 100 indicating good performance. This conditional formatting followed Microsoft Excel's default ‘color scales’ formatting. Point estimates were presented in this paper by every five years, from 1990 to 2019, to contribute to the assessment of changes that occurred in the period in a more detailed approach (Table 4  ). Lastly, a line graph presented the evolution of SDG index from 1990 to 2017 and its projections up to 2030 for both countries (Fig. 1 ).   Results Brazil had a higher percentage of well-certified death registrations (83.6%) in 2019 compared to Ecuador (69.4%) (Table 2 ). The homicide rate in Brazil (27.5/100,000) in 2019 doubled the rate in Ecuador for the same year (13.3/100,000). Between 1990 and 2019, the following indicators worsened: disaster mortality rate, the prevalence of child overweight, HIV incidence, alcohol consumption, the prevalence of non-intimate partner violence, homicide rate, physical violence, sexual violence, child sexual abuse and suicide mortality rate (only in Brazil) (Table 2 ). On the other hand, some indicators improved. Decreases were observed: in the prevalence of child stunting and wasting; maternal mortality ratio (MM); under-5 and neonatal mortality; incidence of tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis B and neglected tropical diseases; suicide mortality rate (Brazil only); road injury mortality; air pollution mortality; water, sanitation and hygiene mortality; poisoning mortality; smoking prevalence; and the percent of intimate partner violence. Skilled birth attendance, family planning met by contraception methods, universal health coverage, immunisation coverage and health worker density increased. It is noteworthy that the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index showed similar performance between Brazil (70.6%) and Ecuador (68.4%) in 2019 (Table 2 ). Additionally, although mortality due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) decreased in both countries, in 2019 the rates remained quite high in Ecuador (238.5/100,000.) and even higher in Brazil (321.3/100,000) (Table 2 ). The SDG Index showed a positive percent change of 46% in Brazil and of 24% in Ecuador between 1990 and 2019 (Table 3 ). Although Brazil presented a summary index of 67.0 (UI95% 64.0–68.0) in 2019, opposite situations were found, such as a good score in vaccination coverage (99.0 UI95% 99 - 99) and a very bad score in the homicide indicator (7.0 UI95% 3–9) (Table 3 ). Likewise, Ecuador, in 2019, showed a synthesis index of 60.0 (UI95% 57.0–62.0) but ranged from a low score on the disaster mortality indicator (21.0 UI95% 10.0–26.0) to a very good score on the skilled attendance at birth indicator (99.0 UI95% 98.0–100.0) (Table 3 ). Although maternal mortality ratios declined (Table 2 ), they remain high (Tables 2 and 3 ). The positive percentage change in the vaccination coverage score was the highest for both countries (424% for Brazil and 357% for Ecuador) (Table 2 ). A positive change of more than 20% was observed in both countries for: skilled birth attendance, infant and neonatal mortality, malaria incidence, communicable diseases mortality, family planning and modern contraception, adolescent birth rate, universal health coverage, air pollution mortality, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)-related mortality (water supply, sanitation and hygiene), poisoning mortality, the burden of occupational hazards and health worker density (Table 2 ). On the other hand, Brazil and Ecuador showed a worsening between 1990 and 2019 in the scores referring to the disaster mortality indicator, HIV incidence, alcoholic beverage consumption, non-intimate partner violence, homicide and sexual violence. In isolation, the worst performances observed referred to the score of the child overweight indicator for Brazil (−67%) and disaster mortality (−69%) for Ecuador (Table 2 ). Trend analyses from 1990 to 2017 and projections up to 2030 indicate that both countries will increase their SDG Index by 2030 (70 for Brazil and 65 for Ecuador) (Fig. 1 ).  Discussion Although the SDG indicators are global in scope, meeting their targets depends on regional contexts and local capacities.12   Brazil and Ecuador have had great success in implementing comprehensive and universal health care, but significant health inequalities between regions persist, particularly for specialised services.13–15   Promoting equity in access to health is a fundamental principle of universal health coverage (UHC) and is explicitly present in SDG 3.8.1–3   There have been improvements in child health outcomes in Brazil and Ecuador, especially between 1990 and 2015, including the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals target with a two-thirds reduction in IMR and a 50% reduction in the number of malnourished children.13–18   In the case of Brazil, this is explained by the implementation of the Sistema Único de Saúde (Unified Health System [SUS]), the creation of the Family Health Programme, ‘Rede Cegonha’, ‘Bolsa Família’, among others.13  , 14  , 16   However, after 2015, due to the political crisis and the austerity measures implemented such as cuts in social protection programs, the increase in unemployment resulted in a worsening of social and health indicators.19–21   In the case of Ecuador, a study showed that despite the reduction in general mortality, 42.8% of the provinces had an increase in mortality, illiteracy and poverty.18   In both countries, there was an important disparity in prevalence of child mortality, malnutrition, stunting and obesity between geographic regions,7  , 8  , 22   and overweight and obesity increased dramatically over the same period.18  , 23  , 24   Brazil did not reach the Millennium Development Goal in 2015 concerning maternal mortality and the situation worsened with the Covid-19 pandemic. There was an increase in maternal mortality by about a third.25   In Ecuador, the maternal mortality rate in 1990 was 86.4 per 100,000 live births, and despite the negative effects of the pandemic, a rate of less than 50 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births has been maintained.26   Both countries showed significant improvements in the indicators of tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases incidences. Despite improvements in the access to antiretroviral drugs, recent Brazilian and Ecuadorian HIV data indicate a reduction in incidence after 2010, except in adolescents and young males (15–29 years of age), among whom the incidence continues to rise.27  , 28   Brazilian and Ecuadorian data showed that although tuberculosis mortality and prevalence declined substantially between 1990 and 2015, the disease persists as the leading cause of death among individuals with HIV while there is a high percentage of under-diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis.29   In prisoners, it is an increasingly important health problem in both countries.28  , 30  , 31   Several initiatives have been implemented, but the incidence is still high and the goal of eliminating tuberculosis by 2030 needs further reinforcement.32   The study points to an important reduction in other communicable diseases, in particular WASH-related mortality (i.e. from diarrhoea, intestinal helminth infections or energy-protein malnutrition). This is justified by the improvement in general living conditions, investment in public protection policies by 2015 and especially the progress in expanding access to treated water.14   However, it is important to note that WASH-related mortality still affects children, and by 2023, increases in diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition mortality among indigenous children are predicted to become increasingly important, resulting in a severe humanitarian crisis.33   The indicators related to NCDs indicate that, in Brazil, despite the progress in reducing premature deaths from NCDs, after 2016 the rates reversed and tended to stabilise, and the goals of reduction by one-third by 2030 may not be achieved.19   Among the indicators showing progress, the significant reduction in the prevalence of smoking stands out due to important regulatory measures, such as adherence to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, banning tobacco advertisements, creating smoke-free environments, taxing cigarettes and increasing the prices of tobacco products.34   However, the growth of obesity continues, and progress needs to be made regarding the increased consumption of processed and ultra-processed products.35   In Ecuador, epidemiological studies reveal a high prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adults, affecting women in particular.36   Additionally, large number of people with metabolic syndrome have been observed, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.36   Also, in Ecuador, a comprehensive tobacco control law was adopted. As a result, the prevalence of daily smoking among those aged 15 years and older declined from 9.5% in 1998 to 2.8% in 2014. In 2017, Ecuador received the World No Tobacco Day Award from WHO.37   Violence and accidents are responsible for more than 4.8 million deaths worldwide. In Brazil, about 44,529 deaths occurred in 2019 due to road injuries, in addition to lives lost prematurely, disabilities, loss of quality of life and major impacts on the health system.38   In Ecuador, between 1990 and 2019, there were over 8000 deaths annually from violent causes, while road traffic accidents represented 23% (or 14.47 per 100,000 inhabitants) of all deaths, being the eighth leading cause of death.39   In Brazil, decrees loosening restrictions on gun ownership for civilians were issued between 2019 and 2022, and there is evidence suggesting that greater gun availability would increase firearm violence numbers.40   Recent data from the National Health Survey show that physical violence has a prevalence of 3.8%, while among LGBTQI + people it is three times greater and sexual violence five times greater.41   In May 2023, Ecuador issued new regulations allowing civilians to possess weapons for personal defence, a right previously reserved exclusively for public order forces.42   As for Brazil, this regulatory change is likely to have a negative impact on the number of violent deaths. In 2022, Ecuador recorded an all-time high of 4500 homicides, representing a greater than three-fold increase compared to 2019 (25.32 vs 6.8 homicides per 100,000, respectively).43   In Brazil, intimate partner violence is responsible for half of the violence perpetrated against women, indicating a sad reality that reveals a sexist and patriarchal country.44   Abuse against children and adolescents is largely unseen being generally perpetrated within the home. Brazilian School-based Student Health Survey (PENSE, in Portuguese) data show that 20% of girls have suffered some kind of sexual abuse, and 8.8% report having experienced attempted rape or sexual violence.45   In Ecuador, according to the II Violence Against Women National Survey (2019), nearly two-thirds (64.9%) of participating women had experienced some form of violence during their lifetime, mainly psychological violence (56.9%). The second most prevalent type of violence was physical (35.4%) closely followed by sexual (32.7%). Almost one-fifth (16.4%) had experienced some form of economic violence.46   WASH indicators (access to water, sanitation and hand-washing facilities) have improved in both countries; however, profound national differences remain. In the case of Brazil, the North and Northeast regions, rural and indigenous areas, do not have good indicators, revealing deep regional inequalities. In Ecuador, these important gaps are observed in the high Andes (paramos), and indigenous areas of the coast, highlands and Amazon region. In the case of the latter, indigenous communities presented seroprevalence for hepatitis A and Leptospira  spp. of 98.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.0–99.8) and 50.0% (95% CI: 43.3–56.6), respectively, and 62.6% (95% CI: 55.8–69.4) had enteric parasites in stool samples.47   The prevalence of pathogens varied by age group, whereas it did not vary significantly by gender, temporal migration, illiteracy, perceived morbidity, receipt of conditional cash transfers, water boiling practices, poor housing conditions and anthropometric status.47   These findings suggest a high level of contamination of drinking water by human pathogens in these communities and the need for action to improve access to and use of safe water.47   Both countries present a significant deterioration in indicators related to disaster situations. In the case of Brazil, environmental disasters due to the activities of mining companies have been frequent in recent years, including the tragedy of Mariana and Brumadinho municipalities, with 272 deaths due to burial in the mud.48   In the case of Ecuador, the earthquake in the central coastal region in 2016 marked an important increase in this indicator. The shortage of personnel and physical infrastructure, weaknesses in primary health care in the Ecuadorian health system, the lack of preparation and limited availability of information on health indicators were the causes of the sharp increase in pre-existing diseases in the area, and of new epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases after the earthquake.49   This study has some limitations. Regarding data availability, the SDGs cover a wide range of indicators across multiple sectors. IHME estimates may not be available for all countries or may have gaps in certain areas and may not capture local variations. Concerning data accuracy, there may be discrepancies and bias in the data used by IHME to model the estimates. Additionally, one must consider complex interactions: the SDGs are interlinked and progress on one goal may affect progress on others and may not capture socio-economic or environmental factors that affect the SDGs. Lastly, future projections hold inherent uncertainties, and the assumptions may not consider political and economic changes or uncertainties. Conclusion The GBD study is one of the largest systematic efforts to quantify health loss due to specific diseases and risk factors, providing valuable insights into the health priorities for different populations and regions. The evolution of health-related SDG indicators in Brazil and Ecuador between 1990 and 2019 showed an improvement for indicators related to maternal and child health, infectious diseases, water supply and sanitation. Deteriorations were observed in mortality rates due to violence and natural disasters and in the prevalence of alcohol consumption. Despite this, there are important gaps in each territory, which makes it necessary to reinforce evidence-based health policies.
