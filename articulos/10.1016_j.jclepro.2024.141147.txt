                  Increased urban land use efficiency (ULUE) is a pivotal symbol of urbanization's evolution from rapid expansion to a focus on high-quality development. However, the extent to which the spatial-temporal trends in China's future urban sprawl efficiency could hinder the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11: “Building Sustainable Cities and Communities” remains uncertain. This study endeavors to shed light on this issue, offering insights that could facilitate the dynamic adjustment of land resource use efficiency assessment strategies to align with the SDG11 urbanization process. We leverage socio-economic shared pathways (SSPs) thematic data through the application of the slack-variable-based data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) methodology to project ULUE for China's 368 prefectural-level administrative divisions from 2020 to 2050. In addition, we utilize the coupled coordination degree (CCD) model to anticipate the future harmonization trend of the ULUE with the UN's endorsed SDG indicator, SDG11.3.1: “Land Consumption Rate to Population Growth Rate (LCRPGR)”. We harness tools such as Kernel Density Analysis, Moran's Index, and Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) to unveil the principal factors influencing the CCD changes and spatial clustering trends. We find that: the higher ULUE areas in China gradually shift from coastal cities and provincial capitals to the western regions, and the value of China's LCRPGR gradually decreases. By 2050, China's ULUE and LCRPGR will reach a high degree of coupling under the SSP2, SSP4, and SSP5 routes. The spatial heterogeneity of the CCD is increasing, with urban land areas having the most substantial adverse effect on CCD, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and metropolitan green space areas having sequentially decreasing positive effects on CCD. This study assesses the future SDG 11.3.1 process, which helps to adjust the assessment strategy of SDG11 in due time and promote sustainable urban development.

However, the extent to which the spatial-temporal trends in China's future urban sprawl efficiency could hinder the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11: “Building Sustainable Cities and Communities” remains uncertain. This study endeavors to shed light on this issue, offering insights that could facilitate the dynamic adjustment of land resource use efficiency assessment strategies to align with the SDG11 urbanization process. We leverage socio-economic shared pathways (SSPs) thematic data through the application of the slack-variable-based data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) methodology to project ULUE for China's 368 prefectural-level administrative divisions from 2020 to 2050. In addition, we utilize the coupled coordination degree (CCD) model to anticipate the future harmonization trend of the ULUE with the UN's endorsed SDG indicator, SDG11.3.1: “Land Consumption Rate to Population Growth Rate (LCRPGR)”. We harness tools such as Kernel Density Analysis, Moran's Index, and Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) to unveil the principal factors influencing the CCD changes and spatial clustering trends. We find that: the higher ULUE areas in China gradually shift from coastal cities and provincial capitals to the western regions, and the value of China's LCRPGR gradually decreases. By 2050, China's ULUE and LCRPGR will reach a high degree of coupling under the SSP2, SSP4, and SSP5 routes. The spatial heterogeneity of the CCD is increasing, with urban land areas having the most substantial adverse effect on CCD, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and metropolitan green space areas having sequentially decreasing positive effects on CCD. This study assesses the future SDG 11.3.1 process, which helps to adjust the assessment strategy of SDG11 in due time and promote sustainable urban development.

Notably, China, as the preeminent developing nation, is the paramount impetus propelling worldwide urbanization (C. C. Wang et al., 2023 ). From 1978 to 2021, China accomplished the rapid urbanization of both populace and territory, witnessing urbanization levels burgeon from 17.9% to 63.9%. By 2021, the expanse of the urban environment will encompass over 130,000 square kilometers (Ji and Chen, 2017 ; Wu et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, in 2015, diminutive and intermediate cities within central and northeastern China encountered population contraction, concomitant with unbridled expansion and indiscriminate proliferation of urban land. This transformation converted substantial portions of arable and intractable land into urban tracts, yielding a diminished Urban Land Use Efficiency (ULUE) (Amponsah et al., 2022 ; Arshad et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2022 ; Xie et al., 2021 ). This scenario engenders reduced available arable land, extensive development of ecological domains that prove arduous to sustain, and augmented susceptibility of the environmental milieu within urban vicinities. Addressing the “urban maladies” inherent in the urbanization trajectory and the imperious necessity to safeguard human well-being, the United Nations (UN)’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have delineated the developmental aspiration of fostering “inclusive, resilient, and sustainable” urbanization (SDG11). The forthcoming sustainability of China's urbanization endeavors constitutes a pivotal determinant in realizing SDG11. Constructively responding to SDG11 can facilitate China in rectifying its suboptimal ULUE situation, fostering judicious allocation and efficacious exploitation of land resources, and bolstering the resilience and sustainability of human communities. A pivotal avenue toward achieving sustainable urban development lies in avoiding ineffective urban land expansion and enhancing the ULUE. ULUE, a metric encompassing the intricate interplay between land resource inputs and the manifold outputs in economic, social, and environmental domains, exhibits a profound nexus with regional resource endowments, policy orientations, production technologies, and scale considerations (Wu et al., 2022 ). Presently, the principal methodologies for quantifying the ULUE encompass the parametric approach, the indicator methodology, and the utilization of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) (Zhang et al., 2022 ). The parametric process, grounded in the production function framework, introduces a stochastic error term within the production equation to delineate the ULUE by explicating the influence of random errors. However, necessitates meticulous validation of the random error distribution and judicious selection of the production function equation (Ma et al., 2014 ). The parametric method finds widespread utility in gauging land resource utilization efficiency and the scale of the regional ULUE (Xue et al., 2022 ). In contrast, the exponential process rests upon economic, social, and ecological benefits per unit of land output, employing well-defined indicators to objectively and directly express the ULUE. However, susceptibility to outliers can significantly skew results, prompting a requisite data screening process (Artmann, 2014 ). The exponential approach has been applied to diverse investigations encompassing industrial agglomeration, the ramifications of industrial transformation and local carbon emissions on ULUE, and the dynamic interplay within urban sprawl subsystems (Dong et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Unlike the parametric and indicator methods, DEA operates without the need for a predefined functional form encompassing all elements; instead, it identifies a Pareto optimal point for each input unit, ensuring maximal efficiency at that juncture and ascertaining the ULUE (Chen et al., 2016 ; Guo et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ). Noteworthy research endeavors have been conducted on urban expansion, land resources, including industrial agglomeration and the efficiency of green development within Northeast China, and provincial cultivated land use efficiency, among others (Kuang et al., 2020 ; Xiao et al., 2022 ). However, current research focuses on the past ULUE, and there is still a need to simulate the future ULUE under different scenarios using reliable data to support urban sprawl decision-making and the realization of the SDGs. In tandem with the selection of apt methodologies and pertinent statistical parameters for quantifying the ULUE in alignment with the subject of inquiry, the UN has put forth a quantifiable reference framework to gauge the efficacy of local urbanization and land expansion endeavors on a global scale, known as SDG11.3.1. Termed the “Land Consumption Rate to Population Growth Rate (LCRPGR)”, this metric prognosticates the sustainability of regional urbanization and land expansion (Zoomers et al., 2017 ). LCRPGR operates on the premise of two core constituents: territorial boundaries and population figures. Its underpinning lies in a land utilization perspective, employing explicit indicators to encapsulate a given area's population and ecological carrying capacity (O'Neill et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). The indicator's emphasis rests on delineating the interrelation between demographic shifts and land requisites across various analytical scales, unraveling trends in LCRPGR within national and urban systems to facilitate the realization of SDG11 (Rienow et al., 2022 ; Schiavina et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ). At the urban level, LCRPGR has been harnessed to evaluate urban expansion and conflicts arising from natural environs in the Rhine-Ruhr industrial belt in Germany and the Peking-Tientsin-Hebei region in China. On a national scale, the optimal pathways to heighten ULUE at the countrywide stratum in China have been ascertained through amalgamating data about the urban expanse and populace of Chinese prefectural cities. Even so, a dearth of robust evaluative endeavors persists concerning the predictive capacity and applicability of the LCRPGR, specifically in furnishing local substantiation regarding the achievability SDG11.3.1 by 2030. Furthermore, an appraisal is imperative to ascertain whether LCRPGR necessitates dynamic recalibrations of indicator definitions in forthcoming investigations into urban expansion to yield explicit and actionable methodologies for assessing the ULUE in the future. Additionally, establishing a unified baseline for the LCRPGR assessment efforts in the context of global urbanization mandates attention (Jiang et al., 2022 ). Thus, an exigent need emerges to contrast the quantifiable interplay between the LCRPGR and the ULUE, as prescribed by UN SDG 11.3.1, to furnish pertinent evidence endorsing the prospective applicability of the LCRPGR assessments within the urbanization trajectory. The Coupled Coordination Degree (CCD) offers a promising avenue to glean the intricate spatio-temporal dynamics underlying the interactions and influences permeating the two distinct yet interdependent ULUE and LCRPGR subsystems. This method accentuates the shifts in the trajectory of mutual harmony between these systems, effectively discerning instances of their convergence. Across antecedent inquiries, this approach has garnered extensive application within the ecological domain, spanning endeavors such as juxtaposing the resilience and efficacy of agroecosystems and harmonizing economic development and the environment in the face of climatic vicissitudes (Shi et al., 2020 ; Tao et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, investigations concerning the symbiotic interplay between urbanization and land resources have extensively harnessed the Coupled Coordination Degree Model (CCDM) to capture the nuanced non-linear ramifications. This research encompasses dual facets. On the one hand, it elucidates the interrelationship between urban expansion and the ecological milieu—examples include quantifying the correlation between the urbanization process and the vitality of ecosystem services and unraveling the nexus between urbanization and land use dynamics within ecologically sensitive realms (Li et al., 2021 ; Xiao et al., 2022 ). It delves into the realm of urban expansion and functional transformation, with a focal point on delineating how demographic and economic variables contribute to orchestrating adjustments in the urban industrial framework, fostering heightened productivity, and expediting the trajectory of sustainable urban evolution (An et al., 2023 ; Shi et al., 2022 ). Although CCDM proffers a reference point for decision-making about industrial realignment, land utilization planning, demographic policy, and safeguarding the ecological milieu, a pertinent pursuit pertains to apprehending the harmonized trends across diverse subsystems of sustainable urbanization assessment. This pursuit aims to calibrate and formulate a more judicious urban sustainability assessment strategy capable of addressing disparities and ecological preservation challenges stemming from the urbanization process. Due to the uncertainty of future urban expansion indicators, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has provided a new generation of scenario combinations, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), to facilitate integrated analyses of future climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017 ; O'Neill et al., 2017 ). This study is based on five SSPs projection scenarios using SSPs' future global change projection data, including global future population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and future land use change high-resolution gridded projection datasets (G. Chen et al., 2020 ; Yimin Chen et al., 2020 ; Wang and Sun, 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ), which can help to capture future land use change as well as urban sprawl trends (Chen et al., 2022 ; Gao and Pesaresi, 2021 ; Huang et al., 2022 ). This study uses the SBM-DEA method to quantify China's ULUE from 2020 to 2050. The CCDM is further used to quantify the coordination relationship with the UN's recommended use of the Sustainable Development Goal indicator SDG11.3.1: LCRPGR and to map the spatial and temporal distribution of the degree of coordination of China's ULUE coupled with the LCRPGR in the next 30 years. The main objectives of this study are (1) to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of the spatial-temporal changes of the ULUE and the LCRPGR in China under the five SSPs from 2020 to 2050. (2) Explore the CCD of China's ULUE and LCRPGR under SSP1-SSP5 when they are highly consistent from 2020 to 2050. (3) To obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of the CCD in different SSPs from 2020 to 2050, to reveal the critical areas of concern for future urbanization assessment, and to compare the driving forces of urbanization in three dimensions: economic, social, and environmental.  2 Research methodology 2.1 Study area and data sources This study encompasses 368 prefecture-level administrative divisions across mainland China as the designated research domain, excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To quantify the ULUE, we utilize urban extension boundaries, GDP, population, and land use data, all embedded within the framework of SSPs (Chen et al., 2022 ; Huang et al., 2022 ; Wang and Sun, 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). These pathways encapsulate five distinct socioeconomic developmental trajectories: (1) SSP1 Sustainability – Taking the Green Road (Low challenges to mitigation and adaptation). The world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. (2) SSP2 Middle of the Road (Medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation). The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. (3) SSP3 Regional Rivalry – A Rocky Road (High challenges to mitigation and adaptation). A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. (4) SSP4 Inequality – A Road Divided (Low challenges to mitigation, high challenges to adaptation). Highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. (5) SSP5 Fossil-fueled Development – Taking the Highway (High challenges to mitigation, low challenges to adaptation). This world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017 ; O'Neill et al., 2017 ; L. L. Wang et al., 2023 ). Each specific SSP scenario delineates a developmental trajectory at the national level, embodying a unique amalgamation of developmental attributes and influential factors. These factors encompass population growth, economic advancement, technological innovation, environmental conditions, equity principles, governance, and globalization. The SSPs illustrate five distinct paradigms for the future economic and social systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between economic and social advancement alongside the responsive strategies to the challenges posed by climate change mitigation. They are a fundamental foundation for conducting projections about the ULUE and the LCRPGR (Huang et al., 2022 ).  2.2 Calculation of the ULUE The conventional CCR-DEA and BBC-DEA models are adjusted to the data; however, the radial model lacks the element of accounting for slack when evaluating efficiency scores (Yang et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ). Nonetheless, residual non-radial slack still emerges in numerous instances. The non-radial Slack-Based Measure (SBM) model in the efficiency framework abandons the previous assumption of proportionate changes in inputs and outputs. Instead, it directly addresses the cases of slack, which may result in the depletion of varying proportions of the original inputs and outputs (N. Chen et al., 2020 ). The SBM-DEA model offers a more robust solution to the limitations of traditional DEA methodologies. In this investigation, predicated upon the refined SBM-DEA model (Equation. 2, Equation. 3), we compute the ULUE under diverse SSPs for the 368 mainland China prefecture-level administrative divisions spanning the temporal ambit of 2020–2050. SBM-DEA has been widely used in studies to measure ULUE. Since land expansion is a behavior over a period of time, in order to better determine the ULUE, we separate the new land use in the future period (10 years) as the input factor, encompassing three distinct scenarios of future urban growth: spontaneous expansion, organic expansion, and intermediate convergence paths. Our focus remains centered on the analysis of outcomes stemming from the intermediate convergence paths (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Outputs encompass economic indicators (GDP growth), social dimensions (population growth), and ecological metrics (expansion of green spaces, including forests, shrubbery, and grasslands). All pertinent data and analyses have been comprehensively incorporated within the Supplementary Materials. In light of the presence of zero and negative values within the raw data, the process of Min-Max normalization (Equation (1) ) was imperative to facilitate the computation of the ULUE (Zhou et al., 2022 ):(1) y = 0.9 * ( x − min  )   max − min   + 0.1      Among them, y  is the data after standardization, x  is the data before standardization, min  is the very small value in a set of data, and max  is the very large value in a set of data. Using the SBM-DEA model to calculate the ULUE for China over the next 30 years at different SSPs:(2) ρ = min 1 − 1 M  ∑ m = 1  M  s m x  x k ′  m  t ′     1 + 1 N + I   [ ∑ n = 1  N  s n y  / y k ′  n  t ′   + ∑ i = 1   I   s i b  / b k ′  i  t ′    ]        (3) s . t . { x k ′  m  t ′   = ∑ t = 1  T  ∑ k = 1  K  λ k t  x k m  t  + s m x  , m = 1 , … , M    y k ′  n  t ′   = ∑ t = 1  T  ∑ k = 1  K  λ k t  y k n  t  − s n y  , n − 1 , … , N    b k ′  i  t ′   = ∑ t = 1  T  ∑ k − 1  K  λ k t  b k i  t  + s i b  , i = 1 , … , I    s m x  ≥ 0 , s n y  ≥ 0 , s i b  ≥ 0 , λ k t  ≥ 0 , k = 1 , … , K          where M , N , and I  denote the number of input indicators, desirable output indicators and undesirable output indicators, x  denotes the input, y  denotes the desirable output, b  denotes the undesirable output variable, s m x     denotes the input slack variable, s n y     denotes the desirable output slack variable, s i b     denotes the undesired output slack variable, x k ′  m  t ′     , y k ′  n  t ′     , and b k ′  i  t ′     , are respectively the input-output value of city k ’ in year t ’, λ k t     is the coefficient, and ρ  denotes the ULUE, referring to s m x    , s n y     and s i b    , is between 0 and 1. When ρ  = 1, then s m x    , = s n y     = s i b     = 0, indicating that the DMU is effective and there is no redundancy or deficiency of the input; when ρ  < 1, the DMU is ineffective and there is a loss of efficiency.  2.3 LCRPGR calculation We use the UN SDG11.3.1: LCRPGR to characterize the efficiency of urban land use (Estoque et al., 2021 ; European Commission. Joint Research Centre, 2022 ; Jiang et al., 2022 ; Song et al., 2023 ). The method uses urban built-up areas instead of urban areas and is calculated using the population within the exact built-up area instead of the total population. The LCRPGR method first quantifies the land consumption rate (LCR) (Equation (4) , Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and the population growth rate (PGR) (Equation (5) , Supplementary Fig. 4 ) within a given spatial unit and period (y). We applied the method to newly expanded urban land to calculate its LCRPGR (Equation (6) ), respectively.(4) L C R = LN ( U r b  t + n   U r b  t   )   y      (5) P G R = LN ( P o p  t + n   P o p  t   )   y      (6) L C R P G R = L C R  P G R        Among them, Urb t   and Urb t + n   capture the total urban land area in the initial reference year t and the total urban land area in the final reference year t + n  with the New Deal urban conversion land (expressed as the range of human settlement floor space), respectively, while Pop t   and Pop t + n   enter the urban population in the initial reference year and the urban population in the final reference year with the sum of the population on the New Deal urban conversion land (LN  is the natural logarithm of the ratio), y  the interval of observation years. LCRPGR  denotes the ratio of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate. LCRPGR  is the ratio of LCR  to PGR , and an ideal scenario is where LCR  and PGR  are growing in harmony. When LCRPGR  < 0, it is not possible to determine which is growing faster, land or population. When both LCR  and PGR  are positive, LCRPGR  > 0. LCRPGR  values can be divided into two cases: LCRPGR  > 1 and 0 < LCRPGR  < 1. In the former case, the land growth type is defined as LCRPGR  > 1 or LCR  > 0 and PGR  < 0, while the population growth type is defined as 0 < LCRPGR  < 1 or LCR  < 0 and PGR  > 0 (Wang et al., 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2021 ).  2.4 Coupling relationship between ULUE and LCRPGR The CCDM are widely used to assess the relationships between land use and service values, reflecting the dependence between subsystems (Cheung and Ma, 2011 ; Zhou et al., 2020 ). These models are now commonly used to compare relationships between multiple systems to better understand the interaction mechanisms and the spatial and temporal evolution of subsystems and the overall system (Jiang et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2020 ). The degree of coupling provides a measure of the level of interaction between systems (Ouyang et al., 2016 ; Sun et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). In this study, we developed a method for assessing the ULUE that considers three dimensions: economic, social, and ecological. In contrast, the LCRPGR recommended in SDG11.3.1 only considers population and land. To establish a coherent relationship between ULUE and LCRPGR, we calculated the CCD using Equation (7) , Equation (8) , and Equation (9) .(7) C = f ( x )  * g ( y )   ( f ( x )  + g ( y )   2  )  2        (8) T = α f ( x )  + β g ( y )      (9) D = C T        Among them, C  is the degree of coupling between 0 and 1, and f(x)  and g(y ) are the normalized values of the two systems. The higher the value of C , the more coupled the two systems are. When C  = 0, the two systems are independent of each other. In this study, f(x)  is the ULUE, and g(y)  is the LCRPGR. when 0 < C  ≤ 0.3, there is a low level of coupling between the ULUE and the LCRPGR. When 0.3 < C  ≤ 0.5, the ULUE and the LCRPGR are in an opposing phase. When 0.5 < C  ≤ 0.8, the ULUE and the LCRPGR are in an abrasive phase, and when 0.8 < C  < 1, there exists a high-level coupling phase of harmonious and mutually beneficial coupling between the ULUE and the LCRPGR, and when C  = 1, benign resonance coupling is achieved. D  is the coupling coordination degree; T  is the CCD; α  and β  are the weights of the ULUE and the LCRPGR, and we consider the ULUE and the LCRPGR to be equally important, and to achieve cross-sectional comparability of the evaluation structure, α  = β  = 0.5. To better describe the results of the CCD, we use a common classification of coupling coordination into ten coupling types (Sun et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2022 ) (Table 1  ).  2.5 Characterization of the CCD time evolution Kernel density estimation (KDE), a technique esteemed for its robust statistical attributes, is harnessed as a non-parametric approach to delineate the distribution pattern of stochastic variables. It employs seamless curves to articulate the evolutionary trajectory and absolute differentials from a data-centric vantage point (Equation. 10) (Katkovnik and Shmulevich, 2002 ; Silverman, 1986 ). This method unveils the temporal progression nuances and fluid trajectories of the CCD between 2020 and 2050. The formulation is succinctly conveyed as:(10) f n  = 1 n h   ∑ i = 1  n  k ( x − x i   h  )      where h  is the bandwidth value (h  > 0); k  is the kernel function; the larger the bandwidth value, the smoother the spatial point density.  2.6 The CCD spatial autocorrelation and local spatial correlation Global Moran's I serve as a metric for spatial autocorrelation, devised by the distinguished Patrick Alfred Pierce Moran, to gauge the interplay of spatial arrangement and attribute values. To ascertain the configuration pattern, be it clustered, dispersed, or displaying a random distribution, the computation of Moran's I (Equation (11)  and –Equation (12) ), Z-Score, and significance level becomes imperative. The spectrum of Moran's I span from −1 to 1. A positive value of Moran's I, exceeding 0, signifies a spatially positive correlation within the data. Moreover, as this value augments, the spatial correlation assumes heightened prominence. Conversely, a negative value of Moran's I, less than 0, denotes a spatially negative correlation. In this instance, an augmented value underscores the intensification of spatial correlation. On the other hand, Moran's I of 0 signifies the manifestation of spatial randomness.(11) I = n S 0   ∑ i = 1  n  ∑ j = 1  n  W i , j   Z i  Z j   ∑ i = 1  n  Z i 2        (12) S 0  = ∑ i = 1  n  ∑ j = 1  n  W i , j       where z i   is the deviation of an attribute for feature i from its mean (x i  -x average  ), w i,j   is the spatial weight between feature i  and j , n  is equal to the total number of features, and S 0   is the aggregate of all the spatial weights: Global spatial autocorrelation fails to capture distinct spatial clusters definitively. Thus, within this study, an additional facet is embraced by incorporating the local spatial correlation index (Local Moran's I, Equation (13) ). This measure serves to assess the spatial diversity inherent in the coupled coordination dynamics between the LCRPGR and the ULUE from 2020 to 2050. The investigation involves the extraction of spatial autocorrelation linking each cell to its neighboring counterparts, realized through the subsequent formulation:(13) L o c a l  M o r a n ′  s I n ( x i  − x a v e    )  ∑ j = 1  m  w i j   ( x j  − x a v e    )     ∑ i = 1  n  ( x j  − x a v e    )  2    ( i ≠ j  )      where m  denotes the number of cities neighboring the i th city, x i   is the urban area level of the i th city, n  is the total number of cities, and W ij   is the spatial weight matrix, which is the average urban area level among all cities.  2.7 Drivers of spatial and temporal changes in CCDs MGWR possesses the capacity to function across multiple spatial scales. Its modeling outcomes are derived from spatial fluctuations, aiding in identifying pivotal internal indicators within the system that wield significant influence over the degree of coupled coordination (Equation (14) ). MGWR introduces the concept of individual spatial smoothing for each chosen independent variable, thereby mitigating estimation biases. The designated bandwidths for each independent variable delineate the spatial dimensions of operative spatial processes. This multi-bandwidth approach converges toward a more authentic and pragmatic spatial process modeling paradigm. Building upon this foundation, a geospatially tailored reference frame can be established to capture the determining factors of coupled coordination effectively. The expression of the MGWR is encapsulated by the subsequent equation (Fotheringham et al., 2017 ):(14) y i  = ∑ j = 1  k  b b w j   ( u i  , v i   )  x i j   + e i      where bwj  represents the bandwidth used for the regression coefficients of the j th variable. Each regression coefficient b bwj   in MGWR is obtained based on geographically local regression.   3 Results and analysis 3.1 Spatio-temporal distribution of ULUE in China from 2020 to 2050 For simplicity, from now on, we will only report the results of the middle integration growth model Chinese ULUE. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in China's ULUE over the next 30 years, with the central and western regions improving their ULUE significantly faster than the eastern regions (Fig. 1   ). In particular, the SSP1-SSP4 shifts from higher ULUE in eastern China to higher ULUE in western China; the SSP5 shifts from higher ULUE in western China to eastern China and back to western China, with the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region in southwestern China having the highest ULUE in the future; the central provinces of Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi and the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou have the lowest ULUE in the future. In terms of ULUE values, China's ULUE will gradually increase over the next 30 years. The average ULUEs for SSP1-SSP5 in 368 Chinese cities in 2020–2030 are 0.244, 0.147, 0.188, 0.141, and 0.592; the average ULUEs for SSP1-SSP5 in 2030–2040 are 0.230, 0.222, 0.204, 0.258, and 0.233; and the average ULUEs for SSP1-SSP5 in 2040–2050 are 0.634, 0.600, 0.322, 0.697, and 0.645.  3.2 Spatio-temporal distribution of LCRPGR in China from 2020 to 2050 We analyzed the LCRPGR values for 2020–2050 under different SSPs (Fig. 2 ). The average LCRPGR values for China's 368 cities under SSP1-SSP5 were −118.65, 140.37, 156.54, −124.46, and −33.91 for the 2020–2030 period; −175.58, −137.79, −103.30, −166.58, and −76.88 for the 2030–2040 period; and −341.75, −257.49, −146.05, −411.57, and −356.04 for the 2040–2050 period. These results indicate a mismatch between China's future urban expansion and population change. LCR growth is faster than PGR growth, implying that urban expansion is occurring much more rapidly than population growth. The LCRPGR values under SSP1-SSP4 experience a continuous and fluctuating decline in absolute terms. This suggests a possible decrease in housing and employment demand arising from population growth. This indicates a gradual easing of the population-land conflict.  3.3 ULUE and LCRPGR coordination We employed the CCD as an indicator to delineate the level of interaction and synchronization between the ULUE and the LCRPGR across various SSPs (Fig. 3  , Supplementary Table 1 ). Numerically, the mean CCD values for SSP1-SSP5 during 2020–2030 are 0.643, 0.345, 0.436, 0.567, and 0.819, respectively. For 2030–2040, the corresponding values are 0.613, 0.607, 0.655, 0.653, and 0.573, respectively. From 2040 to 2050, SSP1 exhibits an average CCD of 0.558, SSP2 of 0.854, SSP3 of 0.616, SSP4 of 0.893, and SSP5 of 0.860. This analysis elucidates that the CCD of SSP1 remains consistently stable, perpetually residing within the grinding stage. The CCDs of SSP2 and SSP4 always ascend, progressing to an advanced coupling stage. The CCD of SSP3 attains stability after transitioning from the opposition stage to the grinding stage. Notably, the CCD of SSP5 follows an initial decrease followed by an ascent, ultimately culminating in an advanced coupling stage. This observation signifies the anticipated elevation of coordination levels between the ULUE and the LCRPGR, notably achievable along the SSP2, SSP4, and SSP5 trajectories. Regarding the spatial distribution of the CCDs, subtle variations emerge. Weak spatial heterogeneity is evident in the CCDs under the SSP2 and SSP3 pathways during the 2020–2030 interval and within the SSP2, SSP3, and SSP5 paths from 2040 to 2050. Broadly, the eastern coastline of China is characterized by elevated the CCDs, juxtaposed against lower values in the central region. Noteworthy is the pronounced contrast in ecologically sensitive areas, specifically Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xinjiang, which record the lowest CCDs. This pattern resonates with the propagation of high CCD diffusion and spatial clustering, signifying their attendant benefits.  3.4 Spatial-temporal trends of coupling coordination degree 3.4.1 Temporal trend of coupling coordination degree under different paths The variations in CCD across distinct SSPs from 2020 to 2050 undergo scrutiny through KDE analysis (Fig. 4   ). A discernible trend is observed veering toward the rightward spectrum throughout the sampling interval. The apical juncture of the KDE curve experiences an initial ascent followed by a gradual attenuation, thereby signifying the propensity of the CCD among diverse municipalities to converge and subsequently disperse. Amid the various SSPs, the span between 2030 and 2040 exhibits the most uniform distribution, with the mean CCD coalescing around 0.6. Beyond 2040, the coupling coherence degree of SSP2, SSP4, and SSP5 gravitates towards unity, thereby elucidating the convergence of ULUE with LCRPGR. Furthermore, the distribution of the CCD shows a transition from bimodal and multimodal to unimodal, implying that elevated the CCDs predominantly steer the coupling coordination degree throughout the transformative process. Owing to the diffusive influence of elevated values, this phenomenon facilitates the enhancement of the CCDs in cities marked by lower values. Concurrently, the range encompassed by CCD curves displays an inclination towards expansion, spanning from 0.2 to 1. This conveys the proliferation of cities exhibiting varying characteristics of the CCDs, thereby underscoring the discernible spatial heterogeneity within the CCD distribution.  3.4.2 Spatial distribution trend of coupling coordination degree under different paths Moran's I coefficient for the CCD under various SSPs between 2020 and 2050 was meticulously computed (Fig. 5 ). The outcomes notably validate the significance of Moran's I across all temporal segments, attesting to the evident spatial correlation entrenched within the realms of ULUE and LCRPGR. Throughout the interval spanning 2020 to 2030, the Moran's I value, as underscored by the assorted SSP trajectories, remains at a modest level, hovering around 0.1. Notable exceptions emerge in the case of SSP5. During the subsequent phase, 2030 to 2040, an overall elevation in Moran's I am witnessed across most SSPs, with SSP3 and SSP5 constituting the exceptions. Beyond 2040, extending till 2050, there surfaces a consistent augmentation in Moran's I across all SSPs, converging and stabilizing above 0.3. Remarkably, this plateau denotes the apogee of global spatial correlation, culminating in a heightened level of aggregation for CCDs. This is particularly pronounced in SSP5, where the spatial coalescence of the CCDs is bolstered to an acme. Global Moran's I merely encapsulate the mean extent of spatial correlation prevalent between a given sample and its spatially proximate sample CCDs. Thus, a broader perspective necessitates the computation of Local Moran's I. This computation underscores four distinct clustering methodologies: H-H, L-L, and H-L clustering paired with L-H clustering. These approaches collectively delineate the landscape of the local spatial CCD clustering (Fig. 6  ). The outcomes underscore a discernible augmentation in the count of cities exhibiting clustering attributes, a trend sustained across various trajectories, excluding SSP5. Within the temporal span of 2020–2030, cities manifesting clustering attributes experience sporadic distribution, predominating the coastal, northeastern, and Sinkiang and southwestern border regions. Notably, L-L clustering features assume dominance. Transitioning from 2030 to 2040, spatial clustering attributes intensify, manifesting a heightened prevalence. Remarkably, the eastern region records a surge in H-H clustering attributes, while its western counterpart predominantly evinces L-L clustering attributes. Come 2040 to 2050, the prevalence of spatial clustering attributes will escalate significantly. The northeastern and Sichuan regions take center stage with H-H clustering attributes. In contrast, the southwestern border and Xinjiang regions adopt diverse L-L and L-H clustering attributes. Amidst all trajectories, cities exhibiting H-L clustering features remain comparatively sparse. The cumulative evidence underscores the reinforcement of spatial heterogeneity within CCDs across Chinese municipalities, characterized by conspicuous spatial correlation and clustering tendencies. This compels the imperative utilization of spatial econometric models to dissect the variegated impacts of distinct factors on CCD dynamics.   3.5 Drivers of coupling coherence Upon ensuring the variance-covariance test (VIF<7.5) for all chosen variables, we systematically formulate the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) model for the CCD under various trajectories of SSPs in China spanning 2020 to 2050. The findings substantiate that the MGWR model attained its zenith Adjusted R2  during 2030–2040, boasting an average of approximately 0.88 across all SSPs. Contrastingly, the average Adjusted R2  values during 2020–2030 and 2030–2040 stand at 0.64 and 0.67, respectively. These observations collectively underline the dependability and trustworthiness of the MGWR model's performance (Table 2  ). MGWR was used to obtain the influencing factors affecting the CCR of ULUE and LCRPGR (Table 3  ). Urban built-up area is the most significant negative factor affecting the CCD, and the absolute value of the regression coefficient of the urban built-up area continues to increase under all SSPs paths, with mean values of −0.77, −1.07 and −2.10 (2020–2030, 2030–2040, and 2040–2050, respectively, henceforth). GDP is the most critical factor affecting the CCD as a positive factor, with mean values of regression coefficients of 0.27, 0.63 & 0.44, respectively; demographic factor is also a positive factor influencing the CCD, with mean values of regression coefficients of 0.24, 0.11, and 0.45, respectively; and green space factor has a weaker influence on the CCD, with mean values of regression coefficients of 0.07, 0.10, and 0.04, respectively, and is a negatively influencing factor under a few paths. The above evidence suggests that the CCD of ULUE and LCRPGR is mainly determined by the rate of urban sprawl, and among the remaining influencing factors, the economic factors have more muscular control than the social and ecological factors.   4 Discussion Our inquiry proffers a prognostication of China's elevated zones of the ULUE, presaging a trajectory from the eastern littoral to the inland west between 2020 and 2050. Rooted in the LCRPGR perspective articulated within SDG11.3.1, China is poised to augment its land use efficiency quotient in the forthcoming era. However, an insightful revelation surfaces: post-2040, over two-thirds of the regions are anticipated to embark upon a more gradual trajectory of urbanization, thus corroborating findings derived from analyses grounded in the demographic and economic urbanization paradigm (Estoque et al., 2021 ; Jiang et al., 2021 , 2022 ; Song and Tao, 2022 ; Song et al., 2023 ). Remarkably, the CCD interweaves ULUE and LCRPGR along the trajectories charted by SSP2, SSP4, and SSP5, culminating in exemplary alignment from 2040 to 2050. Coincidently, the preeminence of demographic factors within the land-demographic framework burgeons over temporal epochs, forging a proximate convergence of prognostications embraced by the LCRPGR with those of the ULUE. Our contribution resides in pinpointing the focal arenas that warrant timely attention in sustainable urbanization in the forthcoming era, concurrently offering a compass to navigate the intricacies necessitating the dynamic recalibration of the SDG11.3.1 assessment strategy. 4.1 Future ULUE in China In 2020–2030, the cities with higher ULUE are mostly Chinese provincial capitals, developed coastal cities, and industrial towns, due to their well-developed industrial structure and solid economic foundation (Mudau et al., 2020 ). 2030–2040, the cities with the higher ULUE are primarily located in China's northeastern and coastal regions, with apparent central diffusion effects, which stems from the combination of excess production capacity and high and new technology means in the major city with the transfer of industries to the coastal areas, which are the main reasons for the increase in ULUE in the future. High-tech means accompanied by the transfer of industries to neighboring cities, forming a cluster effect to improve the ULUE in the surrounding towns. 2040–2050, the ULUE in western China is rapidly increasing, on the one hand, due to the late start of the urbanization process, which can learn from the experience of the priority development areas to avoid the waste of land resources; on the other hand, with the acceleration of the land development process, it is expected that in 2050, the urbanization process in the west will reach the highest level. On the other hand, as the land development process accelerates, it is expected that the urbanization process in the west will reach its peak around 2050. The more relaxed population flow and investment incentives will further attract the population and capital from the central and eastern regions, which will, in turn, increase the ULUE (G. Chen et al., 2020 ; Gao and Pesaresi, 2021 ; Huang et al., 2022 ; Jing et al., 2022 ; Wang and Sun, 2022 ). China's ULUE changes under the SSP1-SSP4 are consistent, i.e., ULUE stays low in 2020–2040 and increases significantly in 2040–2050. This is closely related to China's choice of investing in human capital and cleaner production rather than competitive markets and fossil energy, which will lead to a slower return on investment, resulting in a short-term negative impact of declining quality of development, but actively building a natural and environmentally friendly development model will have a better prospect of profitability. And the change of the SSP5 differs from the SSP1-SSP4, with the higher ULUE areas shifting from the west to the east and back to the west, which stems from the fact that SSP5 is a fossil-fuel-driven development route, which accelerates the short-term growth of the local economy through the resource- and energy-intensive lifestyle, and the rapid growth of the economic sub-efficiency leads to the increase of the ULUE in 2020–2030; However, the SSP-RGP 5–8.5 scenario will inevitably cause a decline in environmental sub-efficiencies, as well as a decline in economic efficiencies due to energy depletion, leading to a decrease in ULUE in 2030–2040; as China's population declines around the middle of the 21st century, an increased share of the green economy and increased social equity will gradually improve the urban environment, helping to increase the ULUE (Huang et al., 2022 ; Jiang and O’Neill, 2017 ; O'Neill et al., 2017 ).  4.2 Future LCRPGR in China From 2020 to 2050, the number of cities with LCRPGR greater than zero continuously decreases in all SSPs scenarios, and the number of towns with less than zero first increases and then decreases. This is because the LCRPGR only considers per capita land consumption, which assumes that all previously unbuilt land within the unit of analysis has the same social and ecological importance. Therefore, the foreseeable future trend of decreasing population in China will lead to a renewed decrease in the number of cities with the lower LCRPGR values (i.e., more efficient use of resources) (Estoque et al., 2021 ; Schiavina et al., 2022 ). Cities with positive values of the LCRPGR all have an LCRPGR greater than 1 for the land growth type. This phenomenon stems from the rapid urbanization policy implemented in China: rural land was converted into urban land, and then farmers were encouraged to move to the cities through subsidy policies, suggesting that prioritizing land urbanization leads to a lagged effect on population urbanization (Jiang et al., 2021 ; Ye et al., 2022 ). Since the LCRPGR is a ratio concept that fails once the land expansion of the predicted city stops or the population growth stagnates, a scenario where the LCR is 0 is prone to occur in a future where China's urbanization process slows down with counter-urbanization. The LCR failure regions are concentrated in the western areas that are difficult to urbanize due to the harsh natural environment and the Coastal areas. The central part, which started urbanization later and has a large amount of reserve urban land that is easier to develop, still has the potential to continue urbanization by 2050 (Estoque et al., 2021 ; Jiao et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the assessment strategy and scope of application of the LCRPGGR and establish a set of sustainability evaluation indicators that consider both reverse and stagnant urbanization areas.  4.3 Coupling and coordination relationship between ULUE and LCRPGGR The CCDs of SSP5 in 2020–2030 and SSP2 in 2040–2050, SSP4 and SSP5 reach the Excellent coordination stage, which indicates that ULUE and LCRPGR have high CCDs when there is a gap between the global resource mitigation and adaptation challenges. This is due to the low mitigation and high adaptation challenges of SSP4 for human beings, SSP4 for human beings, and SSP4 for human beings. This is because SSP4 has a higher mitigation challenge for human beings and a higher adaptation challenge for them; SSP5 has a higher mitigation challenge for human beings and a lower adaptation challenge; SSP2 will level off only after 2050, gradually improving the income imbalance and environmental degradation, and it is predicted that there will still be an imbalance between mitigation and adaptation challenges in SSP2 until 2050 (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017 ). The way to improve the CCD varies across different regions of China: the southeast coastal region, which started earlier and is more economically developed, should pay attention to the ecological and environmental subsystems, reduce intra-urban inequality, and gradually move towards a sustainable development path, the western region, which started late in the urbanization process and is economically more backward, should consider the economic subsystems and the environmental subsystems, and move towards a green path as much as possible through regional supportive policies and raising public awareness; the central region is in between; and the central region is between the two. The central region is in between the two. While accepting the transfer of industries from the East and supporting the West, it should make the best use of its resource advantages, learn from the development experience of the East, and establish a more mature urban hierarchy and industrial system that is consistent with the strategy of sustainable development (Sun et al., 2019 ). We suggest that the future challenges of mitigating and adapting to climate change should be actively considered, and priority should be given to achieving the coordination of the ULUE and the LCRPGR in the eastern and western regions with fewer urbanization needs.  4.4 Drivers affecting the coupled coordination relationship The CCD of LCRPGR and ULUE are influenced successively by urban zones, GDP, population, and greenfield expanses. This sequence of factors underscores that LCRPGR still necessitates the quantification of economic-tier urbanization, aligning with prior research (Guo et al., 2022 ; Jiang et al., 2021 ). In the epoch of 2040–2050, the ULUE and the LCRPGR achieve a state of Exceptional coordination across various SSP trajectories. This signifies the convergence of the LCRPGR, which encompasses the land-population paradigm, with the ULUE, which encompasses the land-“economy-population-ecology” framework. This phenomenon emanates, firstly, from the mitigation of regional developmental disparities and the capacity of the population to embody myriad dimensions of human endeavors (including human activities, economic production, and ecological footprints). Secondly, it is a consequence of the limited explanatory potency of the green space element, juxtaposed with the coinciding explanatory potency of GDP and population dimensions, culminating in pronounced interconnection. Significantly, by 2030, the end of SDGs guidance, the CCD of ULUE and LCRPGR merely attains 0.56 on average across SSPs, achieving only a state of Marginal coordination. We propose a timely adjustment to strategies about SDG11.3.1 assessments, actively forging connections with urban environmental evaluation markers like SDG11.6 Atmospheric Particulate Matter and SDG11.7 Urban Green Space. Furthermore, it is imperative to introduce indicators gauging urban economic vitality and human well-being at the opportune juncture, thus elevating the precision and credibility of SDG11 evaluation (Fullman et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; Zhai et al., 2023 ).  4.5 Shortcomings and suggestions The first limitation of this study stems from the data source. Although we used SSPs data for validation, the different scales of predictive studies may lead to differences in the results and be limited by the number of available predictions (Yimin Chen et al., 2020 ; Wang and Sun, 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). Second, erroneous predictions may occur due to the need to consider international emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic in the SSPs prediction scenarios, population restrictions in some Chinese cities, and policy impacts such as family planning policies versus policy migration. Finally, the uncertainty of administrative restructuring leads to the possibility of splitting and joining some prefecture-level regional units, which can lead to incorrect predictions for some regions. To ensure the accuracy of the results, we need to assume that the impact of emergency events and policy adjustments such as COVID-19 will be eliminated in a short period. On the other hand, we include the spontaneous and organic growth expansion scenarios in the sensitivity analyses to ensure that the urban boundaries and the regional population have a high degree of consistency as much as possible to minimize the disturbing factors (G. Chen et al., 2020 ; Yidan Chen et al., 2020 ; Gao and O’Neill, 2020 ; Nisa et al., 2021 ). The second limitation stems from the fact that the input dataset of LCRPGR contains both population and urban extension boundaries, ignoring the impact of other important factors, such as economic growth, on LCRPGR. We believe that the current the LCRPGR lacks the consideration of other social and environmental factors; second, the LCRPGR does not reflect the external influences on urban areas, as it measures the city as a whole, and lacks the consideration of boundary spillovers and the ecological footprint of the area. Lastly, the urban sprawl can be expanded in terms of the “height” of the sprawl, but the LCRPGR only considers outward sprawl. The LCRPGR only considers outward expansion but not upward expansion (Estoque et al., 2021 ; Guo et al., 2022 ; Jiang et al., 2021 ). However, due to its simplicity and validity, the LCRPGR indicator can still be used to quantify the relationship between land and population urbanization in areas that are still rapidly urbanizing (Jiang et al., 2022 ; Schiavina et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). We suggest that, data should be collected at more negligible administrative levels and incorporated into national or local development plans, priorities, and policies, as well as other local socio-economic issues, to make coherent predictions of SSPs independently; secondly, the LCRPGR can also be improved to incorporate more ecological footprint changes and external disturbances, with a focus on the economic development dimension, to obtain a more consistent and consistent picture than traditional methods such as data envelopment analyses. Finally, due to the limitation of the lack of a uniform baseline for statistical data, the incorporation of remote sensing means, such as night-lighting, can be considered in the future to carry out indiscriminate quantification work at larger scales. Specifically, we recommend that researchers focus on the following in the future. (1) Modelling short-term future socio-economic development scenarios using Markov chain (MC) and cellular automata (CA) to obtain more credible data on future development. (2) Consider modelling some of the undesirable outputs of the land expansion process, such as air pollutants, to construct efficiency models that take into account undesirable outputs. (3) This study does not consider the lagged effects between the ULUE and the LCRPGR, and related studies can construct econometric models such as spatial Durbin models to exploit the potential time-lagged effects. (4) Based on geospatial means, the ULUE is quantified at the raster scale as much as possible to obtain the ULUE with explicit spatial attributes.   5 Conclusions and potential implications Our study estimated the ULUE for 368 Chinese municipalities spanning 2020–2050, employing the SBM-DEA model across five distinct SSP trajectories. We further applied the CCDM to gauge the interrelation between the ULUE and the LCRPGR. We identified the determinants of the CCD by utilizing the KDE, the Moran Index method, and the MGWR. Our inquiry delves into the following pivotal inquiries: Firstly, what patterns will define the spatial and temporal evolution of the ULUE and the LCRPGR in China over the ensuing three decades? Our findings reveal a roughly 25% expansion in China's urban land area from 2020 to 2050. The diffusion impact of central cities experiences an initial augmentation followed by attenuation. Urban centers characterized by elevated ULUE shift away from China's economically advanced coastal metropolises and provincial capitals boasting pronounced primacy, gravitating towards western regions. Throughout this transition, China's land usage efficiency sees enhancement, though the populace's role in the urbanization process lags relative to land utilization. Secondly, does ULUE substantiate an enhanced correlation with LCRPGR? 2020–2050, the interdependence between the ULUE and the LCRPGR in China witnessed further augmentation. Projections indicate that post-2040, the most robust coupling between the two emerges within SSP2, SSP4, and SSP5. The two components converge as evaluation indices for land resource efficiency, potentially serving as reciprocal surrogate metrics in forthcoming evaluations. Nonetheless, we stress the necessity for adaptations in SDG11.3.1-related assessment strategies, integrating urban land resource efficiency with regional economic advancement and ecological contributions. Aims to achieve “Building Sustainable Cities and Communities” as far as possible by 2030. Finally, what trajectories underpin the spatial-temporal dissemination of the CCD across diverse SSPs, and what catalytic forces drive these trends? Spanning 2020–2050, the affirmative spatial alignment of the CCD is set to intensify, accompanied by a surge in clustered urban locales. The ascendancy of urban regions grows more pronounced with time. Our prognosis suggests that by 2050, land-based urbanization will retain its supremacy as the principal mode of expansion in China, eclipsing population-based urbanization, economic-driven urbanization, and ecologically-center urbanization. We suggest that the Chinese government should focus on prioritizing the “population-city-land” urbanization process in the future, to prevent ineffective urban land expansion and population spillover; secondly, it still needs to accelerate the pace of energy transition, move towards sustainable development as soon as possible, and realize the process of green and efficient urbanization; and lastly, there is a need to further implement the “Western Development” to narrow the development gap between the backward regions in the central and western regions and the developed regions in the east. For the SDG 11.3.1, we suggest that economic development evaluation indicators such as GDP should be included to adapt to the process of economic urbanization; secondly, it is still necessary to consider the trade-offs and coordination effects within SDG 11, focusing on the relationship between economic development and urban habitat; lastly, a unified baseline for the LCRPGR should be formulated as soon as possible, to obtain globally consistent data, to work on the relationship between the sustainable land protect and urban development.
