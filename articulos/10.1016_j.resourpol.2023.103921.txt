                  China's economy has been slowing down over the past decade after decades of rapid expansion due to demographic challenges and a precipitous drop in productivity growth. Thus, rising economic imbalances constitute a significant drag on China's economy's potential for expansion. Thus, understanding the forces and reducing the imbalance between development and ecology is imperative. For this purpose, the present study is conducted to ascertain the role of Natural Resources (NTR), Economic development (ECD), Renewable Energy (REN), and Clean Technology (TEC) on Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through a cutting-edge timeseries estimation technique of a Quantile Autoregressive Distribution Lag (QARDL). The reported results revealed the positive relationships of NTR and ECD with GHG, whereas REN and TEC are found to reduce the level of GHG. Based on the findings and the declining trend in the growth of the Chinese economy, it is recommended to take sustainable initiatives to balance the imbalance between ecology and development sustainably.

China's economy has been slowing down over the past decade after decades of rapid expansion due to demographic challenges and a precipitous drop in productivity growth. Thus, rising economic imbalances constitute a significant drag on China's economy's potential for expansion. Thus, understanding the forces and reducing the imbalance between development and ecology is imperative. For this purpose, the present study is conducted to ascertain the role of Natural Resources (NTR), Economic development (ECD), Renewable Energy (REN), and Clean Technology (TEC) on Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through a cutting-edge timeseries estimation technique of a Quantile Autoregressive Distribution Lag (QARDL). The reported results revealed the positive relationships of NTR and ECD with GHG, whereas REN and TEC are found to reduce the level of GHG. Based on the findings and the declining trend in the growth of the Chinese economy, it is recommended to take sustainable initiatives to balance the imbalance between ecology and development sustainably.   Keywords Natural resources  Economic development  Renewable energy  Clean technology  Greenhouse gas emissions  QARDL    1 Introduction China finds itself at a crossroads. On the one hand, it needs to maintain its ever-rising standard of living for its population, and on the other hand, it needs to reduce the ever-rising GHG, which is one of the highest worldwide(Yan et al., 2022 ; Dang et al., 2020 ). Despite its massive success in industrialization and being a "global factory," environmental disaster is just around the corner. Climate change is a significant risk factor for China's development and prosperity(BI et al., 2020 ). Nearly 20% of China's population lives in areas that are vulnerable to rising sea levels and accompanying risks such as coastal floods, storm surges, and rising seas. Agriculture is an essential livelihood, especially for China's rural poor(Chen et al., 2018 ). However, it is threatened by extreme weather conditions becoming more common and harsh in the interior provinces of the country's north and west(Chen and Yang, 2019 ). Recent extreme droughts and floods have ravaged significant portions of the country, showing that these hazards are hypothetical and will eventually occur (Ali et al., 2022 ; Esmaeil et al., 2020 ; Arfaoui and Yousaf, 2022 ). Over the last five years, natural disasters have caused an average annual direct loss of US$76 billion. Researchers have found that these negative consequences would only worsen and that by 2030, climate change might cause a 0.5–2.3 percent drop in GDP(The World Bank, 2022 ). Worryingly, these effects will hurt the bottom 40% of the income distribution, losing as much as 4.7% of their earnings by 2030 in the worst-case climate scenario. China's coasts are frequently affected by flooding, storm surges, saltwater intrusion, and saltwater intrusion. As early as 2030, experts predict that unchecked climate change will cause GDP to drop between 0.5 and 2.3 percent (Cai et al., 2021 ; Ramzan, 2021 ; Dilanchiev and Taktakishvili, 2021 ; Saungwemeand and Odhiambo, 2021 ; Gohar et al., 2022 ; Adebayo et al., 2022 ). Achieving global climate targets is impossible without China's transformation towardsa low-carbon economy. China emits 35% of global GHG (The World Bank, 2022 ). To make this change, there is a need to invest significantly in new energy-efficient technology and other forms of innovation (Ali et al., 2022 ; Esmaeil et al., 2020 ; Arfaoui and Yousaf, 2022 ). China must invest between US$14 trillion and US$17 trillion in sustainable projects to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060(Newburger, 2021 ). Moreover, rising economic imbalances constitute a significant drag on China's economy's potential for expansion. China's economy has been slowing down over the past decade after decades of rapid expansion due to demographic challenges and a precipitous drop in productivity growth. Despite their constantly dwindling returns, financial investments, particularly in the carbon-intensive transportation system and real estate, have grown too crucial to the economy(Umar et al., 2020 ; Cai et al., 2017 ). China's economy continues to rely on manufacturing at a higher rate than other countries with similar per capita incomes. This is primarily due to the prevalence of state-dominated heavy industries, such as metal and cement, as well as other construction and building sectors and China's leadership position in many international value chains(HUGHES et al., 2012 ). China must rebalance its growth model from conventional infrastructure spending to innovation, export markets to domestic consumption, manufacturing to high-value services, shifting towards sustainable production, and government towards market-driven resource allocation if it is to make the transition from rapid to sustainable economic expansion (Tiwari et al., 2021 ; Ali et al., 2022 ; Noman et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022 ; Yıldız et al., 2023 ). Transition hazards will be associated with the shift to carbon-neutral, resilient development. Detaching economic expansion and emissions at a faster rate and a lower income bracket than in industrialized economies is necessary if China is to achieve its climate and development goals, but doing so would be extraordinarily difficult(Fu et al., 2018 ). This will require significant adjustments to the economic structure, particularly in the areas of energy, industry, transportation, urban planning, and land use in China. There will be adverse effects on households and businesses from the inevitable rise in energy prices, at least for the foreseeable future. Jobs in polluting industries, most located in some of China's poorer interior provinces, will be lost, and a considerable portion of China's existing carbon-heavy invested capital will become obsolete. For decarbonization to be financially, socially, and politically feasible, the accompanying disruptions and dislocations and their consequences for development and inclusiveness must be addressed (Ji et al., 2021 ; Naqvi et al., 2023 ; Huang et al., 2020 ). ECD is often considered the main contributorto rising GHG. The rising economic activity would increase production and consumption, eventually leading to more significant environmental pollution (Su et al., 2022 ; Jiang et al., 2022 ). However, reduced ECD would also mean that the standard of living would fall, and an economy would not be able to fulfill its potential. Thus, there is a need to assess the role of ECD on GHG and identify ways to use the ECD to promote sustainability rather than facing rising GHG (Bai et al., 2022 ; Lv et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2021 ; Rjoub et al., 2021 ; Yang et al., 2022 ; Ly et al., 2022 ; AwosusiLiu et al., 2023 ). Similarly, NTR's are needed for ECD to furnish the energy needs of a growing economy. The availability of NTR can also be a double-edged sword (Omokanmi et al., 2022 ). The depletion of NTRs would lead to rising GHG, while the absence of NTRs would also mean that an economy would be deprived of the NTR rent (Li et al., 2021 ; Yang et al., 2022 ; DanishUlucak and Baloch, 2023 ). Furthermore, the revenue from NTR can also be used to fund green and other sustainable projects. The use of REN can be a handy alternative to solve the ever-evolving cauldron of development without harming the environment. REN would focus on reducing the GHG and the strain on the NTRs (Lanre Ibrahim et al., 2022 ). Using REN would furnish the energy demands of industries and ensure that the wave of development continues. In addition, the TEC would be a logical developmental step for reducing GHG. TEC can play a more holistic role in providing cleaner energy with a reduced carbon footprint and working to develop viable solutions to reduce waste. Both factors can be vital in reducing GHG in China's foreseeable future(Metawa et al., 2022 ). This study uses a new method called QARDL to examine the relationships, focusing on China. The study used the cutting-edge time-series estimation technique of a Quantile Autoregressive Distribution Lag (QARDL) to examine the association between variables. Quantitative analysis of possible spatial inequalities using the QARDL method emphasizes the strength of the link between the variables and offers both long- and short-term estimates across quantiles (Chen et al., 2022 ; Ramzan, 2021 ; Dilanchiev and Taktakishvili, 2021 ; Saungwemeand and Odhiambo, 2021 ; Gohar et al., 2022 ). Through this technique, a more detailed explanation can be drawn from the generated outcome, which further assists the decision makers in terms of their subsequent decision and policy making. The rest of the research is structured with section-2 having the review of the literature, Section-3 constituting the estimation techniques, and Section-4 including the results. The concluding section-5 has a summary and practical recommendations.  2 Literature review 2.1 Economic development and greenhouse gas emissions All types of organizations are influenced by environmental deterioration and climate change, which impact the state of the sustainable economy (Ozili, 2020 ). Climate risk, which negatively affects economic activity and, by extension, people's livelihoods and quality of life, reveals the potentially harmful effects climate change will have on economic activity. Social judgments, project implementation process, and the ability to foresee climate strategies connected to future GHG, and the trend of socioeconomic development (Tiwari et al., 2021 ; Ali et al., 2022 ; Noman et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022 ; Yıldız et al., 2023 ), are required for managing climate deterioration (Sullivan, 2014 ). Industrial emissions are a major contributor to global warming and a significant global problem. Even while energy is a crucial driving force behind economic growth, the aggregate demand trend for ECD would need an efficient approach to meeting the environmental challenges (Onofrei et al., 2022 ). The idea that more per capita income leads to faster environmental deterioration is supported by the fact that changes in environmental legislation directly result from that money. However, it is generally believed that a country's banking system, organizations, health, and educational standards significantly impact its ability to manage climatic stress (Garcia et al., 2020 ). Environmental assets tied to economic expansion have continued to contribute towards the depletion of the NTR, resulting in new issues and vulnerabilities in places affected by environmental GHG, even though the enacted environmental rules have provided some solace for environmental protection efforts (Halicioglu, 2009 ). The growth limit theory is foundational in studying how ECD affects environmental quality. This theory predicts that as production in the industrial sector rises, so will the usage of NTR, the buildup of waste, and the concentration of pollutants. Furthermore, the overuse of NTR eventually limits economic activity (Arrow et al., 2004 ). It was not until the sustainable development idea of the 1980s suggested that "ECD will not inevitably hurt the environment" that those researchers began digging into the connections between the two. Tolerance and Solidarity, part of the six sustainable development goals, can positively impact nations' quest for ECD (Cai et al., 2022 ). The EKC hypothesis states that despite the initial degradation of the environment, economies would then evolve to improve the environmental degradation (Harbaugh et al., 2002 ). This theory predicts that, as economies grow, GHG levels will rise until they eventually level out at some apocalyptic "turning point." Hence, GHG will exhibit a declining tendency, and protection of the environment will enhance; in other words, there is an inverted U-shaped link between GHG and income growth which eventually leads to ECD (Grossman and Krueger, 1991 ). One focus of EKS has been on determining the relationship between ECD and GHG (Graff Zivin&Neidell, 2013 ). An alternative approach showed that a country's output capacity decreases as GHG levels rise (Fleming et al., 2018 ). Optimizing environmental quality benefited long-term ECD (Wang et al., 2015 ). GHG in the environment due to economic expansion may have a delayed positive effect on the environment (Lisciandra and &Migliardo, 2016 ). Similarly, according to Chen and Hu (2020) , GHG and ECD appear to have a reciprocal effect. Furthermore, ECD may contribute to GHG, and GHG can contribute to ECD (Hagens, 2020 ). Thus, based on the above discussions, Economic development affects greenhouse gas emissions.H1 Economic developments affect Greenhouse Gas emissions.    2.2 Natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions One of the main contributors to a rising GHG is the increasing use of NTR's. They use fossil fuels to generate power and electricity, emitting harmful gases into the environment. Countries like China considered one of the largest economies in the world, is heavily dependent on using NTRs to meet their energy demand. The increased GDP and production in the economy would directly result in increased use of NTR which would play a dominant role in the increase of GHG (Mahmood et al., 2020 ). NTR rent is essential for an economy to maintain its financial stability in the long run. However, in some countries, the NTRs are often under the custody of manufacturing industries, which would extract the NTRs for commercial use and produce GHG (Bekun et al., 2019 ). Firms that use the NTRs might be considered an essential part of the economy as they would be contributing towards the national revenue of the government (Chien et al., 2023 ). The NTR rent can be one of the critical financers for developmental projects, but expanding this practice of the NTR rent would also mean that the energy derived from the extraction of the NTRs is directly contributing towards GHG too. Thus, the NTR rent might only sometimes be beneficial regarding the ecological aspect (Gyamfi et al., 2021 ). The depletion of NTR's can result in some of the most damaging consequences for a resource-based economy. The extraction of NTRs would be encouraged as the government would earn substantial revenue through NTR rent. Using the NTRs for the industries would then lead to greater GHG. This depletion of the NTR might spell trouble in various ways for a country, especially China. The tourism industry might suffer due to the massive extraction of NTR, as NTR is essential for a thriving tourism industry (Zaman et al., 2016 ). Industries are the backbone of every economy but also affect the global environment. Industry's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions severely affect human health (Zhao et al., 2021 ). GHG emissions from industrial energy consumption are a significant contributor to environmental deterioration. Many new illnesses have appeared in the last several decades thanks to industrial GHG emissions. The costs have skyrocketed over the past few years compared to the economic gains (Zhang et al., 2020 ). People already feel the effects of environmental destruction and global warming. Because of the proliferation of machines in the industrial sector, industrialization significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions (Nguyen &Kakinaka, 2019 ). according to Brahmasrene and Lee (2016) , Certainty in globalization, urbanization, industrialization, and tourism, might help regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Using natural resources to create manufactured goods is a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions(Lv et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2021 ; Rjoub et al., 2021 ; Yang et al., 2022 ; Ly et al., 2022 ; AwosusiLiu et al., 2023 ). There will be havoc and climate change if industrialized nations raise greenhouse gas emissions. Heat waves, brought on by the changing weather, can damage some items and impact other businesses (Chien et al., 2023 ). On the one hand, using NTRs might be directly related to the increase of GHG in countries. However, the availability of energy is essential for economic harmony too. Thus, there is a strong need to develop renewable energy sources and ensure that industries can fulfill their energy demands (Lieberei and &Gheewala, 2016 ). Thus, based on the above discussions, Natural Resources affect greenhouse gas emissions.H2 Natural Resources affect Greenhouse Gas emissions.    2.3 Renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions Due to their ability to lessen the production of greenhouse gases, store energy for later use, and ensure steady economic growth, REN resources are often regarded as the most environmentally friendly energy options available. Hydropower generates electricity by channeling water via electric turbines (Mousavi et al., 2017 ). Hydropower energy production and use prevent GHG and guarantee future electric supplies (Kusumadewi et al., 2017 ). Using energy from the sun is a sustainable practice. Solar panels are becoming increasingly popular as a source of REN due to their ability to reduce overall energy prices while meeting the growing electricity demand (Liu et al., 2019 ). Solar energy is gradually replacing fossil fuels, the traditional source of greenhouse gases. By soaking up heat from the air, solar panels mitigate the warming caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases (Wu et al., 2018 ). To mitigate the need to rely on non-REN in the future, an additional storage system powered by solar energy can be added (Zhou and Li, 2022 ). Armin Razzaq et al. (2021a)  studied the impact of dependable REN resources on energy sustainability and GHG. They concluded that using REN sources such as the sun and the wind. In addition to the sun and the wind, there are additional REN options. Like other REN resources, wind power is less harmful to the environment. Due to its environmental friendliness, wind power is becoming more popular in the industrial, transportation, agricultural, and service sectors. Wind energy's dual benefits—lowering regional GHG and preserving energy and materials for future economic use—make it an attractive option (González-Aparicio et al., 2017 ). Many corporate organizations may accomplish the most significant work thanks to wind power. This method decreases the need for fossil fuels and lessens the output of noxious fumes and smoke-producing byproducts (Zhou and Li, 2022 ). Using wind power guarantees more consistent economic performance while reducing pollution due to economic activity and protecting a wide range of natural resources (Garcia et al., 2020 ). In order to achieve China's carbon reduction goals by 2030, it is of paramount importance to replace coal-fired electricity with wind power is a viable strategy (Zhou and Li, 2022 ). Furthermore, GHG emissions from a single Chinese wind farm were 12.5 g/kWh, and those from a single coal-fired plant were 810.4 g/kWh. As a result, wind energy reduces global warming potential (Lin and Chen, 2018 ). Bioenergy is a preferred energy source among commercial organizations since it has little to no negative influence on the natural environment. Energy from biofuels or biomass, both natural resources, is used to generate bioenergy. The quality of these natural resources is maintained by their use to generate electricity for everyday tasks and business operations. On the contrary, limiting GHG effectively lowers GHG levels and ensures economic viability (Bhatia et al., 2019 ). Using bioenergy helps the bio-economy expand while reducing GHG (Schulze et al., 2020 ). countries increasingly use bioenergy to power their businesses' technology and processes to cut their emissions. Bioenergy sources include trees, edible and non-edible plant matter, and agricultural byproducts and residues. Bioenergy resources may be created using atmospheric carbon dioxide (Bauer et al., 2018 ). Reducing waste and limiting emissions of GHG. Thus, based on the above discussions, Renewable energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions.H3 Renewable energy reduces Greenhouse Gas emissions.    2.4 Clean Technology and greenhouse gas emissions Countries aim to reach a higher level of ECD to achieve higher living standards. This increases the economic activity in an economy. The increased economy would need more incredible energy to produce goods and services. The impact on the environment and GHG are twofold as the depletion of NTR increases along with the rise in waste levels due to the rise in the level of consumption. Both factors lead to an increase in GHG (Metawa et al., 2022 ). The use of TEC can be a game changer regarding the goal of sustainability and reduction of GHG. TEC's goal is to lessen environmental impact by decreasing pollutant levels. In broad words, it is an effort to reduce the adverse effects of technology on the natural world by minimizing changes to process systems, manufacturing activities, product qualities, and manufacturing procedures. TEC can be one of the critical solutions to the mounting environmental problems globally (Zhou et al., 2022 ). One of the key benefits of TEC is the low carbon emission and reduced energy use. This helps to ensure the lowest GHG levels without hampering the industries' energy demand. The scope of TEC is not only limited to finding greener technology but can also work to reduce wastes which can be one of the significant ways GHG can be reduced. Overall, the benefits of TEC can be used to reduce GHG and promote environmental sustainability (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Achieving adequate TEC can be attained in collaboration. There needs to be a process through which an organization can reap the maximum benefits. The concept of green finance and technology comes to the foray to support the cause of TEC (Tao et al., 2022 ). It is unrealistic to expect a firm to develop without investment in green technology or dedicating resources to developing greener alternatives(Ferrat et al., 2021 ; Gao et al., 2021 ). The evolution of green finance, which would look into a company's financial needs and support the production needs, would be needed to fully utilize TEC to reduce GHG in the long run (Madaleno et al., 2022 ). Thus, based on the above discussions, Clean technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions.H4 Clean Technology reduces Greenhouse Gas emissions.     3 Methodology Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag” (QARDL): As already mentioned, to examine the relationships, focusing on China, this study used the cutting-edge time-series estimation technique of a Quantile Autoregressive Distribution Lag (QARDL). Quantitative analysis of possible spatial inequalities using the QARDL method emphasizes the strength of the link between the variables and offers both long- and short-term estimates across quantiles (Chen et al., 2022 ). Moreover, for ascertaining the extent of cointegration, the Wald Test is utilized because of the nature of time-varying relationships, which assists in evaluating the smoothness of the quantile coefficients (Razzaq et al., 2021a ). The conventional ARDL-based reflecting relationships among the variables are mathematically represented in Equation (1) .(1) G H G  t  = α + ∑ i = 1  p  ∅ i  G H G  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 1   ω i  N T R  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 2   λ i  E C D  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 3   θ i  R E N  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 4   έ i  T E C  t − 1     + ε t       In Equation (1) , the error term of the model is denoted by ε t    , which is further elaborated as G H G  t  − E [ G H G  t  F t − 1    ]    . In this elaboration, the denotation of the minimum σ   -field is made through F t − 1     , which is generated through { N T R  t  , E C D  t  , R E N  t  , T E C  t  , G H G  t − 1   , N T R  t − 1   , E C D  t − 1   , R E N  t − 1   … …  }  .    Moreover, the “Schwarz Information Criterion” is utilized for selecting the lag order of the equation that must be optimized, which are p , q 1  , q 2  , a n d q 3    . It is important to mention that the natural log of all the studied variables were taken for uniformity. To incorporate the aspects of QARDL in this traditional ARDL form, Cho et al. (2015)  have reconfigured this equation to integrate the (p,q) aspects. Hence, the restructured model is mentioned in Equation (2) .(2) Q G H G  t   = α ( τ )  + ∑ i = 1  p  ∅ i  ( τ )  G H G  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 1   ω i  ( τ )  N T R  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 2   λ i  ( τ )  E C D  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 3   θ i  ( τ )  R E N  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 4   έ i  ( τ )  T E C  t − 1     + ε t  ( τ )       Due to the restructuring, the error term that is initially denoted as ε t  ( τ )    , has also been restructured, which is now reflected as ε t  ( τ )  = G H G  t − 1   − Q G H G  t   ( τ F t − 1    )    , in which the τ t h      quantile of G H G  t    , is further explained as Q G H G  t   ( τ F t − 1    )    . According to Kim and White (2003) , such an explanation is highly conditioned to the generated outcome, which is calculated through F t − 1     . Therefore, equation (2)  is further modified and is shown as Equation (3) .(3) Q G H G   = α ( τ )  + ∑ i = 1  q 1  − 1   δ N T R  i   ( τ )  Δ N T R  t − 1     + γ N T R   ( τ )  N T R  t  + ∑ i = 1  q 2  − 1   δ E C D  I   ( τ )  Δ E C D  t − 1     + γ E C D   ( τ )  E C D  t − 1   + ∑ i = 1  q 3  − 1   δ R E N  i   ( τ )  Δ R E N  t − 1     + γ R E N   ( τ )  R E N  t  + ∑ i = 1  q 4  − 1   δ T E C  i   ( τ )  Δ T E C  t − 1     + γ T E C   ( τ )  T E C  t  + ε t  ( τ )      W h e r e a s , γ N T R   ( τ )  = ∑ i = 0  q 1   ω i   ( τ )  , δ N T R  t   ( τ )  = − ∑ j = i + 1  q i   ω i   ( τ )  , γ E C D   ( τ )  = ∑ i = 0  q 1   λ i  ( τ )    , δ E C D  t   ( τ )  = − ∑ j = i + 1  q i   λ i   ( τ )  , γ R E N   ( τ )  = ∑ i = 0  q 1   θ i  ( τ )    , δ R E N  t   ( τ )  = − ∑ j = i + 1  q i   θ i   ( τ )  , γ T E C   ( τ )  = ∑ i = 0  q 1   έ i  ( τ )    , δ T E C  t   ( τ )  = − ∑ j = i + 1  q i   έ i   ( τ )       Since the parameters mentioned in Equation (3)  are only capable of ascertaining the dynamics for the short run; therefore, for ascertaining the long-run relationships, there is a need to incorporate the aspects of the long run, which are mentioned in Equation (4) .(4) Q G H G  t   = μ ( τ )  + X t ′  β ( τ )  + M t  ( τ )      In equation (4) , X = [ N T R , G F N , F D I , F D T  ]     and β N T R   ( τ )  = γ N T R   ( τ )  [ 1 − ∑ i = 1  p  ∅ G   ( τ )   ]  − 1      and M t  ( τ )  = ∑ j = 0  ∞  ϑ N T R  j    ( τ )  Δ N T R  t − 1   + ∑ j = 0  ∞  θ N T R  j    ( τ )  Δ ε t − 1      with μ ( τ )  = α ( τ )  [ 1 − ∑ i = 1  p  ∅ G   ( τ )   ]  − 1      and ϑ j  ( τ )  = ∑ l = j + 1  ∞  π l   ( τ )    . The remainder of the variables is also computed in a similar manner. In addition to this, the further elaboration of { θ 0  ( τ )  , θ 1  ( τ )  , …    and { π 0  ( τ )  , π 1  ( τ )  , …    is made through ∑ i = 0  ∞  θ i   ( τ )  L i  = ( 1 − ∑ i = 1  p  ∅ i   ( τ )  L i   )  − 1      and ∑ i = 0  ∞  π i   ( τ )  L i  = ( 1 − L  )  − 1   ( ∑ i = 0  q i   ω i   ( τ )  L i   1 − ∑ i = 0  q i   ω i   ( τ )  L i    − ∑ i = 0  q i   ω i   ( τ )   1 − ∑ i = 0  q i   ω i   ( τ )     )    . It is important to highlight that it is of crucial importance to dilute the serial correlation in any time series-based study. Otherwise, it will have adverse effects on the generated outcome. Therefore, such dilution can be done through generalization, of which certain elements are included in QARDL. For that, the earlier equation needs further reconfiguration, which is accordingly done and is shown in Equation (5) .(5) Q Δ G H G  t   = α + ρ G H G  t − 1   + ∅ N T R   N T R  t − 1   + ∅ E C D   E C D  t − 1   + ∅ R E N   R E N  t − 1   + ∅ T E C   T E C  t − 1   + ∑ i = 1  p  ∅ i   Δ G H G  t − 1   + ∑ i = 0  q 1  − 1   ω i  Δ N T R  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 2  − 1   λ i  Δ E C D  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 3  − 1   θ i  Δ R E N  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 4  − 1   έ i  Δ T E C  t − 1     + v t  ( τ )       Though through the revision made by Equation (5) , the serial correlation is diluted; however, because of the nature of studied variables Δ N T R  t  , Δ E C D  t  , Δ R E N  t  , Δ T E C  t     and their natural level of associations, the probability of having serial correlations still persists, which can eventually affect the generated outcome. Therefore, to marginalize the serial correlation further, a connection is developed between v t     and Δ N T R  t  , Δ E C D  t  , Δ R E N  t  , Δ T E C  t  ,    while generating the estimated outcome. This restructuring enables to create of separation between ε t     and the estimated results from Δ N T R  t  , Δ E C D  t  , Δ R E N  t  , Δ T E C  t    . Hence, for incorporating this aspect, equation (5)  is further reconfigured, where ECM is incorporated, and is shown as Equation (6) .(6) Q Δ G H G  t   = α ( τ )  + ρ ( τ )  ( G H G  t − 1   − β N T R   ( τ )  N T R  t − 1   − β E C D   ( τ )  E C D  t − 1   − β R E N   ( τ )  R E N  t − 1   − β T E C   ( τ )  T E C  t − 1    )  + ∑ i = 1  p − 1   ∅ i   ( τ )  Δ G H G  t − 1   + ∑ i = 0  q 1  − 1   ω i  ( τ )  Δ N T R  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 2  − 1   λ i  ( τ )  Δ E C D  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 3  − 1   θ i  ( τ )  Δ R E N  t − 1     + ∑ i = 0  q 4  − 1   έ i  ( τ )  Δ T E C  t − 1     + ε t  ( τ )       It should be noted that the nature of the generated outcome of the short run are cumulative that are estimated by connecting the prior value with the subsequent value of GHG by the help of ∅ * = ∑ j = 1  p − 1   ∅ j     . The cumulative values are further calculated for the variables of the current study through ω * = ∑ j = 1  q 1  − 1   ω j     , λ * = ∑ j = 1  q 2  − 1   λ j     , θ * = ∑ j = 1  q 3  − 1   θ j      and έ * = ∑ j = 1  q 4  − 1   έ j     .Moreover, the level of cointegration for the variables, in the long run,is ascertained through β N T R   = ∅ N T R   ρ    , β E C D   = ∅ E C D   ρ    , β R E N   = ∅ R E N   ρ    , and β T E C   = ∅ T E C   ρ    . In addition, the short run's cumulative parameters are computed with the assistance of the Delta Method, which also helps calculate the long run's parameters. Moreover, for the validation of the model, the generated ECM, which is depicted by ρ ,    needs to be negative, whereas its impact needs to be statistically significant. The Wald Test, which is mentioned earlier, is also used that is grounded on the distribution of Chi-Square, which helps in understanding the long-run and short-run asymmetries. The hypotheses of the Wald Test for both long and short run ∅ * ω * , β * a n d ρ *    are:H 0 ∅  = F ∅ *  ( τ )  = f  A g a i n s t  H 1 ∅  = F ∅ *  ( τ )  ≠ f     H 0 ∅  = S ω *  ( τ )  = s  A g a i n s t  H 1 ∅  = S ω *  ( τ )  ≠ s     H 0 ∅  = S β i *   ( τ )  = s  A g a i n s t  H 1 ∅  = S β i *   ( τ )  ≠ s     H 0 ∅  = S ρ i *   ( τ )  = s  A g a i n s t  H 1 ∅  = S ρ i *   ( τ )  ≠ s     In these hypotheses, the F and f are the predefined matrices reflected by h*ps and h*l. Moreover, there is consistency in the nature of S and s, with h*s and h*l, where h denotes the restricted bounds and limits, and i denotes the studied variables (Cho et al., 2015 ). Through the Wald Test, the exploration of the characteristics of the relationships that are either linear or non-linear must be in accordance with the adjustment reported through shifting of the parameters that are occurred in both long-run and short-run estimations. Besides, four different statistical parameters are also utilized, and deployed to assess the groups and individuals. In terms of proxies used to measure the studied variables, the selection was made based on the established reliability and consistency in reflecting the essence of the variables as proven by the existing literature. For NTR, the “Total natural resources rents (% of GDP)” is used; for ECD, “GDP (constant 2015 USD, and unit: billion USD)” is used; for REN, “Amount of renewable energy consumed (unit: million tons)” is used; for TEC, “access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (% of the population)” is used; and lastly for GHG “the emissions kiloton of carbon equivalent” is used. All of these data were extracted from the database of “The World Bank” from 1990 to 2020, whereas the observations were transformed in the quarterly frequency for better prediction. The application of statistical analysis and the subsequent outcome are discussed in the following section.  4 Estimations and results In the initial step, ascertaining the characteristics and behavior of the data is very important, which can be done by exploring its description. Therefore, the Mean, Standard Deviation (SD), and the range of the values within the variables are ascertained. For NTR, it has a mean of 2.760, with an SD of 1.146, whereas all of the values of the observations within this variable are between 1.820 and 3.394, respectively. For ECD, it has a mean of 2.331, with an SD of 0.593, whereas all of the values of the observations within this variable are between 1.867 and 3.489, respectively. For REN, it has a mean of 2.508, with an SD of 0.776, whereas all of the values of the observations within this variable are between 1.883 and 3.157, respectively. For TEC, it has a mean of 1.977, with an SD of 0.954, whereas all of the values of the observations within this variable are between 1.843 and 3.722, respectively. For GHG, it has a mean of 1.993, with an SD of 0.654, whereas all of the values of the observations within this variable are between 1.884 and 3.758, respectively. These descriptive were explored after taking the log of the variables. Additionally, the normality of the variables was also assessed by employing the JB Stats. This test revealed that none of the variables follow the normal distribution. Such an outcome justifies the subsequent application of QARDL, as such non-normal nature could be because of the differences between the quantiles within the variables. The discussed descriptive, and JB Stats outcome is listed in Table 1  . On the other hand, as discussed in the derivation of QARDL, multiple steps are already being taken to dilute the possibility of serial correlation. However, due to the nature of the variables, there is still the probability that they may have higher relationships. Hence to evaluate such probability, the correlations were assessed between the variables. The generated outcome of the correlations is listed in Table 2  , where none of the pair-wise relationships shows any higher values. In the subsequent step, the presence of the unit root is assessed in the dataset. As the requirement of any conventional econometric, every data need to be stationary so that the generated outcome reflects the true nature of relationships. Likewise, the current study also ascertains the presence of variables’ stationarity. In the present study, the stationarity is assessed through “Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)” and Zivot-Andrews (1992) (ZA), which are considered as most frequently utilized tests in recent times (Razzaq et al., 2021b ). The ADF test is limited to ascertaining the structural breaks; therefore, such deficiency is addressed through the ZA test. The findings of both tests confirm and validate the presence of stationarity at the first difference, whereby the variables had a unit root at the level. The outcome of both tests is listed in Table 3  . After the meeting of the initial requirements for the application of QARDL, the technique is finally applied. From the generated outcome, the first thing that needs to be assessed is the values of ECM, which need to be negative and statistically significant, as mentioned earlier. The values of ECM in the current study are found in accordance with the stated conditions and listed in Table 4  . In terms of understanding the relationships between NTR and GHG, the NTR is found to be positive across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects remain significant for all of the quantiles of GHG at a 1% level of significance. This nature and significance show an alarming situation. It means that due to continuous consumption of NTR, the GHG is reportedly increasing as both share positive relationships. This could be because of the regular consumption of NTR, which eventually reduce the reserves of NTR, whereas NTR consumption itself dilutes the capability of ecology to counter the adverse impact of GHG. Thus, China is facing the dual effects of rapid consumption of NTR, leading to an increase inGHG.In terms of understanding the relationships between ECD and GHG, the ECD is found to be positive across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects remain significant for all of the quantiles of GHG at a 1% level of significance. This nature and significance also show an alarming situation. It means that the GHG is reportedly increasing due to continuous improvement by the economy as both share positive relationships. This could be because of the regular consumption of resources, excessive production, and consumption, which eventually increase GHG and dilute ecology's capability to counter GHG's adverse impact. Thus, China is facing asituation where ECD is being done at the cost of ecology, leading to increased GHG levels. In terms of understanding the relationships between REN and GHG, REN is found to be negative across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects were insignificant at lower and middle-lower quantiles; however, they became significant for the rest of the higher quantiles of GHG, at a 1% level of significance. This nature and significance show an encouraging situation. Since REN are the initiatives that require time from capitalization to actual performance, they remain insignificant at the lower quantiles. However, as the potential benefits of the REN started reaping, the REN started showing its potential to counter the GHG. This is reflected through the improvement in significance at the higher quantiles of GHG. Thus, China is facing a situation where REN could contribute to reducingGHG.In terms of understanding the relationships between TEC and GHG, the TEC is found to be negative across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects were insignificant at lower and middle-lower quantiles; however, it became significant for the rest of the higher quantiles of GHG, at a 1% significance level. This nature and significance show an encouraging situation. Since TEC are the initiatives that are being taken to improve the quality of technology, which complies with the principles of clean and green, it requires time from capitalization to actual performance; therefore, they remain insignificant at the lower quantiles. However, as the potential benefits of the TEC started reaping, the TEC started showing its potential to counter the GHG. This is reflected through the improvement in significance at the higher quantiles of GHG. Thus, China is facing a situation where REN could contribute to reducingGHG.These results are for the long run and are listed in Table 4 . The nature and significance of the relationship in the short run show similar results reported in the long run. For instance, for NTR and GHG in the short run, the NTR is found to be positive across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects remain significant for all of the quantiles of GHG at a 1% level of significance. Similarly, for ECDand GHG, the ECD is found to be positive across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects remain significant for all of the quantiles of GHG at a 1% level of significance. Likewise, for REN and GHG, the REN is found to be negative across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects were insignificant at the lower quantilesof GHG, became significant at the middle quantiles of GHG at a 1% level of significance, and then again became insignificant at the higher quantile of GHG in the short run. Moreover,for TEC and GHG, the TEC is found to be negative across all of the quantiles of GHG. In terms of significance, the effects were insignificant at the lower quantilesof GHG, became significant at the middle quantiles of GHG, at a 1% level of significance, and then again became insignificant at the higher quantile of GHG in the short run. The variation in the significance of both REN and TEC is due to the short-run nature of the relationships. These results are for the short run and are listed in Table 4 . In the subsequent step, the nature of asymmetries is assessed by applyingtheWald Test. Though the JB Stats clearly rule out the presence of normal distribution. However, one limitation of JB stats is the evaluation of normality at the intercept of the variables. Besides, the presence of asymmetrical relationships is validated by the Wald Test through the outcome reported in Table 5  . In the last step, the direction of the causality among the independent variables with the quantiles of the dependent variable is assessed through the application of “Granger Causality.” The outcome reported in Table 6   clearly indicates the presence of dual directional causality among GHG and NTR, GHG and ECD, GHG and REN, and TEC and REN. This is because when there is a depletion of NTR, the GHG will strengthen, whereas GHG itself reduces the NTR. For ECD and GHG, increasing ECD will increase the GHG; however, increasing GHG will urge to have a step that can reduce its level without compromising the ECD; thus, it eventually improves the ECD. For both REN and TEC, it reduces the GHG, whereas increased GHG will highlight the importance of REN and TEC, thus will urge initiatives to counter the GHG. These results are listed in Table 6 .  5 Conclusion and recommendations Despite China's massive success in industrialization and being a “global factory,” environmental disaster is just around the corner, whereby climate change is a significant risk factor for China's development and prosperity. On the other hand, China's economy has been slowing down over the past decade after decades of rapid expansion due to demographic challenges and a precipitous drop in productivity growth. Thus, rising economic imbalances constitute a significant drag on China's economy's potential for expansion. Thus, understanding the forces and reducing the imbalance between development and ecology is imperative. The depletion of NTR would lead to rising GHG, while the absence of NTR would also mean that an economy would be deprived of the NTR rent. On the other hand, the use of REN can be a handy alternative to solve the ever-evolving cauldron of development without harming the environment, whereas TEC can play a more holistic role in providing cleaner energy with a reduced carbon footprint and working to develop viable solutions to reduce waste. For this purpose, the present study is conducted to ascertain the role of NTR, ECD, REN, and TEC on GHG through a cutting-edge time-series estimation technique of a Quantile Autoregressive Distribution Lag (QARDL). The reported results revealed the positive relationships of NTR and ECD with GHG, whereas REN and TEC are found to reduce the level of GHG. Based on the findings, there are various implications that the current study proposes. Despite the expansion, since the Chinese economy has shown a declining trend in terms of its growth, therefore, at a first stance it is recommended to take sustainable initiatives so that the imbalance between ecology and development is sustainably balanced. Moreover, since both REN and TEC started to reap benefits in the long run, these initiatives need to be taken immediately so that future ecological health is preserved and sustained. Moreover, the government needs to create an atmosphere where private partnership from the organization or the general public is encouraged. This will enable the government to enhance environmental health from bottom to top. Based on the limitations, it is proposed that more sustainable forces require exploration to counter GHG. Moreover, since the variables are found to be non-linear, the current study's findings need to be validated through other non-linear-based techniques like NARDL. Moreover, the current model must be tested in other high-polluting countries like the US, Russia, and India. Lastly, there is a need to explore the studies that evaluate the relevancy of more policy-related phenomena like the rule of law, governance, compliance towards policies, etc.  Funding Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2023R261 ), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia .This research is funded by Thuongmai University, Hanoi, Vietnam .
