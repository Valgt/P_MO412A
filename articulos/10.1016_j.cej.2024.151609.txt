                  Food waste is a common organic solid waste generated worldwide in significant quantities, and its proper treatment and management practices are hindered by high moisture content. However, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technique uses food waste moisture as the reaction medium and converts it into an environmentally friendly coal-like product, i.e. hydrochar. Food waste conversion to hydrochar via HTC has many benefits but a complex mechanism because each component of food waste has its own structural and chemical properties and interacts with the other components/chemical species during the process involving heterogeneous reactions, which significantly impacts the physio-chemical properties of food waste hydrochar (FWH). Due to high surface area, stability, carbon content, and regeneration capability, FWH is an attractive choice for numerous environmental applications, helps to achieve various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and supports carbon neutrality and a circular economy. Given the importance of this topic, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the advancements in HTC technology for producing hydrochar from food waste, as well as the carbonization mechanism of each constituent of food waste. The study also highlights the significance of different modification and activation methods used to enhance the primary drawback of FWH. We primarily intend to assess the application of FWH in accomplishing several SDGs, i.e., SDG 6.3 (pollutant removal from wastewater), SDG 7 (generate clean energy), SDG 13 (combat climate change, i.e., CO2 sequestration), SDG 15.3 (land and soil restoration). Our primary focus is to evaluate the future perspective of FWH via CO2 emission assessment, life cycle assessment, and techno-economic assessment, along with challenges in commercializing FWH, and propose significant avenues for future research. These insights are essential for determining the economic viability and environmental advantages of FWH as a valuable resource to accomplish several SDGs, achieve carbon neutrality, and promote a circular economy.

Graphical abstract       Food waste is a common organic solid waste generated worldwide in significant quantities, and its proper treatment and management practices are hindered by high moisture content. However, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technique uses food waste moisture as the reaction medium and converts it into an environmentally friendly coal-like product, i.e. hydrochar. Food waste conversion to hydrochar via HTC has many benefits but a complex mechanism because each component of food waste has its own structural and chemical properties and interacts with the other components/chemical species during the process involving heterogeneous reactions, which significantly impacts the physio-chemical properties of food waste hydrochar (FWH). Due to high surface area, stability, carbon content, and regeneration capability, FWH is an attractive choice for numerous environmental applications, helps to achieve various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and supports carbon neutrality and a circular economy. Given the importance of this topic, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the advancements in HTC technology for producing hydrochar from food waste, as well as the carbonization mechanism of each constituent of food waste. The study also highlights the significance of different modification and activation methods used to enhance the primary drawback of FWH. We primarily intend to assess the application of FWH in accomplishing several SDGs, i.e., SDG 6.3 (pollutant removal from wastewater), SDG 7 (generate clean energy), SDG 13 (combat climate change, i.e., CO2  sequestration), SDG 15.3 (land and soil restoration). Our primary focus is to evaluate the future perspective of FWH via CO2  emission assessment, life cycle assessment, and techno-economic assessment, along with challenges in commercializing FWH, and propose significant avenues for future research. These insights are essential for determining the economic viability and environmental advantages of FWH as a valuable resource to accomplish several SDGs, achieve carbon neutrality, and promote a circular economy.

The global annual production of food waste accounts for about 1.3 billion tons (approximately 13.8 % of global food production), making food waste one of the major forms of organic solid waste worldwide [1] . Food waste has worldwide social, financial, and environmental consequences of approximately 1 trillion USD annually, including environmental costs of 700 billion USD and social costs of 900 billion USD [2] . Further, on average, developed nations contribute more (680 billion USD) than developing nations (310 billion USD) [3] . Moreover, food loss and waste generate about 8–10 % of global greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions [4] . Considering the alarming rise in global food loss and waste, this problem has been added to the list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) regarding “sustainable consumption and production patterns” [1] . The proper segregation and management of food waste from other types of garbage, transforming it into more valuable resources, including carbon materials, biochemicals, and biofuels via the use of advanced technologies, and maximising its potential can contribute to accomplishing SDGs, achieving carbon neutrality and promoting a circular economy [5,6] . Food waste is characterized by its high moisture and organic content (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and lignocellulosic compounds), among other distinguishing attributes. Biological and thermochemical conversion are the two main value-added treatment approaches to food waste. However, biological conversion (e.g. landfill and anaerobic digestion) is limited by large land use, long processing times and release of GHGs (e.g. CO2 , CH4 ) during bioconversion, which seriously challenges the SDGs and carbon neutrality [7] . The major thermochemical conversion, i.e., incineration and pyrolysis, face the major problem of high moisture content of food waste, which requires pre-drying to become energy and cost-intensive [8] . Food waste contains a lot of vicinal and bound water and has a high latent heat, so it can be converted directly into a variety of value-added products without pre-treatment (drying) using hydrothermal techniques like hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), which has many benefits, i.e. cost-effective method due to mild operating conditions (temperature < 350 °C and pressures (2–10 MPa)), low maintenance cost, less energy consumption and fast reaction, and high conversion rate [5,9] . HTC occurs at temperature and pressure below the subcritical region, and subcritical water has a low dielectric constant, making it easier for food waste components to dissociate [10] . Concurrently, there is a significant shift in the solventization behaviour of subcritical water, due to a rise in the ion product or self-ionization constant [6] . The elevated levels of H3 O+  and OH–  found in subcritical water can serve as an effective catalytic medium to facilitate various chemical reactions, especially hydrolysis (cleavage of linkage bonds in biomacromolecule) and aromatization (formation of coal-like structures, i.e., hydrochar) [6,9,11] . HTC uses the water content of food waste as the reaction substrate, resulting in moderate reaction conditions, a faster treatment cycle, and the elimination of secondary emissions while adding value to the product [12] . Hydrochar production requires less energy and costs than biochar, and the economic study has confirmed its profitability and feasibility [13] . Hydrochar exhibits unique physical, chemical, and biological properties, including a high specific surface area and pore volume, high mineral content, enhanced surface functional groups, long-term stability, etc. (Fig. 1  ) [14–17] . Owing to their physicochemical properties, several articles have summarized the application of food waste hydrochar (FWH) in multiple fields to address various SDGs such as adsorbent in the treatment of polluted water (SDG 6.3: improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse) [18–21] , as a solid fuel and in electrochemical devices to generate clean energy (SDG 7: affordable and clean energy) [8,22–24] , as a CO2  remover to contribute to the fight against climate change (SDG 13: combat climate change) [25–28] , as a soil quality improver to aid in the land restoration (SDG 15.3: end desertification and restore degraded land), and increase agricultural productivity, thereby addressing hunger (SDG 2: zero hunger) [29,30] . Moreover, the United Nations established 17 SDGs for 2030, with 169 associated targets in September 2015, and 193 nations endorsed this initiative to foster global improvements and enhance the quality of life [1] . It has been more than eight years since then, and significant work still needs to be accomplished to reach the stated objectives (Fig. 2  ). Moreover, compared to biochar, FWH is still in the early stages in terms of optimization of production processes custom design for specific applications due to limited porosity, surface area and functional groups [5,15,17] . Several recent reviews have summarized the latest advancements in HTC technology [31] , the influence of hydrothermal properties on product yield [32] , the reaction mechanism in HTC of food waste [33]  and recently [12]  discussed FWH for its chemical structure, carbonization mechanism, and application as biofuel. So far, there has been a lack of comprehensive evaluations that have extensively examined carbonization mechanisms considering each component of food waste and the activation/modification methods to overcome the limitation of FWH (i.e. yield percentage, porosity, surface area and functional groups). The novelty of this paper is the detailed discussion (first time) on GHGs emissions assessment, life cycle assessment and techno-economic assessment of FWH due to their crucial role in shaping the future trajectory of hydrochar research. In view of the above discussion, the present review was undertaken using the following five objectives: (1) explore the mechanism of food waste conversion to hydrochar via HTC; (2) highlight the significance of various modification and activation strategies to improve the potential of FWH; (3) briefly delineate the application and performance of FWH to achieve SDGs via pollutants removal (SDG 6.3), solid fuel (SDG 7), GHGs control (SDG 13), and land and soil restoration (SDG 15.3); (4) summarize the future perspective of FWH via CO2  emission assessment, life cycle assessment and techno-economic assessment; and (5) elaborate challenges in commercializing FWH and propose recommendations for future research directions.  2 Food waste to hydrochar: Hydrothermal carbonization mechanism HTC is recognised as an environment-friendly process because of its operation at a comparatively low temperature (<350 °C) and pressure (up to 6.0 MPa, under subcritical conditions) using water as a solvent [34] . Moreover, the procedure does not require pre-drying, involves relatively mild operational conditions, has a high operation feasibility, emits lower CO2  from power plants and has comparatively lower energy consumption [12] . The HTC process takes place in the subcritical region, leading to the formation of different products, i.e., a solid (hydrochar), a liquid (mixture of bio-oil and process water), and a synthesis gas (H2 , CO2 , CO), making up 95 % of the total volume (Fig. 3 a ). The HTC process primarily breaks down organic wastes into simpler light chains, mainly by ion-product reactions at autogenous pressure and elevated subcritical temperature (Fig. 3 b). Concurrently, water readily penetrates the solid via the pores, breaks down the rigid structure of these polymers, and the resulting solid is called hydrochar. Water is a natural, non-toxic, affordable and ecologically friendly reactant. During HTC, the dielectric constant and density of the inherent water available in the food waste is decreased at the subcritical temperature range, converting it into an organic solvent. The reduction of dielectric constant facilitates 1) the dissolution of non-polar polymers via reducing water polarity and 2) the enhancement of acidic (H3 O+ ) and basic ions (OH− ) via weakened hydrogen bonds, therefore promoting acid-catalyzed reactions of organic compounds [12,35] . Since subcritical water improves organic compound solubility and reactivity, it speeds decomposition and turns organic waste into a solid, hydrophobic, coal-like hydrochar and nutrient-rich liquid (process water). 2.1 Lignocellulosic portion Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are known as lignocellulosic components. The depolymerization reaction converts cellulose and hemicellulose into their saccharide, which is later transformed into various sugar molecules, such as glucose, xylose, glucose, galactose, via hydrolysis (Fig. 4  ). Cellulose degrades quickly at water's critical point, whereas low-molecular-weight oligomers are challenging to hydrolyze. Futher, hemicellulose is also quickly hydrolyzed, and about 95 % of hemicellulose monomers can be extracted at 34.5 MPa and 200–230 °C [36] . Lignin is either depolymerized and hydrolyzed to phenolic and aldehyde compounds at 250 °C in subcritical water and repolymerized with other compounds to form hydrochar or directly carbonized (unhydrolyzed lignin) into hydrochar [37] . The reaction between phenols, amine and aldehyde (mannich reaction) results in the formation of mannich bases, which take part in N-containing hydrochar formation [38] .  2.2 Carbohydrates portion The transformation of carbohydrates involves depolymerization (carbohydrates to saccharide) and hydrolysis (saccharide to sugar molecules) reaction. These small sugar molecules further undergo a series of dehydration, decarboxylation and rearrangement reactions to produce aldehyde compounds, organic acids and reactive intermediates (e.g. furfural, furan, 5-HMF, and their derivatives) [6,39]  (Fig. 4 ). For example, the pyranose form of xylose (a pentose sugar from hemicellulose) converts to furfural, forming furfuraldehyde. The two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, undergo isomerization [40]  and via lobry de Bruyn–Alberda van ekenstein transformation, lead to the formation of multiple forms, which transform into furans and furfural [9] . Moreover, isomerization of glucose to fructose is common in subcritical water, and the reverse is impossible. Fructose produces more dehydration products, such as 5-HMF, while glucose decomposes into acetaldehyde, acetone, and other compounds [41] . Further increase in the HTC temperature and residence time decreases the fructose content [12] .  2.3 Protein portion Protein break down into amino acids, and their subsequent transformation is a function of HTC temperature. Initially, amino acids undergo deamination to produce organic acids and, at high temperatures, amine compounds via decarboxylation reactions [42] . The organic acids produced from both sugar molecules and protein increase the solution acidity, which initiates the positive feedback mechanism of the hydrothermal reaction, i.e. sugar decomposition into reducing sugars and protein hydrolysis to create amino nitrogenous chemicals through the maillard process, which combine to form heterocyclic compounds by dehydration. The amine joins aromatic clusters generated from furan, furfural polymerize, phenolic, and aldehyde compounds in hydrochar by condensation reactions [34]  (Fig. 4 ). Hydrochar with low nitrogen content is obtained at high temperatures, and biomass undergoes extensive dehydration, decarboxylation, and deamination; however, lignocellulosic biomass rich in carbohydrates can significantly enrich nitrogen via millard and mannich reactions in hydrochar at moderate temperatures (e.g., 180–240 °C) [38] . Protein breakdown requires a minimum temperature of 150 °C; however, feeds with high protein content (<30 % wt basis) need a higher temperature of 220 °C [12] . The hydrolysis of carbohydrates is faster than proteins because glycosidic bonds are weaker than peptide bonds [34] .  2.4 Lipid portion Lipids disintegrate into fatty acids and glycerol hydrolyzed by dehydration and decarboxylation to create hydrocarbon molecules to hydrochar via polymerization reactions (Fig. 4 ). The high temperature of HTC decreased the polarity of water, which increased the solubility of fats and oil, and in a supercritical state, fats and water become entirely compatible. The glycerol can undergo secondary decomposition to generate alcohol and aldehyde compounds [6] . During HTC, carbohydrates contribute mainly to produce hydrochar, while proteins particularly increase the N-heterocyclic functional groups [43] . Lipid can potentially inhibit the reaction between proteins and carbohydrates, playing a crucial role in HTC processing. Further, they do not participate in the carbonization reaction, but their products are possibly adsorbed onto the hydrochar surface. The carbohydrates in the feedstock improve the fixed carbon content and the homogeneity of the hydrochar, resulting in their better combustion performance. However, a minor effect on the improvement of the fuel quality of hydrochar was observed with increased proteins. High lipids resulted in a lower ignition temperature and lower combustion activation energy for the hydrochar [43] . Therefore, significant variations in the physico-chemical properties of hydrochar produced from different types of food wastes have been observed (Table 1  ).   3 Food waste hydrochar: Activation and modification 3.1 Activation Hydrochar produced after HTC processing has a smaller pore structure, limited surface area and non-specified functional groups; however, physical and chemical activation can enhance these features. Physical treatments are cost-effective and environment-friendly approaches for improving the hydrochar textural properties; however, chemical activation treatments exhibit higher global warming potential [44] . 3.1.1 Physical activation Steam, air, and CO2  are widely employed activation agents during physical activation. Steam-activated engineered chars had more O-functional groups and improved porosity [44] . CO2  activation is favoured because of its low reactivity and simple handling even at higher operating temperatures (>700 °C), making activation control straightforward. However, CO2  emissions threaten carbon neutrality during CO2  activation. Physically activated hydrochar exhibits lower surface area (<1000 m2 /g), total pore volume (0.7 cm3 /g) and yield (<30 %) [45] , however low production and operation cost, high deployment feasibility, and minimum corrosion to activating reactor, making it a suitable choice for producing engineered hydrochar with broad practical and commercial applications.  3.1.2 Chemical activation Hydrochar is chemically activated by impregnating it with an acid, basic, or salt (e.g., H3 PO4 , HNO3 , H2 O2 , KOH, NaOH, K2 CO3 , ZnCl2 , and MgCl2 ) in an inert gas environment [44] . This approach outperforms physical activation in yield, porosity, and energy consumption because of its low operating temperature and short process time [25,46] . However, chemical activation has limitations and considerable environmental impacts, such as ZnCl2  produces zinc-heavy metal-loaded wash water after activation, and KOH generates GHGs and takes a lot of water for impregnation and washing [47] . Hence, to build a realistic and sustainable activation method, it is necessary to consider its environmental impact throughout its life cycle. Chemically activated hydrochar can exhibit a surface area > 3,000 m2 /g, and a total pore volume of about 3.0 cm3 /g [48] , but the chemical agent, operating temperature, and raw material composition are the limiting factors.   3.2 Surface modification Besides textural features, the engineered hydrochar's surface chemistry, defined by functional groups including O–, N–, and S–rich groups, crucially affects its functionality and performance in diverse applications. Oxygenated functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl on porous carbon can boost their ability to remove heavy metals from wastewater and adsorb atmospheric CO2 [26] . O-functional groups can be incorporated into hydrochar via surface oxidation with HNO3 , KOH, H2 O2  (increases –OH and –COOH) [49] . Similarly, the N–content of hydrochar improves its CO2  adsorption capacity. The nitrogen groups provide active basic sites that facilitate the interaction between CO2  molecules and the carbon surface. Two common techniques of incorporating nitrogen groups include post-treating carbons with amine or ammonia (cause pore blockage of porous carbons), and using high nitrogen-containing precursors [50] . The presence of lone-pair electrons on nitrogen may significantly influence the electron transfer properties of carbon compounds. Furthermore, the interaction between the lone-pair electrons of nitrogen and the graphitic π-bonds of carbon distorts the carbon structure. This distortion results in the formation of additional pores and accessible active sites. Consequently, it enhances the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors [51] . Yue et al. [26]  reported that N-doped porous bio-carbons from strawberry-derived hydrochar activated by KOH exhibited excellent recyclability and stability, moderate heat of adsorption, quick adsorption kinetics, reasonable CO2  over N2  selectivity, and superior dynamic CO2  capture capacity. N, O, P, S, and halogen groups may be doped by dual or tri-doping procedures to enhance carbon surface chemistry [50] . Ammonia, urea, and polypyrrole were initially utilised for N–doping in porous materials since they were inexpensive but unsustainable. Therefore, they are replaced with renewable organic waste (food waste) as its protein self-dopes heteroatoms like N, O, S, and/or C [49] . Dual and tri-doping enhance synergy and improve rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries' performance, oxygen reduction reactions, and supercapacitors [52–54] .   4 Food waste hydrochar: Sustainable Development Goals, carbon neutrality, and circular economy 4.1 Greenhouse gases removal Numerous research studies have demonstrated the utilization of FWH in carbon sequestration (Table 2  ). The pore structure and surface chemistry of the pristine FWH are insufficient for efficiently collecting a substantial quantity of CO2 . However, modifying hydrochar using acid or alkaline activation, heteroatom doping, and metal impregnation improves their potential for GHGs removal [25,68] . The CO2  adsorption capacity of the untreated garlic peel hydrochar was 1.65 mmol/g, but following KOH activation, it increased to 4.22 mmol/g [20] . The improved efficiency is attributed to its high surface area and porosity, i.e., 947 m2 /g and 0.17 cm3 /g, respectively, then the pristine version, i.e., 306 m2 /g and 0.51 cm3 /g. However, selecting appropriate activation conditions is of utmost significance. Alkali improves CO2  adsorption by increasing O-functional groups of carbon framework. Besides O-functional groups, pyridinic–N may offer hydrochar a lone pair of electrons, alkalizing its surface and enhancing CO2  adsorption. FWH can also absorb methane (CH4 ) and nitrogen, therefore limiting CO2  adsorption. The high CO2  selectivity of heteroatom doping with hydroxyl, amine amid, pyridine, and sulphoxide functional groups can overcome this drawback [69] . The functional groups containing nitrogen, such as amine– or imine–N, pyrrolic–N, quaternary–N, and graphitic–N, can enhance CO2  chemisorption. The char activated with ammonium sulfate provided sulfur groups, improving CO2  capturing efficiency [70] . The micropores, O-functional groups, N–functional groups, and aromaticity of FWH majorly contribute to CO2  adsorption. The significance of pore size in the physical sorption of CO2  surpasses other factors, such as specific surface area, total pore volume, and pore structure. The pore size in the micropore category (<2 nm) exhibits high CO2  adsorption capacity via a pore-filling mechanism at low pressure [71] . Li et al. [72]  reported that CO2  adsorption manifests via surface covering under elevated adsorption pressures. Therefore, a high surface-area porous hydrochar is preferable for a high-pressure adsorption mechanism, while micropore-size pores hydrochar is suitable for low-pressure adsorption. Nitrogen doping also increases the porosity of hydrochar. The metal oxide nanoparticles facilitate the physical adsorption potential of hydrochar and CO2  at metal sites surrounded by hydroxyl groups and N–atoms [73] . Hydrochar gained O-functional groups, mainly –OH, by alkali treatment, which bind CO2  via hydrogen bond. Lewis acid-base interactions also promote CO2  and adsorbent material covalent coordination bonding. Nitrogen-containing polymers improve hydrochar alkalinity and electron density, strengthening Lewis acid-base interaction [72] .  4.2 Solid fuel The polymeric compounds found in food waste that possess the most excellent heating values are lignin > cellulose > hemicellulose > extractives > ash [76] . HTC primarily eliminates holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) and increases the lignin content, a natural binding agent, throughout the densification process. Lignin exhibits higher thermal stability than holocellulosic components, and food waste with high lignin content produces a hydrochar with good yield and better properties as solid fuel (Table 3  ). The determination of the O/C ratio in food waste, based on its elemental composition, serves two purposes: assessing the stability of the fuel and differentiating it from other carbonized materials. A lower ratio of O/C signifies a more excellent heating value in the context of solid fuel. Saqib et al. [55]  compared the higher heating value (HHV) (MJ/kg) of FWH with respect to O/C ratio and observed a high HHV value (31.0) at a low O/C ratio (0.17) and a high O/C ratio (0.29) shown a decreased HHV value (20.81). Further, fuel with low H/C and O/C ratios is advantageous because of the reduced energy loss, smoke, and water vapour produced during combustion. Fuel ratio is a fixed carbon to volatile matter ratio, used to express the combustibility of solid fuel. FWH exhibits a lower fuel ratio than raw materials, suggesting hydrochar is more easily combustible [77] . Khan et al. [78]  found FWH fuel ratios of 0.014 to 0.27, substantially lower than coal (1.46 to 7.10). However, a high fuel ratio (≥2) may cause incomplete combustion and flammability, therefore leading to inefficiencies within the heating system [79] . Energy yield measures thermochemical energy recovery by multiplying hydrochar yield by energy density, and these rely on source material composition and HTC reaction temperature. Temperature increases devolatilization and dehydration, lowering hydrochar yield, but sample reactivity increases and results in hydrochar with high energy densification, HHV, and lower corresponding temperature. The ignition temperature determines how quickly a fuel will ignite, and hydrochar exhibits better ignition performance than its raw material. Burnout is the highest temperature at which the fuel undergoes complete combustion. A higher calculated combustibility index value indicates a greater capacity for combustion [80] . FWH yields are comparable to lignocellulosic biomass/wastes. For example, at 190–260 °C, rotting apple waste yielded 36–39 % hydrochar, apple chip waste 27 %, and grape waste 38–45 % [58] . Nevertheless, the low yield is a prevalent obstacle in FWH. Co-HTC has the potential to address this issue while simultaneously improving physical and chemical properties, energy output, and combustion behaviour. Wu et al. [8]  incorporated corn stover in food waste (1:1) to create co-hydrochar, with an energy yield of up to 71.1 % and a carbon retention rate of 68.9 %, similar to lignite. Further, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Friedman methods found that co-hydrochar had a lower average activation energy of 128.5 kJ/mol and 114.3 kJ/mol, respectively, making it suitable material for energy applications. Moreover, the reduction in hydrochar yield can be mitigated by increasing the number of process water cycles. The process water cycling promotes polymerization and condensation reactions, resulting in increased size of cross-linked microspheres on the surface of FWH. Therefore, FWH (produced at 220 °C and 4 cycles of process water) exhibited a high yield value (47.25 %), high energy yield (71.33 %) and better carbon retention (70.10 %) and significantly lower fuel ratio (0.57), suggesting its better combustibility [24] .  4.3 Soil restoration and crop improvement Hydrochar exhibits an ample capacity to store nutrients and water, further enhancing soil fertility and microbial activity and encouraging carbon sequestration. Hydrochar use in crop improvement depends on food waste composition, HTC production conditions, and soil type, notably sandy, fertile, clay, and loamy soil. FWH can enhance soil porosity, reduce bulk density and encourage the development and stability of soil aggregates [92] . Fresh hydrochar is hydrophobic and has few polar functional groups. However, hydrochar is oxidised in soil to form hydrophilic molecules with carboxylic and phenolic functional groups that may retain nutrients and water and exchange cations better [93] . A small quantity of orange peel-based hydrochar (5 wt%) increased the water-holding capacity [29] . Hydrochar extracted from beetroot chips promoted pore germination and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungal colonization [94] . Hydrochar has more aliphatic carbon atoms than aromatic ones, making it less stable than biochar and more susceptible to microbial digestion in soil. In addition, the C/N ratio of raw material, lignin concentration, and availability of more hydrophilic functional groups all have a role in the degradation of hydrochar [95,96] . However, Schulze et al. [30]  found that temperature and reaction time influence hydrochar stability more than lignin content. Many studies have examined biochar for soil improvement, but few on FWH.  4.4 Pollutants removal Hydrochar exhibits less surface area than pyrochar, but has abundant O-functionality, which enhances its adsorption capability for inorganic and organic contaminants (Table 5 ). Hydrochar-based adsorbent material is the most economically feasible and effective resource for dye decontamination. Hydrochar can adsorb both anionic and cationic dyes; however, cationic dyes have shown more efficacy [97] . Nascimento et al. [98]  observed a maximum uptake capacity of 19.6, 8.7 and 4.0 mg/g of Reactive Turquoise, Reactive Gray and Remazol Yellow Gold dye using orange peel-based hydrochar. Coffee ground hydrochar exhibited a maximum adsorption efficiency of 34.9 mg/g for methylene blue dye [43] . Hydrochar produced by HTC of food waste at 250 °C shown to be an effective adsorbent for removing Acridine Orange (79.36 mg/g) and Rhodamine 6G (71.42 mg/g) from polluted water [20] . Fernandez et al. [54]  reported higher efficiency of chemically (with phosphoric acid) and thermally activated orange peel-based hydrochar than pristine hydrochar. Ozone treatment, chemical activation, one-pot synthesis, acid etching, magnetic modification, functionality doping (nitrogen, amine, polyamine carboxylate), and co–HTC, are various post-activation methods for hydrochar which significantly improved the adsorption efficiency (47 mg/g to 5181 mg/g) [99] . ZnCl2 , NaOH, K2 CO3 , H3 PO4 , other bases, acids, oxidising agents, and salts have significantly expanded the surface areas of hydrochar [100] . The maximum amount of diclofenac absorbed by Zizipus mautitian  fruit-based hydrochar occurred via pore-filling processes. Various hydrochars have been made from diverse food wastes, including saccarum, tomato peel, avocado seed, and watermelon peel, which efficiently eliminated various contaminants by enhancing carboxyl, hydroxyl, and oxygen functional groups and via π-interaction, Van der Waals force, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding [101] .  4.5 Electrochemical devices The research has shown that hydrochar has considerable potential as a material for electrochemical devices, including batteries and supercapacitors, owing to its stability, porosity, aromaticity, surface area, and polarity [104] . Hydrochar-based supercapacitors exhibit high power density and cycle stability. Activated carbon has a high specific capacitance due to its strong conductivity and large surface area. Nevertheless, the high manufacturing costs limit large-scale production. Food waste might avoid the energy-intensive pre-drying process using HTC, producing hydrochar with a high carbon content and an abundance of functional groups suitable as an optimal precursor for activated carbon production. Venne et al. [53]  prepared activated carbon from food waste by HTC process and KOH activation. The food waste-derived activated carbon exhibited a notable specific capacitance of 235 F/g at 1.0 A/g, indicating its ability to store significant electrical charge. Additionally, the activated carbon showed exceptional energy retention capacity, with a retention capacity of 98 % even after undergoing 10,000 cycles. Therefore, high-moisture food waste can be converted into activated carbon with larger pore architectures and functional groups via HTC combined with chemical activation, and starch is essential for forming carbonyl groups and micropores in activated carbon. Pyrrolic–N, micropores, and edge defects in activated carbon can be produced by protein and lignocellulose components of food waste [52] . Pyrrolic–N enhances the specific capacitance of activated carbon from 311 F/g to 327 F/g at 0.5 A/g due to the formation of micropores and a capacitance retention rate of 79.8 %. The electrochemical performance of activated carbon depends on its pore and carbon structure and heteroatomic atom distribution. A porous network facilitating ion transit and storage, edge defect-enrich increases active sites and charge transfer efficiency and functional groups, primarily oxygen and nitrogen, increase the wettability of the electrode and, therefore, contribute pseudocapacitance through faradaic reaction [52] . Wang et al. [105]  prepared the activated carbon from the orange peel with a specific capacitance of 434 F/g at an applied current density of 1.0 A/g. The electrochemical performance of food waste-based activated carbon is influenced by the presence of starch, lignocellulose, and protein, which modify the carbon structure, porosity, and functional groups. Xiao et al. [106]  reported the generation of carbonaceous microspheres, esters, and hydroxyl groups by increasing the cellulose and hemicellulose content in orange peel. Food waste high in starch may produce activated carbon with improved capacitance retention. However, more research is required to understand how modification parameters, including residence time, temperature, and type of activator, impact the electrochemical performance of activated carbon produced from different food waste. Considering the economic aspects of producing electrode materials derived from food waste via HTC in conjunction with an activation process is crucial.   5 Greenhouse gases emission assessment 5.1 Carbon dioxide The addition of FWH to soil results in the release of CO2  because it includes labile carbon (quantity is temperature dependent). Hydrochar generated at temperatures < 200 °C contains more labile carbon and emits a more significant amount of CO2  compared to hydrochar produced at temperatures ≥ 200 °C. Further, the H/C ratio indicates hydrochar stability and associated CO2  emission. A high H/C ratio value indicates the low stability of hydrochar against degradation. These conditions favour high CO2  emission after application in the soil, providing extra substrates for soil microorganisms such as actinomycetes, fungi, N-fixing bacteria, and methanogens [5] . Jafari Tarf et al. [107]  reported that olive oil solid waste hydrochar positively affects the soil's biological properties and creates short-term nutrient traffic. The soil texture and composition also significantly impact the emission of CO2  and other GHGs (CH4  and N2 O). GHGs emissions from the soils amended with hydrochar exhibited variation among paddy soils, eroded agricultural soils, and grasslands [92] . High organic carbon of hydrochar can modify the characteristics of native soil organic carbon via physical interactions. FWH has a unique, organic carbon characteristic because it has a wide range of materials with distinctive compositions and concentrations. Hydrochar significantly impacts the diversity of the microorganism in soil [108] . The presence of organic acids, including acetic, lactic, furanic, and formic, on the hydrochar surface makes it acidic, which increases the abundance of Acidobacteria by 5– to 6–fold than the control [109] . The combination of hydrochar, fertiliser inputs, and elevated moisture levels leads to significant CO2  emissions from the soil [110] . Kammann et al. [111]  reported 20 times higher CO2  fluxes from soil amended with the beet hydrochar than control. Numerous studies have provided empirical evidence regarding the multifaceted behaviour of hydrochar in soil for GHGs emissions, highlighting three distinct aspects. One facet elucidates that the hydrochar enhanced the GHGs (CO2 , CH4  and N2 O) emissions. Another facet underscores the hydrochar's potential in mitigating GHGs emissions. Lastly, a third facet acknowledges the irrelevance of this aspect. The use of modified or activated hydrochar before its application in soil and washing can be a mitigation strategy to decrease CO2  emissions, as these practices remove water-soluble organics like acetic, formic, and glycolic acid, which microorganisms can mineralize easily [30] . No specific study has evaluated the role of FWH in GHGs emissions.  5.2 Methane Hydrochar contains more labile carbon and decomposes quicker, facilitating more methanogenic precursors for methanogenesis and associated increases in soil CH4  emissions [112] . Further, soil with high nitrogen content enhances CH4  emission by inhibiting CH4  oxidation. Ji et al. [113]  found that rice straw hydrochar in paddy soil enhanced cumulative CH4  emission by 150–430 % owing to labile organic carbon release and microbial community shifts to CH4 –producing groups (e.g., Euryarchaeota , Janibacter , Anaeromyxobacter , Anaerolinea , and Sporacetigenium ). Mørkved et al. [114]  reported high CH4  emissions from soil amended with beet hydrochar due to increased oxygen consumption, which led to an anaerobic microsite. In contrast, hydrochar changes the soil water content, which regulates O2  and CH4  diffusion by reducing soil compaction and improving soil aeration, which reduces CH4  emission, a well-known aeration effect. Therefore, the amount of hydrochar added to the soil is a regulating factor in CH4  emission.  5.3 Nitrous oxide The N2 O generation from the soil is primarily regulated by fungi rather than bacteria, especially under acidic conditions [115] . Therefore, hydrocarbon application positively impacts N2 O generation owing to the microbial community shift to fungi and simultaneously exerting a detrimental impact on bacteria [108] . Hydrochar-induced stimulation of fungi was also observed by many researchers [116] . In contrast, the hydrochar has a high content of labile carbon, which supplies more energy to the heterotrophic denitrifiers to reduce N2 O to N2 , effectively reducing N2 O emissions [117] . Nevertheless, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the emission of N2 O from soils supplemented with hydrochar, and the role of essential properties of hydrochar in influencing soil N2 O emission remains uncertain. To the authors' knowledge, no study investigated the effect of FWH on soil N2 O emissions.   6 Life cycle assessment of food waste hydrochar Life cycle assessment (LCA) can measure, evaluate, compare, and create products and services based on their environmental implications. Environmental LCA studies enable decision-makers to understand technology from an environmental viewpoint and choose the optimal solution for waste management [118] . HTC of food waste requires an LCA that considers the nature of feedstock, formed products, reactor design, process location, operation size, and methods used to dispose of undesirable byproducts. The LCA findings will vary depending on the issue in question. The key to successfully translating laboratory findings to an industrial scale is to conduct testing at a pilot plant, where critical operating conditions can be identified and environmental repercussions may be studied. As a result, environmental and economic effects must be considered throughout the life cycle of industrial applications [119] . Ahamed et al. [118]  conducted LCA (software: SimaPro 7.3 libraries) using one ton of food waste as the functional unit and the collection, processing, waste conversion, and disposal of food waste as the system boundaries, with electricity, hydrochar, and glycerol as the three product outputs. A decentralised waste-to-energy system required about 2 MJ/kg-food waste for the HTC. The total energy demand for the impact category includes energy requirements for the process, the background processes, and the product contribution. However, the production of products like hydrochar exceeded the energy need. Further, environmental advantages from energy production (biodiesel to electricity assuming 35 % efficiency) and resource recovery (hydrochar and glycerol) were increased in the food waste-to-energy (via HTC, transesterification and biodiesel burning) system. In addition, one functional unit was projected to be worth S$3631 in Singapore, and the advantages of the food waste-to-energy system would recoup an additional 2.63 % of that value. Hydrochar, a byproduct of the food waste-to-energy system, seems to be a promising alternative recovery material since it recovered roughly S$72 million/year from food waste. However, the food waste-to-energy system has three major drawbacks: 1) high-pressure treatment calls for a strictly regulated environment; 2) extremely high capital cost necessitates upfront funding from investors; and 3) complex design, building, operation, and maintenance. Hu et al. [120]  subjected hydrochar to an LCA to determine its viability as a carbon source in wastewater treatment plants and its utility in soil restoration. The results showed that the hydrochar could eliminate 28 % of the global warming potential (GWP100) impact of wastewater treatment plants, 47 % of the GWP100 impact of freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, 54 % of the eutrophication impact of soil fertilisation, and 34 % of the GWP100 impact of soil remediation. In addition, the environmental impact of using hydrochar produced at 160 °C was lowest. Carbonization temperature and hydrochar moisture content affect the system environmental effect, indicating both are significant for industrial applications, as observed by Benavente et al. [121]  during the LCA (EASETECH, version 2.0.0) of fresh two-phase olive mill waste (TPOMW). HTC loses 35–45 % of the energy in olive mill waste, making it less environmentally friendly than incineration with energy recovery. Nevertheless, suppose the electricity recovery efficiency derived from incineration surpasses 30 %. In that case, the environmental consequences linked to HTC and subsequent energy production are comparable to or more favourable than those of TPOWM with energy recovery. The environmental impact of hydrochar drying fell by about 80 % in all categories when the HTC reaction temperature was raised from 200 to 250 °C. LCA studies indicated that HTC and anaerobic digestion for olive pomace are more viable than incineration for all environmental impact categories owing to biogas and hydrochar replacing electricity. HTC without anaerobic digestion is much better than incineration if wastewater is treated due to the energy recovery from hydrochar, and the recovery rates of electricity range from 30 % to 40 %; environmental benefits from HTC would increase with an increasing rate [122] . According to Ahamed et al. [118] , a food waste-to-energy biodiesel system with bio-oil and hydrochar as products is recommended for handling food waste and is a better alternative to incineration. Berge et al. [23]  reported FWH (275 °C, 16 h, and 32 % dry matter content) has lower GWP (−99 %), acidification (−93 %), and human-toxicity, non-cancer (−38 %) than conventional lignite. However, process water emissions had the highest environmental detrimental effects (>60 % for human toxicity, ecotoxicity, and freshwater eutrophication). Therefore, food waste is a wet feedstock, making HTC a better option than conventional dry carbonization methods (like pyrolysis).  7 Techno-economic assessment of food waste hydrochar The evaluation of the implementation of biomass/organic waste, particularly food waste, to various environmental applications utilising HTC must include a techno-economic evaluation because very little research has been conducted on converting food waste into hydrochar. Although numerous pilot plants and a few full-scale facilities have been constructed and are operating in many parts of the world, including Europe, China, and the United States, however the lack of actual industrial-scale HTC systems leaves a large void in economic assessment, making HTC technology is still in its early stages of development [123] . Moreover, the reactor is the pivotal component of a commercial HTC operation. Continuous reactors are essential for industrial establishments to effectively reduce their water and energy consumption. The two primary designs for HTC plants are vertical reactors (used by companies such as AVA–CO2  and TerraNova Energy GmbH) and horizontal reactors (used by Artec Biotechnologie and Grenol GmbH). One of the earliest pilot-scale HTC facilities, Ingelia S.L. of Spain, has a single cylindrical vertical reactor that runs nonstop. The bottom of the reactor is for feeding the reactor with organic wet biomass and collecting hydrochar/water slurry; the top is for collecting the gases. Small and medium-sized enterprises can boost capacity by installing more or bigger reactors than the pilot-scale reactor. Other HTC technology providers (e.g., AVA–CO2 ) also make it possible to scale up existing plants and provide a modular approach to the HTC setup [124] . Although numerous plants across the globe widely utilise HTC technology, finding such information can be challenging as businesses generally do not disclose confidential data and several companies have utilised their patented HTC process to manufacture diverse products.• INGELIA, Naquera near Valencia, Spain: uses organic waste from the surrounding municipalities to produce hydrochar and solid biofuel with HHV of about 24 MJ/kg.  • CPL Industries, Sheffield, England: uses food, clothes or garden waste and converts them into bio coal pellets.  • C-Green Technology AB’s, Solna, Sweden: uses wet sewage to produce hydrochar.  • Antaco UK Ltd., London: uses organic waste, including food waste, to produce solid biofuel.  • SUNCOAL, Germany: uses organic sludge to produce carbon, biochemicals and biofuel.  • TerraNova-energy, Germany: uses sludge and food waste as feedstock to produce solid fuel and fertilizer (phosphorous).    According to the above discussion, only a few companies sell hydrochar, especially FWH. Furthermore, hydrochar has not been evaluated from a techno-economic perspective. However, its manufacturing process is considered more cost-effective due to its ability to operate at lower temperatures. The commercialization of hydrochar faces two key challenges: manufacturing cost and utilisation. The company Ingelia S.L. sells hydrochar at a price range of 150–200 euro/ton. Lucian and Fiori [125]  used grape marc (65 % moisture content) to produce hydrochar using the HTC technique (optimized process conditions, T: 220 °C; time: 1 hr; dry biomass to water ratio: 0.19), and thermal energy, power consumption and plant efficiency were equal to 1170 kWh/ton, 160 kWh/ton hydrochar and 78 %, respectively. The production cost of pelletized hydrochar and breakeven costs were 157 and 200 euro/ton, respectively, with a repayment period of 10 years. Mahmood et al. [126]  performed a techno-economic assessment for an HTC plant with 2000 ton/day of food waste capacity for Singapore City using CAPCOST software (available online). The minimum selling price (any price greater than MSP would bring profits to the business) of hydrochar produced without enzyme was $30/ton, and with enzyme was $60/ton. Enzymatic pre-treatment of food waste substantially increases the price of the products due to the high cost of the enzymes used. Nevertheless, enzymatic pre-treatment produces attractive platform chemicals, e.g. 5-HMF, which could be a possible incentive to employ the enzymatic pre-treatment in the process but may not be a desired economic option to produce energy products solely. Mazumder et al. [127]  evaluate the techno-economic prospect of hydrochar production through co-HTC of coal waste and food waste. The production process, including seven reactors, produced 49,192 kg/h hydrochar. The economic analysis revealed the break-even costs to be $62.24/ton for case I (including only food waste transportation cost), $69.90/ton for case II (including transportation cost for both coal waste and food waste), and $60.26/ton for case III (included only coal waste transportation cost). Additionally, increasing the hydrochar production capacity has drastically decreased the break-even cost. A subsidy for food waste might be required to reduce the price of co–HTC hydrochar to be economically competitive with coal. The advantages of FWH compared to conventional fossil fuels are highlighted in Table 4   .  8 Challenges and future prospective FWH has various environmental, economic and social advantages (Fig. 5  ). However, more research is required to fill many knowledge gaps, such as cost-effective manufacturing methods, energy efficiency, resource utilization, and compatibility with existing infrastructure [91] . Some of the common challenges in FWH for commercialization are as:• Cost:  Hydrochar manufacturing from food waste might be expensive. Another factor that might drive up manufacturing costs is the restricted availability of food waste as a feedstock in certain areas.  • Scalability:  The generation of hydrochar from food waste necessitates the application of specialist equipment and advanced technological processes. Hence, more investigation is required to optimize the manufacturing process to achieve cost-effectiveness for commercialization.  • Resources and energy efficiency:  HTC convert food waste into a high-energy fuel, however it needs energy for heating and pressurisation. Thus, the manufacturing process's energy efficiency and resource use must be assessed to improve efficiency and minimise resource use.  • Compatibility:  FWH burns like fossil fuels, so further investigation is required to determine its compatibility with current combustion systems, infrastructure and procedures.  • Regulation policies:  Waste management, pollution, and renewable energy restrictions may affect fuel development and acceptance. Therefore, the legal and policy environment must be assessed to determine potential impediments to FWH fuel adoption.     9 Conclusion and recommendations Food waste has a complex composition with high water content, and HTC can convert it into a promising and sustainable product, i.e., FWH. FWH has various environmental applications in achieving many SDGs and contributing to carbon neutrality and circular economy. Moreover, the activation and/or modification of FWH using different strategies to advance engineered chars can extend their energy and environmental application. FWH can be cost-effective in the long run due to its cheaper production cost compared to fossil fuels and its ability to lessen dependency on these resources, which are becoming more and more costly. Interdisciplinary partnerships, including thermochemical engineering, data science, environmental engineering, and material science, are necessary for developing a carbon–neutral FWH. Moreover, the commercial application of FWH is limited due to the wide range of variation in feedstock and the lack of specific guidelines for the synthesis/modification of hydrochar. Additionally, the life cycle and techno-economic assessments significantly influence the evaluation of FWH economic feasibility and environmental benefits. Here are some recommendations for expanding the application of FWH:1. Because many feedstocks are available, it is best to follow certain principles while selecting, processing, and synthesising hydrochar to optimise its benefits.  2. Research should concentrate on novel reactor designs and operating conditions to improve the process's effectiveness and scalability. It is also necessary to perform the techno-economic and life cycle assessments from production to application. A pilot study may be beneficial in assessing the feasibility and efficacy of FWH in a real-world environment.  3. Apart from conventional processing and modification methods, incorporating the latest technologies, such as catalysts and co-firing, can be helpful to improve HTC's efficiency further.  4. The evaluation of the impact of hydrochar on GHGs emissions is mostly confined to laboratory or greenhouse settings; therefore, it cannot represent real-world climatic circumstances accurately. Hence, it is advisable to conduct more studies to examine the GHGs emissions from soils treated with hydrochar on a broader scale, particularly in field conditions and across various climatic scenarios such as drought and flood events.  5. To ensure SDGs and the concept of carbon neutrality and circular economy, interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers for new insights and innovation in hydrochar production, industry for commercialization and stakeholders and policymakers for implementation, and to promote hydrochar as a sustainable material for various environmental applications is the need of hours.
