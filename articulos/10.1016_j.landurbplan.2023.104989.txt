                  Urban wetlands are well-known to provide multiple ecosystem services and are essential for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The management practices of local institutions are strongly influential on the sustainability outcomes of urban wetlands, yet the beliefs and value systems underlying distinct management approaches have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the perceptions of local stakeholders regarding the ecosystem services provided by urban wetlands, their linkages to the SDGs, and pertinent threats to the wetlands, to reveal the connections between local awareness and sustainable management practices. Using the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) in India as a case study, we used a mixed-method approach to interview 120 local stakeholders associated with two differentially managed wetland systems – community and private. Our results demonstrate that the community wetlands are more socially inclusive in nature than the private wetlands. The private users emphasized economic benefits and livelihood security above all, whereas the community users strongly valued diverse provisioning services and cultural services in addition to the livelihood security. Further, community users identified a greater number of ecosystem services as contributing toward the SDGs relative to private users. We suggest that sustainable development strategies consult and incorporate the perceptions of local community wetland management groups, as these management practices are rooted in more comprehensive value systems and are more aligned with sustainable outcomes. These insights reveal the importance of local awareness of ecosystem services, and may be of value to urban planners and policymakers working toward sustainable urban management.

Urban wetlands are well-known to provide multiple ecosystem services and are essential for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The management practices of local institutions are strongly influential on the sustainability outcomes of urban wetlands, yet the beliefs and value systems underlying distinct management approaches have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the perceptions of local stakeholders regarding the ecosystem services provided by urban wetlands, their linkages to the SDGs, and pertinent threats to the wetlands, to reveal the connections between local awareness and sustainable management practices. Using the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) in India as a case study, we used a mixed-method approach to interview 120 local stakeholders associated with two differentially managed wetland systems – community and private. Our results demonstrate that the community wetlands are more socially inclusive in nature than the private wetlands. The private users emphasized economic benefits and livelihood security above all, whereas the community users strongly valued diverse provisioning services and cultural services in addition to the livelihood security. Further, community users identified a greater number of ecosystem services as contributing toward the SDGs relative to private users. We suggest that sustainable development strategies consult and incorporate the perceptions of local community wetland management groups, as these management practices are rooted in more comprehensive value systems and are more aligned with sustainable outcomes. These insights reveal the importance of local awareness of ecosystem services, and may be of value to urban planners and policymakers working toward sustainable urban management.   Keywords Urban wetlands  Blue infrastructure  Landscape management  Ecosystem services  SDG   Data availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction It is estimated that almost 68 % of the world’s population will be living in cities by 2050 (United Nations, 2019 ), with about 90 % of future urban growth expected to take place in the Global South (Nagendra et al., 2018 ). The interconnected challenges of food security and sustainable forms of urbanization have been addressed in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030, most notably in SDG 2 (food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture); SDG 11 (inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities) and SDG 12 (sustainable production and consumption). Food supply in cities is a critical issue in the context of increasing global urbanization (Chiffoleau et al., 2020 ), and the current global situation demands the prioritization and strengthening of resilient food supply chains for cities (Moustier et al., 2023 ). Urban food production has frequently been described as a key lever for transformative change towards sustainability (Hebinck et al., 2021; Ilieva, 2017; Moragues-Faus & Carroll, 2018 ). Therefore, the need to consider agriculture and horticulture in urban planning is increasingly recognized. Investigating the contributions of urban food systems to the interconnected Sustainable Development Goals may be helpful in ensuring that policy efforts meet multiple dimensions of sustainability. Plenty of studies have explored the multiple contributions of urban agriculture to the sustainable development of cities (e.g., Ilieva, 2016; Morgan, 2009; Sonnino, 2016 ). Many other studies have investigated how urban green and blue infrastructures support the supply of ecosystem services across the world (e.g., Elmqvist et al., 2013; Kabisch et al., 2017; Plieninger et al., 2022; Shih, 2017 ). However, the particular contributions of urban blue infrastructure (UBI) toward achieving the targets of multiple SDGs have received little attention so far. The notion of UBI is used to highlight the importance of wetlands, rivers, ponds (for freshwater management), and coastal ecosystems (for marine systems management) in urban development (Sajaloli, 1996; da Silva & Wheeler, 2017 ). UBI has often undergone degradation, especially in the Global South, and some types of UBI, such as wetlands, swamps, and marshes, have even been framed negatively as wastelands. Consequently, the potential of UBI for sustainable development has only recently been taken up within urban planning (Nagendra et al., 2018 ). The focus of this study is on urban wetlands, a type of UBI which, when managed and restored naturally, can contribute to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (The Ramsar Convention, 2018 ). The biophysical and social components of wetlands are essential for contributing to a nation’s capital, through mechanisms such as supporting the livelihoods of local communities (MA, 2005; Romero-Duque et al., 2020; Veerkamp et al., 2021 ), providing water resources for agriculture (Rebelo et al., 2010 ), acting as a buffer against natural disasters and contributing to global long-term carbon sequestration (Bolund & Hunhammar, 1999; Gómez-Baggethun & Barton, 2013 ). Apart from these highlighted ecosystem services, urban wetlands also support food production, through both aquaculture and agriculture (Eric et al., 2022). In many urban landscapes, wetlands are either strictly protected for biodiversity conservation or are developed commercially as recreational sites (Maconachie et al., 2009 ). Even though state policies to achieve sustainable development frequently emphasize the term ‘participatory management’ in the context of wetlands, local communities are often not involved in decision-making processes (Jain, 2021 ). However, studies from various cities in South Asia have shown that local communities often have long-standing associations with wetlands (Murphy et al., 2019 ). They often have their own institutions for managing wetlands, which tend to be bottom-up in nature, rooted in local cultural realities, flexible, and resilient to environmental changes (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 2000; Sen and Nagendra, 2020b ). The necessity of urban food systems for meeting the needs of local communities has also been increasingly recognized, and many studies have highlighted the positive impacts of urban agriculture on consumers and communities via the provision of ecosystem services or the building of social capital (Hemerijckx et al., 2023; Iida et al., 2023 ). However, the role of UBI in providing access to food has rarely been studied. The strengthening of community-based governance of natural resources is recognized as a key sustainability approach for shaping not only cities but also entire nations (Mwonzora, 2022; Owens & Zimmerman, 2013 ). The local voices of communities have the ability to initiate many positive sustainable changes, in particular in cities of the Global South (Sen and Nagendra, 2020b ). Local practices, which are strongly influenced by the local peoples’ perceptions of ecosystem services and relevant threats to those ecosystems, are also key determinants of the success of sustainable development efforts (Mensah et al., 2017; García-Llorente et al., 2020 ). Valuing and strengthening traditional management practices is an essential strategy for preventing various negative impacts of urbanization, particularly those arising from the transformation of wetlands to agricultural areas or built infrastructure. Many cities of the Global South are inhabited by long-standing indigenous communities who follow established and effective practices for natural resource management, but are now undergoing massive transformations toward privatization of their resource base as a result of urbanization (Sen & Nagendra, 2020a ). Therefore, understanding how the perceptions and practices of these traditional communities and private groups differ is vital for deriving a nuanced understanding of resource management ideologies and how they influence socio-ecological systems transformations and outcomes provided by UBI. To fill this knowledge gap, this aim of this study was to investigate India’s East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW), as an example of UBI, from a food system lens and to compare how users of community-managed and privately managed wetlands perceive the ecosystem services provided by the EKW and their linkages to the SDGs. Our analysis addressed three research questions. First, what are the functional differences between the local institutions governing community-managed wetlands and privately-managed wetlands? Second, how do these management approaches relate to individual perceptions about the provision of ecosystem services and negative impacts of the wetlands? Third, how do local people perceive the EKW’s ecosystem services and the SDGs, and how do these perceptions differ between community and private wetland users?  2 Methods 2.1 Study area The East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) (22°25′-22°40′ N to 88°20′-88°20′ E) are located at the eastern fringe of Kolkata, in the state of West Bengal, India. They cover 12,500 ha of wetland, or bheris  (as they are locally called), and were designated as a protected site under the Ramsar Convention in 2002. The EKW are located on the vast low-lying area at the transitional interface between the rural and urban or peri -urban zones of Kolkata (Fig. 1  ). The EKW trap 60 % of carbon from wastewater, resulting in reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and are home to 380 major species of flora and fauna (EKWMA and WISA, 2021 ). By that, they act as ‘the kidney of the city’ (Stigge & Brown, 2017). Kolkata is the fifth-largest megacity in India, with a population of fifteen million people. It has no conventional sewage treatment facility. The EKW thus represent the world’s largest recycling ecosystem, receiving and transforming 750 million L of urban wastewater and 2,500 t of waste per day. The EKW is managed by locals according to inter-generational practices and knowledge (Mukherjee & Chakraborty, 2016 ). Local fishermen and farmers carry-out traditional and low-cost recycling practices centered around wastewater fisheries, paddy cultivation, and vegetable farming. The EKW have been estimated to generate 22 t of fish and 150 t of vegetables per day, covering almost 40 % of Kolkata’s needs (Mukherjee & Sen, 2020 ). Although Kolkata is a cosmopolitan city, the typical (staple) diet of a Kolkata resident is largely Bengali (locally rooted) in nature (Ray, 2012 ), consisting of rice, fish curry, and seasonal vegetables as the basics, with the addition of other foods depending on their income, social background, and caste-based norms. Apart from providing cost-efficient wastewater recycling systems and local food production for the city, the EKW also support the livelihoods of 150,000 people living in and around the wetlands as daily wage workers (Mukherjee & Chakraborty, 2016 ). The term ‘amphibious terrain’ was used by Bhattacharya (2018)  to describe moving boundaries, intractable marshes, and the sudden appearance of new land formations. As a consequence of their amphibious nature, the EKW have been the center of struggles over land ownership rights and identities; a situation which continues to this day (Bhattacharya, 2018 ). A boom in private investment in real estate development and the local political contestations of land rights are disrupting the biophysical nature of the EKW as economic incentives are prioritized over the ecological functions of the wetlands. Aquaculture and agricultural outcomes of wetlands are also determined by factors such as the size or area of the wetlands, the location of each wetland and its distance from the municipal wastewater channels, and ownership or governance patterns (Aguilar-Manjarrez et al., 2017 ). These factors influence the functioning of the wetlands as they have implications regarding local power roles and informal governing of the landscape. Therefore, in this study we focused on the roles of the local institutions managing the wetlands and their influence on social-ecological outcomes. New guidelines were set forth in 2017 for the formation of wetland authorities, which were created by formulating a list of agendas, regulations, and prohibitions for the wise use of wetlands and defining a strong conservation strategy, consulting officials, ministers, and experts from all states (MoEFCC, 2017 ). Officially, the EKW is governed by various institutions: the East Kolkata Wetlands Management Authority (EKWMA) and the Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) for demarcating the EKW boundary, taking pollution measurements, and conducting biodiversity conservation and environmental awareness initiatives; the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) and the West Bengal Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBHIDCO) for urban development; and the state Department of Fisheries for maintaining fishing regulations. However, the on-the-ground management of the fisheries in the EKW involves three major types of governance: state government-managed, privately-managed, and community-managed or cooperative bheris  (Fig. 2  ). The state government-managed fisheries are under the responsibility of the Department of Fisheries and the Government of West Bengal. The cooperative wetland fisheries are managed by local communities who are members of the cooperative bodies, which are partly but inconsistently supported by the Department of Fisheries. In the community-managed wetlands, the profits earned by each bheri  is equally divided among all cooperative members, irrespective of their roles. These cooperative bodies also have welfare schemes for the working members, such as saving funds for an emergency crisis, providing loans to a member or their family when in need, monthly leave for all members, and rotational night duties. The privately-managed wetlands consist of three types: leasehold, shareholder, and partnership systems. In the leasehold system, a group of people lease the land and pay an annual rent, and the profit is shared among themselves according to each lease holder’s share. In the shareholder system, a landowner takes 45 to 50 % of the profit earned and a group of shareholders divide the remaining profit among themselves. In the partnership system, the land is owned by a person who earns the rent and holds the power of decision-making, in addition to receiving a share of profits earned.  2.2 Pilot study Before selecting the final stakeholders to be interviewed, we conducted a pilot study from January to March 2022, to interact with the local communities and identify local contacts to help us in understanding the contextual background and for coordinating with other wetland members. This process involved building local contacts with farmers and community members and reaching out to local organizations, researchers, and universities in order to gain an understanding of the landscape and socio-political dynamics. Two rounds of workshops were conducted with representatives from different wetlands to elaborate on our research in further detail. The local resource persons helped us to get in touch with the farmers, fishermen, and gardeners, and they assisted us in the organization of workshops with locals. We also identified and approached local policy experts as well as experts from local NGOs and academic institutions who have been involved with the case study. Many experts from the above-mentioned institutions offered to share their insights, and we went through rounds of informal discussion and interviews to get an idea of the overall context.  2.3 Stakeholder selection and data collection Out of 254 wetlands or bheris , the two largest wetlands are government-owned, six are cooperative or community-managed, and the rest are privately managed. For the current study, we focused on the six cooperative wetland fisheries and selected six private wetland fisheries. We did not include the government-owned wetlands because this would have resulted in a small sample size. Primary data collection included individual interviews of 120 stakeholders, conducted between March and June 2022. Each day, various activities in the EKW start as early as 4 am, including netting, fishing, sorting, and sending the catches to the local market. The timing of the interviews thus varied depending on each individual stakeholder’s role and job. We interviewed ten individual stakeholders from each of the 12 community- and privately-managed wetlands or bheris , leading to a final sample of 120 respondents. Stakeholders included farmers, fishermen, managers, accountants, gardeners, watch guards, priests, and local collectors or gatherers. 2.3.1 Questionnaire The core of data collection in this study consisted of a combination of structured and semi-structured paper-based interviews. First, structured interviews were performed with the managers of the bheris  to obtain basic background information. Then, individual interviews were conducted with the 120 stakeholders based on a questionnaire. The questionnaire was composed of four parts. The first part captured the demographic characteristics of the respondents, which included age, income, level of education, profession, gender, and caste. It also elucidated the duration of the respondent’s association with the EKW and details of their migration from other areas. Respondents were asked to list the types of fish and agricultural products they produce, the size of the bheris,  and their distance from the municipal wastewater channels (which is indicative of water inflows) (see Appendix). The second section included semi-structured questions to investigate wetland members’ perceptions of the ecosystem services provided by the EKW and threats to the EKW, additionally aiming to elucidate how these differ between private and community wetland members. Respondents were requested to rate how important they perceived the EKW as being for their livelihood dependencies and for other functions, on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 (where 5 was of the highest importance). The respondents were then asked to elaborate further on their ratings and share their experiences in open-ended questions. The list of ecosystem services was categorized based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005)  and further adapted according to the input obtained in the pilot interviews, which captured the local context and knowledge of local experts and stakeholders. This was done to ensure the concept of ecosystem services was accessible and easy to grasp for the stakeholders. For example, for provisioning services, we asked about the respondents’ dependency on the EKW for daily food consumption, fodder for livestock, firewood for cooking, timber wood for construction, livelihood security, and medicinal plants. For cultural services, the categories were ornamental flowers/leaves/fruits for cultural and spiritual practices, exchange of local traditional knowledge, social bonding, simply being there and enjoying the place, and providing a sense of home. For regulating services, the categories were shade and coolness, air purification, water purification, silt from wetlands for fertilizer for vegetable and fruit trees, local biodiversity for food production, dealing with climate-induced changes like heatwaves and cyclones, and dealing with other crises like COVID-19. Similarly, the questionnaire explored the respondents’ perception of threats to the EKW. We adapted the list of major threats to EKW management into broad categories based on the input obtained from pilot interviews, which included lack of ownership, siltation, rapid urban development, land use change, land encroachment by real estate, discharge of unwanted waste materials, lack of manpower due to emigration, irregular maintenance, other encroachment threats, proximity to the main sewage canal, transformation of wetlands to agricultural land, and loss of wild edible flowers and greens. We evaluated the statements using a five-point Likert scale from 1 (“not important”) to 5 (“highly important”). This part was followed by an open-ended question to allow the respondents to elaborate further on their ratings and share about their experiences. Immediately after the semi-structured interviews, in-depth follow-up discussions were initiated to investigate two aspects: a) the awareness of the SDGs, aiming to establish the links between perceived ecosystem services and threats and the SDGs; and b) the visions of local communities for a sustainable and resilient future. For this section, respondents were briefed about the terminology of the 17 SDGs and their actions. Each respondent was then asked to mention the potential links between all 17 SDGs and the ecosystem services they perceived in relation to the EKW. For example, after demonstrating what SDG 1 (no poverty) stands for, respondents were asked if they thought that the EKW serves that action or not. The discussion was left open for respondents to elaborate on their answers, in order to better grasp the local understanding of the SDGs (Simon et al., 2016; Valencia et al., 2019 ). The interpretation of these in-depth interviews and narratives allowed for exploring the complex socio-ecological differences between private and community-based wetland management schemes, and the relations of each to rapid urban transformations. Informed consent was obtained from all stakeholders before conducting the interviews. The names of the stakeholders and individual wetlands were anonymized to protect their privacy. The language used for the interviews was Bengali, the native language of the local people.   2.4 Data analysis All interviews were transcribed from Bengali to English and analyzed for contextual details and interpretation of the socio-ecological and cultural observations. Transcripts were coded through content analysis in an excel data table, categorizing perceptions related to three aspects: ecosystem services provided by the EKW, threats to the EKW, and linkages between the EKW and the SDGs. The unstructured discussions were similarly analyzed to understand the local perceptions of ecosystem services provided by the EKW, the threats thereto, and their links with the SDGs. Responses of private wetland members and community wetland members were analyzed separately in order to elucidate differences in perceptions between the two types of wetland users.   3 Results 3.1 Differences between community and private wetland users and their activities The community wetland users largely belong to scheduled tribes, scheduled castes, (for more information, see MTA, 1956 ) and Muslim minority populations, and have high livelihood dependencies and long-standing associations with the wetlands for aquaculture, agriculture, and horticulture purposes. Wetlands managed by private users involve a large proportion from the general caste population along with scheduled tribes and scheduled castes. The labor work in private wetlands is done mostly by part-time migrant laborers, along with a few full-time workers (Table 1  ). All interviewed stakeholders from both types of wetlands produce a variety of freshwater fish along with seasonal vegetables (Table 2  ). Many women from the neighboring localities depend on the community wetlands for their livelihoods. Around 45 kinds of wild greens are collected from these wetlands. The women also collect wild edibles like grass, periwinkles or snails, crabs, small fish, water hyacinth, taro greens, fruits, grass seeds, and flowers to sell at local markets. The privately managed wetlands are not used for collecting edibles due to the lack of different varieties of wild edibles and restrictive guidelines. The private wetlands are financed by investors for aquaculture operations, and the community members or appointed laborers receive a fixed monthly salary independent of any profits earned. In these wetlands, the investors are the decision makers. They decide which variety of fish to farm, in which season, and how will they be farmed. No workers have the right to make such decisions. In contrast, in the community-managed wetlands, all users are directly involved as cooperative members, and duties are divided amongst individuals with specific roles. Roles include manager, gardener, accountant, fisherman, and farmer. The profits earned from aquaculture and agriculture are divided equally, irrespective of individual roles. Monthly meetings are also held with other cooperative wetlands to exchange knowledge and to discuss problems and potential solutions. These meetings are widely attended by both women and men involved in the community wetlands.  3.2 Differences in perceptions of ecosystem services provided by the EKW between community and private wetland users The perceived importance of the ecosystem service provisioning functions of the EKW was high among community users (Fig. 3  ). The respondents from the community-managed wetlands readily recognized their dependency on the EKW for daily consumption, collection of fodder for livestock, firewood, and timber wood, whereas the private wetland users were not dependent on the wetlands for any of these purposes (Fig. 4  ). Medicinal plants were valued highly by most community wetland users (96 % of respondents), but few of the private wetland users (8 %).“We eat what we grow and we grow more than enough. Even after selling at a profitable rate to the local market, we can feed all members of our bheri everyday… Working in the bheri requires physical labor, and small accidents or insect bites are inevitable, but we always have elders around us to take care of our medical needs with the help of these local plants… Many people from the city raised a lot of questions about the quality of our harvests because it’s from wastewater treatment bodies. We tell them that if they would survey us about how frequently we fall ill or have chronic or fatal illnesses, then they will get an answer. We have a diverse range of food, depending on the season, but we get all our nutritional needs taken care of well.” (Community wetland user, male, 67 years). “Oh! Why spend money to buy vegetables and fruits from the outside market when our soil is so fertile it can grow everything? What does a human need to eat for a healthy living? Rice, fish curry, dal (lentils), a vegetable curry, and some wild greens like spinach, amaranthus, or goosefoots (Chenopodium) or water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), etc., depending on the season. Once a week we have meat and egg, which are easily available from our backyards. We have all types of fruit trees common to Kolkata; in between work in the evening we pluck whichever fruits we want as a snack. We work hard all day, we eat freshly grown food, to me that’s all we need for being healthy.” (Community wetland user, male, 42 years).   Private users were found not to depend on the wetlands for provisioning services. “It takes a lot of time and effort to grow vegetables, we work here as contractual employees where we have shifts. Like I am here only until 10 am, after that I go out and have lunch in a local stall and move to my next workspace. A batch of workers come at 12 pm, they usually come after lunch. So, we all manage our meals outside according to our own shift timings. Some of us grow some seasonal vegetables that are easy to grow, but that’s mostly to sell in the local market.”  (Private wetland user, male, 41 years). “Is it really feasible or even necessary to grow your own vegetables and greens? We are running a huge business in aquaculture, we need to focus and dedicate our time and effort to this. Investing smartly in aquaculture can bring in a lot of money. What is it about own consumption? You go to any market and you get everything available, with plenty of choices.”  (Private wetland user, male, 50 years). Another difference between the community and private wetland users was the use and appreciation of cultural services (96 % of community wetland users versus 28 % of private wetland users), which includes a sense of home that the EKW provide to the respondents (93 % community users, 18 % private users).“Not all the city people are aware of the vast existence and contributions of the EKW, but we are very well aware. I’ve been living here for 37 years, and to this day I couldn’t find a safer and calmer place in the whole city than this. Years back, when I came to Kolkata with no hope but to start farming and livestock grazing, it was a completely different landscape – it felt like my own place instantly. Even today, when it is not the same anymore, it still feels like my own.” (Community wetland users, couple, 76 and 68 years). “A workspace like this makes the hectic day at the bheri calmer. On most days, we forget to appreciate the beautiful landscape, but I can tell that I enjoy working here more than my evening job.” (Private wetland user, male, 23 years).   100 % of the respondents from community wetlands depend on the silt from the wetlands as natural fertilizer, especially for vegetable and fruit gardening, whereas only 20 % of the respondents from private wetlands use wetland silts as fertilizer.“We don’t need to buy added fertilizers for vegetable farming and fruit gardening. The silt from the wetlands is fertile enough. We have been requesting the government to provide us with support to extract the silt. It worked out a few times, but now we have someone from our bheri to do that regularly, to maintain the health of the wetland and also to maintain the farms.” (Community wetland user, male, 47 years). “We usually dump the silts a bit away from our bheri to keep it more spacious and breathable for the fish farming. Our aquaculture is at a large scale, so we need more space to utilize as we have many workers. We appoint more workers for our aquaculture, as it is the most profitable investment to make, rather than engaging with farming.” (Private wetland user, male, 51 years).   Regulating services, like supporting local biodiversity for pollination, were highly valued by community users (90 %), but less so among private users (15 %).“Our gardens have different kinds of birds, bees, and butterflies coming all throughout the year which definitely helps our farms and gardens. Some officers from the government of West Bengal appreciated our method of gardening and encouraged us to continue it. They also gave us mango saplings to plant for the next season, which we are now making space for.” (Community wetland user, male, 73 years).    3.3 Differences in perceived threats to the EKW between community and private users Based on the open-ended questions in the questionnaire, the main perceived threats to wetland degradation among both community and private users were identified as lack of ownership rights, siltation, urbanization, land-use change, land encroachment by real estate, and discharge of unwanted waste materials or chemical contamination. Lack of manpower due to emigration, irregular maintenance, other encroachment threats from aspects such as local power politics, long distance from main sewage canals, transformation of wetlands to agricultural or paddy fields, and depletion of wild edible flowers and greens were also among the top identified threats (Figs. 5   and 6  ). The users of privately managed wetlands identified major threats from land ownership issues and real estate and other encroachment threats, while the community users found siltation, lack of manpower due to emigration, lack of proximity to the main sewage canal, land-use change, transformation of wetlands to agricultural or paddy lands, and depletion of wild edible flowers and greens to be the major concerns for the depletion of the wetlands. Both expressed a similar intensity of concern for the discharge of unwanted waste materials, such as chemical contamination from nearby tanneries and rapid urban development. The three interlinked challenges that were discussed by the cooperative wetland members were rapid urban development, land use change around wetlands, and depletion of edible wildflowers and greens (biodiversity). According to them, this is another major threat to the health of the wetlands which is beyond their control. They said, “You see the kind of urban development happening around? Wherever you look around, you will see high-rise buildings and apartments, roads, and gated colonies. These buildings don’t come up in a day, there is continuous construction work going on all throughout the year, which brings more silt and degrades the pond porosity and channels with other wetlands. It is choking the fish ponds eventually. This also affects the vegetation quality in the embankments. Usually, the soil in the embankments is basically silts removed from the ponds; the soil is heavily fertile, and we do not need any added fertilizers – but we can see the changes in the sizes, colors, amount, and shapes.”  (Community wetland user, male, 45 years). Another respondent added, “While cleaning the weeds, we have noticed that some wild plants like bakhra are not growing anymore. The flowers of these plants attracted a lot of pollinators. We also used to sell them locally – you can eat them, they are very good for vision, and taste like pumpkin flowers. We don’t really see them anymore.”  (Community wetland user, female, 38 years). The conversation in the cooperative wetlands further adds, “Earlier, in between the wetlands periphery and the city, were the habitats of cattle grazers. A huge community of cattle grazers lived there and reared their cattle in the green open spaces, or ‘math’. The urine and fecal excretory matter of these cattle were used to mix with the wastewater which was gold for our aquaculture, vegetation, and agriculture. All these settlers were moved out from parts of the city as the urban development boomed in. These grazers have now moved to the other side of the wetlands, far away from the city. Unfortunately, the wastewater comes from the city to the wetlands, we can’t take it from the other side. This impacted our livelihoods to a huge extent. We never had to think of any form of fertilizers or added food for fish.”  (Community wetland user, male, 71 years). Community wetland members also expressed concerns about ownership issues and encroachment: “The wetlands are not directly converted to built-up areas, they are first transformed to agricultural plots and then slowly converted to built-up areas. It is concerning because there is higher pressure or interest in growing for paddy cultivation than for fisheries. Now, with the degrading quality of waste and high siltation in the ponds, the production quantity and quality are both disrupted.”  (Community wetland user, male, 66 years). Another issue highlighted was the degradation of wastewater quality for various undesirable reasons. “There are tanneries close to the wetlands that are being detrimental to the water quality. Now lately, there are some plastic-making units that are causing problems. This is affecting the health of fish. A few years back we had to bear a huge loss because of that.”  (Community wetland user, female, 54 years). Private wetland respondents did not mention any concern about the above-mentioned issue. Emigration is also a matter of concern among community wetlands. While the private wetlands include large populations of workers from outside the city and state, the cooperative bheris  are entirely maintained by local communities. Many community wetland members expressed these concerns clearly: “The wetland conditions are depleting. Often, we don’t have good support from the government at the right time, which leads to bearing losses and uncertainties for the future. The new generations are seeing our struggles and efforts, and most of them are not wanting to have the same future as us. They want to go out to the cities and earn well, have a different life. Most of our kids have now moved to the southern part of India for different kinds of jobs.”  (Community wetland user, male, 43 years).  3.4 Localized awareness of SDGs and vision for a resilient future for the EKW General awareness about the links between the EKW and SDG outcomes was higher among the community wetland users than the private wetland users. Although respondents generally lacked prior knowledge of the SDG targets and indicators, most were able to conceptually relate the SDGs to the ecosystem services the EKW provide. The community wetland users were able to link the EKW to 15 out of 17 SDGs, whereas the privately managed wetland users were able to link the EKW to only 9 SDGs (Fig. 7  ). SDGs 1 and 2 (No poverty and zero hunger, respectively) were among those most frequently linked with the EKW. “No one will ever die of hunger. We have our twice-daily meals secured for every day for the whole year. No matter what our daily earnings are, we always have sufficient food for ourselves and our families.”  (Community wetland user, female, 59 years). “During this COVID-19 lockdown, we could not depend on the market so much. We had meetings with our malik (chief investor) for getting at least the fish from the ponds. When the whole market system was disturbed, we had to depend on these wetlands, and at least we could have mach-er jhol bhat (fish curry rice) for our meal.”  (Private wetland user, male, 43 years). SDGs 8, 12, and 13 (decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption and production, and climate action, respectively) were also frequently linked to the EKW by both types of wetland users. Both private and community wetland users highlighted the EKW as contributing to their decent livelihoods and economic stability. Many respondents referred to the contributions of the EKW not only to the lives of the communities but also to the state. “People here have been depending on the wetlands for many generations. Our kids are trying to go out and have a different living on their own, but we don’t expect them to send home money. We can sustain our lives by whatever we grow and whatever we earn.”  (Community wetland user, female, 56 years). “For the past 20 years, I have been collecting wild greens from the patches and have been selling them in the local market and weekly at the farmers market. These days, I also go to local apartment complexes and sell door-to-door. It takes more effort but I get a better price there. I earn around 500 INR or 6 USD per day.”  (Community wetland user, male, 70 years). “The EKW are not just our source of livelihood and income, but also an economic lifeline for the city. Investing in aquaculture these days is more beneficial than investing in stock markets – you may not always get the same return as from the stock market, but aquaculture will never go into losses.”  (Private wetland user, male, 49 years). Respondents from both user groups mentioned the role of the EKW in responsible production and consumption. “We are taking away Kolkata’s waste and producing food; it’s like turning coal into gold. This is a completely circular food system we have in India.”  (Community wetland user, male, 54 years). “We do not produce any waste, we use resources available optimally. Kolkata city is heavily dependent on us and we reduce the city’s cost in so many ways. First, the wastewater treatment is done naturally without spending thousands of USD. Second, we are supporting the state’s daily food production.”  (Private wetland user, male, 42 years).  Respondents from community wetlands also more commonly associated the EKW with SDGs 3 and 11 (good health and well-being, and sustainable cities and communities, respectively) as compared to the respondents from private wetlands. Individual awareness of SDGs has a global environmental impact, which although relatively minor, can have huge consequences when amplified by the entire population. Interviews from the community wetland users illustrated a holistic picture of sustainable cities and well-being (SDG 3 and 11, respectively). “We are more active and healthier than the people living in the city. We eat homegrown food, do physical work, and stay active. We breathe fresh air and relax under the tree.” “We snack on fruits instead of burgers! Just pluck a fruit whenever you want, we have so many fruit gardens.”  (Community wetland user, male, 38 years). In contrast, the concept of sustainable cities was limited among the private wetland users. “Where is the development of the EKW? If you go to the other cities, you will see a lot of infrastructural development around lakes. The EKW have been the same for a long time. People are protesting and complaining about the minimum developmental work like building roads. Locals are not educated enough to understand the importance of the developed city. They are too comfortable in their way of living.”  (Private wetland user, male, 47 years). One concerning difference between the two user groups was the lack of knowledge related to gender and other inequalities (SDG 5 and 10, respectively) among the private wetland users. Several interviewees from the private wetland groups identified female participation in the group as being problematic. For them, the overall SDG goals are significantly more important than the individual goals of gender and other inequalities. In response to the issue of gender inequality in private wetlands, a 51-year-old male private wetland user said: “Aquaculture is a labor-intensive job. Each worker is paid a wage monthly, and we need to maintain their salary. With growing market prices these days, labor costs are also increasing, and it is becoming difficult to maintain so many workers. So, we employ young to middle-aged men who are more involved to strengthen the manpower. ” Contrastingly, a 69-year-old woman from a community-managed wetland said: “We are less involved in fish production but more involved in the agricultural farms. We have so many other vegetables growing besides the fish farming. We are involved in other agricultural production or animal husbandry .” “In our cooperative wetland system, we are equally paid and have equal leave days as men. We are usually not assigned night work like guarding. My husband worked as a night or day guard for 21 years here, but after his demise, I was not ever asked to do the same job and I am also paid the same.”  (Community wetland user, female, 53 years). The awareness of SDGs amongst the two user groups of the same landscape was contrasting (see Appendix).   4 Discussion The potential of local communities in the sustainable management of urban blue infrastructure is largely ignored, despite it being critical for wetland restoration (Ghosh, 2005 ). One of the aims of this study was to unravel the factors that facilitate or impede the contributions of UBI to the sustainable development of cities. The motivations of the private wetland users were found to be more narrowly economically focused or profit-driven, whereas the community wetlands serve a more diverse array of functions and are more socially inclusive. The community users value the sustainable provision of fish and vegetables, appreciate the wetlands for spiritual and social purposes, and highly value its function in alleviating poverty. The practices of the community users are more rooted in traditional knowledge and sustainable practices, and consider multiple pillars of a healthy community. This provides direct evidence of the benefit of such community-based management practices for the environment, local communities, and livelihoods of local people. These practices can thus be drawn upon to inform or serve as guidelines for effective management and governance approaches and for sustainable development policies. Increasing urbanization represents a major challenge for conserving blue and green spaces, as does the global persistence of privatization schemes (Colding et al., 2020 ). Lots of research has been conducted on the massive shift towards privatization of public or common green and blue spaces (Colding et al., 2020 ). This case study represents an attempt to provide support and a relevant framework for drawing upon traditional local practices to guide sustainable planning and management of urban blue and green infrastructures. In the following sections, we discuss the varied local perceptions of the ecosystem services provided by the EKW and their role in achieving the SDGs, along with perceived threats to the wetlands. Wild foods play a critical role as a buffer against food stress caused by climate change impacts or other crises such as COVID-19, provide health benefits and nutritional security, and conserve biodiversity (Bharucha & Pretty, 2010; FAO, 2009 ). Our results indicate that the community-managed wetlands are more inclusive and support the livelihood of communities outside the wetlands by creating more diverse pond farmlands, and also by allowing foragers and gatherers to collect wild edibles. The privately-owned wetlands are almost exclusively managed for intensive aquaculture, with very little or no diversification. Community-based management has been demonstrated to facilitate traditional local knowledge as well as successful conservation of wetlands (Walle & Nayak, 2020 ), but such practices are often not considered in policy-making or planning. We found that wetlands managed by a community are largely inclusive in nature, including participants from a broader range of age, caste, religion, and gender, whereas wetlands managed by private users have limited representation from different gender, religion, and caste groups. There is a broader distribution of task roles in the community-managed wetlands, wherein all the jobs or roles are more or less equally paid, in contrast to privately-managed wetlands, wherein the pay scale was strictly hierarchical. The monthly meetings held by community wetland users involve participatory processes to strengthen the inclusion of all stakeholders, leading to more beneficial environmental and social outcomes (de Vente et al., 2016 ). In this study, we found that community users perceived urban wetlands as being rich in provisioning, regulating, and cultural services, similar to the results of a 2020 review on natural resource management and community (Qin et al., 2020 ). As Ghosh (2005)  said, the use of ecosystem services in the EKW is integral to the ecological character and to local stakeholders. Our results demonstrated that the community users perceived the ecosystem services arising from the wetlands as being much more important as compared to the perceptions of the private wetland users. For instance, provisioning services like supplying food for consumption, firewood, fodder, and wild edibles were not perceived to be beneficial amongst private wetland users, whereas they were perceived to be important by the users of community wetlands. Private users strongly acknowledged their livelihood dependency and the exchange of local knowledge as a beneficial service provided by the wetlands. However, the private users also acknowledged the importance of the wetlands for food consumption during the COVID-19 crisis period, when markets were not easily accessible. Recreational services like shade, shelter, protection from air and noise pollution, and water purification were highly valued by both the private users and the community users. In terms of the perceived threats to the existence of urban wetlands, the private users highlighted several threats and issues. Similar to many previous studies on urban wetlands (Plieninger et al., 2022; Murphy et al., 2019; Nagendra & Hanjagi, 2019 ), our analysis also highlights various perceptions related to the negative impacts of rapid and unplanned urban development. The EKW have undergone drastic urban transformations in the last decades, leading to large-scale shrinkage of the wetlands and depletion or reduction of ecosystem service provision and ecological richness (Ghosh & Das, 2019 ). Increasing rapid urban development and landscape transformation around Kolkata’s periphery challenge the management of the wetlands (Mondal et al., 2022 ). Our research indicates that private wetland users perceived themselves as being more susceptible to the threat of ownership issues than the community users. However, the community wetland users perceived their wetlands to be more vulnerable to the transformation of pond farms to agricultural land and to eventual encroachment by real estate developers. Community users were heavily reliant on traditional farming and aquaculture, which makes them more vulnerable to the impacts of land use change and rapid urban development. The community wetland users highlighted the importance of cattle herders in such landscapes to maintain and regulate ecosystem services. The cattle herders were displaced from their traditional lands, which were located in between the wastewater channels and the EKW, due to urban development. This displacement degraded the quality of wastewater inputs and disrupted the nutrient content of the wetlands, resulting in declines in fish production and quality. The community users were more affected than private users by this process, as they prefer to limit the use of additional pesticides, and this was expressed in their perceptions of the ecosystem services of the wetlands. This process affected the entirety of the wetlands, but only community users mentioned it as a concerning reason for wetland degradation and poor landscape planning. The roles of informal resource users like grazers and harvesters in UBI is deserving of further investigation. Rapid urban development has caused significant losses of biodiversity, local communities and traditional practices, and augmented vulnerabilities and inequalities, especially in cities of the Global South (Mundoli et al., 2017 ). The EKW have been undergoing such changes and losses for a long time. Although there is little doubt about the importance of urban blue and green infrastructure in achieving the SDGs in cities (Fuldauer et al., 2022 ), there are surprisingly few studies on how SDG targets and their relation to UBI are understood locally. Our analysis provided contextual insights into how local engagement with SDGs could help to achieve a sustainable food system in the city under two different governance models. We were particularly interested in how the community and the private users perceive the ecosystem services contribution to the overall SDG model. SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (reduced inequality), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land) were acknowledged by the respondents as being served by the wetlands. However, community wetlands users related the EKW to more SDGs than the private wetland users (Fig. 5 ). Several studies have found that local governments have successfully implemented SDG targets in planning (Hartley, 2019; Leavesley et al., 2022 ). Compared to private management schemes, the local management practices of the community wetlands are better equipped to respond to rapid urban development issues and climate impacts, and support nutrition and health outcomes that are more aligned with SDG targets. However, the proportion of community-managed wetlands has declined drastically over the past decades as private management schemes take over. If the community wetlands continue to be transferred to private management systems, the effective contributions of the wetlands towards achieving the 2030 UN Agenda will be reduced significantly. Although neither the community nor private wetland user groups were explicitly aware of the SDG 2030 targets, the community-managed wetlands are more engaged with actions that align with the SDGs and support achieving the 2030 UN agenda. By introducing the SDG 2030 goals, we intended to demonstrate that the actions of community management practices align with the global SDG framework, which also aligns with the targets of regional policymakers. Similar to what was found in other case studies (Maconachie et al., 2008; Velez et al., 2018 ), local wetland user groups play a critical role in managing and maintaining the wetlands, and also have the ability to significantly influence local decision-making. The differing perceptions of the two wetland user groups toward the ecosystem services provided by wetlands and how these relate to the SDGs demonstrate the greater ability of the community users to recognize the multiple beneficial services supported by the wetlands and their wider impacts, and thus provide evidence that incorporating the expertise of local communities can be of considerable value in decision-making processes for sustainable development policy (Etzion, 2018 ).  5 Conclusion Although the present study focused on local perceptions of the wetlands in Kolkata, our findings are of general interest to urban planning, especially in the Global South. The results of this study revealed the importance of understanding the local perceptions of the provision of ecosystem services and threats to the ecosystem, in order to identify the values and disvalues of stakeholders before preparing a sustainable conservation plan. First, our survey revealed that community wetland users readily recognize their local landscape as providing various ecosystem services. They are dependent on the wetlands for daily food consumption, fodder for livestock, firewood, timber wood, and medicinal purposes. Community-based wetland management accommodates a wide range of stakeholders from local urban neighborhoods. Therefore, a wider variety of ecosystem services are perceived beyond those of economic or labor importance. Private management practices were generally associated with a lack of recognition of the provisioning services of wetlands, resulting in limited acknowledgement of ecosystem services but high significant perceived threats. Second, community management provides more room for local outcomes that are aligned with the SDGs to emerge from the landscape. Respondents from the community-managed wetlands acknowledged the linkages of the SDGs with the ecosystem services provided by the local landscape. The contribution of UBI toward the SDG outcomes is acknowledged globally, but increased local awareness of and receptiveness to the SDGs supports relevance to promote informed decision-making in urban planning. Finally, the community-managed wetlands facilitate participatory and inclusive management. The community users associate their wetlands with strong emotional, philosophical, and cognitive values which go beyond the economic dimension. Local decision-making processes will lay the groundwork for the future of these landscapes. Therefore, it is essential to bring attention to the perceptions of the local communities and understand their visions in order to identify pathways for a desirable and sustainable urban future. Our study reveals that community-managed wetlands provide more benefits toward sustainable development than privately managed ones and that they thus deserve protection. Local governments should therefore prioritize community wetland users and include them in their management and planning activities. Incentives should be introduced for these community users to achieve milestones and aids for combating threats collectively. Younger generations should be particularly encouraged to maintain and revitalize traditional knowledge and management practices. Collective meetings in regular intervals and collaborative approaches to management may be helpful to achieve this. Urban sustainability planning strategies should also consider the issue of declining community management schemes, better understand the local contexts and local perceptions of urban wetlands and their relation to the SDGs; they should develop visions and design constructive plans to achieve such visions.
