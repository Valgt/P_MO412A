                  The deforestation and burning of the Amazon and other rainforests is having a cascade of effects on global climate, biodiversity, human health and local and regional socioeconomics. This challenging situation demands a sustainable exploitation of the region's resources in accordance with the United Nations (UNs) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to meet Good Environmental Status and reduce poverty. The management of forests sustainability spans across at least eight of the 17 UN SDGs mainly to combat desertification, halt biodiversity loss, and reverse land degradation. Significant changes are needed if we are to sustain the world's rainforests and thereby the global climate and biodiversity. These measures and mitigations are of global responsibility requiring both developed and developing nations such as the United States, EU, and China to change their policies and stand regarding their high demand for meat and hardwood. When possible, non-profit tree-planting internet browsers should be implemented by governments and institutions. So far, there is a lack of active use of the UN SDGs and the countries must therefore need to fully adopt the UN SDGs in order to help the situation. One way to enforce this could be through imposing economic penalties to governments and national institutions that do not adhere to for example publishing open access of data and other important information relevant for the mission of the UN SDGs.

Fig. 4   Fig. 5 The industrial chain and value structure of forestry and agriculture. Agriculture products are kept in stable and low price to ensure basic subsistence in food and clothing, achieving financial stability. On the contrary, primary products from forest have much higher value than agriculture products. Conventionally exploration of natural forest resources allows the forestry community to increase their income, achieving financial security or slightly better to achieve financial freedom. The advanced utilization of forestry raw materials maximized through production of wood-based panel, pulp, biochar, biomedicine, cosmetics, biopesticides and functional essential oils allows compensation of increasing costs of raw materials and empowers forestry communities to achieve financial affluence.

Editor: Elena Paoletti The deforestation and burning of the Amazon and other rainforests is having a cascade of effects on global climate, biodiversity, human health and local and regional socioeconomics. This challenging situation demands a sustainable exploitation of the region's resources in accordance with the United Nations (UNs) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to meet Good Environmental Status and reduce poverty. The management of forests sustainability spans across at least eight of the 17 UN SDGs mainly to combat desertification, halt biodiversity loss, and reverse land degradation. Significant changes are needed if we are to sustain the world's rainforests and thereby the global climate and biodiversity. These measures and mitigations are of global responsibility requiring both developed and developing nations such as the United States, EU, and China to change their policies and stand regarding their high demand for meat and hardwood. When possible, non-profit tree-planting internet browsers should be implemented by governments and institutions. So far, there is a lack of active use of the UN SDGs and the countries must therefore need to fully adopt the UN SDGs in order to help the situation. One way to enforce this could be through imposing economic penalties to governments and national institutions that do not adhere to for example publishing open access of data and other important information relevant for the mission of the UN SDGs.   Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image       Keywords Amazon  UN SDG  Climate change  Human health  Ecology  Policy    1 Introduction The world's rainforests are found in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. These forests have sustained human existence for more than 10,000 years and part of this has been the way that the forests control the regional climate including precipitation that is important for agroforestry and farming (Moreno-Mayar et al., 2018 ; Qin et al., 2019 ; Werth and Avissar, 2002 ). These rainforests such as the Amazon also affects the global weather systems, so cutting down the forests significantly increases the effects of climate change, threatening the world's biodiversity and causing local desertification and soil erosion (Esquivel-Muelbert et al., 2019 ). The current fire activities and deforestation especially in the Amazon therefore have consequences for global sustainability, ecosystem, and poverty. The Amazon and other rainforests also bind CO2  out of the atmosphere, reducing the carbon footprint and thereby climate change including global warming (Popkin, 2019 ). For example, the value of planting 1000 hm2  can lead to a sequestration of more than a million tons of CO2  (Fig. 1  ). The fast removal of large rainforest areas in Brazil has severe consequences for climate change regionally and the associated global biodiversity and sustainability (Fonseca et al., 2019 ; Lapola et al., 2019 ). In addition, global warming affects global economy in a way that increases the risk of armed conflicts through lack of food sources and clean water (Froese and Schilling, 2019 ; Yumashev et al., 2019 ). The derivation from this trade war accelerates deforestation of the Amazon due to the increasing demand of food such as soya beans (Fuchs et al., 2019 ). Fuchs et al. (2019)  estimated that the Brazilian soya-bean production might increase by almost 40% equal to 13 million hectares or the same as the area of Bangladesh based on numbers from the last 25 years from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In addition to this, the global demand for meat production is leading to deforestation in for example the Northern Brazil for livestock such as cattle (Schiermeier, 2019 ). This very complicated situation demands global actions and a concrete use of UNs SDGs that through binding agreements will lead to Good Environmental Status as discussed below.  2 The effects of deforestation Deforestation and burning of rainforests have been on-going for decades (Anonymous, 2019 ). From January to August 2019, Brazilian Amazon has experienced 74,155 fires and destroyed more than 9700 km2  of the rainforest, which is an 85% increase in comparison to the previous year (Freedman, 2019 ; Richard et al., 2019 ). Recently, fires have been deliberately used in clearing trees in the Amazon for developing agricultural or pastoral lands due to intensified farm activities for food production (Ribeiro et al., 2018 ). A recent study found that deforestation and burning outbreaks contribute to severe drought in certain regions of the Amazon, which are likely to have adverse effects to farming in the area (Stabile et al., 2019 ). The widespread use of fire to remove rain forest not only threatens its rich biodiversity but also releases greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4 ), carbon monoxide (CO), CO2 , water and ozone precursors into the atmosphere and that causes global warming (Soares Neto et al., 2011 ). This recent deforestation and burn-down of the Amazon destabilize global climate and threaten biodiversity and overall sustainability (Popkin, 2019 ). The Amazon being the largest rainforest in the world absorbs more greenhouse gases compared to other tropical rainforest. Cutting down the Amazon rainforest changes the global climate due to increased CO2  emissions (Anonymous, 2020 ; Fonseca et al., 2019 ; Lapola et al., 2019 ; Tollefson, 2010 ). However, it is also a threat to the local climate that is very much depending on the rainforest and the creation of precipitation due to lack of humidity brought in from the ocean (Raymond, 2005 ). The rainforest regulates local climate through heat absorption, evaporation, transpiration, exchange of atmospheric gases, and generation of rainfall (Stabile et al., 2019 ). Thus, removing rainforest alters the local climate regulation including water cycles (Fig. 2  ), which may change the distribution of rainfall, pattern of ocean current and global weather (Malhi et al., 2008 ; Raymond, 2005 ). This condition leads to drought and increased temperature that may contribute to the death of vulnerable trees in the forest as they are not able to adapt to the changing climate; thus, creating a cycle that may lead to further deforestation (Malhi et al., 2008 ). In particular, the extensive deforestation in the southern Amazon region has detained the arrival of the rainy season and reduced the plant growing season (by lessening water vapor flux to the atmosphere) (Stabile et al., 2019 ). Burning down the Amazon is directly affecting local and global biodiversity as rainforests in general bind CO2  from the atmosphere which counteract desertification, soil erosion, carbon footprint and climate change (Fig. 1 ; Tables 1, 2   ) (Peng et al., 2019 ; Popkin, 2019 ). Other than Amazon, the exacerbating deforestation also occurs in other regions such as Indonesia that has gained significant attention globally due to the massive emission of particulate matter and pollutants from illegal forest activities (Tacconi and Muttaqin, 2019 ; Tacconi et al., 2019 ). Large-scale cultivation of monoculture boom crops and unrestrained extraction of natural resources including palm oil and rubber agroforests, as well as poor law enforcement, have led to this uncontrolled situation (Krishna et al., 2017 ; Kunz et al., 2017 ; Tacconi et al., 2019 ). In India, mining is the main activity that contributes to deforestation in several districts. In particular, the mining of minerals such as limestone, iron and coal is shown to have large adverse impact on the depletion of forest compared to other mining types (Ranjan, 2019 ). Similarly, gold mining activities in Guyana of South America has contributed to forest depletion of 9000 ha which equals to 90% of the total deforestation in 2009 (Lowe, 2014 ). The mining activities are not only responsible for the loss of forest area but also adversely affect biodiversity in the regions. In addition, the recent Australian wildfire has caused significant damage to biodiversity and habitats causing for example extinction risk of the koala as a species (Lam et al., 2020 ). As previously pointed out by reviews in the literature, the situation is very complex and differs between regions, urbanization, infrastructure and types of forests. This requires a deeper understanding of the complexity and interactions between climate change, forest wildfire and the ecosystem services provided by the forests including the communities and socioeconomics (McWethy et al., 2019 ). A mapping is useful to address the risks associated with the economy, environment and society, pinpointing where there is a need to completely stop the fires and where it is having unfavorable or may be desirable effects. This could help dealing with the situation though it is likely not possible to adhere to the ideal planning and thus being able to completely control wildfires and the multiple associated conflicts (Moritz et al., 2014 ).  3 Human health The incomplete combustion of wood from deforestation and burning of rainforests leads to emission of particulate matter (PM), poisonous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, and ozone precursors to large cities, which causes cardio-pulmonary disease and cancer (de Oliveira Alves et al., 2015 ; Targino et al., 2019 ). PAHs are mutagenic due to their intervention with DNA mechanisms (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016 ). In the Amazon, the presence of particularly nitro- and oxy-PAHs has been associated with life time cancer risk (LCR), indicating that the exposure may be associated with mutations and DNA lesions (de Oliveira Galvão et al., 2018 ). Unfortunately, this is not only an Amazon regional problem but applies to several continents including Brazil, Columbia, and Indonesia where deforestation is a common praxis (Permadi and Kim Oanh, 2013 ; Vasconcellos et al., 2010 ; Wentworth et al., 2018 ). In China, where PAH is released from coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coking industries, biomass burning and petroleum volatilization, has also been associated with increased risk of lung cancer (Yan et al., 2019 ). Other than PAHs, burning forest activity also emits PM which contains heterogeneous mixture of chemicals with spatial and temporal changes according to the emission source (de Oliveira Galvão et al., 2018 ). A recent study in Greece showed that the high PAH levels emitted from biomass burning is more toxic compared to the PM that originates from other sources (de Oliveira Alves et al., 2015 ). Therefore, the emission of PAHs from burning forest should be controlled through air quality management due to the severe health risk (e.g., carcinogenic and mutagenic potential) posed by PAHs exposure (de Oliveira Alves et al., 2015 ). It must be acknowledged that it remains a challenge as to what extent that is at all possible, however, it could be integrated into the above-mentioned management plans needed for wildfire mitigation coupled with actions including weather forecasts as well as zones prohibited for burning forests close to large cities (McWethy et al., 2019 ; Moritz et al., 2014 ). In addition, biomass burning produces nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can lead to the formation of ozone (Koplitz et al., 2018 ). It has been reported that approximately 1.04–1.23 million respiratory deaths in adults was attributed to ozone exposure (Xie et al., 2019 ). Deforestation and burning of the Amazon rain forest also drive diseases transmission such as malaria, in which increment of 10% in deforestation led to 3.3% increase in the occurrence of malaria (MacDonald and Mordecai, 2019 ). This is mainly due to the existence of human-altered landscapes and woodland edge habitat that promoted the formation of breeding habitat for anopheles mosquitoes which increased their survival and subsequently encouraged transmission of malaria by expanding human–vector contact (Fraser, 2010 ).  4 Climate change and tipping points Climate change alters the average precipitation and temperature which in turn causes loss of climate-driven habitats and populations, rise of ocean temperature, and transmission of infectious diseases (Launay et al., 2020 ; Mittermeier et al., 2011 ). Ectotherms animals sensitive to temperature rise and depend on surrounding heat sources to regulate their body temperature, have experienced range shifts, phenology change and population decline in response to global warming and climate change (Huang et al., 2020 ). Based on these impacts, sustainable development practices and policies have been initiated worldwide given that the Brazilian deforestation is among the 9 major climate tipping points recently recognized by Lenton et al. (2019) . In London, for instance, a protest of Extinction Rebellion Climate Change on April 2019 had resulted in 1130 arrests and 69 charges (Bain and Bongiorno, 2020 ; BBC, 2019 ). This protest demanded UK government for a declaration of climate emergency, legal commitment on carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and formation of public assembly to solve this crisis (BBC, 2019 ). Moreover, withdrawals by global leaders in international climate cooperation raise other forms of global co-operation scepticism including the withdrawal by Japan, Canada and Russia from the second commitment period (2012–2015) of the Kyoto protocol (Fjellvang, 2015 ) and the US from the Paris agreement (Hersher, 2019 ). The idea of climate tipping points by Lenton et al. (2019)  including Amazon rainforest, Arctic sea ice, Atlantic circulation, boreal forest, coral reefs, Greenland ice sheet, permafrost, West Antarctic ice sheet, Wilkes Basin helps to define the state of climate emergency and urgent call for climate action when global warming exceeds between 1 and 2 °C. The Amazon being the largest rainforest in the world could lead to a tipping point of 20% loss of forest-cover and 40% of deforestation (Lenton et al., 2019 ). Exceeding this tipping point disrupts carbon release back to the atmosphere and globally changes are needed to avoid a global catastrophe (Peng et al., 2020 ). A sustainable development of the Amazon region is needed and should be surveilled using objective measures in order to continuously evaluate the process and developments regarding limitations in deforestation (Finer et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, mitigation actions of climate change lead to public scepticism of uncertain future outcomes and economic costs. Although most people are convinced that anthropogenic activities have massively induced climate change, there are still large communities that believe those affirmations on climate change mitigation are being overemphasized without having an effective enforcement (Akter et al., 2012 ). Climate change policies and mitigations should appraise the economic and social benefits to overcome public fright for comfort adjustments in their livelihoods and communities. In order to garner public support, those environmental stakeholders must be of high moral without any personal hidden agendas and lead good examples for the public to follow such as practising sustainable lifestyles (Bain and Bongiorno, 2020 ). Herein, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) possess a significant platform in influencing public perceptions regarding climate change through knowledge transfer, educational programs and research (Zobeidi et al., 2020 ). Knowledge and education are important for public perceptions and essential for the motivation of mitigation and changes in behaviours (Zobeidi et al., 2020 ). Climate change knowledge should comprise science, factors, impacts, process, trend and mitigations of climate change. Numerous sustainable innovations have been collectively established by HEIs around world to revamp a green campus in for example the US, Canada and UK (Plymouth, n.d. ; Urbanski, 2019 ). Green campus is an educational institution concept based on sustainable living practices by the campus committees (Sisriany and Fatimah, 2017 ). In USA for example, the California State University has installed rooftop solar systems while Thompson Rivers University in Canada provided free bike access to students and employees (Urbanski, 2019 ). Plymouth University in the UK, on the contrary, aims for sustainable campus by reducing water consumption to less than 3.3 m3  per student per annum and waste recycling for at least 70% of waste generated in the campus.  5 Non-profit/tree-planting internet browsers as a new tool? In Denmark, Aarhus University Departments have implemented the non-profit tree-planting internet browser Ecosia  to advocate global tree planting projects. The funds generated by this green initiative goes to planting one tree every 30 s which could lead to planting of well above one million trees yearly that sequester 380,000 tons of CO2  (Peng et al., 2020 ). In fact, planting 1000 hm2  of tree sequestrates a million tons of CO2 , which is equal to that emitted by 213,000 of passenger vehicles driven for a year (Agency, 2020 ). The global mapping of the non-profit internet browser shows that more than 70 active students have driven university campaigns in North America, South America, Europe and South East Asia (Blog, 2019 ). Fig. 3   illustrates the mapping of tree planting based on this revenue. The CO2  sequestration from environment through the newly-implemented tree-planting internet browser could thereby reduce climate change, desertification and soil erosion (Popkin, 2019 ). It also helps to clean the air through absorbing pollutant gases and filtering out particulates, and forests regulate water cycles and help providing food and ecosystem diversity. Although the tree plantations have remarkable effect on environment, a proper selection of tree species is needed to avoid potential emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) such as isoprene and α-pinene that may contribute to the increase of ozone level (Sicard et al., 2018 ). Despite the global efforts to mitigate climate change, the effectiveness is highly debatable and controversial among the public worldwide. Several studies reveal public scepticism towards the mitigation of climate change and have doubts on environmental groups especially politicians for taking actions without careful considerations. Those environmental groups are likely to harm the world's economies and human welfare, and fail to bring positive effects on climate change. Therefore, adopting suggestions from higher education institutions to reduce carbon emissions is likely to have significant results on the public doubts. Thus, innovative effort from universities to implement the non-profit tree-planting internet browser shall be encouraged also in the public so that everyone can help in mitigating climate change.  6 Socioeconomics Forestry is closely linked to socioeconomics and poverty. It has been estimated that Brazil may loss trillions of dollars if the Amazon no longer produces rain for the country's crops over the next 30 years (Lapola et al., 2018 ). This is a dilemma, as the production of soya beans has led to massive deforestation in the Amazon, which damages approximately 20% of the Amazon's forest cover, which again affects the rainfall (Arruda et al., 2019 ). Green poverty is a new social phenomenon where products from forestry and farming are sold with low profit (Fig. 4 ) (Jonsson et al., 2015 ; Wade, 1973 ). In China for example, each person of the community in forestry areas is generally allocated with 1 km2  of forest land, and based on an estimated labour income of 5 USD per day (The-World-Bank, 2015 ), the income generated from forestation is equivalent to only 415–754 USD/km2 /year excluding the labour costs (Table S1 ) (Peltzer et al., 2015 ). Unfortunately, the number of poor communities in forestry areas in South Asia and Africa are also increasing (The-World-Bank, 2017 ). Efforts to promote and implement reforestation by countries like China is now undertaken after years of deforestation for urban development (Gerlein-Safdi et al., 2020 ; Yao et al., 2019 ). While forestation is extremely important, it has to be done in a socioeconomic sustainable way in order not to lead to unexpected low living standards with respect to food, clothing and housing (Fig. 5 ) (Akhter and Rahut, 2018 ; The-World-Bank, 2017 ). Such phenomenon of ‘green poverty’ happens partly because cement and steel have replaced the use of wood as building materials; and coal, natural gas, biogas and hydrogen as fuel (Adam and Eltayeb, 2016 ; Akhter and Rahut, 2018 ). Forestry is closely linked to socioeconomics and poverty. It has been estimated that Brazil may loss trillions of dollars if the Amazon no longer produces rain for the country's crops over the next 30 years (Lapola et al., 2018 ). This is a dilemma, as the production of soya beans has led to massive deforestation in the Amazon, which damages approximately 20% of the Amazon's forest cover, which again affects the rainfall (Arruda et al., 2019 ).

Unfortunately, the number of poor communities in forestry areas in South Asia and Africa are also increasing (The-World-Bank, 2017 ). Efforts to promote and implement reforestation by countries like China is now undertaken after years of deforestation for urban development (Gerlein-Safdi et al., 2020 ; Yao et al., 2019 ). While forestation is extremely important, it has to be done in a socioeconomic sustainable way in order not to lead to unexpected low living standards with respect to food, clothing and housing (Fig. 5 ) (Akhter and Rahut, 2018 ; The-World-Bank, 2017 ). Such phenomenon of ‘green poverty’ happens partly because cement and steel have replaced the use of wood as building materials; and coal, natural gas, biogas and hydrogen as fuel (Adam and Eltayeb, 2016 ; Akhter and Rahut, 2018 ).   China has carried out large-scale forest plantations in an effort to curb the trend of climate change and desertification while also developing national parks and new plant-based pharmaceuticals (Tollefson, 2010 ). China articulated its new forest policy, The Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP), in 1998 in order to achieve several goals such as (i) restoration of natural forests in ecologically sensitive areas, (ii) forests plantation for soil and water protection, and timber production, (iv) protection of existing natural forests from excessive cutting, and (v) maintenance of multiple-use policy in natural forests (Zhang et al., 2000 ). In order to successfully implement the NFCP, the central government of China has invested more than a billion USD during 1998–2000 for this program. As a result, there was a decline of timber harvests in China's natural forests from 32 million m3  in 1997 to 23 million m3  in 1999 (Zhang et al., 2000 ).  7 The United Nations sustainability goals The devastating removal of rainforest demands a sustainable exploitation of the regions resources in accordance with UNs SDGs to meet Good Environmental Status. The management of forests sustainability spans across at least 8 of the 17 UN SDGs with the goal to combat desertification, halt biodiversity loss, and reverse land degradation (UnitedNation, 2020 ). Significant changes are needed if we are to save the world's rainforests and thereby the global climate and biodiversity. For instance, changing consumer behavior and global reduction on meat consumption through public education, eating less meat and buying meat that is sustainably produced may benefit the environment (Fuchs et al., 2019 ). The problems is that there is no binding agreement for UN SDGs and therefore the world is relying on governments and scientists to commit funding and data to sustain a collaborative global protection of the world's rainforests (Lu et al., 2015 ). Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) should develop more initiatives in order to strengthen the platform to advocate sustainable development and public support for rainforests and the socioeconomics by connecting to the global initiatives and movements for UN SDGs, e.g. the green campus and tree planting internet browser to support UN SDGS 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land). This also means that the data, findings, and particularly the measurement and impact of implementation of the initiatives based on UN SDGs should be available under open access and that there is a system available to monitor that this is in fact happening. One way to enforce this could be through imposing economic penalties to governments and national institutions that do not adhere to for example publishing open access to data and other important information relevant for the mission of the UN SDGs. These measures and mitigations are a global responsibility requiring the United States, China and the EU to change their policies and stand regarding the high demand for meat and hardwood. For example, Brazilian authorities have enforced Brazil's Soy Moratorium to reduce the transformation of forest into cropland by preventing major traders from buying soya grown on deforested lands (Fuchs et al., 2019 ). During 2004 until 2012, Brazil has successfully curbing deforestation by more than 80% and reduced carbon emissions in Brazil (Anonymous, 2019 ), but this achievement is now menaced with the increment in reprobate logging and a series of disastrous changes to its environmental policies by Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro (Arruda et al., 2019 ). The rain forests and especially the Amazon have previously been called the lungs of our planet. This may not be entirely true but it definitely shows the importance of this wide-ranging ecosystem affecting our entire globe.  8 Conclusions The Amazon and other rainforests are burning and this very complicated situation demands a sustainable exploitation of the region's resources in accordance with UNs SDGs an in order to meet Good Environmental Status. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) should develop more initiatives in order to strengthen the platform to advocate sustainable development and public support for rainforests and the socioeconomics by connecting to the global initiatives and movements for UN SDGs, e.g. the green campus and tree planting internet browser to support UN SDGS 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land).
