               The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a global call to improve lives of everyone, leaving no one behind, by 2030. They recognize health as a cornerstone of development and serve as a platform to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all.
               COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how a health crisis may have intersecting flow-on effects on global sustainable development by affecting the progress of all SDGs.
               Urbanization is one of the leading global trends of the 21st century that has a significant impact on health. Cities have a huge responsibility and opportunity to promote healthier urban environments.
               The way we plan and build our cities defines our quality of life. It affects not only the quality of our living spaces and transport, but also the air we breathe, the water we drink, and our access to nutritious food, education, health care services, and employment.
               Transportation has an impact on the environment and human health. Sustainable transport plays a fundamental role in improving social equity, health, resilience of cities, and urban–rural linkages.

They recognize health as a cornerstone of development and serve as a platform to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all. COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how a health crisis may have intersecting flow-on effects on global sustainable development by affecting the progress of all SDGs. Urbanization is one of the leading global trends of the 21st century that has a significant impact on health. Cities have a huge responsibility and opportunity to promote healthier urban environments. The way we plan and build our cities defines our quality of life. It affects not only the quality of our living spaces and transport, but also the air we breathe, the water we drink, and our access to nutritious food, education, health care services, and employment. Transportation has an impact on the environment and human health. Sustainable transport plays a fundamental role in improving social equity, health, resilience of cities, and urban–rural linkages.   Keywords Agenda 2030  Air pollution  COVID 19  Decade of action  Development health  Health promotion  HiAP  MDGs  New urban agenda  SDGs  Sustainability  Sustainable Development Goals  Sustainable transport    Sustainable Development Goals The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone. The Goals were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, as part of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development (United Nations, 2015 ), which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the goals. The SDGs are composed by 17 goals and 169 targets, which are integrated and indivisible, global in nature, and universally applicable, taking into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development, and respecting national policies and priorities. The Goals recognize the link between sustainable development and other relevant ongoing processes in the economic, social, and environmental fields. The SDGs replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2000 to tackle extreme poverty and hunger. For 15 years, the MDGs drove progress in several important areas: reducing income poverty, providing much needed access to water and sanitation, driving down child mortality, and drastically improving maternal health. Most significantly, the MDGs made huge strides in combating HIV/AIDS and other treatable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The MDGs were revolutionary in providing a common language to reach global agreement, and its achievements provide the international community with valuable lessons and experience to begin work on the new goals. However, the MDGs only applied to developing countries, while the SDGs apply universally to all UN Member States, and they are considerably more comprehensive and ambitious than the MDGs. The SDGs were the result of over two years of intensive public consultation and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders around the works, which paid particular attention to the voices of the poorest and the most vulnerable. The Global Goals • Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere  • Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture  • Goal 3.

Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development (Fig. 1  ).     SDGs Monitoring and Reporting The Sustainable Development Goals are not legally binding. Nevertheless, countries are expected to take ownership and establish a national framework for achieving the 17 goals. Implementation and success rely on countries own sustainable development policies, plans, and programs. Besides financial implications, the most significant challenge to the universal implementation of the SDGs include capacities for progress monitoring. Actions at national and subnational level to monitor progress require quality, accessible and timely data collection and regional follow-up and review. The UN provide the Global Indicator Framework for Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2020a ) that allow to monitor and review the 17 goals and 169 targets using a set of global indicators. Governments are requested to develop their own national indicators to assist in monitoring progress. The follow-up and review process is informed by an annual SDG Progress Report to be prepared by the Secretary-General. The report provides an overview of the world's implementation efforts to date, highlighting areas of progress and where more action needs to be taken. The SDG Report 2020 states that an estimated 71 million people are expected to be pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020, the first rise in global poverty since 1998. In addition, the effects of COVID-19 pandemic are already visible. The more than one billion slum dwellers worldwide are acutely at risk from the pandemic, suffering from a lack of adequate housing, no running water at home, shared toilets, little, or no waste management systems, overcrowded public transport and limited access to formal health care facilities. (United Nations, 2020b ). The high-level political forum on sustainable development is the annual meetings playing a central role in reviewing progress toward the SDGs at the global level. The Forum adopts intergovernmentally negotiated political declarations.  In addition, understanding that 65% of the SDGs could not be achieved unless local governments are fully and equitably involved in implementation (UCLG, UN-Habitat, 2020 ), since 2016 local and regional governments monitor and report progress they have made in localizing SDGs and the other global agendas. In 2018, the city of New York was among the first to produce voluntary local reviews (VLRs), organic self-assessing documents, which aimed to complete the information and data on SDG implementation that national governments are already providing, yearly, at the high-level political forum.  The Decade of Action (2020–30) In September 2019, the UN Secretary-General called on society to mobilize for a decade of action to accelerate SDGs implementation. The decade of action (2020–2030) is deployed on three levels: global action to secure greater leadership, more resources, and smarter solutions for the SDGs; local action embedding the needed transition in the policies, budgets, institutions and regulatory frameworks of local governments; and people action, including by youth, civil society, the private sector, the media, unions, academia, and other stakeholders.   Health and Development Health is a cornerstone of development. Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to global sustainable development. In 2017, only around one third to half of the global population was covered by essential health services. If current trends continue, only 39%–63% of the global population will be covered by essential health services by 2030 (United Nations, 2020b ). Recognizing this interdependence, the  SDGs provide an ambitious and comprehensive plan of action for ending the injustices that underpin poor health. Goal 3 is focused on good health and well-being. It takes into account widening economic and social inequalities, rapid urbanization, threats to the climate and the environment, the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, and emerging challenges such as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Also, universal health coverage will be integral to achieving SDG 3, ending poverty, and reducing inequalities. But health is also part of many of the 17 SDGs’ indicators and targets—and, at the same time, action on health-related aspects of these SDGs is essential to achieve many of the targets for SDG 3. Following a research led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGLOBAL), at least 48 SDG targets are relevant to urban health, corresponding to 15 SDGs, mainly captured by SDG 3 and SDG 11 on inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities (Ramirez-Rubio et al., 2019 ) (Fig. 2  ). In this sense, SDGs provide a platform for intersectoral work facilitating a “Health in All Policies” (HiAP) approach. HiAP is based on the recognition that our greatest health challenges—for example, noncommunicable diseases, health inequities and inequalities, climate change, and spiraling health care costs—are highly complex and often linked through the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age, and the wider set of forces and systems affecting these circumstances: for example, economic and development policies, social norms, social policies, and political systems. In this context, promoting healthy communities, and in particular health equity across different population groups, requires that we address the social determinants of health, such as public transportation, education access, access to healthy food, economic opportunities, and more. While many public policies work to achieve this, conflicts of interest may arise. Alternatively, unintended impacts of policies are not measured and addressed. This requires innovative solutions, and structures that build channels for dialogue and decision-making that work across traditional government policy siloes (WHO, 2014 ). Shanghai Declaration on Promoting Health in 2030 Agenda The outcome of the Ninth Global Conference on Health Promotion (Shanghai, 21–24 November 2016), jointly organized by the Government of China and WHO, was the concise Shanghai Declaration on Health Promotion (WHO, 2016 ). It was endorsed by the over 1260 participants of the Conference from 131 countries, including 81 ministers and 123 mayors. The Shanghai Declaration recognizes health and well-being as essential to achieving sustainable development. The principal message is that health is a political issue and, therefore, political commitments are crucial. In this sense, the declaration pretends to provide guidance to UN Member States on how to reflect promoting health into national SDGs responses and how to accelerate action. Health promotion is about enabling and empowering people, communities, and societies to take change of their own health and quality of life. The declaration highlights three pillars of health promotion:Good governance : strengthening governance and policies to make healthy choices accessible and affordable to all; and to create sustainable systems that make whole-of-society collaboration real.Healthy cities : creating greener cities that enable people to live, work, and play in harmony and good health.Health literacy : increasing knowledge and social skills to help people to make the healthiest choices and decision for their families and themselves. One of the recommended actions on the healthy cities area is to design our cities to promote sustainable urban mobility, walking and physical activity through attractive and green neighborhoods, active transport infrastructure, strong road safety laws, and accessible play and leisure facilities.   COVID-19 Pandemic's Impact in Global Development In 2020, the world faced a global health crisis unlike any other. Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spread human suffering, destabilizing the global economy, and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe. The pandemic shown that in rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty; hence what began as a health crisis quickly became a human and socio-economic crisis. In March 2020, the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, reported how the COVID-19 crisis was likely to have a profound and negative effect on sustainable development efforts. A prolonged global economic slowdown may adversely impact the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (United Nations, 2020c ). The most vulnerable, including women, children, the elderly, and informal workers, were hit the hardest. The impact on the environment, on the other hand, was likely to be positive on the short term, as the drastic reduction in economic activity reduced CO2  emissions and pollution in many areas. However, unless countries deliver on their commitment to sustainable development once the crisis is over and the global economy restarts, such improvements are destined to be short-lived.  The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) mapped how COVID-19 affected each of the SDGs, from disruption to food supplies (SDG 2) to increased levels of violence against women (SDG 5). This conceptual mapping, while simple, shows the value of the SDGs as a framework for understanding the intersecting flow-on effects of a health crisis (Fig. 3  ). While the crisis is imperiling progress toward the SDGs, it also makes their achievement all the more urgent and necessary. It is essential that recent gains are protected as much as possible. A transformative recovery from COVID-19 should be pursued, one that addresses the crisis, reduces risks from future potential crises and relaunched the implementation efforts to deliver the 2030 Agenda and SDGs during the decade of action.   Urban Environment and Health Cities have a huge responsibility and opportunity to promote healthier urban environments. Urbanization is one of the leading global trends of the 21st century that has a significant impact on health. Since 2007, over half of the world's population live in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to raise 66% by 2050 (UN-Habitat, 2018 ). As most future urban growth will take place in developing countries, the world today has a unique opportunity to guide urbanization in a way that protects and promote health. Urban areas will be increasingly critical for achieving all SDGs and integrating the social, economic and environmental goals set forth in the 2030 Agenda. It is, therefore, no surprise that SDGs 3 and 11 are strongly interlinked. Both goals have explicitly targeted improving road safety and air quality. Target 4 for cities directly links to health by aiming to reduce mortality due to disasters. Additionally, all targets of Goal 11 that aim to improve the living and working conditions of people in cities will support the achievement of the health goal. As an example, 7 million people die every year from exposure to fine particles in polluted air. Air pollution is a major cause of NCDs. Venerable populations are often at risk from a variety of sources, which may expose them to pollutants including vehicle emissions and industrial discharges. In an analysis of data from 3000 cities, 80% of them did not meet the recommended WHO air quality guidelines, a critical parameter being the presence of fine particulate matter, produced mainly by vehicle diesel-engines. The 60% of European cities, 20% of North American cities, and 40% of high-income Asian cities, fail to meet adequate air quality standards (Clos and Surinach, 2019 ). Furthermore, the increasing effects of climate change are now very evident. Climate change affects many of the social and environmental determinants of health—clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and secure shelter. According to WHO, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress. Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through better transport, food, and energy-use choices can result in improved health, particularly through reduced air pollution. Effective planning policies may significantly reduce this problem. Urban planning decisions can create or exacerbate major health risks for populations, or they can foster healthier environments, lifestyles, and create healthy and resilient cities and societies. On the other hand, urban design can help to reduce inequalities both in service provision and health status and lead to more inclusive and productive societies. Bad examples such as limited access, poor quality, or absence of open public spaces or whole districts built without taking into account the need for people to be able to access local amenities by walking drive an increase of NCDs pandemic. Noncommunicable diseases already account for nearly 70% of global deaths each year with rapid and unplanned urbanization being a major factor. Expanding networks for urban public transit, walking and cycling, particularly for vulnerable groups, and having access to more options for safe mobility can increase access to jobs and services, reduce risks of road injury and limit noise exposure (WHO, UNDP, 2016 ). The New Urban Agenda In 2016, the United Nations adopted the New Urban Agenda at the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III). The New Urban Agenda incorporates a new recognition of the correlation between good urbanization and development, and of the fundamental linkages between health and sustainable urban development. It further clarifies the importance of these linkages, and that health is not only about the provision of health care services, but also reflects on decades of experiences and advances in our understanding of how the shape and form of urban development influences the health of city residents (United Nations, 2016 ). The New Urban Agenda recognizes that effective urban planning, infrastructure development, and governance can mitigate risks and promote the health and well-being of urban populations. There is, however, a need to further address how specific urban policies can contribute to reducing disease burdens.   Transportation and Health Transport plays an essential role in our societies and economies. It provides access to jobs, education, services, amenities and leisure, while contributing to economic growth jobs and trade. At the same time, it has an impact on the environment and human health.   Close to a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions come from transport and these emissions are projected to grow substantially in the years to come, contributing to climate change. Other pollutants, most evidently in many urban centers, directly impact health; casualties and deaths from transport-related accidents are also on the rise (United Nations, 2020d ). Lack of Safety on the World's Roads Approximately 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes and road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of children and young people aged 5–29 years. According to the Global Status Report on Road Safety (WHO, 2018 ) the number of road traffic deaths continues to rise steadily. However, the rate of death relative to the size of the world's population remains constant. When considered in the context of the increasing global population and rapid motorization that has taken place over the same period, this suggests that existing road safety efforts may have mitigated the situation from getting worse. Middle- and high-income countries reported progress. However, not a single low-income country demonstrated a reduction in overall deaths. In fact, the risk of a road traffic death remains three times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The rates are highest in Africa (26.6 per 100,000 population) and lowest in Europe (9.3 per 100,000 population). In terms of regions, Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific are showing a decline in traffic deaths rates (Fig. 4  ). The SDGs, in its target 3.6, call for a 50% reduction in the number of road traffic deaths by 2020. The current progress remains far from sufficient to achieve the target. In the Stockholm Declaration, ministers and representatives of international, regional and subregional governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector, recognize that SDG target 3.6 will not be met by 2020 and that significant progress can only be achieved through stronger national leadership, global cooperation, implementation of evidence-based strategies and engagement with all relevant actors including the private sector, as well as additional innovative approaches (Third Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety: Achieving Global Goals 2030, 2020 ).  Sustainable Transport The role of transport in sustainable development was first recognized at the 1992 United Nation's Earth Summit and reinforced in its outcome document—Agenda 21. The global attention to transport has continued in recent years. World leaders recognized unanimously at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio + 20) that transportation and mobility are central to sustainable development. Sustainable transportation can enhance economic growth and improve accessibility. Sustainable transport achieves better integration of the economy while respecting the environment, improving social equity, health, resilience of cities, urban–rural linkages, and productivity of rural areas. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, sustainable transport is mainstreamed across several SDGs and targets, especially those related to food security, health, energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and cities and human settlements. Sustainable transport plays a fundamental role in overcoming the social exclusion of vulnerable groups. SDG target 11.2 explicitly calls on the international community to work toward sustainable transport for all people: “By 2030, provide access to  safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons.” It seeks to expand public transportation making it easy for vulnerable groups to use. Good mass transportation and high-density, compact urban design go hand in hand. Efficient planning will result in lower travel times and costs, especially if the right mix of walking and cycling facilities are combined with public transport and rapid transit systems. This must be done in such a way to reduce hazards for pedestrians and cyclists from motorized transport and, has been shown to greatly reduce the prevalence of NCDs. Encouraging less private motor vehicle use, impacts positively on air and noise pollution. Public transport can also help to promote equity in access to employment, educational and social amenities. Evidence indicates that significant health gains can be made from restricting the use of diesel engines for both commercial and private vehicles in dense urban systems. The exhaust gases are carcinogenic, and emit a greater proportion of small particulate matter, which is associated with increased stroke, heart and respiratory disease, and early death (WHO, 2003 ). In Mexico City, the reductions in air pollution resulted in a saving in 6100 days of lost work, together with reduced cases of bronchitis and deaths (WHO, UN-Habitat, 2016 ). Over the past 10 years, improved bus rapid transport systems serving around 1 million passengers a day, encouraged 10% of the population to leave their cars at home. Additionally, an innovative bike sharing program was developed which was integrated with the metro-rail and bus systems, offering one payment for all. Greater access to parks and green spaces was also made possible. Providing access through sustainable transport will require advances in three key areas: policy development and implementation, financing, and technological innovation. If rigorous action is pursued in each of these areas, together they will drive change and help individuals, businesses and governments mobilize sustainable transport.
