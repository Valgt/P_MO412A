                  Developing countries suffer poor solid waste management (SWM) systems. and setting priorities to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is urgent. The current research aims to assess Ugandan SWM system, and the main circular strategies implemented in the last decade to identify actions that should be prioritised towards a sustainable development. Low collection rates, unsound waste disposal, and poverty-driven recycling are the common issues that threaten the achievement of SDGs in Uganda. Waste collection improvement and construction of controlled sanitary landfills must be prioritised to reduce environmental contamination and avoid the generation of unsafe work for informal workers. End child labour, ensuring access to affordable and clean energy sources, and valorising local entrepreneurship in waste recycling are also fundamental actions to achieve an effective and inclusive SWM system. This review contributes to identify the priorities to start circular actions now, supporting decision makers in implementing policies and innovative solutions to assist the transition towards sustainable SWM systems in Uganda and the Global South.

Developing countries suffer poor solid waste management (SWM) systems. and setting priorities to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is urgent. The current research aims to assess Ugandan SWM system, and the main circular strategies implemented in the last decade to identify actions that should be prioritised towards a sustainable development. Low collection rates, unsound waste disposal, and poverty-driven recycling are the common issues that threaten the achievement of SDGs in Uganda. Waste collection improvement and construction of controlled sanitary landfills must be prioritised to reduce environmental contamination and avoid the generation of unsafe work for informal workers. End child labour, ensuring access to affordable and clean energy sources, and valorising local entrepreneurship in waste recycling are also fundamental actions to achieve an effective and inclusive SWM system. This review contributes to identify the priorities to start circular actions now, supporting decision makers in implementing policies and innovative solutions to assist the transition towards sustainable SWM systems in Uganda and the Global South.

They represent the tool to guide and support actions aimed to reach peace and welfare for people and the planet, integrating all the three aspects of sustainable development: environmental, social, and economic (UNDESA, 2015 ). Improving solid waste management (SWM) systems can accelerate the achievement of SDGs. This is crucial in low-income countries, which are often characterized by a lack of effective SWM systems due to poor planning strategies and implementation, scarce funds suppling, and absence of expertise and suitable technologies (Cobbinah et al., 2017 ; Ghanimeh et al., 2019 ; Guerrero et al., 2013 ). SWM practices represent a global concern in terms of environmental pollution, economic sustainability, human health, and social inclusion (Ferronato and Torretta, 2019 ; Gupta et al., 2015 ; Vitorino de Souza Melaré et al., 2017 ). Thus, SWM plays an important role in achieving SDGs both in developed and developing countries (Sharma et al., 2021 ). SWM and disposal practices, in 2016, were responsible for the emission of around 1.6 billion tonnes of CO2 -eq, equal to about 5% of global emissions (Kaza et al., 2018 ). The main sources of greenhouse gasses are waste disposal without landfill gas collection systems and open dumping (Manfredi et al., 2009 ). In addition, SWM also represents a non-negligible cost for municipalities. In low-income countries, almost 20% of municipal budget is spent for SWM. This value decreases for middle-income and high-income countries, which typically use about 11% and 4% of the municipal budget in SWM (Kaza et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, worldwide, about 1% of the population rely on informal waste management systems (Medina, 2010 ). Landfilling is not the preferable option in the waste management hierarchy (Cleary, 2009 ; Pires and Martinho, 2019 ). In Africa, more than 70% of municipal solid waste (MSW) is dumped (mostly in uncontrolled landfill) or open burned (Gomez-Sanabria et al., 2022 ). Uncontrolled disposal quickly reduces sanitary landfill's capacity, making necessary the construction of new disposal sites, which typically request billions of dollars to be built (Ayeleru et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, although informal waste collection and recycling allow the reduction of costs related to formal waste collection, waste pickers are exposed to health and social risks which threaten their safety (Schenck et al., 2019 ). Thus, waste sustainable management represents a challenge that most African cities are currently facing (Aryampa et al., 2019 ). This challenge is enhanced by the fast increase in population. In Sub-Saharan Africa, urban population is projected to triple from 2018 to 2050, reaching more than 1.2 billion of people living in cities (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2018 ). With about 46 million people in 2020 (Worldometer, 2022 ) and a total area of 241,555 km2  (UBOS, 2022 ), Uganda is the eighth largest African country by population and the fourth considering eastern African countries. Kampala City, the capital, counts more than 1.5 million people, while the other largest urban centres do not exceed 400,000 inhabitants. Uganda is divided into 4 administrative regions: Central, Western, Eastern and Northern, further divided into 135 districts, which are partitioned in 309 counties. The smallest administrative units consist in Town Councils and parishes (UBOS, 2022 ). Uganda's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was equal to 822 US dollars in 2020, about a half of the average per capita GDP of Sub-Saharan African countries (The World Bank, 2020b ). The main source of energy in Uganda is biomass (90%), which can be divided into charcoal (5.6%), crop residues (4.7%), and firewood (78.6%). Oil products, mainly used for vehicle and thermal power plants, account for about 9.7% of the generation rate, while electricity contributes for about 1.4% (MEMD, 2015 ). Around 64% of households use firewood for cooking, up to 30% use charcoal, and only 6% use other sources of energy, such as electricity or methane (UBOS, 2018 ). As with most African countries, Uganda is facing challenges at every step of the waste management process (Mohee and Simelane, 2015 ). Thus, effective waste management strategies are needed to allow the progress toward the achievement of the ambitious SDGs’ targets (Aryampa et al., 2019 ). In the scientific literature, only few studies define effective waste management strategies to specifically support SDG achievement in developing countries. Lohani et al. (2021)  pointed out challenges of the SWM system in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, suggesting strategies to align it with SDG agenda, focusing on waste to energy technologies. Hettiarachchi et al. (2018)  suggested that focusing on the organic fraction (OF) of MSW could be an effective way to supports the 2030 Agenda of the UN, due to the high organic presence in MSW and the relatively inexpensive labour cost. Challenges and opportunities in municipal SWM in Mozambique have been reviewed by Sallwey et al. (2017) , showing that managing MSW in an integrated way would allow to achieve various SDGs. Edodi (2022)  briefly analyses the African and Ugandan situation highlighting SWM system challenges. No one defined priorities to achieve SDGs, supporting future policies and potential best practices that can be applied in the African continent. Therefore, the current review aims to set priorities in the African continent to address global warming and environmental pollution through the sustainable management of resources. To do so, Uganda has been considered and analysed as a suitable case study, to identify the SDGs that should be prioritised towards a sustainable development. The current situation regarding Ugandan waste generation and management system has been highlighted, identifying potential resource recovery actions and possible pathways that can lead to the achievement of SDGs aiming at resource circularity and waste valorisation. Within this study, the following questions were answered: “What are the main strategies implemented to  support SDGs in Uganda? ” And “which priorities should be set to  support sustainable development?”  Results of the review can be of interest to waste management planners and practitioners as well as decision-makers to support the implementation of appropriate technologies and integrated systems in African countries towards a sustainable development.  2 Methods The review was conducted through an analysis of scientific literature and public/legal documents on Ugandan waste generation and management practices. The information collected during the literature review was used to set priorities in waste management practices to match the Ugandan waste management system with SDGs. Thus, an analysis of the SDGs was conducted, focusing on specific targets and indicators related to waste management. Results are presented following the methodological approach. Solid waste generation and characterization are firstly reported and current SWM practices for these waste fractions are explored. Then, virtuous SWM examples are collected identifying potential resource recovery actions. Finally, the best practices identified within the scientific literature are compared in terms of SDGs’ indicators and targets that can be achieved aiming at circular economy and waste valorisation, defining Ugandan priorities. 2.1 Literature review The literature research was made in Scopus and Web of Science databases, searching for original articles and reviews with the following keywords: Uganda AND “solid waste” AND management OR collection OR disposal OR recycling. Only papers published in English from 2010 to 2022 were considered within the review in order to collect updated information. Approximately 63 and 65 papers have been found respectively in Scopus and Web of Science database. Globally, 34 papers were selected focusing on articles and reviews, providing quantitative information about solid waste production, composition, and management. Conference paper and book chapters were not considered within the review. Furthermore, articles related to wastewater generation and treatment were discarded. The scientific articles selected were classified according to the publishing year. The type of waste and the topic assessed within the articles were also highlighted (Table 1  ). The focus of the study was related to MSW and healthcare waste (HCW) due to the lack of quantitative and reliable information related to special waste, such as, for example, industrial waste, construction and demolition waste (CDW), end of life vehicle, and electronic waste. “Elsevier”, “Taylor & Francis”, “SAGE”, and “Hindawi” are the editorial systems where the most relevant papers were published. “Waste management”, “Waste Management & Research”, “Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association”, “Journal of Environmental and Public Health”, and “Habitat International” are the most consulted journals. Fig. S1  shows the number of publications according to the publishing year. The focus of the studies collected is related to waste generation rates and waste management practices. Ugandan institutions (e.g., Universities) are usually involved in the studies, together with foreign partners: Sweden and Dutch institutions participated in most collaborations.  2.2 Evaluation of SDGs associated to SWM SDGs were fully investigated. Goals, targets, and indicators related to SWM were selected to support further considerations about practices that can lead toward a more sustainable SWM system. Table 2   shows the SDGs which includes the topic of SWM. The SDGs selected are those linked with typical waste management system improvement introduced in low-income countries, such as: informal sector integration (SDGs 3, 8), improvement of collection services (SDGs 3, 6, 8, 11, 14), landfill, open dumping, and open burning avoidance (SDGs 6, 11, 14, 15), and introduction of waste treatment technologies (SDGs 7, 12, 13).   3 Results - solid waste generation and characterization Data available about the solid waste generated in Uganda can be divided into two main categories namely MSW and HCW. MSW is mainly composed by household waste (HW), markets, and commercial waste. HCW can be divided into hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste. 3.1 MSW characterization According to Okot-Okumu and Nyenje (2011) , in Uganda, HW contributes for about 52% of MSW, followed by market waste (20%) and commercial waste (8%). Institutional waste streams and industrial waste weight respectively for about 5% and 3% of MSW composition, while 1% of MSW is represented by HCW, mostly household-like waste. The remaining 11% can be classified as “other waste” and includes street sweepings, public park waste, and construction debris. Data on MSW generation and composition is mainly available for Kampala City, while data referred to Uganda MSW generation rate and composition are scarce, as well as information referring to minor cities of the country. Fig. 1   shows the MSW production of different Ugandan places. On average, the MSW generation rate in Uganda can be estimated on 1.5 kg capita−1  d−1 . This value is higher than other generation rates typical of low-income countries (Kawai and Tasaki, 2016 ). This is due to the inclusion of other waste fractions in MSW streams, such as CDW. CDW are typically not included in MSW according to the definition of The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), under which MSW includes waste generated by household, small commercial activities, offices, and institutions that generate household-like waste. It is included yard and garden waste, street sweepings, bin litter, and market cleansing (OECD, 2020 ). Information about MSW composition is only available for Kampala City (5 studies), Kasese (1 study), Central Uganda region (1 study), and the entire country (1 study). Table S1  shows all the information collected, while in Fig. 2   the main waste characterization values, in aggregate form, are depicted. Organic waste is the dominant fraction in MSW (71%–92%), followed by stones and debris (1.5–13.4%), paper waste (1.3–10.9%) and plastics (1.2–7.8%). Textile waste represents 0.35–1.3% of MSW. Due to their high recovery and recycling rates, glass and metal waste are the least present fraction in MSW, about 0.1–1.1% for glass and 0.1–0.9% for metal waste. Christensen et al. (2014)  and Tibihika et al. (2021)  also described a wooden fraction equal to 0.15–1.3% of MSW. Typical composition data for Kampala, Kasese, Central Uganda, and Uganda were averaged to obtain a MSW composition reliable for the country. Results show that organic waste weight for 80.4%. Plastic and paper waste represent respectively 4.5% and 4.8% of MSW, while metals, glass, and wood account about 1.1%. Detailed composition is provided in Table S2 . HW represents the majority of MSW (Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ), thus the generation of domestic waste greatly affects MSW production and composition. In Table 3  , data about HW production are reported. Domestic waste generation rate is strongly influenced by the economic status: low-income, middle-income, or high-income context. On average, HW production in low-income urban areas is lower than half of domestic waste generation in high-income districts. The average HW generation rate in Uganda is 0.66 kg capita−1  d−1 .  3.2 HCW characterization According to the National Environment Waste Management Regulations of 2020 (NEMA, 2022 ), HCW can be categorized as hazardous or non-hazardous waste. Hazardous HCW includes sharps waste (needles, blades, scalpels, and knives), infectious waste (contaminated with blood and other body fluids), and pathological waste (tissues, blood, organs, and body fluids). Very few studies analyse HCW production and characterization for Ugandan hospitals providing quantitative and qualitative information. Kibirango Mugambe et al. (2012)  assessed the characteristics and generation rate in two hospitals of Kampala City, whereas Kwikiriza et al. (2019)  assessed HCW production in a private hospital in rural Uganda. Table 4   shows the production of HCW in the selected hospitals. On average, infectious HCW generation is equal to 0.25 kg bed−1  day−1  and non-hazardous HCW production is 0.49 kg bed−1  day−1 . These values are comparable to values obtained for Nigeria: 0.18 kg bed−1  day−1  of infectious waste and 0.64 kg bed−1  day−1  of non-hazardous waste (Babatola, 2008 ). Typical HCW generation rates for Africa are slightly higher than the Ugandan values: 0.72 kg bed−1  day−1  for non-hazardous waste, and 0.66 kg bed−1  day−1  for hazardous waste (Mol et al., 2022 ).   4 Results - SWM system analysis Ugandan SWM system was analysed considering two different dimensions: a physical component and a governance aspect (UN-HABITAT, 2010 ). The physical component includes MSW collection services, which influence public health, waste treatment and disposal, environmental protection, and resource valorisation through material reduction, reusing, and recycling. The governance components of SWM includes sound institution and pro-active policies, which reflect on stakeholders’ inclusivity and financial sustainability of the services provided (Wilson et al., 2015 ). HCW management system analysis was conducted considering the indicators set introduced by (Ferronato et al., 2020 ): collection and selective collection, storage, local treatment, maintenance, monitoring, and awareness, security, and prevention. 4.1 MSW management – physical aspects While the growth of population leads to an increase of waste generation, national local authorities are facing challenges with low capacity in waste collection, inappropriate disposal methods, and weak waste management infrastructures (NEMA, 2019 ). Management of MSW in Uganda mainly includes collection systems, made both by public, private and informal companies, and final disposal into legal or illegal dumpsites. Recycling, reuse, and recovery are conducted by formal and informal sectors, taking place at multiple steps of the SWM system, and creating a gap in the accounted waste amounts (Aryampa et al., 2019 ). 4.1.1 Collection MSW collection rate in Uganda varies between 15% and 60%, with higher efficiencies where the service is provided by private companies (Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ). Private companies operate especially in high-income neighbourhood offering kerbside services, whereas low-income areas receive low quality waste collection services. The case of Kampala City is illustrative: collection services are provided by public, private and informal companies. Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) is the only public SWM service provider, and more than 80% of its activities serve low- and middle-income districts (Katusiimeh et al., 2013 ). Informal collection companies’ services are mostly addressed to low- and middle-income households, whereas private companies operate for high-income households. According to The Kampala Solid Waste Management Ordinance of 2000, private companies need permits to handle waste. However, several private collection companies operate without the allowance required from KCCA (Katusiimeh et al., 2012 ). Kampala City waste collection rate is estimated to be equal to 60%, made by KCCA for 55% and by private and informal companies for 45% (KCCA, 2020 ). As highlighted by Kinobe et al. (2015b) , the waste collection system in Kampala City may be divided into four models, according to the income category of the area. In informal low-income areas, waste is stored in plastic bags or bins which are transported to unofficial collection sites for secondary collection by KCCA when the bags reach about 30–50 kg. Waste is self-transported by households or by informal waste collectors to collection sites by pulling the sacks, carrying on the head or using barrows (Ssemugabo et al., 2020 ; Katusiimeh et al., 2013 ). The vehicle mainly used in these areas are compactors trucks, tractors, and tipper trucks. In residential areas, solid waste collection is mainly operated by private companies that provide polyethylene bags to institutions and households. Bags are temporarily stored in collection sites before proper collection. In business area and in the city centre, where most of the shops can be found, collection services are mainly provided by private operators. Coloured bins and plastic bags are provided by the company responsible of the collection. Finally, KCCA is the only responsible for the solid waste collection in market areas and public parks, as for street sweepings and drain channel de-silting (Kinobe et al., 2015 ). Waste collection by KCCA is mostly made daily or two/three times per week, while private companies services are provided twice or thrice per week (Katusiimeh et al., 2013 ). On the other hand, in Kasese, MSW collection is supervised by the Municipal Council, which uses three waste trucks (one skip-loader truck, one compactor, and one tipper truck) to collect the waste from 25 collection points equipped with containers. The efficiency of the collection system is near 10%, mostly due to problems with vehicle maintenance and lack of fundings for fuel (Vanhille et al., 2013 ). In other minor cities, like Mbarara and Busia, collection is provided by the Municipality through the definition of collection sites. However, more than 30% of the waste generated remains uncollected (Gumisiriza and Kugonza, 2020 ; Lederer et al., 2015 ). Waste collection services are scarce if not absent in urban poor areas, due to inaccessible roads and unplanned facilities. Transfer stations are absent, determining higher collection distances and time (Aryampa et al., 2019 ; Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ).  4.1.2 Disposal of collected waste Collected waste is mainly sent to dumping sites (Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ). Kampala City is the only municipality in Uganda with a sanitary landfill. Kiteezi landfill was opened in 1996, 12 km far from the city. It is the only sanitary landfill currently registered in Uganda (Aryampa et al., 2019 ). The landfill is characterized by the lack of a liner and a containment, poorly managed drainage channel, and a dysfunctional leachate collection plant. Furthermore, steeps and slopes are unstable and landfill gasses capture system is absent (KCCA, 2020 ). The total area of the landfill is over 0.12 km2  (Kinobe et al., 2015 ) and waste is disposed of free of charge (Aryampa et al., 2019 ). From 2011 to 2017, the amount of disposed waste increased from 227,916 tonnes to about 481,081 tonnes per year (KCCA, 2020 ). All other towns dispose of their collected waste into open dumping sites owned and operated by the Municipality. These sites are often located close to residential areas, wetlands, rivers, and drainage channels or steep slopes (Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ). Dumping sites are characterized by the absence of fences and control, thus waste picking represents a common situation in all the dumping sites (Kinobe et al., 2015 ; Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ).  4.1.3 Disposal of uncollected waste Uncollected waste is managed in different ways, which include indiscriminate disposal, backyard disposal, burying and open burning. It was estimated that, in Uganda, about 70% of the uncollected waste is burned and about 15% is dumped in open dumps (Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ). In Kampala City, a total of 59 illegal dump sites were mapped by Kinobe et al. (2015b) . Illegal dumps are open, often located along streets, water bodies or drainage channels, where waste is dumped indiscriminately and not collected. The blockage of drainage channels leads to flooding and the increase of flies, representing a common problem related to waste mismanagement in Kampala City (Kulabako et al., 2010 ). In Kampala, about 60% of the uncollected and unrecycled waste are open dumped or open burned, while almost 20% are buried (Oyoo et al., 2014 ). Illegal dumpsites are prevalent in rural areas or informal settlements, which allow people to indiscriminately dispose of solid waste. Mukamba et al. (2016)  analysed waste management practices into two informal settlements (outskirt of Kampala and Mukono municipality). Almost 40% of households dispose waste at illegal dumping sites and about 25% burn waste in open pits.  4.1.4 Formal and informal recycling Recycling, reuse, and recovery are conducted both by formal and informal sectors and occurs at different stages of the SWM system. In Kampala City, about 11% of the waste generated undergoes recycling or recovering before the disposal (Kabera et al., 2019 ; Oyoo et al., 2014 ). The main actors of MSW recycling before the landfilling are waste collectors and refuse loaders (Kinobe et al., 2015 ). Waste pickers gather recyclable materials directly from households, collection sites or from open dumpsites, searching for recyclables. Sometimes, waste pickers pay households for materials. Children are also involved in waste collecting activities. Refuse loaders, employees contracted by KCCA, also collect and trade recyclable materials to earn extra income. Recyclable materials are then purchased by waste buyers, who are usually located near the municipal landfill. The aim of their work is to sort and clean recyclable waste adding value to the products. In Kiteezi landfill, more than 500 waste pickers search daily for recyclables materials, such as plastics, textiles, papers, and metals. Peelings or food waste is also collected for cows and pigs feeding. Waste pickers are integrated in the waste disposal process: bulldozers spread the delivered waste and cover the unsorted materials when waste pickers end their selection. Kinobe et al. (2015a)  estimated that about 14% of the landfilled material (up to 180 tonnes per day) is reused or recycled after landfilling. Recyclables collected from the landfill are sold to waste buyers and then are bought by traders, who target specific materials providing them to reprocessing plants. Similarly, in the municipality of Busia, almost 14% of MSW is informally recycled or reused. This flow includes metal and textiles sold to the recycling market, organic waste used in agriculture, paper and plastics reused by households (Lederer et al., 2015 ). Around 75% of households coming from informal settlements reuse high amounts of waste, with plastics and organic waste as the most reused resources. Plastic residues are reused for carrying purpose, food covering, and fuel for cookstoves, threatening human health. Banana peelings and food leftovers are used mainly to feed animals, as composting is not a common practice (Mukamba et al., 2016 ; Nsimbe et al., 2018 ).   4.2 MSW management – governance 4.2.1 Institutional framework Institutional framework concerning SWM in Uganda is headed by The Ministry of Water and Environment. It comprises three Directorates: Directorate of Water Development, Directorate of Water Resources Management, and the Directorate of Environmental Affairs. Some semi-autonomous institutions are affiliated to the Ministry. For example, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) is responsible for ensuring environmental management practices for sustainable development. Local governments are other key stakeholders responsible for the delivery of services in the sector. The National Environmental Act of 2019 is the principal law governing environmental management and conservation in Uganda. Other supporting laws and policies are relevant in the SWM field: National Environment Regulations S.I. 49 of 2020 (Waste Management, Environmental and Social Assessment, and Standards for Discharge of Effluent into Water or Land), and the Guidelines for the Management of Landfills in Uganda (2020) (NEMA, 2022 ). Local practices in SWM are still far from the national SWM strategy. Local governments do not apply sustainable solutions, threatening environmental protection (Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ).  4.2.2 Financial sustainability According to Okot-Okumu and Nyenje (2011) , Urban Councils, the responsible of waste management services, spend less than 10% of their total budget in waste management practices and infrastructures. Most of low-income households do not pay any tax and agree that the Urban Council should not require any fee to collect waste. Town Councils receive money mostly from the central government, but these funds are insufficient to guarantee suitable waste management practices. In Kampala city, only one third of households in informal low-income areas pay for the service an average of 36,000 Uganda shillings per month (about 10 USD) (Ssemugabo et al., 2020 ; Katusiimeh et al., 2013 ). In residential areas, households and institutions pay respectively an average of 50,000 and 65,000 Uganda shillings per month (about 14 and 18 USD). The fee depends on the collection frequency and on the amount of waste generated (Kinobe et al., 2015 ). Many households (59.9%) were not satisfied with SWM services and only 48.1% of the households surveyed by Ojok et al. (2014) ) willingly pays for services. Finally, the beneficiaries in business areas pay a 10,000 to 100,000 Uganda shillings per month (about 3–30 USD).   4.3 HCW management Management of HCW involves waste management at hospital level, and SWM at city level. Hospital level management includes waste collection at appropriate collection sites, waste storage, on site treatment, maintenance, monitoring, awareness, and staff training to prevent health and environmental hazards. Literature studies concerning HCW management in Uganda are scarce and mainly focused on the hospital level. Around 40 Ugandan hospitals were studied by Galukande et al. (2015) . Kibirango Mugambe et al. (2012)  described HCW management in three hospitals of Kampala City, whereas Kwikiriza et al. (2019)  focused on Bwindi's private hospital in rural Uganda. Finally, Tsebeni Walufa et al. (2019)  conducted a study in 8 health facilities in Kampala City. Until 2020, Uganda had no legal framework that requires health facilities to take any particular care of their HCW (Kwikiriza et al., 2019 ). Currently, HCW management is regulated by the National Environment Regulations S.I. 49 of 2020 (Waste Management) (NEMA, 2022 ). 4.3.1 Collection, storage, transport, and treatment Waste collection mostly occurs by different bins or boxes to segregate waste. Colour coding or labels are the two ways used to collect separately sharps, infectious, pathological, and general waste. Needles are often collected in empty plastic bottles (Kibirango Mugambe et al., 2012 ). Effective segregation of waste occurs in almost 90% of the surveyed sites (Galukande et al., 2015 ). The considered studies do not mention storage sites. Kwikiriza et al. (2019)  highlighted how HCW are often transported from collection point to treatment facilities by hospital staff by hand or using wheelbarrows. In Kampala City, general waste is collected from hospitals by the local authority and then taken to the landfill (Kibirango Mugambe et al., 2012 ). Okot-Okumu and Nyenje (2011)  highlighted that most of hospitals treat their own waste. The treatment of HCW mostly occurs by incineration. About 65% of hospitals managed a functional incineration system (Galukande et al., 2015 ), although many incinerators are not well-designed and they are not able to effectively handle the waste, ensure efficiency in burning, and avoid harmful emissions (NEMA, 2019 ). Sharps waste undergoes incineration or needle destroying processes, while pathological wastes are buried in placenta pits or incinerated. Open burning of HCW still occurs, while for non-hazardous waste the most adopted managing methods are landfilling, incineration, or open burning (Kibirango Mugambe et al., 2012 ; Kwikiriza et al., 2019 ).  4.3.2 Awareness, security, and prevention Clinical staff's knowledge of HCW management is high and personal protective equipment is generally used. Almost 78% of hospitals have a protocol to control infection in managing HCW (Galukande et al., 2015 ). About 28% of health workers interviewed by Tsebeni Walufa et al. (2019)  reported that they have been affected due to poor HCW management. Needle pricks are the most common effects of poor HCW management. Kwikiriza et al. (2019)  highlighted that despite protective gloves are used every day, the type of gloves is often incorrect for its use.    5 Results - circular actions implemented in Uganda Virtuous SWM and waste valorisation projects are described and summarized in Table 5  . Waste valorisation is the process that allows to obtain useful products, materials, or energy according to the principles of circular economy: waste and pollution avoidance, products and materials circularity at their higher value, and nature regeneration (The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2021 ). 5.1 Uganda municipal waste composting programme The Ugandan Municipal Waste Composting Programme (UCP) is a 21-year project (2007–2028) implemented under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) introduced with Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 2005 ). The CDM allows the realization of emission-reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified emission reduction credits (CER). The UCP project is implemented by the Government of Uganda, NEMA, the World Bank, and the participating municipalities. Fig. S2  shows the 17 selected cities. Whitin the UCP, a loan from the World Bank is used to fund the construction of one composting plant in every municipality and the purchase of collection and composting equipment. Generated CERs are used to pay back the initial loan and to generate income for the municipalities (Lederer et al., 2017 ). Nine cities were involved in the first part of the project. Other eight cities were involved in the second part. The composting plant was built in 12 out of the 17 cities (NEMA, 2017 ), while others only received the collection equipment (Lederer et al., 2017 ; Tibihika et al., 2021 ). Christensen et al. (2014)  and Vanhille et al. (2013)  describe the UCP implementation in Kasese municipality. Collected waste is carried unsorted to the plant with waste trucks. After manual sorting, the inorganic fractions are dumped into separate pits near the plant without further treatments. About 1500 t month−1  of unsorted waste are delivered to the plant and about 90 t month−1  of compost are produced after about 50 days of treatment. During composting, material is further sorted to remove remaining inorganic fractions, while oxygen and temperature levels are monitored. The compost produced remains mostly unsold due to the absence of any demand. Similar results were assessed for composting plants operating in Mbale and Soroti (NEMA, 2017 ).  5.2 Briquettes production from faecal sludge and organic waste biomass Kizito et al. (2022)  explored the production of briquettes made from faecal sludge (FS) and different organic biomass: pineapple waste (PP) and bean husks (BH). PP and BH represent organic waste streams that are highly produced but slightly valorised (Baidhe et al., 2021 ; Kiggundu et al., 2014 ). Biofuel characteristics compared to traditional wood-derived charcoal and briquettes available and traditionally used in Uganda were estimated. Briquettes made from FS blended with PP showed higher calorific value compared to other briquettes, and lower calorific value compared to charcoal. However, economic analysis assessed how FS and PP briquettes are a viable option compared to charcoal fuel, generating savings for 620 USD per tonne of avoided charcoal (Kizito et al., 2022 ). It was estimated that household and businesses in Kampala could generate a market demand respectively of 19,000 tonnes and 105,000 tonnes per year (IWMI, 2015 ). However, Bagire et al. (2021)  highlighted that micro-scale manufacturers operate in Uganda, but they mostly use primitive equipment, producing briquettes for self-consumption or local trading.  5.3 Manure and organic waste vermicomposting Lalander et al. (2015)  studied the application of vermicomposting technologies to urban small-holder animal farms in Kampala City. The treatment process of organic waste generates two products that can be economically exploited: compost and animal feed protein as worm biomass. The system implemented had a material reduction rate on total solids (TS) basis of 45.9%, and a waste-to-biomass conversion rate of 3.5% on a TS basis. The vermicompost is an odourless, homogeneous, and porous product. However, both vermicompost and worms need a further post-treatment to stabilise the organic matter and reduce the risk of diseases transmission if worms are used as animal feed. It was assessed that vermicomposting has a high economic potential for small-holder farmer if vermicompost and worm biomass can be sold, generating earnings of about 200% of the initial investment after 5 years from the start of the system. The study evaluated the potential of vermicomposting but no information about current applications is available.  5.4 Uganda domestic biogas program The Uganda Domestic Biogas Program (UDBP) is part of the Africa Biogas Partnership Program (ABPP) that started in 2009 as a collaboration between financial institutions, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), and biogas construction companies. From 2009 to 2019, about 7629 domestic biogas plants have been constructed in rural and semi-urban areas of Uganda (ABPP, 2009 ). The aim of the program was to improve conditions of Ugandan households through waste valorisation and to reduce environmental damages caused by firewood for cooking. Women and children were the main beneficiaries, improving their health conditions by cooking in smokeless environments. It has been estimated that a household plant with an average biogas production of 0.48 m3  d−1  allows saving about 1610 kg y−1  of fuelwood and about 0.3 t of CO2 -equivalent (Menya et al., 2013 ). However, despite an estimated lifespan of about 20 years, Lwiza et al. (2017)  assessed that more than 29% of households used the biogas plants only for about 2–4 years. The main causes of dis-adoption were the scarce availability of family labour, shortage of organic raw material to feed the digestor, and lack of technical skills for plants’ maintenance.  5.5 Landfill gas extraction and flaring The “Mpererwe Landfill Gas” project is a waste management action implemented in Kampala City from 2012 to 2022 by KCCA and the Government of Netherlands under the CDM (UNFCCC, 2012 ). The aim of the project was to implement a landfill gas extraction and flaring at Kiteezi Landfill, which currently has no gas management systems. Flaring of the collected gas allows avoiding harmful greenhouse gasses emissions and reducing the risk of explosions in the landfill site. Furthermore, it represented the opportunity to introduce useful technologies to foster improvements in sustainable waste management. Other benefits related to the implementation of the project include the provision of employment opportunities and the training of local staff. The project involved the installation of gas extraction wells, gas collection pipes, a gas extraction plant, condensate management systems, and flare units. A study on possible electricity generation using the biogas was involved in the project proposal. The annual amount of emission reduction was estimated up to 18,000 t of CO2 -eq. International literature and developers’ websites did not provide any information related to the implementation and performances of the project.  5.6 Plastic bag ban The first announcement of the plastic ban occurred in 2009, but after the protests of the Ugandan Plastics Manufacturers and Recyclers Association (UPMRA) the implementation of the ban was delayed. In 2015 and in 2018, respectively NEMA and Ugandan Government tried to introduce the ban, which has never been effective (Behuria, 2021 ). Finally, The National Environment Act 2019 prohibited the use of plastics under 30 μm and prescribed a list of the permitted uses of plastics and plastic products. The National Environment Act of 2019 does not allow the import, export, local manufacture, use or re-use of plastic carrier bags or plastic products made of polyethene or polypropylene below 30 μm (NEMA, 2021 ).   6 Discussion - Uganda SWM and SDGs 6.1 Waste valorisation projects Virtuous waste management and valorisation projects implemented in Uganda support the achievement of SDGs. Fig. 3   highlights how the described actions meet the selected SDGs' targets. The analysis showed that SDGs’ targets 8.7, 8.8, 12.4 and 12.8 were not addressed by waste management and valorisation projects implemented in Uganda. A clear need of acting on awareness improvement, child labour ending, safe working conditions, and special waste management was revealed. Special waste, for example CDW, waste of electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) or industrial waste have been never addressed by waste valorisation projects. This reflects on a lack of data on special waste generation and management. Furthermore, no project focused on informal waste management inclusion was implemented in the past, nor HCW proper collection and treatment. In relation to the projects, it can be highlighted that UCP provided collection equipment for the municipalities, increasing waste collection rate (Lederer et al., 2017 ), improving waste recycling, creating job opportunities, and avoiding indiscriminate dumping. On the other hand, briquettes production from FS and organic waste biomass, as well as biogas production, represents a viable option to reduce the dependence on traditional fuels. Other important benefits introduced by circular projects include the creation of innovative entrepreneurship, waste minimization, and avoidance of natural resources depletion. According to Mkude et al. (2021) , the use of FS and organic waste biomass derived briquettes can save about 16 m2  of forest area for every tonne of produced briquettes. At the same time, vermicomposting presents similar advantages to composting in terms of SDGs achievement, while the introduction of the “plastic ban” is the only implemented action that avoids plastic debris generation. This showed a lack of interventions aimed at improving plastic recycling and valorising informal entrepreneurships.  6.2 Challenges in implementing SDGs in Uganda 6.2.1 Goals 3, 6, 11 and 14 – environmental contamination Uganda waste management system threatens environmental health and safety at multiple steps, failing SDGs’ targets 3.9 and 6.3. The low values of MSW collection rate leave waste uncollected, which is mainly open dumped, open burned or buried. Furthermore, collected MSW typically ends up into open dumping sites operated by municipalities. Open dumping and burring significantly alter water, groundwater and soils properties, causing soils acidification (Ali et al., 2014 ), water eutrophication, and introducing bacterial and heavy metal contamination (Mohan and Joseph, 2021 ; Vaverková et al., 2020 ). Premakumara et al. (2018)  highlighted that greenhouse gasses emission generated by uncollected waste is equal to about 360 kg CO2 -eq tonne−1  of waste, due to methane emission from dumping and CO2  emission from open burning. The incineration of MSW also emits pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, and other environmental harmful contaminants and fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) (Das et al., 2018 ). SDG's target 14.1 aims at marine pollution avoidance, particularly from land-based activities, which contribute for about 80% of marine littering (Jambeck et al., 2015 ). Open and indiscriminate dumping represent the main source of oceans contamination and plastic pollution (Ferronato and Torretta, 2019 ) thus the achievement of SDG 14 is seriously hindered by Ugandan SWM system. Improvement of SWM sustainable practices is fundamental to move towards the achievement of SDGs 3, 6, 11 and 14. Increasing the collection rate must be a priority in Uganda to minimize uncontrolled dumping. One of the main hurdles in waste collection is vehicle and fuel availability. Finally, the introduction of controlled sanitary landfills with liner, drainage system for leachate collection and gas collection systems represents an essential SWM improvement to minimize environmental contamination.  6.2.2 Goal 7 – energy provision Since biomass (firewood and charcoal) is the main source of energy in Uganda, and only 40% of Ugandan population have access to electricity (about 70% in urban areas and 33% in rural areas) (The World Bank, 2020a ), Uganda is still far from reaching SDG 7. The introduction of sustainable SWM technologies can surely support the transition to more sustainable source of energy. Many studies highlighted how biogas production from organic material is one of the most promising technologies in Uganda (McCord et al., 2020 ; Roopnarain and Adeleke, 2017 ). The high organic presence in MSW can surely support the implementation of anaerobic digestion plants. However, the implementation of the UDBP has shown that many factors can contribute to dis-adoption of this technology. It is thus crucial to provide correct training of stakeholders and ensure plants’ maintenance. Where domestic plants require excessive input material and family labour, larger scale plants could be considered. The implementation of landfill gas collection and electricity generation using the biogas would also support the achievement of SDG 7.  6.2.3 Goal 8 – economic growth and work conditions Informal employment, child labour and occupational injuries are common situations in Uganda. Uncontrolled landfills and disposal sites for MSW represent an unsound environment where labour rights, safety, and decent job are neglected. Injuries are frequent both in MSW management and HCW treatment and disposal practices. Strong actions are needed in Uganda to face these issues and move towards the targets of SDG 8. As highlighted by Edodi (2022) , unemployment, poverty, and socioeconomic needs are the main drivers of recycling in Uganda, and this hinder economic growth and leads to scarce labour conditions. The construction of controlled sanitary landfills can surely reduce the number of waste pickers that works in unsafe environment. However, this action must be coupled with the design of an inclusive SWM system, capable of include and valorise the informal sector, which has the ability and the opportunity to deliver SWM improvements such as kerbside collection and waste segregation (Ferronato and Torretta, 2019 ).  6.2.4 Goal 12 – waste recycling and proper treatment Ugandan typical recycling rates are very low. Reusing of plastic and organic waste occurs in most informal settlements. Information about special hazardous waste (like chemicals, batteries, electronic waste, among others) is scarce, and it can be assumed that special hazardous waste are disposed of as MSW (Gumisiriza and Kugonza, 2020 ). Improving waste recycling and proper treatment in Uganda to achieve SDG 12 is a twofold problem, as it includes people's awareness and technological skills and equipment. Community awareness in waste management to fight environmental pollution must be a priority because it represents the starting point to change people's lifestyle. Awareness creation on SWM laws is also fundamental to support SDG 12. Considering the prevalence of biodegradable waste in MSW, it is reasonable to prioritize the sustainable management of this fraction, avoiding open dumping practices.  6.2.5 Goal 13 – policy implementation With The National Environmental Act and other supporting laws and policies, in particular the National Environment Regulations (NEMA, 2022 ), Uganda integrated SWM measures into national laws. The implementation of the “plastic bag ban” is an important sign of commitment in implementing sound SWM strategies and policies. However, local regulations for implementing SWM laws are necessary because sustainable strategies are still unapplied by local governments. Long term strategies and plans are needed to achieve SDG 13, as well as indicators to assess total greenhouse gasses emissions.  6.2.6 Goal 15 – forest depletion Ugandan ecosystems, in particular forests, are seriously threaten by waste open dumping and firewood supplying (NEMA, 2019 ). SDG 15, which deadline was in 2020 for target 15.1, is surely unattained. However, SWM system improvements could adjust the unsound trend. Sustainable technologies and practices are needed to reduce the reliance on traditional fuels, preserve natural environment and reduce forest losses. Briquettes production from FS and organic waste biomass, as well as biogas production surely represent possible viable options.    7 Conclusions The review proved that Uganda needs urgent actions to improve its SWM system and achieve the SDGs. More than a half of generated MSW remains uncollected and it is mainly open burned. Collected waste is generally open dumped in open sites owned and operated by the municipalities. Recycling is mostly informally conducted, also by children, and it is driven by unemployment, poverty, and socioeconomic needs. The main strategies implemented in Uganda to improve SWM focused on the management of the OFMSW, to reduce the amount of dumped waste and produce valuable materials (compost, briquettes, and animal feed) and energy. The success of waste valorisation projects was often threatened by scarce social acceptance of the technology introduced and by a lack of material, equipment, and technical skills. Waste-related policies have been recently introduced in Uganda. However, local regulations are needed because local practices in SWM are still far from the national waste management strategy. On balance, improve waste collection and build controlled sanitary landfills must be for sure priorities to reduce environmental contamination and avoid the generation of unsafe work environment for informal workers. However, these plans should be coupled with local and practical actions, designing inclusive SWM systems that valorise local opportunities for resource circularity. In particular, the review underlines that:• Community awareness campaigns in waste management, and knowledge improvement on SWM laws are fundamental actions needed to support SDGs achievement.  • Child labour still occurs in informal waste management processes. Thus, integrate the prohibition and elimination of child labour in actions related to SWM is imperative.  • Waste circular bioeconomy projects are necessary to reduce nature depletion and improve products circularity.  • Informal recycling organizations that address valuable materials such as plastics and metals must be valorised within the collection and recycling systems.  • Special waste generation and management needs to be investigated: actions are required to assess waste flows and amounts, exploring the introduction of safe collection and recycling systems.  • The number of people with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology must increase, ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.  • HCW management systems must be improved to effectively handle waste and ensure efficiency in burning avoiding harmful emissions.    These findings can support decision makers in focusing small-scale projects and practical actions to support the transition towards sustainable SWM systems in Uganda and the Global South.
