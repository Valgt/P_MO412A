                  Sustainable development is a complex system involving multiple dimensions of society, economy, resources and environment. It is of great significance to evaluate the sustainable development level and explore the interactions among sustainable development goals (SDGs) for the promotion of sustainability. In present study, a localized urban sustainable development evaluation framework was first proposed. Then, taking Shandong Province as an example, the spatiotemporal variations and goal evenness of sustainability were investigated. Finally, synergies and trade-offs between SDGs were revealed. The results showed that the sustainable development level has improved slightly from 2011 to 2020 in Shandong Province, exhibiting a dual-core pattern with Jinan and Qingdao. Shandong Province performed relatively well in SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The unevenness existed in sustainable development, indicating that the development process varied from one goal to another and there were obvious differences among cities for the same goal. Relatively weak synergies and trade-offs relationships were mainly observed between SDGs, and the interactions were in a changing state. Analyzing the sustainable development level from multiple perspectives and promoting multi-goal coordinated development are vital for achieving urban sustainable development.

It is of great significance to evaluate the sustainable development level and explore the interactions among sustainable development goals (SDGs) for the promotion of sustainability. In present study, a localized urban sustainable development evaluation framework was first proposed. Then, taking Shandong Province as an example, the spatiotemporal variations and goal evenness of sustainability were investigated. Finally, synergies and trade-offs between SDGs were revealed. The results showed that the sustainable development level has improved slightly from 2011 to 2020 in Shandong Province, exhibiting a dual-core pattern with Jinan and Qingdao. Shandong Province performed relatively well in SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The unevenness existed in sustainable development, indicating that the development process varied from one goal to another and there were obvious differences among cities for the same goal. Relatively weak synergies and trade-offs relationships were mainly observed between SDGs, and the interactions were in a changing state. Analyzing the sustainable development level from multiple perspectives and promoting multi-goal coordinated development are vital for achieving urban sustainable development.

Sustainable development emerges from human beings' widespread concern about environmental issues and profound reflection on the process of the industrial revolution (Basheer et al., 2022 ). In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in alleviating hunger and poverty and improving the living environment quality. However, challenges remain in urban-rural imbalance and ecological degradation (Han et al., 2023 ; Naidoo & Fisher, 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2020 ). In 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit adopted "Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", which identified 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Colglazier, 2015 ), indicating that sustainable development has entered a new stage (The United Nations, 2015 ). As a core concept for promoting global development, the sustainable development scientifically guides humanity in addressing multifaceted issues, such as social, economic, and environmental problems, and gathers strength for tackling global challenges. Sustainable development is a crucial topic in the new era of combining theoretical science and applied practice (Wang et al., 2024 ). Scholars have carried out numerous studies on the connotation and theory evolution, research frameworks, and evaluation methods (Allen et al., 2017 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). The evaluation systems mainly include economic-social-ecology framework, production-life-ecology framework, and pressure-state-response framework (Leng et al., 2024 ; Yin et al., 2023 ). However, it is still difficult to effectively integrate these frameworks with the SDGs. It is imperative to conduct research within the SDGs framework to provide direct decision-making support for implementing the 2030 agenda. A series of methodologies, including data envelopment analysis model, genetic algorithm, and comprehensive evaluation method (Yin et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ), have been widely applied in sustainable development assessment. Despite the remarkable achievements in research and implementation of sustainable development, the universally applicable system proposed by the 2030 agenda was limited by the development disparities and the different challenges faced by countries and regions (Li et al., 2024 ). Moreover, there exists a noticeable disparity between the indicator system and local statistics, as well as monitoring data (Allen et al., 2021 ), especially at small spatial scales where the indicators are less adaptable. Cities are complex socio-economic-natural composite systems that play a key role in the human civilization development (Blasi et al., 2022 ; Han et al., 2024 ; Ren et al., 2024 ; Tan et al., 2016 ; Xiong & He, 2024 ; Yu et al., 2024 ). Consequently, the urban development has emerged as a fundamental prerequisite for embarking on the path to sustainability (Cui et al., 2024 ; Du et al., 2024 ). Although studies have been conducted to assess urban sustainable development within the context of SDGs, which predominantly focus on SDG 11 and are primarily carried out in large and medium-sized cities (Jiang et al., 2022 ; Yamasaki & Yamada, 2022 ). It is urgent to establish a localized assessment framework for urban sustainable development based on the SDGs system. The realization of sustainable development is not a simply combination of goals but a result of the goals interactions (Xiao et al., 2024 ). Based on the SDG framework, scholars have primarily focused on the evaluation of sustainable development to explore the opportunities and challenges faced by it (Omer & Noguchi, 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). However, the neglect of the interrelations among goals makes it difficult to comprehensively evaluate regional sustainability and achieve multi-goals synergistic development (Barbier & Burgess, 2019 ). Although the United Nations explicitly stated that the SDGs were equally important, it is impractical to simultaneously achieve all goals or one by one. Existing studies generally employ average scores to evaluate the sustainability, while studies on the assessment of development balance among the 17 goals are still insufficient. The intricate interactions among the goals are a critical challenge affecting the implementation of the SDGs (Bennich et al., 2020 ; Xing et al., 2024 ). Current research has increasingly focused on exploring the interactions among goals (Han et al., 2023 ; Pham-Truffert et al., 2020 ; Xiao et al., 2023 ), particularly in the aspects of climate, poverty, biodiversity and energy (He et al., 2021 ; Mathy & Blanchard, 2016 ; Nerini et al., 2019 ). Correlation analyses, network analyses, and comprehensive models have been widely applied in studies of goals interactions (Kroll et al., 2019 ; Nerini et al., 2018 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ). A majority of these studies are conducted at large scales such as the global or national level (Herrera, 2019 ; Jayaraman et al., 2015 ; Wu et al., 2023 ). However, interactions among goals may exhibit distinct interaction mechanisms across varying spatial scales, and interactions of SDGs at small spatial scales still need to be explored in depth. The objective of this study is to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating urban sustainable development and investigate the interactions among SDGs. First, to construct a research framework to assess sustainable development level and to analyze the spatio-temporal variations from 2011 to 2020 in Shandong Province; Second, to quantify the evenness of SDGs based on improved radar chart model; Finally, to explore the synergies and trade-offs of SDGs and to reveal the interactions among goals. The results will provide a crucial guide for the 2030 agenda implementation and formulation of relevant decisions to realize urban sustainable development.  2 Material and methods 2.1 Study area Shandong Province is situated on the eastern coast and in the lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin (114°47.5'-122°42.3′ E, 34°22.9'-38°24.01′ N), and includes 16 cities (Fig. 1  ). The province boasts a prime geographical location and abundant natural resources, making it a pivotal economic and demographic hub in China. Additionally, the rapid urbanization has given it a strategic position within the country. In 2020, the urbanization rate of Shandong Province was about 63.05%, and the total population and gross domestic product (GDP) account for 7.1% and 7.2% of the country, respectively. However, with emerging development scenarios, such as the mode transformation and structural optimization of economy, Shandong Province still faces challenges in the pursuit of sustainable development.  2.2 Data sources This study adopted 16 cities in Shandong Province as the fundamental unit, and encompassed the period from 2011 to 2020. The data were mainly obtained from the China Urban Statistical Yearbook, China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook, and Shandong Statistical Yearbook.  2.3 Research methodology 2.3.1 Research framework and indicator system construction This study proposed a research framework for the sustainable development of localized cities aligned with SDGs (Fig. 2  ). The construction of a localized urban scale indicator system for SDGs incorporated both top-down and bottom-up approaches. First, we interpreted the framework of the 17 first-level goals and 169 second-level goals of the SDGs, and assessed the usability of 231 specific sustainable development indicators, selecting those that could be directly adopted. Then, we supplemented indicators from the existing database that fit the SDGs connotation and region development characteristics, to form a localized sustainable development assessment indicator system (Table 1  ). Among them, SDG 14 on marine resources is not included because the study area includes inland cities. Additionally, SDGs 5, 16, and 17 are not included in the evaluation system due to the lack of quantitative indicators.  2.3.2 Comprehensive evaluation of sustainable development The entropy weighting method is commonly used to determine indicator weights and can avoid the subjectivity of artificially assigning weights (Li & Lu, 2021 ; Lu et al., 2022 ). In this study, the entropy weighting method was applied to quantify the indicator weights. The integrated score of each city was then calculated by comprehensive evaluation method.1) Data normalization To consider the comparability of data with different dimensions, we normalized the data of indicators. The normalization process is as follows:(1) A i j   = X i j   − min ( X i j   )   max ( X i j   )  − min ( X i j   )          X i j   i s  a  p o s i t i v e  i n d i c a t o r     (2) A i j   = max ( X i j   )  − X i j    max ( X i j   )  − min ( X i j   )          X i j   i s  a  n e g a t i v e  i n d i c a t o r     (3) P i j   = A i j   ∑ i = 1  m  A i j            where i  denotes the i th city; j  denotes the j th indicator. The larger value of the positive indicator suggests better sustainability (conversely, the larger value of the negative indicator means greater disadvantage).2) Entropy and weight calculation The normalized value of each indicator was used to calculate the information entropy. The formula was as follows:(4) e j  = − ∑ i = 1  m  P i j   × ln P i j    ln m       (5) w j  = 1 − e j   ∑ j = 1  n  ( 1 − e j   )           where ej   and wj   represent the information entropy and weight of the j th indicator, respectively.3) Sustainability score calculation The different SDGs scores were calculated separately based on the normalized values and quantitative weights of each indicator. It can be calculated as follows:(6) Z i  = ∑ j = 1  k  P i j   × w j         where Zi   is the integrated sustainability score of the i th city.  2.3.3 Evenness score calculation Since the introduction of the SDGs in 2015, many studies have shown that the 17 SDGs should be addressed equally (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). In this study, we calculated the evenness score (ES) by using an improved fan radar chart method. The eigenvector area (S ) and perimeter (L ) were calculated with the following formulas (Smith & Wilson, 1996 ):(7) S i  = ∑ j = 1  n  S j  = ∑ j = 1  n  π f j  r j  2      (8) L i  = ∑ j = 1  n  L j  = 2 | r m a x   − r m i n    |  + ∑ j = 1  n  2 π f j  r j      (9) E S = 4 π S i   L i   2       where n  represents the number of SDGs or cities, rmax  , and rmin   represent the maximum and minimum values of the scores, rj   represents the j th score, and fj   represents the j th weight. The ES is the highest when goals existed the same score for one city or all cities have the same score for one goal.  2.3.4 Correlation analysis Interactions can be categorized as synergies or trade-offs, where one goal advances or hinders the other. This study adopted correlation analysis to quantify the trade-off synergies between SDGs. Spearman's correlation coefficient can assess the degree of correlation between variables (Spearman, 1904 ), and captures nonlinear correlations between variables, which is less sensitive to outliers. In this study, we used correlation coefficients (r ) of ± 0.5 as a threshold to define synergies and trade-offs between pairs of indicators, indicating that the indicators have relatively strong or at least moderate relationships when r  > 0.5 or < -0.5 (Smarandache, 2008 ).(10) r s  = 1 − 6 ∑ D  2   n ( n  2  − 1  )        where n  represents the number of samples.    3 Results 3.1 Variations of sustainable development performances 3.1.1 Variations of goals sustainability The comprehensive sustainable development levels of 13 SDGs were measured and the scores presented an overall improvement in Shandong Province from 2011 to 2020 (Fig. 3  ). There was an obvious decline of SDG sores in 2019, with an overall decline of about 6%, while the sustainable development level has been improved in 2020. Shandong Province showed a commendable performance across most SDG indicators, particularly in SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Notably, SDG 11 attained the highest score. Meanwhile, there were relatively lower scores for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) and SDG 13 (climate action), indicating persisting challenges faced by Shandong Province concerning urban-rural disparities and climate change mitigation. Specifically, the scores of SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) exhibited a consistent upward trend from 2011 to 2020. The score of SDG 1 (no poverty) showed a prominent increase of 14.23%, particularly during the period between 2011 and 2016 when it surged from 0.051 to 0.06. These findings indicate that Shandong Province has actively promoted employment opportunities for impoverished individuals, implemented targeted poverty alleviation measures, and made substantial efforts to achieve poverty eradication. The scores of SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) also exhibited improvements during the study period, primarily attributed to Shandong Province's persistent efforts in promoting the transition from old to new driving forces, fostering strategic emerging industries, and continuously advancing high-quality development. The scores of SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 15 (life on land) exhibited a slight decline from 2011 to 2020. In particular, the continued increase in CO2  emissions highlights the need for a greater focus on carbon emissions to plan for achieving the targets of carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.  3.1.2 Spatial pattern of city sustainability The sustainable development level of cities exhibited a distinct spatial pattern, and the SDG scores gradually decreased from Jinan and Qingdao towards the surrounding areas, with the western regions displaying relatively low levels compared to the eastern regions (Fig. 4  ). Specifically, Qingdao and Jinan achieved high levels of sustainable development, with scores were 0.645 and 0.613 in 2020, respectively. Weifang also performed relatively well in sustainable development with an SDG score of 0.535 in 2020. However, the cities of Binzhou, Liaocheng, Zaozhuang, and Rizhao showed comparatively low levels of sustainability. Additionally, the rapid development of the central city and its radiating effect on the surrounding cities have contributed to a more equitable level of sustainable development in Shandong Province during the study period, progressively reducing geographical development disparities. In terms of the interannual variation, the sustainable development level exhibited a general trend of growth between 2011 and 2018, followed by a slight decline from 2018 to 2019, and ultimately stabilized from 2019 to 2020. The cities in eastern regions consistently exhibited better performance of sustainable development compared to cities in other regions in most years. Jining and Jinan experienced the most prominent development from 2011 to 2020, with the SDG scores increased from 0.377 to 0.487 and 0.515 to 0.613, respectively. Most cities in the western region still scored below 0.4, with relatively little change, and were in the weak sustainability phase. It was worth noting that Yantai, Linyi, and Binzhou experienced obvious decreases in SDG scores from 2011 to 2020, representing the urgent need to further capitalize on their strengths and address their shortcomings to promote comprehensive sustainable urban development.   3.2 Evenness differences of sustainable development 3.2.1 Evenness characteristic at SDGs level There are differences in the goals development among cities. Promoting the evenness of each goal development in the region can improve the imbalance of regional development, and can form an agglomeration effect to further promote urban development. From the perspective of sustainable goal evenness in Shandong Province from 2011 to 2020 (Fig. 5  ), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) exhibited more evenness among cities. Conversely, SDG 15 (life on land) showed noteworthy disparities among cities and the lowest level of evenness. The ES for most SDGs have improved from 2011 to 2020. In particular, the ES of SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) increased from 0.66 in 2011 to 0.73 in 2020, resulting in an overall increase of 9.10%. Similarly, the ES of SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) increased from 0.53 in 2011 to 0.59 in 2020, indicating an overall increase of 12.07%. However, there has been a decrease in the ES for certain goals such as SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), which declined from 0.67 in 2011 to 0.58 in 2020.  3.2.2 Evenness characteristic at city level It is crucial to comprehend the evenness characteristics among goals to comprehensively evaluate the region's development status and foster the synergies of multiple goals. Obvious disparities in the evenness among SDGs were observed from 2011 to 2020 (Fig. 6  ). The overall development paths of Jinan, Zaozhuang, Yantai, and Tai'an were relatively ideal, with a more evenness development of goals and multi-year average ES values above 0.55. However, Linyi, Weihai, Heze, and Binzhou have relatively low ES values and a more uneven development of SDGs. It was worth noting that certain cities exhibited higher sustainable development scores but relatively lower ES. For instance, the sustainable development score of Weihai was 0.475 in 2020 (above the average value of 0.448 for all cities), while the ES was only 0.510 (below the average value of 0.530 for all cities). This discrepancy suggests a lack of synchronization between urban sustainable development levels and goals evenness, indicating an existing imbalance in the development process with multiple goals. From 2011 to 2020, there was an increasing trend in the overall ES of most cities. Specifically, Zaozhuang, Jining, Tai'an, and Linyi exhibited obvious increases of 32%, 15%, 13%, and 17%, respectively. Conversely, Jinan, Qingdao, Zibo, Dongying, Dezhou, Liaocheng, and Binzhou have witnessed a decline in their ES, especially the ES in Dezhou and Binzhou decreased from 0.63 to 0.51 and 0.62 to 0.52, respectively.   3.3 Synergies and trade-offs between SDGs The results of the multi-year average correlation between the SDGs in Shandong Province are shown in Fig. 7  . In the 78 interactions types between the SDGs, 37 types were positive and 41 types were negative. There were only 18 types of strong interactions between the SDGs, which was less than weak interactions. However, there were more strong synergistic relationships (11 types) compared to strong trade-off relationships (7 types). The synergies between SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11 were particularly significant. The synergies between SDG1 (no poverty) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), as well as between SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), were extremely prominent with correlation coefficients of 0.75. Generally, there were relatively strong synergies between poverty eradication (SDG 1) and sustainable water resources, sustainable energy, sustainable economic growth, sustainable industry, and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively). Meanwhile, the SDGs exhibited predominantly weak trade-offs among them. Only seven pairs of goals demonstrated significant trade-offs, especially the SGD 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SGD 15 (life on land) with a correlation coefficient of -0.67. The synergies and trade-offs between SDGs changed dynamically from 2011 to 2020 (Fig. 8  ), and the positive linkages between the SDGs were strengthened with an increase in the number of synergistic goals pairs from 5 in 2011 to 12 in 2020. The synergistic relationships between SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 1 and SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 9, and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) have demonstrated relative stability. From 2011 to 2020, trade-offs were particularly prominent for SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) and SDG 13 (climate action), which presented greater challenges in achieving synergies.   4 Discussion 4.1 Sustainable development from multiple perspectives Sustainable development is the key way to ensure human well-being, economic prosperity, and the building of an ecological civilization. The present study established a localized urban sustainable development assessment framework and analyzed the sustainability and evenness. The results showed obvious spatiotemporal differences of the sustainable development level in Shandong province. Xu et al. (2020)  also discovered large spatial and temporal variations in the sustainable development of different provinces in China. Understanding the spatiotemporal complexity is crucial for governments to take effective action for SDGs implementation. Therefore, it is always important to consider the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of sustainable development at different scales (Jia et al., 2023 ). Additionally, it is challenging to synchronize the achievement of SDGs, which is influenced by regional development conditions and stages (Liu et al., 2021 ). However, excessive unevenness could result in unsustainable urban development. In this study, some cities showed high scores for sustainability, however, they did not perform as well for evenness, indicating a large development gap among different goals. This discrepancy may be attributed to the rapid socio-economic growth that has resulted in an increase in sustainable development levels, while simultaneously lagging behind in addressing the rich-poor gap and ecological environment issues. In fact, rapid economic growth at the cost of the environment is considered to be an unsustainable model of development. Consequently, relying solely on a pure sustainable development score proves inadequate for comprehensively assessing regional sustainability status (Fan et al., 2019 ; Fu et al., 2022 ). Therefore, it remains essential to analyze sustainaility from multiple perspectives by incorporating additional indicators such as evenness.  4.2 Complicated interactions among SDGs Synergies among the SDGs can contribute to the comprehensive realization of sustainable urban development. Our findings showed that although the proportion of synergies and trade-offs between SDGs were approximately equal, they exhibited more types of strong synergistic than strong trade-offs. Similarly, Pradhan et al., and Kropp (2017)  reported a comparable conclusion that the number of synergies within the goals is surpasses the trade-offs. This suggests that the SDGs may be establishing positive linkages. However, the interactions among the SDGs are changing with time (Cao et al., 2023 ), and some studies found a potential decrease in synergistic relationships (Fang et al., 2023 ; Kroll et al., 2019 ). In addition, the complicated interactions were not limited to the synergies and trade-offs between two goals. More complex influences and feedbacks may be present in multiple goals. For instance, the SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 2 (zero hunger) may exert impacts on SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) together, and SDG 2 and SDG 8 could influence SDG 1 simultaneously.The cross-scale effects also add to this complexity among SDGs (Xiao et al., 2024 ). Therefore, attention should be focused on the interactions among SDGs. Priorities should then be identified by considering synergies and trade-offs to maximize benefits and exploit synergies among the goals.  4.3 Implications for sustainable development Under rapid urbanization and global warming, the sustainable development is of great significance in addressing social, economic, and environmental issues (Fu et al., 2022 ; Qiao et al., 2023 ). Governments should enhance the comprehensiveness of their sustainable development measures to effectively address the challenges, which is vital to expedite the process of SDGs. First, incorporating the principles of sustainable development into thoughts and actions. This includes synergizing the SDGs, national concepts (e.g. Ecological Civilization and Beautiful China), and development planning. Second, it is crucial to prioritize the SDGs that are relatively lagging behind and implement targeted policies to promote overall system sustainability. For instance, climate factors exert a profound influence on human production and livelihoods (Jia et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2023 ). This necessitates a rational reduction in carbon emissions to mitigate climate change impacts. It is also imperative to effectively strengthen the promotion of new qualitative productive forces and ensure the harmonious combination of economic benefits, environmental protection, and social responsibility. Third, it is necessary to enhance the complementarity of advantages among regions, bridge the gap between developed and relatively underdeveloped regions, and foster regional integration and coordination. Finally, according to the synergies of SDGs, formulation collaborative policy across sectors and regions can enhance the effectiveness and adaptability of goals implementation.  4.4 Limitations The selection of data and indicators remains a key challenge in the evaluation of sustainable development. However, due to data availability and indicator sensitivity, despite relying on China's national conditions and local policies to establish an indicator framework, a consensus has not yet been reached and uncertainties still exist. In the future, it is critical to improve sustainable development evaluation system by integrating statistical data, earth observation data, remote sensing data, big data, and other multi-source data types. In addition, the interactions among the SDGs have a profound impact on sustainable development (Cao et al., 2023 ). This study employed evenness and correlation methods to explore the interactions between SDGs. Multiple methods and models will be adopted to systematically analyze the complex relationship among SDGs and explore the path of synergistic optimization in further studies (Fritz et al., 2019 ).   5 Conclusions This study adopted the SDGs as a guiding to establish a framework for regional urban sustainable development. Taking Shandong Province as a case study to evaluate its sustainable development level and analyze evenness characteristics from 2011 to 2020. Additionally, the synergistic and trade-off relationships between SDGs were investigated. The results presented an increase in the overall level of sustainable development in Shandong Province from 2011 to 2020, exhibiting enhanced performance in poverty alleviation, ensuring food security and promoting sustainable agriculture, fostering sustainable industrialization, and advancing sustainable cities. In terms of spatial pattern, it exhibited characteristics centered on the cities of Jinan and Qingdao, with higher levels in the east compared to the west. The evenness indicated a different development process for each goal, and there were obvious regional differences in the development of the same goal across different cities. The proportion of synergies and trade-offs between SDGs was roughly equal, with weak overall interrelationships but more strong synergies than strong trade-offs, and these interactions were undergoing dynamic changes. This study will provide valuable insights for localized urban sustainable development research aligned with SDGs, and offer decision support to achieve multi-goal synergistic optimization and comprehensive sustainable development.
