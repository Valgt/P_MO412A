                  The Sustainable Development Goal 7 endeavors to ameliorate the energy system towards sustainability. Monitoring the country’s progress to the goal will be of utmost for the government to take suitable actions and thus, constructing a performance monitoring index for Sustainable Development Goal 7 would tune the pace of implementation. This study aims to develop a novel Sustainable Development Goal 7 or Energy Sustainability Composite Index to assess the energy sustainability performance. Since Europe tends to have diverged efforts towards energy sustainability, assessing them with the proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index would provide the evidence needed for effective sustainable development strategies. By describing Europe, the authors signify 40 European countries and the selection of country depends on the availability of all the data that are required for the energy sustainability assessment. In this study, the analyzed energy sustainability aspects include clean energy conversion, energy security, energy accessibility, energy intensity and carbon intensity. The results show that Iceland, Norway, and Sweden tops in energy sustainability aspects with scores of 0.7313, 0.6967, and 0.6313 (on a scale of 0 to 1), respectively. The proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index is also compared with the actual Sustainable Development Goal 7 index, which comprises the indicators defined by the United Nations. The prime difference between the proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index and the actual Sustainable Development Goal 7 index resides in the consideration of energy security and carbon intensity indicators and in the framework designed to evaluate the clean energy prevalence. The evaluated actual Sustainable Development Goal 7 index scores of Germany and France are 0.4915 and 0.4656, respectively. On comparing with the proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index scores, the scores decreased by 20.9% for Germany and increased by 7.2% for France. The robustness of the proposed composite index relies on reducing the effect of outliers by using a modified min–max methodology, namely Aggregated Normalization based on Maximum and Minimum Outliers for normalization and the subsequent weightage allocation criteria utilized in Analytic Hierarchy Process methodology. Sensitivity analyses highlighted that the clean energy indicator is the most influencing indicator for the designed composite index. Nevertheless, uncertainty analysis indicates that the weightage scenario has a more prominent influence than various normalization and aggregation methods.

Table 1 Literature survey of various studies dealing with composite index.         Reference  Composite index name  Purpose  Dimensions and indicators  Location / Application  Results  Remarks    [29]  Sustainable Human Development Index (SHDI) and Environmentally-centered Sustainable Human Development Index (ESHDI) Aimed to monitor the sustainable human development Integration of two sustainability-related dimensions, i.e., environment and freedom to the existing standard framework of HDI with three dimensions is proposed World The top three ranks are: (i) HDI - Norway, Australia and Netherlands. (ii) SHDI - France, Iceland and Denmark. (iii) ESHDI - France, Iceland and Denmark A new class of method for aggregation is put forward to avoid the problem involved with the geometric mean  [30]  – To evaluate the post right recognition impact of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) The index integrates 8 parameters and 15 indicators 300 right holding households in Tripura, India The performed assessment highlights that 25% of the villages have 'very good' socio-economic and vegetation conditions The application of the composite index can be well-suitable for policy assessment. The interlinkages between various considered social parameters are established.  [31]  Climate Change Adaptation Index (CCAI) To assess the national adaptation to climate change in the energy sector CCAI covers three dimensions namely, reactive, anticipatory, and planned adaption Colombia The results emphasize that the energy generation sector's foundation to build a planned adaptation to climate change is barely being laid. Planned adaptation reduces the vulnerability to climate change through a comprehensive approach by including both the adaptation and mitigation strategies  [32]  SDG 9 Progress Index To track the progress made in meeting SDG 9 between 2000 and 2016 SDG 9 progress index consists of five indicators 124 countries The results indicate that 58 countries progressed towards achieving SDG 9 while 66 countries regressed away. The progress index primarily focuses on the change incurred in the given period and it differs from performance indices that evaluate the performance at a given time  [33]  Energy Efficiency Index (EEI) To assess the energy efficiency performance of the industrial sector and to compare the sub-sectoral performance in 2017 The composite index includes 12 indicators grouped within three dimensions such as technical, economic, and environmental 18 main manufacturing industrial sub-sectors in Latvia Various opportunities prevail for enhancing energy efficiency throughout all the manufacturing industrial sectors of Latvia and immense potential to improve energy efficiency is observed in high energy-intensive sectors such as wood and non-metallic mineral manufacturing The study can be extended to perform analysis for a different time period and various countries to compare and contrast the energy efficiency performance of the industrial sector with the usage of EEI from an international perspective  [34]  Life cycle composite footprint index To evaluate the sludge-to-energy technologies in line with sustainable development of the sludge management industry The index analyses 4 dimensions of footprint which include energy, carbon, water and other footprints Six sludge-to-energy scenarios were assessed as a case study Dewatered sludge melting was the most preferable and the drying process was the most undesirable Different weightage methods such as Fuzzy Best-Worst methods and Fuzzy AHP are incorporated  [35]  Proteus composite index To analyze the multidimensional concept of food security and track country's food security status The composite index is built on four dimensions and 21 indicators 185 countries In 2017, the top 5 most food-insecure countries are Somalia, South Sudan, Haiti, Central African Republic, Eritrea The proteus index is a flexible tool to capture the food security scenario in a country and it can be effectively used to compare with other countries. It also indicates the sudden onset crisis and provides a stable score over time.  [36]  Environmental State and Sustainability Index (ESSI) To account for the changes and actual state in environmental dimensions ESSI consists of 9 dimensions 165 countries ESSI is comparable to Environmental Performance Index (EPI) and better mapping of the actual situation is accomplished with a large difference in ranking exists in some countries ESSI is presented as a critique to Environmental Performance Index (EPI)  [37]  Aggregated Composite Index (ACI) To rank the countries based on energy security and environmental sustainability aspects based on carbon emissions ACI considers indicators from energy, economic and environmental dimensions World Canada, the USA, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Russia are the top-ranked countries A linear programming approach is used to develop the composite index  [38]  Energy Security and Environmental Sustainability Index (ESESI) To evaluate the energy security and environmental sustainability of South Asian countries Energy security and environmental sustainability represents the two dimensions of ESESI and it composes a total of 11 indicators South Asian countries Bhutan scored the most while Maldives scored the least in ESESI This study recommends trans -regional renewable energy investments and cross-border energy trade to substantiate long-term energy security and environmental sustainability  [39]  Global Electricity Security Index (GESI) To assess electricity security at the global level Five dimensions and five indicators 14 countries over 25 years Among 14 countries, the USA has the highest overall electricity security The focus of the study is to develop a composite index for evaluating global electricity security accurately using a minimum number of indicators  [40]  – To build a composite index for measuring natural gas supply security Six indicators have been integrated to frame the composite index Croatia The composite index score reached a minimum value of 0.37 in 2015 and a maximum value of 0.58 in 2001 The lower value corresponds to better natural gas supply security and vice-versa  [41]  Composite Environmental Impact Index (CEII) To assess the extent of degradation in agriculture CEII comprises 17 environmental impact indicators Three districts of north-western Bangladesh About 27 to 69% of the theoretical maximum level of degradation, environmental damage is attributed to high yield variety rice cultivation –  [42]  Composite Index of Environmental Performance (CIEP) To analyze the environmental performance trends over time CIEP consists of 20 indicators World Iceland, Norway and Sweden are the countries showing the best environmental performance whereas Cote d’Ivoire, India and Angola are the countries exhibiting poor environmental performance CRITIC method is utilized for weightage allocation  [43]  Comprehensive energy poverty index (CEPI) To measure the magnitude of energy poverty 10 indicators comprise the CEPI Association of Southeast Asian Nations and India Cambodia is ranked as the most energy-poor country while Thailand is ranked as the least energy-poor country CEPI maps availability, accessibility and affordability of energy  [44]  Inclusive Green Energy index To measure the progress towards accessible, green and efficient energy Three dimensions of Sustainable Development Goal 7 157 countries The results highlight that 87% of the countries considered for analysis shows some degree of progress The progress is evaluated as the changes that occurred over time     Table 2 Sustainable Development Goal 7 and its targets as well as indicators [4] .

The Sustainable Development Goal 7 endeavors to ameliorate the energy system towards sustainability. Monitoring the country’s progress to the goal will be of utmost for the government to take suitable actions and thus, constructing a performance monitoring index for Sustainable Development Goal 7 would tune the pace of implementation. This study aims to develop a novel Sustainable Development Goal 7 or Energy Sustainability Composite Index to assess the energy sustainability performance. Since Europe tends to have diverged efforts towards energy sustainability, assessing them with the proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index would provide the evidence needed for effective sustainable development strategies. By describing Europe, the authors signify 40 European countries and the selection of country depends on the availability of all the data that are required for the energy sustainability assessment. In this study, the analyzed energy sustainability aspects include clean energy conversion, energy security, energy accessibility, energy intensity and carbon intensity. The results show that Iceland, Norway, and Sweden tops in energy sustainability aspects with scores of 0.7313, 0.6967, and 0.6313 (on a scale of 0 to 1), respectively. The proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index is also compared with the actual Sustainable Development Goal 7 index, which comprises the indicators defined by the United Nations. The prime difference between the proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index and the actual Sustainable Development Goal 7 index resides in the consideration of energy security and carbon intensity indicators and in the framework designed to evaluate the clean energy prevalence. The evaluated actual Sustainable Development Goal 7 index scores of Germany and France are 0.4915 and 0.4656, respectively. On comparing with the proposed Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index scores, the scores decreased by 20.9% for Germany and increased by 7.2% for France. The robustness of the proposed composite index relies on reducing the effect of outliers by using a modified min–max methodology, namely Aggregated Normalization based on Maximum and Minimum Outliers  for normalization and the subsequent weightage allocation criteria utilized in Analytic Hierarchy Process methodology. Sensitivity analyses highlighted that the clean energy indicator is the most influencing indicator for the designed composite index. Nevertheless, uncertainty analysis indicates that the weightage scenario has a more prominent influence than various normalization and aggregation methods.

Through all of these developments, humans distanced themselves from nature. Most of these human activities and developments created an imbalance in natural cycles, and this is nowadays reflected as a climate crisis. To revamp those approaches, humans had begun to pursue sustainable developments, which acts as an enduring approach for surviving on par with the ecosystem and for the betterment of the planet. In this context, the United Nations General Assembly adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ” [1] . Therefore, SDGs promote energy-efficient economies, human welfare, environmental sustainability, healthy lifestyles, innovations and sustainable production and consumption [2] . When interpreting the current environmental issues and climate crisis, the root cause somehow leads to the usage of unclean energy, industry induced pollutions and societal behaviors. Among these, the use of polluting energy resources such as fossil fuels have profoundly affected the environment throughout history. This pinpoints the significance of accommodating energy transition from unclean to clean energy resources, which is pivotal to achieve SDG 7, that is, to ensure Affordable and Clean Energy for all [3,4] . The prime challenge in achieving this goal relies on accommodating the growing energy demand in terms of modern and sustainable energy resources as well as increasing the share of clean energy sources [5,6] . In general, there are numerous synergic and trade-off effects among the 17 SDGs through which SDG 7 can exert an influence on other goals [7–9] . Hence, SDG 7 is the most underpinning goal that can drive or foster the progress in other SDGs, and it has a direct relationship with Climate Action (SDG 13) as well [10,11] . The contribution towards SDG 7 in any means of strategic planning backed up by research would substantially influence the energy policies. One such contribution to the goal relies on measuring the progress that each country has made towards the goal and this requisite proper research framework. Monitoring the progress towards the target is as important as framing a strategic plan to accomplish the same. This would help us to refine our actions and measures, similar to a feedback mechanism. One of the many ways through which the progress can be monitored is by developing measuring indices. For instance, the SDG index provides a comprehensive evaluation of the countries that appeal to cover a wide spectrum of economic, social and environmental challenges that would underpin sustainable development rather than a narrowly focused development index such as the GDP [12] . On the other hand, indices are also proposed to measure specific progress. As an example, a multicriteria assessment index is framed for evaluating the sustainable energy transition readiness level of countries based on social, political, economic, and technological aspects of transition governed by eight evaluation criteria [13] . Other sustainable development and planning frameworks can be established with multicriteria decision analysis methodology [14]  and multistakeholder transdisciplinary methods are also presented to address the water, energy, and food sustainability concerns [15] . Benchmarking the country’s progress in various aspects of the goal might be too difficult when several indicators represent the country’s status. This calls for an aggregate indicator or index to measure the progress covering the multi-dimensional aspects of the desired goal. This makes the comparative analysis of various countries much easier. Moreover, it can be crucial in developing policies and advocacy towards sustainability since such indicators would yield a reference standard to influence policy makers and the political arena [16] . Composite indicator prevails as a better tool and is widely used by analysts, and it can be equipped to capture the multi-dimensional attributes of energy sustainability. If the composite indices are prone to measure the progress, then a sufficient number of indicators need to be incorporated to accommodate the multi-dimensional aspect without comprising the interpretability of the index [17,18] . Composite indicators also offer flexibility to control the influence of each sub-indicators, which is supportive to represent the accurate dynamics of reality. The application of composite index is extended to various domains such as human development [19] , climate change [20] , general satisfaction [21] , cities’ performance [22] , environmental damage [23] , sustainable assessment of municipalities of the megacities [24] , social sustainable development [25] , energy systems [26] , and investments for renewable energy industry [27] . Table 1   shows the literature survey of various studies that construct a composite index to assess peculiar problems. Europe is one of the continents that exhibits better performance in sustainability perspectives [28]  and possesses diverged approaches towards sustainability. This induces interest to analyze the status of various European countries in energy sustainability and to investigate the influencing factors for those European countries that are leading and lagging in the energy sustainability aspects. This study aims to analyze the aspects of energy sustainability ranging from discussing the current scenario to quantifying them. For establishing an effective quantitative analysis, this study proposes a novel composite index for evaluating the energy sustainability status of 40 European countries by considering the multi-dimensional factors that influence them. Although this study focuses on Europe, the methodology adopted for the development of the novel SDG 7 composite index can be extended to any country or continent outside Europe. The construction of the SDG 7 composite index is accomplished to entrench the ranking among 40 European countries and the novelty of this study is elucidated as follows:• Designing and conceptualizing the novel SDG 7 composite index, and actual SDG 7 composite index as well as integrating the parameters through an appropriate framework.  • Introducing a modified normalization method to reduce the influence of outliers  • Performing sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to evaluate the robustness of the designed framework.    The remaining work is structured as follows: Section 2  signifies the need for a new SDG 7 index and elaborates the design of the proposed SDG 7 composite index. Section 3  presents the methodology to evaluate the proposed SDG 7 composite index. Section 4  details the results of energy sustainability assessment for the considered countries in terms of the proposed index, and a comparative analysis with the actual SDG 7 index is also presented. Further, the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for the proposed SDG 7 composite index is presented in Section 4 . Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5 . A numerical example is also elaborated in Appendix .  2 Design of the novel SDG 7 composite index 2.1 The need The objective of SDG 7 is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all [4] . For measuring the progress of SDGs, the UN developed targets and indicators under each goal. Likewise, for SDG 7, the framed targets and indicators are shown in Table 2  . Out of all the indicators, data only exists for 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1 for most countries. To add upon this, targets 7.A and 7.B measure or depict the development efforts towards the target but do not picture the status of energy sustainability in a country. Moreover, the data for target 7.A is available only for a few countries. Therefore, to portray the energy sustainability of a country, if the SDG 7 index is framed according to UN’s targets and indicators, it will only include the following indicators: access to electricity and clean fuels, renewable energy share in TFEC, and energy intensity. The SDG 7 index formed by using these indicators does not reflect energy sustainability as it lacks the emission aspects, clean energy utilization and energy security perspectives, which are all defined as the core objective of SDG 7. Moreover, since the climate crisis demands a rapid response to cut down the emissions [45] , the energy sustainability assessment should be inclusive of the factors that contribute towards environmental sustainability [46] . Hence, it is required to refurbish the indicators that are considered for the SDG 7 index. In this context, the authors designed a novel composite index to measure the progress towards the SDG 7 and the index is termed as Energy Sustainability Index  or SDG 7 Composite Index .  2.2 Conceptual framework Energy sustainability is governed by numerous factors and no single indicator can capture the multidimensional characteristics. Therefore, composite indicators are more suitable for the assessment of energy sustainability. The objective of developing a new energy sustainability index is to provide a scientific tool for policy makers and governments to evaluate the country’s performance for achieving energy sustainability. It aids the research community in involving the process of continuous development in line with sustainability. On the other hand, such a composite index is also supportive of tracking the progress in implementing the efforts towards SDG 7. The conceptual framework to obtain the SDG 7 composite index through its constituting indicators and parameters is shown in Fig. 1  . The proposed SDG 7 composite indicator is derived from the raw data corresponding to each country through a sequence of the process. This involves the selection of indicators and parameters, data acquisition, outlier identification, normalization, weightage allocation, aggregation, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis. The intuitive approach for developing the SDG 7 composite index relies on the indicators defined by the UN, but as discussed in the previous section, these indicators do not cover the vision of energy sustainability. Hence, the authors analyzed and selected the most appropriate indicators that highlight the definition of energy sustainability. The selection of indicators and their associated parameters are discussed in the next section.  2.3 Selection of indicators and parameters In this study, the indicators represent the constituting factors for constructing the composite index, and the term parameters are used to describe the constituting factors for designing the indicator. The selected indicators needed to build the SDG 7 composite index include energy accessibility, energy security, energy intensity, clean energy, and carbon intensity. Energy accessibility directly aligns with the objective of SDG 7. Energy security prevails as a direct measure of reliability, and it is a mid-goal towards energy affordability. Energy intensity expresses the energy efficiency of an economy. The lower the energy intensity, the higher is the energy efficiency for a given economy (expressed in Joules per US$ (J/US$)). The clean energy indicator and carbon intensity indicator are highly related not only to energy sustainability but also to environmental sustainability. As a whole, all the selected indicators cover the influencing factors for achieving SDG 7. 2.3.1 Clean energy indicator The energy sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions marked by the huge dependency on fossil fuels. Moreover, poor air quality is regarded as the fourth major threat to human health [47] . All this infers that clean energy conversion and utilization prevails as a need  rather than a want . Typically, the status of clean energy prevalence can be assessed by analyzing the amount of energy converted from clean resources. Clean energy resources include most of the renewable energy sources and nuclear power. However, in this study, the renewable energy resources are only considered as clean energy resources to directly align with SDG 7 target 7.2. The parameters considered for clean energy analysis include per capita non-renewable contribution , per capita renewable contribution,  and renewable richness in the energy mix . Per capita non-renewable and renewable contributions are regarded as the ratio of collective energy supplied in Joules (J) by converting non-renewable and renewable sources of energy resources, respectively, to the given population. Whereas, the renewable energy richness in the country’s energy mix is accounted as the percentage contribution of renewables in the total primary energy supply (TPES). The reason for considering TPES is because it includes both consumed energy and the energy lost during transmission. In other words, TPES directly represents the available energy for a given country. Hence, considering the renewable richness with respect to TPES would yield wider aspects for evaluating the clean energy utilization ability of the country in comparison with total final energy consumption (TFEC). The purpose for considering per capita non-renewable and renewable contribution is that the energy mix parameter alone cannot accurately map the clean energy prevalence in a country. For instance, consider a scenario where country A possesses a rich renewable energy mix with less TPES whereas country B possesses a lower renewable richness in their energy mix with a higher TPES, relatively. In this case, considering the energy mix parameter alone would result in an biased comparison since the energy obtained from the renewables in country B might be higher than country A (possibly due to a higher TPES in country B). Therefore, the inclusion of the country’s non-renewable and renewable contributions would depict the accurate clean energy scenario. When the parameters are evaluated for per capita scale, it equalizes the bias induced by the population factor since the non-renewable and renewable contribution is a fraction of TPES and TPES or the energy footprint increases with population growth [48] .  2.3.2 Energy security indicator The International Energy Agency (IEA) defines energy security as “the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price “[49] .  Thus, energy security is a mid-way goal to achieve energy affordability, which is the key aspect of energy sustainability. Generally, the countries that possess abundant natural energy resources tend to be more energy secure, and they have a vital role in the energy market. The common factors that directly highlight the energy security of a nation include import and export characteristics as well as the extent of diversification of their energy dependency. Further, energy security can be established if a country produces enough energy to satisfy its energy consumption and this is known as energy self-sufficiency. Thus, for evaluating the energy security indicator, four parameters are considered: Energy self-sufficiency ratio, Import per capita, Export per capita, and Energy diversification parameter (EDP). The energy self-sufficiency ratio determines the extent of a country’s ability to satisfy the energy needs without depending on other countries. Import and export parameters cover the accurate energy quantity that is traded with other countries to achieve energy security. For analyzing the diversity of energy dependency of each country, the authors introduce a new parameter, known as Energy Diversification Parameter (EDP).  A straightforward procedure is carried out to quantify the EDP based on the ranking method [50] , which is elaborated in Section 3 . EDP is included because the country’s dependency on various energy resources would ultimately impart resiliency in satisfying the energy demand in the lack of any given energy resource. And this reflects the characteristics of energy security.  2.3.3 Energy intensity indicator Energy intensity is the measure of energy efficiency expressed in terms of energy consumption and GDP. Since the raw data for energy intensity is directly available, it does not involve any constituting parameters. The reason for selecting the energy intensity indicator is that it prevails as the measure of energy efficiency of a country’s development, which is much needed for progressing towards energy sustainability [51] . Further, energy intensity is also defined by the UN as a measure to SDG 7.  2.3.4 Energy accessibility indicator Energy accessibility depicts the universal access to electricity, clean fuels and modern energy services. This indicator is composed of two parameters, namely access to electricity and access to clean fuels. Though energy accessibility does not directly define energy sustainability, it is required to substantiate sustainable development for all. Thus, energy accessibility measured in terms of access to electricity and clean fuels would contribute to the objective of SDG 7 to provide universal access.  2.3.5 Carbon intensity indicator Carbon intensity can be defined as the carbon emissions per unit of energy. In this study, it is measured in kg CO2 -eq per MJ, and it is obtained by dividing the total annual CO2  emissions of the country with TPES for the considered year of analysis. The total annual emissions include emissions from energy conversion, production processes such as cement production, and other territorial emissions. Since carbon intensity can be directly obtained from the ratio of total annual emissions to TPES, it can be obtained without any other constituting parameters. Also, this indictor has the flexibility to map the influence of futuristic energy technologies that focus on decarbonization since carbon intensity relies on CO2  emissions. An example of such technology includes fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and storage.    3 Methodology 3.1 Parameter construction and data acquisition The parameters that are used to construct the indicators are elucidated in this section and the data acquisition is accomplished for all factors or parameters, and the sources are presented in Table 3  . Per capita non-renewable and renewable contribution : The non-renewable and renewable contribution is obtained in terms of Tetra Joules (TJ). Dividing non-renewable contribution or renewable contribution with total population would yield the required parameter, and it is expressed in Mega Joules (MJ) per capita. Renewable richness in energy mix : This concerns the ratio of renewable contribution to the TPES, and TPES can be obtained by adding renewable and non-renewable contributions. This parameter is independent of the population influence. The higher the value, the higher is the renewable energy penetration. This parameter is expressed in terms of percentage (%). Energy intensity : This can be represented as the ratio of TFEC to GDP. Since the energy intensity data is available in IRENA country statistics, it is directly utilized without extracting the GDP data. It is represented in MJ per 1$ of GDP. Only the energy intensity data corresponding to Andorra was missing. This data was calculated by the authors. Access to electricity and clean fuels : This parameter indicates the percentage of population that has access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking. Generally, it is obtained by finding the ratio of the population that has electricity access to that of the total population. Similarly, the percentage of access to clean fuels can be determined. Carbon intensity : As defined in Section 2.3.5 , the carbon intensity is obtained as the ratio of total annual emission to the TPES of the country under consideration, and it is represented as kg CO2 -eq/MJ in this study. Import and export per capita : Import represents the amount of energy brought in to satisfy the energy demand of the country, whereas export indicates the amount of energy supplied from the considered country to another. Both the exported and imported energy are expressed in TJ. Import and export per capita are derived by dividing the import and export values by the total population of the country. These parameters are expressed in MJ per capita. Energy self-sufficiency ratio:  It represents the ratio of the total energy produced within the country to the total energy consumed in the country. If the ratio is greater than 1, then a country is self-sufficient to satisfy its energy needs while it is dependent on imported energy resources when the ratio is lesser than 1. The extent of dependence on importation is influenced by both energy production and consumption factors. Table 4   shows the acquired data of all the above discussed parameters for 40 countries. Energy Diversification Parameter (EDP) : This parameter is proposed by the authors to depict the resilient nature of a country by diversifying its energy resource dependency. To construct this parameter the data concerning the share of each energy resource in the energy mix of the country is required. A straightforward procedure is carried out to quantify the EDP based on the ranking method [50] . The energy security ranking score for various energy resources is presented in Table 5  . And the scores are allocated based on the characteristics of the energy resource. These characteristics revolve around the consistent availability and abundance of resources. Nuclear energy proved to substantiate energy security for the long run (operational for more than 30 or 40 years) with no GHG emissions [55,56] . Geothermal resources are available throughout the day and for an indefinite number of years and their supply risks are less in comparison to other renewables and fossil fuels [57] . Nuclear and geothermal energy resources favor achieving energy security to a higher extent and are, therefore, regarded as tier 1 energy secure resources. Hydropower, wind and solar energy resources though present in abundance, are highly influenced by climatic conditions and exhibits intermittent characteristics [58] . Although solar and wind energy resource underpins the sustainable energy transition, the intermittent characteristics mandates additional resources and sophisticated storage systems such as batteries, hydrogen energy systems, energy storage or pumped hydropower storage to provide uninterrupted supply. Hence, these energy resources belong to tier 2 energy secure resources. Bioenergy resource requires a sustainable way of consumption and thus, they are limited at large scale utilization [59–61] . Oil energy sources are easy to transport, handle, and can be stored for a considerable amount of time [62] . Therefore, bioenergy and oil energy resources are treated as tier 3 energy secure resources due to their consistent availability but limited possible utilization. On the other hand, coal and gas are scarce resources, difficult to handle, induce dependency on other resource-rich countries, possess higher GHG emissions and requires more energy to exploit the resources [63–69] . Thus, these energy resources are characterized as difficult to store and scarce availability right under tier 4. Overall, the energy resources are categorized based on their availability, reliability, intermittency, and supply chain risks in relative terms. The energy resource security score corresponding to each energy resource is valued from 1 to 4 as provided in Table 5 , where a score of 4 represents higher energy resource security. The EDP can be evaluated using Eq. (1) .(1) EDP = k × ∑ i = 1  k  ( T S )  i  ×  energy resource contribution (%)   n × ( T S )  max          In Eq. (1) , k represents the number of energy resources that the considered country depends, (TS)i  is the ith  Tier Score for which the energy resource belongs, n is the number of various energy resources considered in Table 5  (n = 9) and (TS)max  represents the maximum tier score (i.e., 4). The EDP is designed to be within the [0,1] range. Table 6   shows the EDP scores for 40 countries along with the contribution of various energy resources in the energy mix. All the data gathered belongs to 2018, and thus, the results highlight the scenario as of 2018. However, if the latest data of every factor or parameter is available, then the same framework can be utilized to assess the energy sustainability performance of the countries. The principal component analysis (PCA) or factor analysis is not performed due to less sample size [70–72]  but to understand the influence of each indicator, a correlation analysis is performed with the aid of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Further, the PCA analysis might not reveal the realistic correlation behind the indicators [73] . After data acquisition, the normalization of the dataset is accomplished which is elaborated in the upcoming section.  3.2 Normalization – The proposed ANMMO methodology Although all these parameters are constructed from available raw data, a quantitative analysis requires the data to be distributed within the same range for effective comparison and aggregation. Hence, normalization of data is accomplished to standardize the data within the limits of 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest score. This normalization process is carried out for the parameters such as per capita non-renewable contribution, per capita renewable contribution, import per capita, export per capita, energy self-sufficiency ratio, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. The parameters whose value is expressed in percentage is not subjected to normalization. The minimum–maximum (min–max) method is utilized for normalization as it distributes the considered parameter values between the maximum and minimum value [70] . While using the min–max method, important consideration must be given for the analysis of the parameter characteristics to identify whether it possesses a positive or a negative correlation with the proposed indicator and index. For instance, the more the renewable contribution per capita, the higher the ability of the country to supply clean energy, which indicates a positive correlation. However, a negative correlation is observed for per capita non-renewable contribution since lesser non-renewable dependency is desired. Depending on the positive or negative correlation between the influencing parameters and the constituting indicator, the min–max normalization can be accomplished using Eqs. (2) and (3) . For positive correlation(2) I i  = x i  - min  i   max i  - min  i         For negative correlation(3) I i  = max  i  - x i   max i  - min  i        where I i     is the ith  parameter of an indicator I, x i     is the data chosen for normalization in the given set of data corresponding to the ith  parameter, and maxi  and mini  are the maximum and minimum values of the ith  parameter. In the min–max method, when the minimum or maximum value emerges as an outlier, the whole normalization process will result in skewed distribution of data between 0 and 1. To add upon it, the outlier data cannot be eliminated because each parameter data represents the country’s contribution in assessing the SDG 7 composite index and ignoring them will result in an inaccurate assessment. The data that lies outside the range of two standard deviations from the mean value is treated as an outlier [70,74] . Applying the two standard deviation rule yields an outlier in each parameter that is required for normalization, and this is represented in Fig. 2  . The shaded region represents the range from −2 to +2 times the standard deviation from the mean. To reduce the influence of outliers, the authors constructed a modified min–max normalization methodology to reduce the influence of outliers in the process of normalization. The methodology is termed as Aggregated Normalization based on Maximum and Minimum Outliers (ANMMO) . The algorithm of the proposed normalization method is as follows:Step 1: Perform normalization and determine Ni      Obtain the dataset and normalization is performed with the nth  largest and mth  smallest values in the dataset. Initially, n and m are equal to 1. The normalized value, Ni , is determined by using Eqs. (4) and (5) . The value of i corresponds to the number of iterations. For positive correlation,(4) N i  = 0 ,   x ij   < min m  x j     x ij   - min m  x j   max n  x j  - min m  x j    ,   min m  x j  ≤ x ij   ≤ max n  x j     1 ,   x ij   > max n  x j               For negative correlation,(5) N i  = 1 ,   x ij   < min m  x j     max n  x j  - x  ij   max n  x j  - min m  x j    ,   min m  x j  ≤ x ij   ≤ max n  x j     0 ,   x ij   > max n  x j              where Ni  is the normalized value of the dataset corresponding to ith  iteration, xij  is the country value in the jth  indicator.Step 2: Check the extreme values for outliers     Determine λ and ∅ by using Eqs. (6) and (7)  for maximum and minimum values, respectively. If the λ or ∅ values are greater than 2, the corresponding maximum or minimum values are treated as outliers. If outliers are detected, then depending on whether the outlier is a maximum or minimum value, the increment in the value of m and n is performed, and return to Step 1 for iteration. Else, proceed to Step 3.(6) λ i  = max n  x j  - μ  σ      (7) ∅ i  = μ - min m  x j   σ      Step 3: Determine Wi      Determine the weightage to consider different sets of normalized data by using Eq. (8) .(8) W i  = ( 1 λ i   + 1 ∅ i   )  ∑ i = 1  k  ( 1 λ i   + 1 ∅ i   )        where Wi  represents the weightage to be considered for the ith  set of normalized datasets, and k is the number of normalized datasets or iterations. The weightage equation is constructed in such a way that a higher weightage is provided for the final iteration (where extreme values are not outliers).Step 4: Aggregated normalization     Aggregate the normalized values by multiplying with a weightage value obtained in the previous step, and this is mathematically expressed in Eq. (9) .(9) N ag   = ∑ i = 1  k  N i  × W i      where Nag represents the aggregated normalization, k is the number of normalized datasets, and Ni  is the normalized dataset obtained for the ith  iteration, and. The algorithm flowchart is shown in Fig. 3 . By implementing these steps, the influence of the outlier data in the process of normalization is reduced without eliminating the data nor modifying the dataset. Also, if the given dataset does not have outliers, then the algorithm reduces to the min–max method. Table 7  presents all the normalized datasets obtained by incorporating the ANMMO method for the seven parameters.   3.3 Weightage allocation and aggregation The aggregation weights developed via methods such as Data Envelopment Analysis may advantageously find the optimum weights for the country depending on the dataset. However, such features do not guarantee the distribution of weights in line with the need of the situation to tackle climate change. This would result in poor justification for good performing countries and might yield an undesirable specialization in the construction of composite index [75] . In this study, the weightage allocation is accomplished by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology since it aids in distributing the weights according to the current situation. The AHP methodology is explained and modelled by Saaty [76–78] , and this AHP analysis is also performed in studies dealing with energy source policy assessment [79] , wind farm siting [80] , photovoltaic diffusion [81] , and energy management improvement [82,83] . Further, it is also been utilized in constructing composite indexes [84,31,70] . In AHP analysis, a n × n    matrix is formed in which n  represents the number of parameters. The pairwise comparison score between the i th  row parameter and the j th  column parameter is assigned in the matrix element ‘aij  ‘. A nine-step scale demonstrated by Saaty [78]  is employed for assigning the weightage to each pairwise comparison and is defined in Appendix Table A1 . The pairwise comparison score based on the nine-step scale is provided from the viewpoint of the most significant parameter that aids in achieving energy sustainability and supports in tackling current climate crisis issues. Furthermore, according to the AHP methodology, the value of the aji   element should be the reciprocal of the aij   element [78] . After defining the decision matrix, the matrix is subjected to normalization, and the eigen value is evaluated. From the eigen value and number of parameters under consideration, the consistency ratio (CR) for the performed AHP analysis is derived. The CR should be lesser than 0.1 or 10% to substantiate the AHP analysis. In the proposed framework, aggregation is required where more than one parameter constitutes an indicator or index.Aggregation 1: Clean energy indicator     The aggregation is required between per capita non-renewable contribution, per capita renewable contribution, and renewable richness in energy mix parameters. Since each of the parameters is equally significant in depicting the clean energy scenario, equal weightage is allocated, and hence arithmetic mean is used to obtain a cumulative score for the clean energy indicator.Aggregation 2: Energy security indicator     Aggregation 2 is performed among energy self-sufficiency ratio, import per capita, export per capita, and EDP parameters. In general, energy security can be entrenched if a country is self-sufficient in satisfying its energy needs. A country that depends more on imported energy resources lags in energy security as it is uncertain when the energy supply chain could be disrupted. A country exporting energy resources tends to have greater energy security, and for those who have diversified their energy dependency, the impact will be lesser if any of the supply resources fail to meet the demand [58] . Hence, there exist different extents of influence afforded by these four parameters for cumulatively calculating the energy security indicator. The energy self-sufficiency ratio depicts the energy security prevailing in a country while export per capita and import per capita parameters illustrates the accurate energy trading in order to achieve energy security. Therefore, the energy self-sufficiency ratio parameter is provided with more weightage when compared to import and export per capita. On the other hand, export per capita has a strong influence on energy security when compared to the import per capita parameter. For instance, if country A possesses an export to import ratio, which is more than that of country B; then country A accounts for higher energy security as it can control its exportation and satisfies its demand. The import quantity of country B might be even lesser than country A, but as a whole, higher exportation decides the energy security in which future certainty for energy exists. When EDP is compared with the import per capita parameter, the import per capita parameter has an edge over the EDP in influencing energy security since the diversified energy dependency might even depend on various imported resources. To accommodate the extent of influence exerted by these parameters, AHP is chosen to evaluate the weightage of influence. Depending on the above discussion, the pairwise comparison priority is assigned, as shown in Table 8   . Hence, the obtained weightage through AHP is feasible as the consistency ratio is lesser than 0.1. This weightage is then multiplied with the corresponding parameters, and all the parameter scores are then aggregated through linear addition to obtain the energy security score of the country. This is mathematically expressed in Eq. (10) .(10) I Energy  S e c u r i t y   = ∑ i = 1  3  W i  × I i      where Wi  is the weightage obtained from the AHP analysis for the ith  parameter and Ii  is the parameter value for a particular country of interest.Aggregation 3: Energy accessibility indicator     The parameters constituting the energy accessibility indicator include access to electricity and access to clean fuels, which are equally significant from energy sustainability aspects. Therefore, the average of the values of these two parameters would yield the energy accessibility indicator.Aggregation 4: SDG 7 composite index     The SDG 7 composite index is obtained by performing an AHP analysis to allocate weightage to each of the five indicators. With energy sustainability as a center of focus, the clean energy indicator prevails as the most significant indicator, followed by the emission indicator. The energy security indicator does not consider environmental sustainability, and hence it has a lower weight than clean energy conversion and the carbon intensity indicators. Energy intensity depends on the economy and its related factors and is not an effective means to reduce energy consumption and its associated CO2  emissions [85] . Thus, energy security is provided with more weightage relative to energy intensity. On the other hand, energy accessibility is a non-influencing indicator since energy sustainability can also exist without attaining 100% energy accessibility. However, when viewed from the aspects of a sustainable society, accessibility seems significant, and thereby it is given the least importance relative to the other four indicators. Depending on the above discussion, the pairwise comparison priority for AHP analysis is decided and is shown in Table 9  . The analysis yields a consistency ratio of less than 0.1. The aggregation of all five indicators is accomplished by linear addition after providing weightage using Eq. (11) .(11) SDG  7  C o m p o s i t e  I n d e x = ∑ i = 1  5  W i  × I i      where Wi  is the weightage obtained from the AHP analysis for the ith  Indicator and Ii  is the indicator value for a particular country of interest.  3.4 Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis 3.4.1 Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis is performed by excluding each of the five indicators to analyze the influence exerted by the excluded indicator. This would result in five combinations of sensitivity analysis due to the existence of five indicators. Moreover, to analyze the robustness, the sensitivity analysis is also performed by various approaches such as “with weightage” (as guided by AHP analysis) and “equal weightage” for each indicator. This results in two scenarios under which five combinations of sensitivity analysis can be performed. As a whole, the sensitivity analysis is performed for ten combinations, and the corresponding scores are calculated by considering the variations resulting from every indicator for each country. To quantify the effect of each indicator, the average relative shift that occurred in each of the ten combinations are analyzed. Mathematically, to quantify the effect of an excluded indicator corresponding to the given weightage scenario, the average absolute difference in each country’s score and reference score is calculated. This is presented as Eq. (12) [70] .(12) Average  E x c l u d e d  I n d i c a t o r  I n f l u e n c e = 1 N  ∑ i = 1  N  ( S c o r e )  ref   - ( S c o r e )  i         where N is the number of countries considered, (Score)ref  is the reference score (SDG 7 composite index score) and (Score)i  is the ith  country’s score, which is obtained for the excluded indicator. To quantify the overall effect on the variation of scores that a country experiences, the absolute difference between the reference score (SDG 7 composite index score) and the score obtained for a given combination of sensitivity analysis are calculated. The average of the absolute difference value obtained for the ten combinations of analysis is considered as the average score variation of the country. This is mathematically expressed in Eq. (13) .(13) Average  v a r i a t i o n  i n  t h e  c o u n t r y  s c o r e = 1 M  ∑ i = 1  M  ( S c o r e )  ref   - ( S c o r e )  i         where M is the number of combinations considered (10), (Score)ref  is the reference score (SDG 7 composite index score), and (Score)i  is the ith  scenario’s score for the country under consideration. This yields perspectives on the country’s performance in achieving energy sustainability under various combinations.  3.4.2 Uncertainty analysis The construction of composite index includes several stages such as data acquisition and treatment, normalization, weightage allocation, and aggregation. The subjective judgements or choosing appropriate methods are to be made in each of these steps and these selections are the bones of the composite index. The quality of the designed composite index depends on the soundness of the assumption made as well as the choice of selection made at each step [70] . Therefore, uncertainties arise in the choice of selection of various methods by the modeler. In the model proposed by the authors, the uncertainties exist in the choice of normalization method, weightage systems, and method of aggregation. The changes in the results are analyzed by using various methods at each step of building a composite index to map the uncertainty and robustness of the model. The uncertainty analysis is performed in three parts:• Uncertainty analysis in outlier treated normalization and aggregation methods:  The normalization method that is incorporated in the study is proposed by the authors and it is basically built upon the min–max method. Other normalization methods that serve the purpose to reduce the outlier effect are based, for instance, on the tandem approach, i.e., to treat or transform the dataset and then normalize it. The normalization can be aided by the min–max method but the former process of treating or transforming the dataset to reduce the effect of outliers requires sophisticated methods. For treating the dataset by reducing the skewness, the winsorization method prevails to be effective by limiting the extreme values and thereby, mitigating the influence of outliers. It is performed for the dataset having skewness and kurtosis values greater than 2 and 3.5, respectively [86] . On the other hand, the transformation of a dataset to reduce the skewness utilizing box-cox proves to be prolific in reducing the outlier effect [87,88] . Therefore, two other normalization approaches are compared: one with winsorization and the other with box-cox transformation followed by winsorization. The output of both the approaches will yield a modified dataset in which the skewness and kurtosis values are lesser than 2 and 3.5, respectively. The modified dataset is then subjected to normalization by using the min–max method. The algorithm for both methods is provided in Appendix A2 and A3 . The aggregation method can primarily be of arithmetic or geometric aggregation. This variation of aggregation method is considered only at the final aggregation of the indicators forming the index.  • Uncertainty analysis in weightage scenario and aggregation methods:  AHP, being a robust and flexible methodology, is used to obtain various weightage scenarios by allocating more priority to various indicators to analyze the induced uncertainty. In this study, the clean energy indicator is given more weightage than the rest but the score variation corresponding to other possibilities of weightage (where other indicators given more weightage) is analyzed. This yields six weightage scenarios such as equal weightage (W1), clean energy weighted scenario (W2), carbon intensity weighted scenario (W3), energy intensity weighted scenario (W4), energy security weighted scenario (W5), and energy accessibility weighted scenario (W6). Further, under two aggregation methods, twelve scenarios are obtained for analyzing the variation of scores.  • Uncertainty analysis in combined normalization, weightage and aggregation methods:  With four normalization methods, six weightage scenarios and two aggregations approach, a total of 48 different ways of evaluation are established. The uncertainties are analyzed by maximum and minimum index scores and are plotted for each country.    The first part of the uncertainty analysis will be conducive to identify that whether the normalization or aggregation method has the most uncertain influence. Similarly, the second part of the uncertainty analysis will aid in understanding whether the weightage scenario or aggregation method has a higher uncertain influence. On combining the results of the first two parts of uncertainty analysis, the most uncertain method can be figured out. The third part of uncertainty analysis will depict how the index score and rank of each country respond to uncertainties.    4 Results and discussions 4.1 Clean energy analysis It can be observed from Table 4  that Iceland has rich renewable penetration, constituting 91.9% of their energy mix and the normalized per capita non-renewable and renewable contribution score is about 0.6423 and 1, respectively (refer to Table 7 ). Altogether, the results of clean energy analysis mark Iceland as a country with the highest clean energy performance, especially due to the leading scores in renewable richness and per capita renewable contribution parameters. Moreover, the per capita renewable energy contribution of Iceland is prodigious, and if such a value is utilized as a maximum value in the min-mix normalization method, it will highly influence the rest of the countries’ scores and shift them below 0.1. This, in turn, would make the per capita renewable contribution parameter’s score of other countries negligible when aggregating into the final clean energy score. Therefore, the proposed ANMMO method to reduce the influence of outliers plays a significant role in equalizing each parameters’ role. The contribution of various parameters constituting the clean energy indicator for 40 countries is represented in Fig. 4 . In Europe, Iceland and Norway possess the highest per capita renewable energy contribution, and this is also reflected in the clean energy indicator. Norway attains the second rank in clean energy analysis, and its score in renewable richness in the energy mix becomes almost half when compared to Iceland. Latvia emerged to attain the third rank in the clean energy indicator. These high scores are primarily influenced by high renewable penetration in the energy mix and per capita renewable contribution scores in the case of Norway while in Latvia, the scores are ascribed to high renewable penetration and less per capita non-renewable contribution. The last three ranks in clean energy analysis are obtained by Luxembourg (38th), Netherlands (39th), and Belgium (40th), respectively. The common reason for low clean energy scores for these countries is that the scores corresponding to all the three parameters are comparatively low. The variation in the scores of bottom-ranked countries is attributed to the differences in the scores of the three parameters constituting the clean energy indicator.    4.2 Energy security analysis The contribution of various parameters constituting the energy security indicator for 40 countries is shown in Fig. 5 . It can be observed that Norway takes the lead since its energy self-sufficiency ratio and exportation value far exceeds the scores of other countries. Further, Norway prevails as the highest energy exporter in all of Europe. The second and third rank is attained by Estonia and Albania, respectively, whose energy security scores are underpinned by lesser import per capita and higher self-sufficiency ratio characteristics while the export per capita scores are low in both cases. Despite obtaining a null score in import per capita parameter (highest import per capita in Europe), the Netherlands attained the nineteenth rank solely due to their higher export per capita as well as self-sufficiency ratio. On the other hand, the top rank of Romania (4th) and Denmark (5th) is bolstered by the self-sufficiency ratio, EDP parameter and lower importation of energy despite having a lower score in export per capita parameter. Although exporting energy symbolizes rich energy reserve (as well as energy security), practically it is not always feasible for a country to export the converted energy from their dependent energy resource or in certain cases, the energy resources themselves. For instance, Iceland cannot export their geothermal resources on which they hugely depend and neither cannot export them in the form of electricity due to geographical constraints [89] . Hence, the sixth rank of Iceland is solely ascribed to the self-sufficiency ratio which demonstrates that energy security limits them to achieving self-sufficiency only. The low rank of Malta (39th) and Luxembourg (40th) is due to their very low exportation of energy resources, high amount of energy importation and poor self-sufficiency ratio, the effect of which is further amplified by the weightage. An alternative interpretation leads to an inference that these countries depend mostly on imported energy and their energy security is at stake. France and Sweden score the most under EDP as its energy mix has well-diversified energy security-rich resources. The influence of EDP is observed in the difference in the ranks of Romania and Bosnia and Herzegovina since all the parameters constituting energy security indicator apart from EDP vary only within the range of 0.1. When analyzing the design of constructing the energy security indicator, the import and export per capita provide a clear picture of energy security instead of considering import and export values directly. For instance, Germany possesses the highest energy import value, but it also prevails to be the most-populated country out of 40 countries considered for analysis. Thus, in this case, the population plays a vital role in energy importation. To counter the population influence, the utilization of per capita value would function as a more pragmatic approach.  4.3 The SDG 7 composite index When analyzing the energy intensity, Ireland and Malta are observed to have the least energy intensity among 40 countries, which led to obtaining the highest score in the energy intensity indicator. On the contrary, Iceland tends to have the lowest score in the energy intensity indicator since it has an energy intensity of 13 MJ/$ of GDP, which is the highest among the 40 countries. From the energy accessibility indicator viewpoint, all 40 countries have 100% access to electricity, and the variation in the scores of the energy accessibility indicator is therefore influenced by the access to clean fuels parameter alone. In addition, the access to clean fuels is mostly above 90% for European countries with a few exceptions such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Serbia. In context with the carbon intensity indicator, Iceland emerges to have the least carbon intensity value while Cyprus possesses the highest carbon intensity value. The correlation analysis is typically performed to reveal whether each indicator maps the same information. In this study, it is performed by determining the Pearson correlation coefficient [90] . The higher the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient between two indicators, the greater is the possibility of conveying the same information by both the indicators [90] . The sign convention represents a positive or negative correlation. The correlation coefficients between each indicator are summarized in Table 10 . It can be observed that most of the correlation coefficients are within 0 to 0.3 or −0.3 to 0 range which indicates a weak correlation between the indicators [90] . Only the correlation coefficient between clean energy and energy security indicators (0.4089) as well as between clean energy and carbon intensity indicators (0.4262) is within the range of 0.3–0.7, which is treated as a moderate correlation [90] . In the former case, a moderate correlation might be attributed to the self-sufficiency ratio since increased renewable energy penetration has the potential to raise the self-sufficiency ratio. In the latter case, a moderate correlation exists since the increased renewable energy penetration goes in hand with reducing the carbon footprint in a country. However, with the development of carbon capture and storage integrated with conventional fossil fuel-based power plants and modern circularity approaches, the carbon footprint can ultimately reduce even when the per capita renewable contribution is low. In such scenarios, the correlation will be low and the authors propose the carbon intensity parameter as the vital component for including future energy technologies that focus on less carbon footprint. Therefore, it can be inferred that each indicator has a pivotal need and do not convey the same information. The results of the evaluated SDG 7 composite index for 40 countries are summarized in Table 11  in which Iceland, Norway, and Sweden obtained the top three ranks with the scores of 0.7313, 0.6967, 0.6313, respectively. Although Iceland scores the least in energy intensity indicator, it manages to attain the highest index score due to consistent higher scores in three indicators, and this is further amplified by weightage. Norway scores consistently high in every indicator, and it can be observed that if every indicator was treated with equal weightage, Norway would have scored the highest instead of Iceland. However, due to the pressing need to focus on clean energy and emission control, the inclusion of weightage to these indicators would steer the decision-makers to act promptly in comparison with the case without weightage. Sweden lags behind Norway in terms of clean energy, energy intensity and energy security, which leads to a lower score in comparison to Norway, despite its higher score in carbon intensity indicator. The bottom ranks are attained by Luxembourg (38th), Poland (39th), and Cyprus (40th). This is mainly due to the influence of the indicators concerning carbon intensity, clean energy, and energy security. Although Germany has an edge in clean energy and energy intensity indicator over France, due to its higher carbon intensity, the carbon intensity score plummets which deteriorate the energy sustainability performance of Germany as reflected in the final rankings of the SDG 7 composite index (Germany – 27; France – 11). This example indicates the robustness of the designed SDG 7 composite indicator for cumulatively evaluating the possible influencing factors for achieving energy sustainability. As a whole, the SDG 7 composite index accommodates factors such as renewable energy role, non-renewable energy role, population factor, energy mix, diversification of energy dependency, import and export of energy resources, energy reliability, energy self-sufficiency, energy efficiency in terms of economy, energy accessibility, and emission criteria. Thus, the quantification of energy sustainability is well-established in this proposed SDG 7 composite index with diversified logical interpretation including proper representation of the extent of each influencing factor. The contribution of various indicators constituting the SDG 7 composite index for 40 countries is presented in Fig. 6  . The detailed sample calculation for the SDG 7 composite index for Norway is presented in Appendix A4 .    4.4 Comparison of actual SDG 7 index and proposed SDG 7 composite index The formulation of the actual SDG 7 index is accomplished with the available data in order to compare it with the proposed SDG 7 composite index. Among all the UN defined SDG 7 indicators (as listed in Section 2.1 ), only indicator 7.2.1 needs a new set of data that deals with the renewable energy percentage in context with Total Final Energy Consumption (TFEC). The rest of the required data for assessing the actual SDG 7 index is already utilized for evaluating the proposed SDG 7 composite index. The aggregation of three indicators is accomplished by linear addition after providing weightage to each indicator using the AHP methodology. The weightage preference of the indicators is as follows: renewable share in TFEC (Indicator 7.2.1) > energy intensity indicator > energy accessibility Indicator. This weightage preference is based on the explanation provided in Section 3.3 . Table 12   represents the weightage obtained for each indicator, and the consistency ratio for the performed AHP analysis is less than 0.1. Table 13   shows the actual SDG 7 index score for each country, and the comparative ranking obtained from the SDG 7 composite index is also presented. The comparative analysis indicates that certain countries’ rankings differ drastically due to the inclusion of emission and energy security indicators in the SDG 7 composite index. For instance, Germany and Ireland obtain a higher rank (22nd and 15th, respectively) in the actual SGD 7 index while these countries attain the 27th and 28th rank, respectively, when using the proposed SDG 7 composite index. On the contrary, the ranks of France and Belgium are advanced from 27th and 34th in the actual SDG 7 index to the 16th and 30th rank in the proposed SDG 7 composite index. Among the components of actual SDG 7, the energy accessibility score does not differ significantly between the considered countries and thus, renewable energy penetration, as well as energy intensity, has a greater influence on final index scores. The countries with higher renewable penetration and lesser energy intensity will attain higher actual SDG 7 index scores. This is explicit in the case of Switzerland. Meanwhile, Iceland’s rank drops to eight (from first in SDG 7 composite index) due to higher energy intensity value despite its highest renewable penetration among the considered countries. Altogether, the difference in the ranking between the two indices is attributed to the additional influence exerted by carbon intensity and energy security indicators in addition to the role of AHP weightage differences. Furthermore, the substitution of the renewable energy indicator with clean energy indicator also exerts influence on certain countries’ scores (mostly boosting them), especially where renewable penetration is higher and the population is lower as in the case of Iceland, Albania, and Andorra. Due to the inclusion of the population factor, carbon intensity, clean energy indicator, and energy security indicator in the SDG 7 composite index, a more accurate picture of various countries’ progress towards energy sustainability are obtained. The contribution of various indicators constituting the actual SDG 7 index for 40 countries is presented in Fig. 7  . A graphical comparison of the SDG 7 composite index scoxre and actual SDG 7 index score of the considered European countries is shown in Fig. 8  .  4.5 Sensitivity analysis The average influence exerted by each indicator is presented in Fig. 9  . Under the weightage scenario, in the absence of a clean energy indicator, the SDG index score changes by 0.08 on average. This marks the higher influence of the clean energy indicator, which is followed by the energy accessibility indicator. On the other hand, under the equal weightage scenario, the energy accessibility indicator has a higher influence than the other indicators. On average, the energy accessibility indicator influences the SDG 7 composite index score by 0.104. This is not a desirable depiction of reality because, currently, clean energy penetration, energy security, and emissions are the biggest existing problems compared to energy accessibility. Moreover, in the European context, energy accessibility is already above the global average [53] . Therefore, the AHP weighted index is more suitable for the representation of reality since its more sensitive to clean energy indicators than the others. In addition, the indicators appear to influence the index score in a way that is assumed in defining the weightage criteria, with the only deviation exhibited by the energy accessibility indicator. As a whole, the sensitivity analysis shows that the most influential indicator prevails as the clean energy indicator, while the energy intensity indicator has the least influence on the designed framework. The average variations involved in a country’s ranking for the conducted sensitivity analysis is depicted in Fig. 10  . None of the countries considered for the analysis has an average variation score greater than 0.1 in both with weightage and without weightage scenarios. Under the weightage scenario, the exclusion of indicators resulted in a maximum variation score of 0.084 corresponding to France and this is due to the low score in the clean energy indicator and high score in the carbon intensity indicator. Under the equal weightage scenario, Cyprus possesses the highest variation in a score of about 0.093. This is imputed to the lower score in the energy security and carbon intensity indicators, and higher score in the energy intensity indicators. Therefore, the key observation elucidates that when a country has a low or higher score in an indicator, the exclusion of such indicator will result in a higher difference and in turn, increase the average variations of a country’s score. The minimum variation score of 0.026 and 0.022 is obtained by Bulgaria under the weightage scenario and without weightage scenario, respectively. The reason for such low variations is due to their scores distributed near the median in most indicators, as a result of which low value is obtained when the absolute difference between the reference score and the excluded indicator score is calculated.  4.6 Uncertainty analysis 4.6.1 Uncertainty induced by normalization and aggregation methods The comparison of the results obtained by using various methods of normalization and aggregation is summarized in Table 14  . The average difference in index scores obtained using the current method and other methods are presented in Fig. 11  . The results highlight that the proposed ANMMO method and winsorization (W) differs by an average score of 0.0125 under arithmetic aggregation. Further, the maximum score difference obtained under arithmetic and geometric aggregations are 0.0377 and 0.0969 corresponding to the min–max method without considering the outlier effect in both aggregation scenarios. The results indicate that the normalization method influences to a lesser extent when compared to the aggregation methods. The primary advantage of the ANMMO method when compared to the rest of the methods is that it does not modify or transform the existing dataset. The extreme values of the distribution are significant and some characteristics of extremities are lost in the winsorization [91] . On the other hand, the box-cox transformation (BC) completely disturbs the distance from maximum and minimum values by transforming the dataset. Meanwhile, ANMMO only scales down the distance from extreme values proportionately and maintains the originality of the dataset. On analyzing the SDG 7 composite index scores, Iceland obtained the highest score irrespective of the normalization methods under arithmetic aggregation scenario while the scores reduces drastically when geometric aggregation is performed. This is because Iceland has its normalization score in both extremes and when its score becomes zero for any parameter (energy intensity), the geometric aggregation results in higher fluctuations. Norway, being the second rank, is not affected much by the geometric aggregation effect since it does not score the lowest value in any of the constituting indicators. Cyprus achieved the last rank in SDG 7 composite index and the effect of geometric aggregation makes the index score of Cyprus much lower. On the other hand, under arithmetic aggregation, the index score of Cyprus was not the lowest when normalization is performed using the min–max method. Therefore, the outlier effect has a considerable influence on index scores, typically, increasing the scores of the countries that have outlier values while decreasing the scores of the rest of the countries.  4.6.2 Uncertainty induced by weightage scenarios and aggregation methods The six-weightage scenarios are summarized in Table 15   while Table 16   represents the index scores obtained by using various weightage scenario and aggregation methods. The average difference in score between the current preference (W2) and the rest of the weightage scenario is obtained and is shown in Fig. 12  . Under the arithmetic aggregation, the maximum average difference in the score (of about 0.1208) is obtained corresponding to W1 (equal weightage scenario). Under geometric aggregation, the maximum average difference in the score (of about 0.0996) is obtained corresponding to W6 (when energy accessibility is given more weightage). This is because the SDG 7 composite index is sensitive to energy accessibility indicator as highlighted by sensitivity analysis in Section 4.5 . Also, in this case, weightage induced uncertainties influence more than aggregation-induced uncertainties. Altogether, it can be inferred that allocation of weightage has a higher influence on SDG 7 composite index than normalization and aggregation methods. In arithmetic aggregation, the influence exerted by each weightage scenario depends on the scores obtained in each indicator. Iceland attained the highest score in carbon intensity and energy accessibility indicator, a higher score in clean energy indicator, moderate score in energy security indicator, and lowest score in energy intensity indicator. Therefore, the weightage influence drastically affects the Iceland score only when energy intensity is given higher weightage (W5) while it remains in the top rank when more weightage is provided to the indicators where Iceland scores higher or highest. Besides, the geometric aggregation exacerbates the index scores due to its inherent effect to lower the index scores when any of its constituting indicators has the lowest score. In other words, when the indicator scores are closer to 0 or 1, the change in aggregation method will exert considerable influence. This is also discussed in Section 4.6.1 . When the indicator scores are not near to extreme values, only the allocated weightage to the indicator influences the index scores for which the countries such as Norway, Sweden and Switzerland can be illustrated as an example.  4.6.3 Uncertainty induced by normalization, weightage and aggregation methods By combining all the uncertainties induced by the normalization, weightage and aggregation methods, the variation in score and ranking can be visualized for 48 scenarios. The maximum and minimum variation of scores and rank corresponding to each country is shown in Fig. 13  . The largest variation in index score and rank is observed for Iceland. This is attributed to three reasons: the first corresponds to the scenario where the more weightage is allocated to the least performing indicator of Iceland (energy intensity indicator); the second corresponds to the distribution of indicator scores of Iceland near the extremities; and the last reason corresponds to the geometric aggregation which suppresses the score obtained in the remaining indicators. The lowest variation in SDG 7 index score is observed for Bulgaria. The reason for this could be the distribution of indicator scores away from extreme values. In terms of rank, the highest difference in rank is discerned for Iceland while the lowest difference in rank is recognized for Norway as well as Sweden.   4.7 Comparison with other energy-related indices The development of any composite index pertaining to a specific problem requires a comparative analysis with the already prevailing indices to benchmark the difference induced in score and ranking. For instance, with the objective to measure the environmental impact, a study compares the performance of two indices, namely, the Composite Index of Environmental Performance (CIEP) and the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) to force out the advantages and limitations associated with the construction of the indices [92] . The proposed SDG 7 composite index is compared with two other energy-related indices apart from the actual SDG 7 index. The World Energy Trilemma Index (WETI) is composed of three dimensions which include energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability, and is proposed by the World Energy Council [93] . The Energy Transition Index (ETI) is proposed by World Economic Forum and is based on a data-driven framework to elucidate the understanding of the country’s energy system performance and readiness for transition [94] . The framework involves the dimensions of energy security and access, environmental sustainability, and economic growth and development. The ranking resulting from the proposed SDG 7 composite index is compared and contrasted with WETI and ETI. Since the WETI and ETI are presented on a global scale and SDG 7 composite index is assessed for 40 European countries, the ranking of WETI and ETI is filtered according to considered 40 countries and are compared in Table 17  . Apart from these indices, other energy-related index such as the Sustainable Energy Development index and Aggregated synthetic index exists [95,96] . However, the results of these indices are obtained by using relatively old data (2011–2012 data), meaning that the data considered would be drastically different and cannot be compared to the current scenario. The WETI rank is arguable and is not reliable according to some studies since some of its components have a strong and moderate correlation with one another [97,98] . Meanwhile, ETI covers the necessary aspects and favors sustainable energy development [99] . Fundamentally, all the indices included in the comparison differs in their defining dimensions with the only commonality found within energy access and energy security aspects. The clean energy indicator’s constituent parameters, energy security indicator’s constituent parameters, the inclusion of carbon intensity and energy intensity indicators, and weighted aggregated model are the prime difference between the proposed SDG 7 composite index and the indices such as WETI and ETI. The top 10 ranked countries of the SDG 7 composite index and ETI have moderate differences except for Iceland, Latvia, Montenegro and Croatia as attributed to the aforementioned reasons. On the other hand, countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Serbia do not show much variation in the rank across the different composite indexes. This may be due to higher contribution to index scores by the common indicators when compared to the contributions from disparate indicators that exist between these indices.   5 Conclusions The existing indicators for Sustainable Development Goal 7 are not sufficient to portray the picture of energy sustainability. Thus, the authors designed a framework to obtain a novel Sustainable Development Goal 7 index, which is applied to 40 European countries to assess the energy sustainability scenario. This is to establish a composite index named the “Energy Sustainability Index” or “SDG 7 Composite Index,” which comprises indicators such as clean energy, carbon intensity, energy security, energy intensity and energy accessibility. Clean energy and energy security analysis is accomplished from a quantitative approach in which the clean energy indicator comprises parameters such as renewable richness in the energy mix, per capita non-renewable energy contribution and per capita renewable energy contribution. The energy security indicator combines parameters such as energy self-sufficiency ratio, import per capita, export per capita and energy diversification parameters. The results show that Iceland, Norway, and Latvia lead in clean energy performance in Europe with the corresponding clean energy scores of 0.8538, 0.5235, and 0.4850, respectively. Meanwhile, Norway, Estonia and Albania possess the highest energy security with scores of 0.9069, 0.5571, and 0.5063, respectively. The remaining indicators such as the carbon intensity indicator, energy accessibility indicator, and energy intensity indicator are derived with the aid of constituting parameters. To support the climate actions, the Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index is structured in a way to give more significance to clean energy and emission factors through the Analytic Hierarchy Process analysis. The obtained Sustainable Development Goal 7 composite index emphasizes top energy sustainability performance in Iceland, Norway, and Sweden with scores of 0.7313, 0.6967, and 0.6313, respectively. It is also observed that Iceland attains top rank especially due to the proposed weightage scenario, and if equal weightage is considered among all the indicators, then Norway emerges to have the highest SDG 7 composite index score. Further, the actual SDG 7 index is compared with the proposed SDG 7 composite index. The key inference from the comparative analysis indicates that the inclusion of the carbon intensity indicator and energy security indicator has a significant effect in picturizing the energy sustainability aspects of a country. Moreover, the inclusion of these indicators has increased and decreased the ranks of several countries. The sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most influencing indicator, and the results show that the clean energy indicator and energy security have the highest influence under weightage and without weightage, respectively. In addition, the maximum average variations in the country’s score under weightage and equal weightage scenarios are found to be 0.084 (France) and 0.093 (Cyprus), respectively. Apart from the proposed composite indicator, a novel method to incorporate the effect of outliers without ignoring them in the normalization process using an Aggregated normalization based on Maximum and Minimum Outliers methodology is propounded. This proposed approach neither changes the extreme values of the distribution nor modify the distance between maximum and minimum values. Therefore, the proposed normalization method has a significant role in designing composite index since the originality of the data is maintained. Further, the uncertainty analysis revealed that the weightage scenario has a pivotal uncertain influence relative to various normalization and aggregation methods. Although this study focuses on 40 European countries, this novel method can be also utilized for any country outside Europe. Moreover, the weightage assigned to various indicators can be flexibly amended according to the prospective scenarios to direct the governmental actions.
