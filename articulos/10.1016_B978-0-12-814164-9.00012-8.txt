               Financial inclusion has been presented in some policy documents as an instrument of poverty eradication in the developing world. It promises to enhance poor families' ability to minimize financial shocks, undertake human capital investments in health and education and/or engage in modest asset accumulation in order to take advantage of promising investment opportunities in their economies. However, the financial sectors in most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have been found to be unwilling or unable to serve the poorest segments of the populations. This renders access to finance still a key challenge in stimulating growth and poverty reduction in SSA. Therefore, this chapter discusses the different ways in which financial inclusion can help achieve the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals of ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030. The discussions also provide pointers to some of the challenges that need to be addressed. One key message is that financial inclusion alone may not provide the poorest segments of African populations with the skills and competences they need to find pathways out of poverty. For this reason, inclusive finance must endeavour to strengthen individuals' control over their lived situations and reinforce their beliefs in their personal efficacy to pull them out of poverty.

The banking sector in particular has been found to be unwilling or unable to tap into the large ‘under/unbanked’ segments of populations across the sub-continent, thereby keeping parts of the economies non-monetized and less productive (Andrianaivo & Yartey, 2009, pp. 1–40; European Investment Bank, 2016; Makina, 2017 ). The current thinking is that the more financially inclusive the SSA economies become, the more able they will be in reducing  poverty. The main argument runs as follows: Financial inclusion enhances poor families' ability to increase their capacity to absorb financial shocks, smooth consumption, accumulate assets and invest in such components of human capital as health and education and/or take advantage of promising investment opportunities in their economies (Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, & Honohan, 2009; Brune, Giné, Goldberg, & Yang, 2011 ). As a result, countries with well-functioning and inclusive financial systems tend to see poverty levels drop more rapidly than those with weak and non-inclusive financial systems (Beck, Maimbo, Faye, & Triki, 2011 ). For this reason, the design of policies aimed at improving access to finance in key economic sectors and to unbanked segments of populations remains a key challenge in SSA. Arguably, the above understanding is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN in 2015. Scholars are therefore calling on SSA governments and policymakers to discuss how they can explicitly factor the development of inclusive financial sectors into policies and plans aimed at achieving the SDGs. This is the task initiated in this chapter. The chapter draws on different strands of research to provide a synthesis of the currently available theoretical and empirical knowledge in SSA on the role of inclusive finance in economic development processes and to concurrently discuss policy choices that will enhance the development of inclusive financial sectors on the sub-continent. The chapter is structured as follows: The next section provides an overview of the theoretical rationale underlying financial inclusion and poverty alleviation in the economic development literature. I then discuss the roles that financial inclusion can play in achieving the SDGs. This is followed by discussions of contemporary policies and strategies of financial inclusion as well as issues that remain unsettled in the existing literature and require further research.  2 Contrasting Perspectives on Poverty and Financial Inclusion 2.1 The Theoretical Arguments The contemporary financial inclusion debate is predicated on the understanding that inclusive financial systems tend to alleviate poverty through the stimulation of economic growth within communities and nations (Beck et al., 2009; Makina, 2017; Tita & Aziakpono, 2017 ). Since poverty is a central construct in the debate  and in policy prescriptions, an understanding of the theoretical viewpoints related to poverty is crucial in predicting the policy directions that are likely to guide financial inclusion efforts.1  1 Distinction is usually drawn in the literature between the ‘transient poor’ – i.e. those households who suffer from extreme volatility in terms of regularly moving above and then dipping below the poverty line on the one hand, and the ‘chronically poor’ or long-term poor – i.e. households who spend extended periods of time below the poverty line. The discussions in the section will draw on this distinction.   Views on poverty reduction policies have traditionally fallen between two extremes: structural/institutional and welfare/behavioural. The structural/institutional perspective promotes the view that a capitalist economic system may be structured in such a way that it disables the poor from pulling themselves out of poverty regardless of how competent they may be. One structural barrier to social mobility is financial exclusion. Structural changes that ensure financial inclusion can unleash resources embedded in individuals and provide them with a pathway to socio-economic mobility. Building on this perspective, the ‘structuralists’ appear to be more interested in issues relating to the supply side of finance (i.e. access to finance). Scholars subscribing to this perspective endorse the view that people are generally rational decision-makers, and if financial services are available and affordable to all, poor people will rationally access these services. For this reason, the responsibility for financial inclusion has at least partially been laid at the doors of the formal financial service providers, including banks. The ‘structuralists’ argue that there is no shortage of funds within the global economy, but it is the ability to move money from the sender to the receiver (the so-called ‘velocity of money’) that is the stumbling block in SSA's financial sector development process. In other words, if the velocity of money can increase, the general access to finance in an economy will increase as well. Institutional voids, rigid regulations, bureaucratic bottlenecks and weak contract enforcement mechanisms have been listed among the factors that constrain the velocity of money (Leão, 2005; Ramsaran, 1992 ). Thus, the establishment of high-quality institutions, efficient legal rules, strong contract enforcement and political stability can improve the supply of money through the supply chain and improve financial inclusion. It has also been argued that improvement in access to financial services will encourage talented but poor entrepreneurs to start their own businesses–e.g. microenterprises. As the fortunes of the micro-business-owners increase, they will be able to grow  the businesses by ploughing part of their profits back, thereby creating sustainable income for themselves and their employees (Klapper, Laeven, & Rajan, 2006 ). In sum, the structuralists believe that microenterprise development can be facilitated by the financial market, and this can lead to substantial poverty reduction. In contrast, scholars subscribing to the welfare/behavioural perspective argue that poverty has an all-encompassing characteristic, concurrently having an impact on individuals, households and communities. It is more than just a lack of income. It also connotes lack of respect, self-worth, dignity, inclusion, choice and security for an individual and his/her family (especially, the long-term poor people). This strand of research draws distinction between ‘transient poor’ – i.e. those households who suffer from extreme volatility in terms of regularly moving above and then dipping below the poverty line on the one hand; and the ‘chronically poor’ – i.e. long-term poor households who spend extended periods of time below the poverty line and rarely exit poverty. Chronically poor people, in particular, resign to their living conditions, and this holds their creativity in check. This means any effort made to pull the chronically poor out of poverty can unleash hitherto untapped psychological and physical human resources within a community and thereby help transform a negative spiral into a positive one. In other words, financial inclusion has the potential to shape people's worldviews, expand their perspectives and allow them to engage in future thinking (Kane, 1987 ). The welfare perspective therefore tends to be more concerned with the impact of specific projects and interventions on poverty reduction. Scholars endorsing this perspective argue that economic growth by itself does not provide a sufficient condition for poverty alleviation. In their view, growth must be regulated and directed through proficient welfare programmes that support health, education and social security for it to support development (Kuada, 2015 ). For this to happen, development-oriented societies must be encouraged to engage in internal criticism of local values and practices that hamper social progress (Nussbaum & Sen, 1989 ). Financial inclusion may have a role in the process if it relates to the provision of affordable financial services – i.e. access to payments and remittance facilities, savings, loans and insurance services to those who tend to be excluded. Although the positions championed in each of the two contrasting perspectives contain significant strengths, reality appears to suggest a blend of structural and welfare perspectives. Some scholars have argued that structural barriers that limit access to financial resources do not only constrain economic growth. They can also create what Kane (1987)  describes as the culture  of learned helplessness–i.e. loss of control over one's own situation in life. It is therefore now acknowledged in the development economics literature that the opportunities that individuals are likely to be exposed to during their life course and their capacity to take advantage of these opportunities are influenced by the socio-economic contexts within which they have been born. For example, human capital formation of household members and the dynamic capabilities that they develop depend on their initial household resource endowments (Kuada, 2015 ). Thus, a poor child is most likely to become a poor adult–i.e. the incidence of inter-generational transmission of poverty (See UNICEF, 2000 ). Fortunately, life is not entirely path-dependent or destiny-bound. Other factors can operate independently to affect wellbeing of individuals over their life-course and thereby re-shape the course of their destinies. But the fact remains that any removal of structural barriers will tend to concurrently promote welfare advantages and economic growth. Similarly, the reduction of psychological deficits through welfare programmes will inevitably be growth-propelling. However, pure redistributive policies have been found to create disincentives to work and save (Aghion & Bolton, 1997 ). Thus, prudent financial inclusion policies must consider a judicious blend of welfare programmes and financial access policies and strategies.  2.2 Some Empirical Evidence The empirical literature on the relationship between financial inclusion and poverty alleviation is rather sparse (Tita & Aziakpono, 2017 ). But the available evidence suggests a positive impact of financial inclusion on poverty. Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine's study (2007)  found that 60% of income growth was due to the impact of financial development on aggregate economic growth, and about 40% was due to the long-run impact of financial development on the income growth of the poorest quintile as the result of reductions in income inequality. Brune et al. (2011)  found that increased financial access through commitment savings accounts in rural Malawi has improved the wellbeing of poor households as it helps them improve their farm output. Similarly, a study in Ghana by Karlan, Osei-Akoto, Osei, and Udry (2014)  showed that insured farmers were able to buy more fertilizers, plant more acreage, hire more labour and have higher yields and income, which have led to fewer missed meals and fewer missed school days for their children. A South African study that looked at expanding access to consumer credit found increased borrower wellbeing in terms of increased income and food consumption,  improved health and improved status of borrowers in the community (Karlan & Zinman, 2010 ). There is also evidence from a range of countries indicating that financial access increases the share of household income controlled by women–either through their own earnings or cash transfers (World Bank, 2014 ). But some studies have not been able to document improvements in welfare as a result of access to finance through microfinance outlets (Cull, Ehrbeck, and Holle. 2014 ). Some scholars therefore warn against blind faith in financial-inclusion policies as harbingers of total poverty eradication. It has also been suggested that access to financial services does not necessarily imply the actual use of these services. Some individuals may voluntarily exclude themselves from the use of these services for religious and/or personal reasons (Tita & Aziakpono, 2017 ). In sum, the current level of theoretical and empirical knowledge on financial inclusion conveys the understanding that institutional structure and policy environment that exists in a particular country will determine the extent to which financial inclusion efforts will affect poverty levels in the country (Kirkpatrick, 2000 ). For example, policies that promote welfare gains at the same time as they promote pro-poor growth will tend to reduce poverty a lot more and a lot faster than policies that focus on either welfare or economic growth alone (Goudie & Ladd, 1999 ).2  2 Some scholars suggest that for a robust pro-poor growth to take place, incomes of the poor must rise at a faster rate than the increase in average incomes, with positive effects in terms of reduced income inequality.     3 Potential Contributions of Financial Inclusion to the SDGs The arguments above seem to be reflected in the thinking underlying the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim at ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all. The UN policy document contains 17 main goals with 169 specific targets to be achieved by 2030. The impact of inclusive financial services on some of the SDGs is direct (e.g. SDGs 1, 2, 5 and 8), while their impact on others is not immediately evident.3  3 In the run-up to the finalization of the SDGs, financial inclusion was included as a specific target in a number of the SDGs, while no agreement was reached among the expert groups on its relevance to the achievement of other goals.   But there was no doubt in the minds of the expert groups that worked on the SDGs that financial inclusion will contribute to  enterprise development and poverty eradication. For example, as noted above, having access to financial instruments opens up opportunities for starting one's own business and improving household incomes for some segments of poor populations. Thus, Asongu and De Moor (2015)  argue that the more inclusive the financial systems in a country, the more able the poorer segments of that country will be in pursuing their economic ambitions, such as starting new businesses and improving the development of their children in terms of non-cognitive and cognitive abilities. Again, as noted above, financial inclusion of farmers can lead to bigger investments in the planting season, resulting in higher yields and improved food security (SDG 2). There are also expectations that microfinance institutions will develop products such as insurance to small farmers to protect their asset base from exogenous shocks and encourage them to undertake relatively risky investments. Furthermore, microenterprise development will tend to increase household welfare by providing more ample possibilities for the smoothing of consumption and investment in human capital–e.g. education and health services (SDGs 3 and 4). The development literature also acknowledges the link between poverty and good health in the sense that poorer households tend to buy poorer quality food items and spend less on fresh fruits and vegetables. The gender equality goal (SDG 5) is also partially linked to financial inclusion. Some empirical evidence suggests that women face greater barriers than men in accessing finance because of poor credit history or lack of collateral. Not only are they more likely to be denied bank loans than men; they often pay higher interest rates than men on formal bank loans (World Bank, 2014 ). This means that in the absence of inclusive financial systems, women will rely a lot more on internal resources or support from family members to invest in their educations or take advantage of promising growth opportunities (Kuada, 2009 ). Previous studies also suggest that women are more likely than men to be self-employed in developing countries and thus are in greater need of access to financial services (Demirguc-Kunt, Klapper, & Singer, 2013 ). Thus, providing women with direct financial services will enable them to have greater control over their finances and investing in their children's health and education. This will result in general improvements in household welfare (Sanyal, 2014 ). It is apparent from the discussions above that the attainment of most of the SDGs rests, to a large extent, on sustainable economic growth and a faith that microenterprise development will lift many poor people out of poverty. This assumption ties  well with the decent work goal as well as the innovation goals (SDGs 8 and 9). For example, innovation demands substantial psychological resources that poor individuals may find hard to leverage without general welfare improvements that are expected to be driven by microenterprise growth. In other words, microenterprise development (with the support of inclusive finance) may create enabling conditions for innovation. Furthermore, previous research suggests that financial inclusion may do more for the poor than simply helping them achieve greater economic stability. It may provide them with greater cognitive resources (i.e. psychological capital) that enable them to reduce the anxieties associated with not being able to efficiently manage their household finances (McLoyd, 1998 ) and thereby focus on important and previously neglected life outcomes such as the education of their children (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013 ). Table 12.1   provides an overview of the SDGs and how financial inclusion may be expected to have an impact on their achievement. However, it is important to bear in mind that people's decisions to engage in entrepreneurial activities depend not only on the availability of financial resources. For example, the extent to which a society perceives entrepreneurial activities to be desirable has a tremendous influence on such decisions (Shapero, 1984 ). That is, if a society considers entrepreneurial drive as a value on its own, entrepreneurs will emerge in that society. But if the society encourages individuals to see themselves as being entitled to the wealth of others through birth or ascription (rather than to create their own wealth), very few within that society will choose the tortuous entrepreneurial path. Furthermore, scholars of entrepreneurship remind us that not all potential and actual entrepreneurs can make good use of support. A vast majority of African entrepreneurs may be classified as necessity-driven, while a few of them are growth-oriented (Kuada, 2016 ). Microenterprise owners who enter business due to necessity (i.e. lack of alternative sources of income) do not often see any clear economic path out of poverty. They may see their businesses as temporary occupations. With such an attitude, the dedication and sacrifice required to grow a business are usually lacking in their everyday business decisions and actions. Those who start these businesses therefore require some guidance, mentoring and support to change their mindsets from having survival as their main goal in business and in order to develop the courage to grow these businesses. We need to take this observation on board when we assess the potential impact of financial inclusion on the SDGs.   4 Financial Inclusion Policies and Strategies If we accept the view that microenterprise creation by talented poor individuals in Africa is a prerequisite for poverty alleviation, there is a need to design policies and strategies that ensure the accessibility of finance to these groups of people. This has been the goal of the financial liberalization policies initiated in several  African countries since the beginning of the 1980s (Ndikumana, 2001, pp. 1–50 ). In spite of the dismantling of restrictive financial regulations and the adoption of innovative financial delivery systems (including mobile banking) in several countries, the hitherto ‘unbanked’ segments of the population remain excluded from financial services. Several policy options have surfaced during the past decade to address this need. For example, Chibba (2009)  argues that tackling financial inclusion challenges in developing countries requires a focus on four key pillars: private (financial and non-financial) sector development, financial literacy, extending microfinance outreach, and public sector support. Similarly, Asongu and De Moor (2015)  suggest that financial products targeting the rural communities in Africa must include farmer-specific features that allow for the spreading of agricultural credit risks and provide special poor-farmer loans and rural low interest policy funds. They also endorse the development of financial and non-financial institutions that encourage and support funds for elementary schools ‘by providing guarantees for rural elementary education and providing more incentives for teachers to take positions in rural areas’ (p. 12). Others have suggested the use of ‘correspondent’ or ‘agent’ banking in which people can deposit into and withdraw from their bank accounts using non-bank agents such as retail stores. Many of these suggestions have merit, and their appropriateness must be examined in specific countries, communities and contexts. In assessing their appropriateness, it is important to make sure that the usage of these financial services and the delivery mechanisms adopted do not overstretch the comfort zones of their potential users. It is advisable to adopt financial inclusion mechanisms that are consistent with the users' financial skills. Furthermore, these services must be concurrently supported by policies that strengthen their users' beliefs in their personal efficacy to exercise control over their life situations. It is under such conditions that they can be empowered to leverage the resources to create their individual pathways out of poverty. It is in light of the above discussions that we may reconsider the role of financial service delivery mechanisms such as informal financial associations (IFAs) including savings and credit cooperatives, village savings and loans associations, and rotating savings and credit associations (RASCOs) in any future policy framework. The RASCO system works in this way: each member contributes the same amount at each meeting, and one member takes the whole sum once (Kimuyu, 1999 ). As a result, each member is able to access a relatively larger sum of money during the life of  the association and use it for whatever purpose she or he wishes. The transactions are trust-based; no records are kept and no money is retained inside the group.4  4 This method of saving and borrowing has also been variously described as peer-to-peer banking or peer-to-peer lending and serves as an alternative to saving at home, with the risk of family and relatives demanding access to the savings.   Recent developments indicate an increasing reliance on these services to cover financial commitments such as paying children's school fees, hospital bills, and funeral or other occasional expenses in many rural communities in Africa. They therefore contribute to the fulfilment of several SDGs. Their strength and competitive advantage lies in their context-specificity–i.e. their ability to use community-based methods to monitor the financial activities of the clients they serve and thereby minimize the incidence of default among them (Thomas, 1992 ). It has been argued that the social structures that characterize informal and quasi-formal financial associations enable the associations to be better informed about the financial needs and creditworthiness of their members. They therefore serve as a proxy for the distribution of information (Gugerty, 2007 ). In addition to this, the delivery mechanisms allow their members to have greater control over their financial experiences. Arguably, a modernization of the IFAs and their integration into the formal financial systems is worth serious attention in financial inclusive policy and strategy considerations. The emergence of ICT-enabled financial services innovation through the use of digital interfaces such as mobile phones is another development with the potential of fast-tracking the financial inclusion process in SSA. Using a mobile phone rather than cash saves considerable travel time, reduces the risk of theft and boosts convenience. An example of a mobile phone financial delivery system frequently cited in the policy literature is the rapid evolution of the M-Pesa system in Kenya, which has grown rapidly since its inception in 2007, reaching approximately 38% of Kenya's adult population in 2015. The general knowledge from the operations of mobile phone-enabled financial services in Africa is that they have created a new and easier entry point into the financial system and have introduced a large measure of convenience into domestic remittance transactions. People living in the urban centres can now transfer money to their relatives in the rural areas a lot more easily, allowing recipients to get fairly regular incomes to finance health and educational expenses. Mobile money also provides opportunities for the ‘microtization’ of transactions–i.e. transacting in smaller amounts and more frequently than has otherwise  been possible. Health bills, electricity bills and school tuition fees can then be broken into small, frequent payments. This will make such services accessible to even the long-term poor segments of populations. Digital financial transactions also have cost advantages that reinforce their growing popularity among the poorer segments of the African population. A study by McKay and Pickens (2010) 5  5 The study covered 18 branchless banking providers with a collective total of more than 50 million customers from such countries as Afghanistan, Brazil, Cambodia, India, Kenya, Pakistan and Tanzania.   found that branchless banking (including mobile money) was 19% cheaper on average than alternative services. It also provides opportunities for the development of other financial products that may be tailor-made to rural communities without basic infrastructural facilities such as roads to link them to existing financial centres. In this way, digitalization of financial services has enabled some of the long-term poor segments of the African populations to build up credit histories which can help lenders assess their credit risks when assessing their loan requests. Hitherto, both IFAs and mobile banking systems have not succeeded in achieving comprehensive financial inclusion due to a number of factors. For example, despite the apparently close-knit social structures that enable informal financial associations to operate, there is still evidence of structural holes that discourage some segments of the population to use them as financial service delivery options (Gugerty, 2007 ). Structural holes in this context imply the fragmentation of valuable knowledge within and among IFAs. These knowledge gaps must be bridged. With regard to digital financial transactions, it has been noted that these services have hitherto been used to a lesser degree to finance investments in small rural farming and non-farming businesses (Duncombe, 2012 ). Furthermore, services such as savings, borrowing and insurance have not as yet been included in the current product portfolio of the mobile phone companies. In addition to this, some important sectors such as health care, education and agriculture have not as yet been covered by mobile phone transactions in Africa (Jack & Suri, 2010 ). There is therefore a need to extend the technology to these sectors. A way forward is to consider the potentials of using the advantages provided by digital financial transactions to facilitate the integration of IFAs into the formal financial systems in SSA. One challenge of increasing the membership of IFAs beyond those within a specific local community (and thereby increasing the financial resources that each member can leverage) is the  uncertainties regarding payments from individual members on stipulated dates. With the digital transfer arrangements, this problem can be solved. It is also conceivable that different IFAs can be brought into networks of financial service associations that further expand their financial resource capacities. Formal financial institutions can serve as bridges (or brokers) in creating linkages between the different associations. The position of a bridge between the associations will allow them to transfer valuable information and knowledge from one association to another (i.e. bridging the structural holes). In addition, financial institutions can combine all the ideas they access from different sources to produce more innovative solutions to common problems. They can do so by virtue of being positioned at crossroads in the flow of information between the associations. In this way they will be able to channel new ideas and best practices between the associations. Embracing digital financial service delivery in rural communities also means creation of jobs for financial service delivery agents as well as financial technology start-ups, microfinance institutions, retailers and other companies. These jobs and microenterprises, by themselves, will enhance the economic development potentials of the communities. The process of integrating IFAs into a formalized financial system may be gradual, the duration varying from one context or country to another. The transitioning process may start by making some of these IFAs quasi-formal. Candidates may be experimentally chosen on the basis of robustness of the current organization and willingness of the leaders to participate. The first challenge will be to determine whether networks of IFAs can be established for purposes of knowledge generation and sharing of best practices within a given context or between similar contexts.  5 Some Unresolved Issues and Implications for Future Research The discussions above provide some good promises for designing realistic policies and strategies for achieving inclusive financial sectors in SSA. The discussions have also shown that a number of issues require additional policy and research attention in order to place African countries on a firmer path to poverty reduction. First, there is the need to understand the nature and requirements for financial capability development among the long-term poor people in African countries. If we accept the view that  poverty is more than just lack of income, then the financial capability of poor people implies having both the knowledge to make financial decisions, access to financial services and products as well as the motivation to leverage these resources and use them in creating a pathway out of poverty (Sherraden, 2013 ). It may therefore be described as a set of variegated competencies that individuals and groups possess that enable them to actively face the challenges of life and to take moderate personal and/or collective risks to achieve what they set out to achieve. Thus, while policies are designed and instruments are fine-tuned to ensure speedy and inclusive delivery of financial resources, it is imperative that efforts are also made to change the mindset of the long-term poor and encourage them to take steps that will pull them out of poverty. Kane (1987)  argues that the long-term poor experience three major interrelated attitudinal constraints that impair their ability to get them out of poverty: (1) motivational deficit (people come to believe that poverty is endemic and actions to reduce it are futile); (2) cognitive interference (people will have difficulty learning that action can produce favourable results in new situations); and (3) an affective reaction (depression or resignation). But perception of helplessness can also be inferred from the environment without direct experience of failure. Under such conditions, having access to finance does not provide the intrinsic motivation to seek funds or undertake the poverty reducing investments that we have identified above. Second, it has been suggested that poverty is not a static or binary concept and it is not appropriate to assume that the poor constitute a homogeneous group. Previous frameworks (e.g. Baulch & McCouth, 1998 ) have offered different classifications of the poor. There may be the transiently poor farmers who move in and out of poverty depending on the outcome of their harvests simply because they engage in rain-fed farming practices. There are also those that have the potential for lift off due to unique skills or competences that they have. And then there are the long-term poor. This means inclusion and exclusion into formal financial systems also change over time. This implies that not all the ‘financially excluded’ may lack the motivational resources to find a pathway out of poverty. However, the heterogeneity among poor households may be unobserved by financial institutions without community-based knowledge and insight. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the poor should suggest that each one will require a separate set of interventions to facilitate their movement out of poverty. However, we currently lack the research knowledge that can provide reliable profiles of the  different groups of poor people in every country as well as insights into what works best for each group. Third, economists have been accused of a tendency of talking about  the poor rather than with  them. This orientation to poverty eradication has proved to be counterproductive and has resulted in biases in conceptualizations as well as governments abandoning policies that could have worked had they given them enough time and support. It has also denied policymakers the opportunity to consider innovative policies that might have worked for some groups of people in some countries. It is important to gain insight into how poor people understand their situations and the options that they examine in their efforts to pull them out of poverty. This calls for new research, since our current level of knowledge is inadequate to guide policy on the issue. Fourth, in spite of promising developments in digital financial services and informal financial associations in Africa, the field is under-researched. For example, we need a better understanding of the factors that can ensure the rapid adoption of mobile financial transactions in different SSA countries. We also need a better understanding of the group dynamics of informal financial delivery associations and the manner in which these dynamics play out to include or exclude members of different segments of the communities within which they are formed. Such knowledge will provide policy guidelines for the twin and symbiotic development of the digital and informal financial service sector development.  6 Conclusions The discussions in this chapter highlight the potentials of financial inclusion in helping achieve some of the 17 UN SDG’s in SSA countries. The direct contributions of financial inclusion to the attainment of SDGs 1, 2, 5 and 8, in particular, have been highlighted. It has also been noted that financial inclusion will accelerate the pace of enterprise development and job creation in African countries and thereby contribute immensely to economic growth and poverty alleviation. The chapter also provides pointers to some of the challenges that need to be addressed. The arguments favour multi-faceted policy interventions and strategies, rather than an attempt to merely extend the outreach of existing financial institutions since current services are fundamentally flawed in terms of appropriateness to the needs and financial capabilities of the unbanked segments of the populations. This will include interventions that strengthen the poorest  individuals' control over their experienced situations as well as beliefs in their personal efficacy to take initiatives that will take them out of poverty. I have also discussed the role of digital financial service delivery networks and the IFAs in the financial inclusion process. While digitalization has enabled parts of the unbanked segments of populations to engage in transactions seamlessly by breaking the transactions into sizes that are convenient for most of them, the IFAs have provided them with psychological certainty that their temporary savings will not be lost. The two mechanisms, if combined, have the promise of introducing financial services to the poor without overstretching their comfort zones.   References Aghion and Bolton, 1997 P. Aghion  P.
