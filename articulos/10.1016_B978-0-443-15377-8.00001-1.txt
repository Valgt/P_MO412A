               A rapid rise in energy usage and human dependency on fossil fuels have caused the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change. The utilization of biofuels is needed on a large scale as a means of attaining energy security and mitigating GHG emissions. This is to comply with the Paris Accord and COP26 agreement that several developed and developing nations are committed to. As opposed to the escalating crude oil costs, political instability in crude oil supplying countries and environmental challenges in the extraction and processing of fossil fuels, biomass and biofuels seem to be a cleaner and inexpensive alternative. This chapter aims to review the opportunities and challenges of biofuels, global warming, wastewater treatment, and renewable biomass. Drawing on the literature on sustainability, this chapter examines the emerging areas of sustainability science, energy security, and sustainable development goals and their links with economic and societal growth. The contribution of biofuels to energy security and the investigation of major challenges facing the field preventing a broader usage of biofuels are also discussed. Moreover, the chapter also highlights the economic implications of the research, including the technological adoption of bio-based products. The benefits of bio-based carbon in wastewater treatment and pollution control not only touch the environmental dimension of sustainability but also benefit the societal and economic aspects.

From air, water and soil pollution to the unparalleled exploitation of natural resources and destruction of rainforests, humans are changing the biosphere at an unprecedented scale. With the growing gap between the demand for the readily available and inexhaustible energy system, and the truth of today’s energy system, which is extremely reliant on fossil fuels, there remains a huge disparity in the world’s energy supply (Gielen et al., 2019 ). The necessity of oil in everyday life has pushed industries and business leaders to search for non-fossil fuel-based energy sources. Many different alternate energy avenues are being explored to fulfill the energy demands using non-renewable sources of energy including biomass. Fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy such as coal, crude oil, and natural gas that contribute to carbon emissions, which in turn play a part in climate change and global warming. With the surge in  consumption of conventional fossil fuels, industrialization, and mining activities, there has been a substantial increase in global and regional issues such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a worsening in air quality (Jha et al., 2019 ). Although fossil fuels have enhanced worldwide economic growth over the years, their negative impacts cannot be denied. These effects are not just limited to a rise in GHG emissions (particularly CO2 ), water pollution (oil spills and effluent release), and air pollution (smog and flue gases) as secondary impacts include global warming, acid rain, climate change, and unusual weather conditions (Kang et al., 2022 ). In the current era, augmented attention has been given to the deployment of biomass energy sources, which is predominantly based on the increasing concerns about the environment due to the usage of fossil fuels (Nanda et al., 2015 ). Biomass is a renewable product generated as a result of the harvesting of food crops, processing of wood residues, industrial processes, and livestock farming (Jha et al., 2022a, 2022b ). These resources along with emerging waste-to-energy technologies can effectively ease the dependency on non-renewable energy resources and reduce the environmental impacts (Nanda et al., 2014 ). Moreover, the use of renewable energy contributes to energy security. Energy security is the capacity of an economy to guarantee the timely and sustainable supply of energy resources, with energy costs at a level that does not negatively impact the economy’s performance. A large amount of biomass including agricultural residues and forest refuse is underutilized for its potential to contribute to energy generation. Globally, 140 billion metric tons of crop residue are known to be produced (Bimbraw, 2019 ). However, most of these residues remain underutilized despite their massive potential to be used as a renewable feedstock for biofuel production. This chapter explores the opportunities and challenges of biofuels in sustainable science and their role in the sustainable development of modern human societies.  1.2 Sustainability science Sustainability science is a unique field interpreted by its objective, the challenges it tackles, and its solution-oriented approaches. The origin of sustainability science stems from an understanding of the human–environment condition with the concurrent intention of fulfilling societal needs while sustaining the planet’s life support systems (Haberl et al., 2019 ). Sustainability science is a surging field of research that deals with the interaction between natural and social systems and how those associations influence the trials of sustainability (Kates, 2011 ). It is also evident that sustainability science has emerged as a response to the  search for a unifying science to turn towards the necessity of sustainable development as humanity faces unparalleled obstacles owing to a surge in population, development, a lack of good decision-making, and land use and environmental alterations (Bettencourt and Kaur, 2011 ). It is an effort to better understand the intricate relationships that exist between nature and society and to support the transition to one that is more resilient and sustainable (Clark, 2007 ). The feasibility and reliability of the environmental systems and human civilization are being threatened by several sustainability trials such as climate change, financial disparity, and increasing pollution. Thus, there is an urgent need for speedy action to deal with these pragmatic challenges. Sustainability science brawls with transitioning from problem-focused to solution-oriented endeavors that yield optimistic results on mitigating sustainability trials. The field of sustainability science offers research characteristics such as problem-driven and solution-oriented approaches that have gathered substantial traction over the past few decades (Boda and Harnesk, 2022 ). These characteristics are a gift to the field of biofuels from sustainability science. These approaches tackle global, complex problems that stem from human–environment interactions. The field of biofuels could greatly benefit from adopting these characteristics of sustainability science for shaping biofuel. An important characteristic that can be adopted in this aspect is use-inspired science. The use-inspired science is a key element of sustainability that encompasses problem-driven and solution-oriented approaches to sustainability (Liao et al., 2020 ). The use-inspired science is a critical prompting concept in sustainability science that also associates knowledge with action. For example, use-inspired science can be identified with the implementation of renewable fuels, thus solving the issues related to land use for growing renewable biomass and treatment of wastewater (Fig. 1.1  ). The problem-driven approach aids in the exploration of how scientific fields and disciplines are reorganizing in the face of urgent and complex sustainability problems. It is evident that fossil fuels are harming the environment, and thus the concern of damage to the environment through harmful GHG emissions can be tackled by using biomass as a viable option. The solution-oriented approach is a distinctive characteristic of sustainability science. Biofuel research can be identified as solution-oriented as it tackles the issues of carbon emissions, pollution, and energy security by adopting biomass as a carbon-neutral and environmentally friendly feedstock compared to carbon-intensive fossil fuels. Another element of sustainability science that aligns with the field of biofuel research is its interdisciplinary nature. This can be perceived as a field of research that brings together various disciplines such as policy  and practice, global and local perspectives as well as disciplines across engineering (i.e., chemical, biological, environmental, mechanical, and civil), sciences (i.e., social and natural), medicine, biotechnology, and humanities (Clark and Dickson, 2003 ). The various disciplines coming together in the field of sustainability science, particularly in biofuels are environment and sustainability, chemical engineering, agriculture, and economics (Fig. 1.2  ). Interdisciplinary research allows for a synthesis of  concepts and the fusion of characteristics from various disciplines of science and engineering (Duerr and Herkommer, 2019 ). Moreover, intricate challenges are often not appropriate to address in monodisciplinary research. Innovations in research and development are more likely to occur at the boundaries in the middle of multidisciplinary research.  1.3 Sustainable development goals The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) deliver an evidence-based agenda for the planning of sustainable development of human societies while preserving the natural environments, wildlife, and ecosystems. SDGs play a crucial role in encouraging nations to build roadmaps for shifting toward renewable resources. The recognized advantage of biofuels and bioenergy is strongly embedded in SDGs for the member countries to propose, plan, execute and establish policies and actions to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy within their energy portfolio. Energy is critical to achieving the majority of the SDGs, from alleviating poverty through advancements in health, water supply, and education to combating climate change. This accounts for three types of energy, that is, heat, power and transportation. Though the energy system is a classic example of a sociotechnical structure, any change in the source and delivery is accompanied by massive changes in the demand or end-use. SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) closely aligns with producing and working with biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues and other organic wastes, to produce solid, liquid, and gaseous biofuels along with biochar that can sequester carbon. Biochar can be further used to produce porous activated carbon to adsorb pollutants from municipal and industrial wastewater, thereby addressing SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG13 (Climate Action) (Patra et al., 2021a ). Effective management and remediation of municipal and industrial wastewater are one of the most challenging environmental concerns in the world today (Nanda and Berruti, 2021 ). Biofuels are carbon-neutral because they are produced from non-edible plant biomass, and the carbon emissions from their burning are absorbed by the plants over time during photosynthesis (Pattnaik et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, the time necessary for balancing the releases can be enormously reliant on the type of carbon sink. For instance, unsustainable use of forests might lower the carbon sink values of plants and topsoil. Biofuels can help achieve specific SDGs by the following approaches: (i) increasing the proportion of renewable energy in the world’s primary energy mix by 2030, (ii) escalating the rate of global  energy efficiency growth, and (iii) increasing the availability of modern sustainable energy services through new or retrofitted infrastructure and clean technology. However, it is reasonable to assess how biofuels intended to be crucial in the interest of SDG renewable energy targets in replacing fossil fuels primarily on the grounds of their environmental friendliness fully warrant their consideration (Acheampong et al., 2017 ).  1.4 Global energy security Energy security can be defined as justifiably offering obtainable, reasonably priced, dependable, effective, environmentally benign, proactively administered, and socially adequate energy services to end users (Sovacool et al., 2012 ). As the national and local economies grow, fulfilling the necessity for existing, accessible, economical, and environmentally appropriate mobility, heating, and cooling will continue to remain a prerequisite for maintaining economic growth. As shown in Fig. 1.3  , energy is not only essential to the well-being of individuals and economic growth but also indistinguishably associated with the trials of environmental challenges such as temperature change, reducing poverty, and responsible utilization of natural resources (Cherp and Jewell, 2014 ). The integration of biofuels with energy security is vital. Biofuels can contribute to energy security by being a cleaner substitute for carbon-based energy production. However, in the case that biofuels are produced from first-generation feedstocks such as food crops (e.g., corn, wheat, sugarcane, and cassava), the land being used to produce these food crops and the food grains compete with agricultural land availability and human and livestock consumption. In other words, using first-generation biomass poses a food-versus-fuel debate and competition for arable lands making them unsustainable (Muscat et al., 2020 ). In contrast, using lignocellulosic biomass obtained after crop harvesting (e.g., bagasse, straw, and husk) and  wood processing residues can mitigate the food-feed-fuel debate to a large extent (Okolie et al., 2021b ). Humankind faces the task of providing food to the mounting population while making sure the energy requirements are met sustainably. The greater challenge is meeting the growing demand for energy and food, specifically when there is a shortage of arable land and water for irrigation due to urbanization and water depletion (Karp and Richter, 2011 ). Therefore, it is important to understand if enough biomass can be generated to deliver food (for human consumption), fooder (for livestock feed) and feedstock (for bioenergy production) required for a modern society. The ability to generate biomass is restricted by its biophysical confines along with social, commercial and policy restraints. Thus, the competition is among feed, food, and fuel for biomass (Erb et al., 2016 ). Thus, using biomass residues specifically which are non-edible for energy generation is a preferred choice. In addition, the utilization of high-input food harvests that utilize large amounts of financial capital to generate transportation fuels requires an alternative and needs to be replaced by the utilization of agricultural residues and woody biomass for numerous environmental profits. In addition, the energy policies should highlight the variations required and provide associated incentives to lessen GHG emissions and boost the environmental performance of biofuels. The threats to energy security are not just restricted to being a significant obstacle to wide-reaching wealth and well-being. They also increase the prices of transportation and electricity, which in turn can push households into poverty. In addition, guarding supplies of energy and the movement of capital from energy distributors to exporters can influence geopolitics and affect the global economy (Nepal and Paija, 2019 ). The world is facing an interconnected and intimidating set of energy security threats that appear to be worsening as the international economy continues to use more energy (Sovacool, 2012 ). Traditionally, scientific contributions to knowledge have been limited to the identification and analysis of problems. However, sustainability experts believe that a shift in focus is necessary to go from identifying the energy security issues to solving them because of the complex nature of the current problems (Rokaya et al., 2017 ). Hence, the issue of global energy security threats can be solved when collaboration among scholarship and practice, the international and local outlook from different corners of the world, and across the disciplines are encouraged (Clark and Dickson, 2003; Arora et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, using the components of fundamental knowledge and putting them into societal action could fetch the desired changes in sustainable energy security (Kates, 2011 ).   1.5 Challenges and opportunities for biofuels Value-added products such as biofuels and biochar obtained from herbaceous and woody biomass are efficient resources to deal with energy security and GHG emissions. Biochar, also referred to as a solid biofuel or bio-based carbon, is a carbon-rich material obtained from the thermal conversion of organic residues via pyrolysis, carbonization, and gasification (Nanda et al., 2016a; Masoumi et al., 2021 ). By lowering losses from soil nutrient leaching, storing atmospheric carbon in the soil, increasing agricultural productivity, and lowering the bioavailability of environmental contaminants, biochar has the potential to mitigate GHG emissions and global warming (Nanda et al., 2016b ). Owing to the presence of carbon with desirable chemical and physical properties, biochar is also being used as a precursor to produce activated carbon and remediate wastewater (Patra et al., 2021b; Patra et al., 2021c; Sakhiya et al., 2021 ). An important aspect of consideration for the biofuel industry is to have an appropriate design and conception to assess the ecological and societal effects of manufacturing biofuels. The worldwide energy crisis coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic and political instability due to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine has been recognized as significant factors contributing to instability in fossil fuel prices and availability (Rempel and Gupta, 2021; Steffen and Patt, 2022 ). Widespread usage of petroleum-based fuels for generating power and producing transportation fuels has initiated high CO2  discharges into the environment, and there is a critical demand to lessen its emission to prevent the detrimental effects of global warming. The many advantages of biofuels in addressing the environmental concerns raised by fossil fuels are shown in Fig. 1.4  . Biomass can be utilized to supply energy in various ways including solid (biochar and biomass pellets), liquid (bio-oil, bio-crude oil, bioethanol, biobutanol, biodiesel, and jet-fuels) and gaseous fuels (biogas, syngas, and biohydrogen) (Sarker et al., 2023; Okolie et al., 2021a ). However, various factors including lifecycle and techno-economic analysis need to be studied to safeguard both the renewable production and usage of biofuels when considering the large-scale transportation, storage, and conversion of biomass (Diaz-Chavez, 2011; Okolie et al., 2021c; Okolie et al., 2021d ). Reflecting on the accomplishments of the biofuel industry, it has been evident that Brazil’s success story with biofuels is inspiring. Today, Brazil is a major producer of bioethanol from sugarcane bagasse, representing 30% of the global fuel ethanol production. Brazil ranks second as a major bioethanol producer (8.6 billion gallons) after the U.S.  (15.8 billion gallons of ethanol) in 2019 (Karp et al., 2021 ). Sugarcane manufacturers are among the highest paid in Brazilian farming. Furthermore, their families have improved socioeconomic status as compared to other agrarian workforces due to the high demand and commodity pricing of sugar and bioethanol (Moraes, 2011 ). The feed charges and amounts of supply are open to being negotiated by the manufacturers and suppliers of bioethanol. For upscaling the function of contemporary bioenergy as liquid biofuels, it is assumed that it can sustain numerous transformative, yet unsettled policy aims, such as transitioning to a further protected and climate-friendly energy system, realizing green development determinations of rural growth and employment and permitting nations to conform with global obligations such as the SDGs. Political assistance and government subsidies are necessary for generating both the requirement for biofuels and the infrastructures that regulate their production and usage. On a worldwide scale, this aid has been motivated by three policy goals such as rural advancement, climate shift, and energy security (Ackrill and Kay, 2014 ). Additionally, many developed and developing nations are moving toward reducing emissions and achieving a net-zero emissions target by gradually phasing out the use of fossil fuels such as coal, gasoline, diesel, and natural gas. Despite many advantages, there are some challenges associated with biofuels. The properties of biomass offer significant challenges in transportation, storage, and handling  (Darr and Shah, 2012; Sarker et al., 2021a ). The complex chemistry of lignocellulosic biomass containing cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin also poses operational challenges to recovering convertible sugars to alcohol-based biofuels (Sarker et al., 2021b ). Another limitation is that liquid biofuels such as bio-oil and bio-crude oil cannot be used in the form they are produced because of the presence of moisture and heteroatoms (i.e., oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur) that can lead to low energy delivery and poor engine performance (Zhang et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021 ). Biofuels are blended with fossil fuels at flexible ratios for effective utilization in current vehicle engines to enhance cold-weather performance and optimize the cost (Altarazi et al., 2022 ). The establishment of compulsory blending obligations and extravagant subsidies can prompt the rapid implementation of biofuel technologies (Elfasakhany, 2021 ). In most cases, farms can be geographically situated far away from the refinery. Hence, transferring biomass from the farm to the refinery can involve a high cost during bulk transportation. During the transportation of biomass from farm to refinery, there is the consumption of fuel and emission of GHGs, which also need to be accounted for to ensure sustainability. However, transporting raw biomass in the form of densified pellets, briquettes, and bales can enhance its economic viability for biofuel production and reduce costs due to volume reduction (Zahraee et al., 2020; Sarker et al., 2022; Azargohar et al., 2022 ). It has also been observed that the production of biofuel is progressing rapidly, but the industry’s progress differs significantly across nations. It has been noticed that governments everywhere subsidize businesses, directly or indirectly, meanwhile at the present level of growth and the cheaper cost of fossil fuel, biofuels are still not competitive (Popp et al., 2014 ). Hence, fossil fuels are relatively cheaper than renewable energy because of the subsidies that the oil and gas industry receives, and the failure to take environmental impacts into account. It is important to reflect on the challenges that people face while shifting from fossil fuels to bio-based products and sustainable technologies. The present challenges are not basic shortcomings of sustainability; instead, they are symptomatic of how intrinsically distinct the worldview of sustainability is from the conventional, contemporary way of thinking. Some of the important threshold concepts that can be used in dealing with challenges related to biofuels are highlighted below:1. Adaptability-by managing the slow change that the world is witnessing towards increasing petroleum-based fuel prices and the shifting of nations towards bio-based fuels (Cinner et al., 2018 ).  2. Collaboratively work towards solving the challenges associated with land use, biomass transportation, logistic cost, etc. (Ostrom, 2009 ).      1.6 Conclusion The world is facing serious global issues such as global warming, a threat to energy security, and the increase in fossil fuel prices. The contemporary paradigm in natural resource management contemplates humans as the main component, and so the degradation of the environment can be seen as an issue that stems from the interaction between humans, societies, and natural resources. The overutilization of fossil fuels has affected various spheres of life, including air and water resources. Biofuels are a feasible option as a pathway to achieving sustainability. Furthermore, the knowledge generation, planning, and implementation aspects of research, including tackling global issues call for collaboration between various disciplines to promote transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in sustainability science. Thus, adopting the characteristics of sustainability is a capable way of attempting to solve these challenging global issues besides accomplishing the SDGs to pave the way toward accessibility to cleaner and abundantly available natural resources for the current and future generations.
