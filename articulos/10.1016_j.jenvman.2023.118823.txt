                  With the rapid growth of the construction industry and urbanization, the construction and demolition waste (CDW) has constituted the most major solid waste flow in the world. The unsustainable management of CDW causes serious societal and environmental issues, as well as leads to resource waste, which directly and indirectly impact on United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the awareness of the destructive effect by CDW, the academic and industry have devoted to offer a sustainable pathway for CDWM, which characterizes minimizing carbon footprints as well as proposing circular approaches. In this context, CDW can be reused, recycled and recovery as a value resource. Therefore, this study proposed a unique research method that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in the form of bigdata analysis and machine learning, which aims to explore the CDWM related knowledge and innovation from academic and industrial perspective respectively. Especially, what is different trends in CDWM-related of academia and industry between pre- and post-SDGs declaration era(s)? What aspects of SDGs have been addressed by academia and industry in pre- and post-SDGs declaration era(s)? The study witnessed that a 350% increase in the growth of academic literature and a 278% increase in the growth in industrial patents compared to pre-SDGs declaration period. In the academia, the emerging topics of research has shifted to management, circular economy, life cycle assessment, and ETC. Similarly, patent citation illustrated that the attention of stakeholders on CDWM in the construction industry has shifted from a linear point to a circular view. Moreover, the result showed that SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) have noted as most seriously addressed concerns by academia and industry.

Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. Charles Sturt University Bathurst New South Wales Australia       Handling Editor: Raf Dewil With the rapid growth of the construction industry and urbanization, the construction and demolition waste (CDW) has constituted the most major solid waste flow in the world. The unsustainable management of CDW causes serious societal and environmental issues, as well as leads to resource waste, which directly and indirectly impact on United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the awareness of the destructive effect by CDW, the academic and industry have devoted to offer a sustainable pathway for CDWM, which characterizes minimizing carbon footprints as well as proposing circular approaches. In this context, CDW can be reused, recycled and recovery as a value resource. Therefore, this study proposed a unique research method that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in the form of bigdata analysis and machine learning, which aims to explore the CDWM related knowledge and innovation from academic and industrial perspective respectively. Especially, what is different trends in CDWM-related of academia and industry between pre- and post-SDGs declaration era(s)? What aspects of SDGs have been addressed by academia and industry in pre- and post-SDGs declaration era(s)? The study witnessed that a 350% increase in the growth of academic literature and a 278% increase in the growth in industrial patents compared to pre-SDGs declaration period. In the academia, the emerging topics of research has shifted to management, circular economy, life cycle assessment, and ETC. Similarly, patent citation illustrated that the attention of stakeholders on CDWM in the construction industry has shifted from a linear point to a circular view. Moreover, the result showed that SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) have noted as most seriously addressed concerns by academia and industry.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Construction and demolition waste  Sustainable development goals  Patents  Research publication  Machine learning  Systematic review   Data availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Sustainability in construction and demolition waste management Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations, which include 17 goals and 169 associated targets as in response to the new challenges of modern society (United Nations Development Programme, 2022 ). As the modern society experienced high pace of urbanization, it also raised several obstacles while achieving SDGs. For instance, a large amount of Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) has been generated worldwide because of rapid urbanization (Colangelo et al., 2021 ). The inadequate management of CDW can potentially causes serious environmental issues and resource wastage (Wen et al., 2020 ), which hinders the implementation of SDGs. In the context of a sustainable future, CDW can be a game changer if the circular view i.e. reuse, recycle, or recover can be adopted in Construction and Demolition Waste Management (CDWM) practices (Gálvez-Martos et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, the sustainable practices in CDWM can play a constructive role in achieving several SDGs simultaneously (Fei et al., 2021 ; Ogunmakinde, 2019 ; Omer and Noguchi, 2020 ). CDW refers to the kinds of waste generated in the process of construction, maintenance, demolition and deconstruction of buildings and civil structures (Aslam et al., 2020 ; Chen and Lu, 2017 ; Mahpour and Mortaheb, 2018 ). According to the European Commission (2022) , CDW includes s a wide variety of materials such as concrete, bricks, asphalt, wood, glass, metals and plastic etc., which can be generated from the construction and demolition of buildings and infrastructure, as well as road construction and maintenance. CDW contains the large amounts of renewable resources, such as steel, concrete, glass, while they also consist of many hazardous substances like asbestos, mercury (Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018 ), which cause soil and water pollution (Wu et al., 2014 ). Alarmingly, there are almost 10 billion tonnes of CDW in the world annually (Kabirifar et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Hence, it is an immediate need to focus on the reduction of the negative impact of CDW on the environment (Ghisellini et al., 2018a ). In terms of the circular view, CDW can be used in new building projects as commodities, which can avoid the need to mine and process raw materials (U.S.EPA, 2022 ). Therefore, the sustainable management of CDW can bring lots of benefits to society, the economy, and the environment, which directly or indirectly affects the progress of the SDGs, such as the reduction of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) emissions, the creation of local job opportunities and economic wealth as well as the reduction of poverty (United Nations, 2022 ). Since the high pace of urbanization worldwide, almost all countries are facing serious challenges related to CDWM (Islam et al., 2019 ; Pires and Martinho, 2019 ). For instance, each citizen from a developed region contributes more than 2 tonnes of CDW every year, which accumulates a total of between 500 million and 1 billion tonnes (United Nations, 2022 ). Unfortunately, masses of CDW used to be dumped or landfilled in many countries (Jain et al., 2020a ). Jain et al. (2020b)  reported that the improper management of CDW not only threats human health but also causes resource waste. As the concept and practices of circular view in CDW is still in the beginning of its evolution, the resources and environment to adopt sustainable practices in CDWM is still challenging (Rabnawaz Ahmed and Zhang, 2021 ). Therefore, the academia and industry have been consistently exploring the best possible ways to optimize CDWM operations so that ecological footprints can be minimized and circular approaches can be maximized in CDWM. In the academic sphere, several theoretical frameworks had been proposed and tested, such as the 3R principle (reduce, recycle, reuse), Circular Economy, and waste hierarchy and classification. Huang et al. (2018)  revealed primary barriers to reducing, reusing, and recycling CDW through the 3R principle. López Ruiz et al. (2020)  studied the factors that influence the adoption of a circular economy in CDWM and provided a theoretical framework to emphasize the waste management and recirculation of recovered materials. Zhang et al. (2022)  analysed the circularity in CDW by the waste hierarchy framework. Moreover, Maués et al. (2020)  proposed a production estimation model for CDW based on fuzzy set theory to accurately estimate the amount of CDW. Shi et al. (2020)  presented a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) to manage the recycling of scrapped CDW based on the technological paradigm. In the industrial sphere, technological advancements are noted as the critical factor that influences the optimization and practice of CDWM (Gupta et al., 2020 ). To improve the efficiency of CDWM, various information systems have been tested and developed i.e. Building Information Modelling (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and internet of things (IoT) based solutions (Shooshtarian et al., 2022 ; Su et al., 2021 ; Z. T. Yang et al., 2021b ). Kang et al. (2022)  adopted smart BIM to create a building demolition waste management. Bao et al. (2021)  used IoT to develop a systematic framework for tracing the source of CDW. Furthermore, Züst et al. (2021)  realized the curatorial management of the CDW flow by the combination of Digital Twin with a graph-based Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the above-discussed literature, numerous efforts noted by academic and industrial stakeholders to offer a sustainable future for CDWM. However, it is still one of the serious challenges globally (Ogunmakinde et al., 2022 ). Therefore, this study attempts to explore in what way the roles and dynamics of SDGs can promote the effectiveness of CDWM through the lens of the UN's SDGs as the focal point. This study included two research questions: RQ1:  to analyse the difference of trends in CDWM-related research in academia and innovation of the construction industry in pre- and post-SDGs declaration era(s); RQ2:  to discover what aspects of SDGs have been addressed by academia and industry in pre- and post-SDGs declaration era(s). This study mapped the roles and contributions of the academia and industries for the sustainable and circular CDWM by papers and patents. To achieve this goal, an atypical and original research method that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches has been created. On the one hand, data visualization and exploration of academic literature were performed by CiteSpace and VOS Viewer. On the other hand, historical data of patents were analysed by machine learning techniques (NLTK and YAKE) with Python. Such research method presented the track of intellectual growth and footprint of technological advances in the field of CDWM. Therefore, this study offered a more holistic and detailed understanding of CDWM, which can provide some recommendations for researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers, so the ecological footprints can be minimized and circular approaches can be maximized in CDWM.  2 Method Explain in words here that method for STUDY 1 and STUDY 2 will be discussed in this section. 2.1 Methodology of study 1: bibliometric approach Academic literature can be examined holistically through the bibliometric approach, as it offers a quantitative method to highlight the most active ‘contributors’. Namely, contributors can be in terms of authors, research articles, publishing journals, institutions, regions, and keywords (White and McCain, 1989 ). Specifically, it offers the longitudinal trend analysis of any research area based on the bibliometric sources and metadata. Systematic literature review in the form of bibliometric analyses is valuable as it offers the facility to analyse quantitative data, underline the role of active 'contributors' in the form of co-occurrence and co-citation (Anwar et al., 2022 ). 2.1.1 Tools The academia reviewed in bibliometric approach by using data visualization tools. Specifically, it includes CiteSpace and VOSViewer, both tools based on Java-based environments and are unique in their specialties. The current paper adopted CiteSpace to analyse the prominent 'contributors' through co-citation and co-occurrence-based network analysis (Chen et al., 2008 ). CiteSpace offers the facility to identify and analysis hotspots (bursts) and Turing points (centrality) of 'contributors' in any research area (Chen et al., 2016 ). Hotspots help to highlight contribution which gain high citation in short interval of time. Moreover, centrality score provides the list of contributions which offered multidisciplinary perspective or divergence in the literature growth. This study examined CDWM and SDGs in a unified manner. On the other hand, VOSViewer was used to examine the contributors' co-occurrence-based collaboration network analysis. It offered a unique visual view to examine the most trending and active contributors, which named as ‘network of contributors'/‘heat map’ (Aysan et al., 2021 ). CiteSapce and VOSViewer have been used in recent years while examining environmental studies (T. Z. Yang et al., 2021a ), industrial analysis (Ye et al., 2022 ), and social sciences (Chanduví et al., 2016 ).  2.1.2 Data crawling In this study, the search query was designed for addressing two distinctive attributes. The first part of the search query addressed ‘construction and demolition waste’ and its related keywords. The second part of the search query underlined SDGs in a comprehensive manner (listed in Appendix A ). It is important to mention that the search query was designed under the guidance of three experts from the industry and academia. Moreover, the query was finalized after four rounds of revisions and revisits by experts in the field of environment, management, and public administration. The search query includes the synonymous of ‘waste’ i.e. rubbish, trash, garbage, etc. Similarly, the alternative words for ‘construction waste’ i.e. ‘construction material waste’, ‘construction demolition’, and ‘construction and demolition’ cover the holistic view. Similarly, each of the SDGs is included in the search query to address the proposed research questions more responsibly. Initially, a total number of 3178 research contributions crawled from the Thomson Reuter's Web of Science – Core Collection which was published from the year 1990 till the present. The PRISMA framework was adopted as advised in the previous studies (PRISMA, 2021 ). The Web of Science – Core Collection is considered the only data repository as it can be counted as the most comprehensive and multi-disciplinary in terms of its meta-data collection (Anwar et al., 2022 ). To maximize the data reliability and sample data for the study, the authors performed manual filtration and review of the crawled data. Finally, the total count of 1359 research articles was taken forward for the bibliometric research.   2.2 Methodology of study 2: machine learning The industrial view complied by examining the historical data of patents registered to address sustainability and ‘construction and demolition waste’ as the search query. The design of the search query for examining the industrial view also involved two experts from the industry. The finalized query took two rounds of revisions and revisits to the experts in the field of waste management. The search query includes the synonymous of ‘waste’ and the alternative words for ‘construction waste’. Similarly, each of the SDGs is included in the search query to address the proposed research questions more responsibly. The data crawled from the Thomson Reuters - Derwent Innovation Index (DII), as existing literature considers DII as a reliable data repository for patent analysis (Mirzadeh Phirouzabadi et al., 2020 ). The authors divided the crawled data from DII in the pre and post-SDGs declaration periods to address the research questions of the study more comprehensively. The metadata of each crawled record comprised patent number, technology innovation, classification, and manual codes. A total of 6383 patents. 2.2.1 Analysing tool Authors considered PyCharm for the following reasons: Firstly, it offers an environment to write code in Python and is a well-known open-source environment for researchers and developers. Secondly, it offers an intelligent, keyword-centric approach with quick fixes (code refactoring capability). The authors examined patents' crawled records, their trends, and developments by using a python script that the authors' developed for this purpose. The Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) was used which enabled the text analysis. Through NLTK, the keywords were extracted from the crawled data according to the scope of the study. The existing literature reports that machine learning as an approach can help to extract keywords, and semantic representation, summarization of the analysed data, and rank words (Goldberg, 2015 ; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004 ). The summarization and word ranking can be performed by KEA, YAKE, and IBM NLU. However, authors considered YAKE as a preferred one as suggested by the literature (Campos et al., 2018 ).  2.2.2 Analysing strategy Initially, the pre-text processing was performed by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) as advised in the literature (Umer et al., 2020 ). This involved examining the frequency of words and scoring their significance in relation to topics and meanings. The title, abstract, and technology of each patent were analysed. The Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library was exploited for NLP text processing and the following steps were applied to clean and prepare the text data for further analysis or natural language processing tasks: Tokenization - Tokenization involves breaking the text into individual words or tokens. NLTK provides various tokenizers, i.e., word tokenizers (e.g., word_tokenize) and sentence tokenizers (e.g., sent_tokenize), which can be used based on the specific requirements of the task; Stop Word Removal - Stop words are common words that do not carry significant meaning and are often removed from the text. NLTK provides a predefined set of stop words for many languages, and you can also customize the stop word list based on your specific needs; Lowercasing - Converting all text to lowercase is a common practice to ensure consistency in the analysis. This step helps in treating words with the same characters but different cases (e.g., “Apple” and “apple”) as identical; Removing Punctuation and Special Characters - Removing punctuation marks and special characters is often necessary to clean the text. NLTK provides string. punctuation, which is a predefined string containing all punctuation marks, making it convenient for removal; and Stemming and Lemmatization - Stemming and lemmatization are techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form. Stemming involves removing prefixes and suffixes from words to obtain the base form (stem). NLTK provides various stemmers, such as the PorterStemmer and SnowballStemmer. Lemmatization, on the other hand, reduces words to their dictionary form (lemma) using morphological analysis. NLTK provides the WordNetLemmatizer for lemmatization. Afterward, the pseudocodes were tested and executed to examine the patents' trends and growth, which includes the procedure to examine the cited patents, examining textual information regarding each patent (technology focus and abstracts), and examining the patents based on their manual and classification codes as declared by DII.    3 Findings 3.1 Findings from academia The current section aimed to examine in line with the research questions as previously stated in the following ways: First, the descriptive analysis was used to catch leading contributors in each period, which included total publications and the list of leading authors, journals, and prominent research areas. It followed the article's co-citation-based cluster analysis to underline the leading thematic view in each period. The rest of the subsections that examined authors, keywords, regions, and institutions were highlighted the key contributors in the micro- and macrostructure of the concerned research area in the pre-and post-SDGs period. 3.1.1 Primary findings The initial findings reported that, the total number of 303 research publication, published in 204 academic journals, by 822 authors from 52 countries contributed in the pre-SDGs declaration period. Specifically, the pre-SDGs declaration period captions from the 1st  January 1990 till 31st  December 2015. The publications included 7744 bibliometric references, with average citation count per item of 42.1 and H-index of 68 respectively. By contrast, in the post-SDGs declaration period, this study captured a total of 1056 research publications, dated from 1st  January 2016 till 9th  September 2022. These papers were written by 3318 authors from 87 countries and published in 404 academic journals, which included 8162 bibliometric references. Moreover, the average citation count per item and H-index were 37.83 and 64 respectively in the post-SDGs period. A graphical view of academic publications for every year from 1994 to 2022 is shown in Fig. 1  . The prominent contributing authors, journals, and research areas in the pre-and post-SDGs declaration periods are listed in Table 1  .  3.1.2 Growth in literature before and after SDGs declaration Regarding the timespan before the declaration of SDGs, there were many prominent clusters. Firstly, the caption of the most highlighted cluster was “construction project ” (silhouette score = 0.899). This cluster emphasized the importance of quantification and recycling of CDW for the proper plan and control of CDWM in construction projects (Gangolells et al., 2014 ). The next cluster with the title of “demolition waste recycling plant ” (silhouette score = 0.907), noted while focusing on the influence of the operation of CDW recycling plant on energy and the environment (Coelho and Brito, 2013 ). The title of the third cluster was “Japanese construction industries ” (silhouette score = 0.973). It signified that Japan was a leading country in the construction industry as well as confirmed that the reduction of CDW can benefit from the better management of materials on building sites (Tam, 2009 ). The fourth cluster with the title “design ” (silhouette score = 1.000), underlined that the appropriate source separation of CDW can minimize construction waste for the building industry (Begum et al., 2006 ). The fifth cluster is labelled as “dynamic material flow analysis ” (silhouette score = 0.979). This cluster focused on the transformation of CDW to new resources. For example, Hsiao et al. (2002)  developed a dynamic model of material flows of concrete waste, which used statistical analysis to obtain future material flows. The sixth cluster entitled “construction stakeholders’ decision ” (silhouette score = 0.98), mainly covered the influence of construction stakeholders' decisions on recycled mineral construction materials (Knoeri et al., 2011 ). Moreover, the rest of the significant clusters included “recovery planning ” (silhouette score = 0.974), “natural inert ” (silhouette score = 0.938), “effect ” (silhouette score = 0.953), and “alternative construction waste management approaches ” (silhouette score = 0.993). The common theme of these clusters concentrated on the minimization of the environmental influence of CDWM through the quantification of the ecological footprint of CDW (Ortiz et al., 2010 ). In the post-SDGs declaration period, the title of the most significant cluster was “China's construction waste change ” (silhouette score = 0.739). In this cluster, the determinants of contractors' behaviour for CDWM in China were emphasized as well as the key role of the government in promoting better CDWM (Wu et al., 2017 ). The second cluster is marked as “demolition waste recycling ” (silhouette score = 0.833), which can be described as an effective attempt that enhances resources effectiveness and reduces waste. for example, Oluleye et al. (2022)  researched the implementation of a circular economy in demolition waste recycling management. The next cluster, “recycled aggregate ” (silhouette score = 0.796), focused on the mechanical properties and environmental impacts of replaced natural coarse aggregates (recycled aggregate) in the concrete. As Rashid et al. (2020)  developed a sustainable strategy for the selection of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) through a series of laboratory experiments and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. The fourth cluster labelled “structural concrete”  (silhouette score = 0.887), mainly researched the mechanical behaviour of structural concrete with recycled aggregate to promote the utilization of mixed recycled aggregates in structural concrete (Cantero et al., 2020 ). The caption of the following cluster was “demolition waste generation ” (silhouette score = 0.755). This cluster investigated the generation, composition, prediction, and precise management of CDW (Islam et al., 2019 ). The sixth cluster named “construction project ” (silhouette score = 0.902), mainly focused on the critical design factors and management practices that can influence the minimization of waste in construction projects (Ajayi and Oyedele, 2018 ). The title of the seventh cluster was “circular economy ” (silhouette score = 0.881). In this cluster, the implementation of the circular economy model in the construction industry, especially in CDWM, was researched (Shooshtarian et al., 2022 ). The eighth cluster, “unprocessed sand-sized construction ” (silhouette score = 0.939), explored that the reuse of sand-sized fractions of unprocessed construction and demolition waste was an alternative to the local soil for sustainable development (Agarwal et al., 2022 ). The caption of the ninth cluster is “environmental evaluation ” (silhouette score = 0.966). This cluster mostly focused on the energy consumption and CO2  emissions of recycled aggregates (RA) produced from CDW based on life cycle assessment (Ghanbari et al., 2018 ).  3.1.3 Author/keywords-based trends before and after SDGs declaration In the pre-SDGs declaration period, the analysis of the author citation network showed that the list of the highly cited authors is following: Vivian W.Y. Tam from the University of Western Sydney (Australia), Hongping Yuan from Guangzhou University (Mainland China), Jiayuan Wang from Sino-Australia Joint Research Centre in BIM and Smart Construction (Mainland China), Liyin Shen from Zhejiang University City College (Mainland China), Weisheng Lu from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (administrative region of China), Andrew Baldwin from Loughborough University (England), and Zhikun Ding from Shenzhen University (Mainland China). In the post-SDGs declaration period, the outstanding authors included Jiayuan Wang from the Sino-Australia Joint Research Center in BIM and Smart Construction (Mainland China), Vivian W.Y. Tam from the University of Western Sydney (Australia), Weisheng Lu from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (administrative region of China), Huabo Duan from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Mainland China), Jian Zuo from The University of Adelaide (Australia), Xiaofeng Gao from Chongqing University (Mainland China), Huanyu Wu from Shenzhen University (Mainland China), and Zhikang Bao from The University of Hong Kong (administrative region of China). The graphical view of the authors' collaboration network is listed in Appendix B . According to the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the prominent keywords included “recycling ”, “waste management ”, “concrete ”, “model ”, “sustainability ”, “energy ”, “buildings ”, and “performance ” in the pre-SDGs declaration period, which were noted as attributes that sustainably addressed the top 30 co-occurring keywords. In contrast, in the post-SDGs declaration period, the top emerging keywords were “life cycle assessment ”, “circular economy ” and “design ”. Especially, in recent years, there are dominating future trends in the unified intellectual growth of CDWM and SDGs, which can be confirmed by newly added keywords, such as “life cycle assessment ”, “circular economy ”, “recycled construction materials ”, “reduction management ”, “construction waste minimization ”, “design management ”, “environmental impact assessment ”, and “environmental sustainability ”. The graphical view of keywords co-occurrence analysis is listed in Appendix B .  3.1.4 Regions and institutions contributed before and after SDGs declaration Based on the analysis of country (region) co-occurrence, the dominant countries (regions) in the literature were China, Spain, USA, Australia, England, Portugal, Brazil, Malaysia, Netherlands,  and Canada  in the pre-SDGs declaration period, while the noticeable countries included China, Australia, Spain, India, Brazil, Italy, Malaysia, England, USA , and Portugal  in the post-SDGs declaration period. According to the changing trend of regions between the pre-SDGs and post-SDGs period, academic researchers who come from both developing and developed countries (regions) have jointly contributed to this field. The graphical view of country-level co-occurrence analysis is listed in Appendix C . In the institution-level analysis, the significant institutions were Hong Kong polytech University (administrative region of China), Chongqing University (Mainland China), Technical University of Lisbon (Portugal), Shenzhen University (Mainland China), Harbin Institute of Technology (Mainland China), Delft University of Technology (Netherlands), University of Western Sydney (Australia) in the pre-SDGs declaration period. During the post-SDGs declaration period, the leading institutions included Shenzhen University (Mainland China), University of Hong Kong (administrative region of China), Hong Kong Polytech University (administrative region of China), Tongji University (Mainland China) and the University of Adelaide (Australia). The graphical view of institute-level co-occurrence analysis is listed in Appendix C .  3.1.5 Traces of circular economy and sustainable/unsustainable practices at academic front While comparing the content of each academic research in the before and after SDGs declaration period, the attributes related to ‘recycling’, ‘sustainability’, ‘reuse’, reduce’, and ‘emission’ noted as common ones. However, the priority of responsible academic contributors noted with sustainable change. The most visible sustainable attributes included ‘sustainable design’, ‘upcycling’, ‘waste to energy’, ‘circular innovation’, ‘circular infrastructure’, ‘economy incentives’ noted after the SDGs declaration in to the industrial practice. In terms of noticeable unsustainable attributes included ‘non-recyclable’, ‘exploitation’, ‘non-renewable’, ‘non-compliance’, ‘environmental impact’, ‘green-building standards’, ‘soil contamination’, ‘illegal dumping’, ‘improper disposal’ and ‘inefficient processes’. Thus, it can be concluded on the basis of the content analysis of academic’ sphere is highlighting fundamental issues and practices in the construction industry, underlining unsustainable practices in the supply chain and value creation in the case of CDWM. The redundancy among top 20 keywords addressing circular economy and sustainable/unsustainable practices in the related academic literature can be noticed, as shown in Fig. 2   below.   3.2 Findings from industry The result showed that a total of 6383 patents were crawled from Thomson Reuters’ DII. The primary findings concluded that 1335 patents were registered before the SDGs declaration. However, 5048 were recorded in the post-SDGs declaration period. The leading countries in terms of patent registration include China, South Korea, Japan, and the United States. According to the comparison of the pre-SDGs and post-SDGs declaration period, Japan was the leading country in the period before the declaration of SDGs, while the contribution of China is more significant in the post-SDGs declaration period as shown in Fig. 3  . 3.2.1 Patent citation before and after SDGs declaration The patents with the highest citation count in the period before the declaration of SDGs mostly focused on the issues focusing on construction waste recycling and regeneration, which comprises materials such as metal, wood, concrete, glass, and plastic. Moreover, some aspects involved in the collection, separation, and processing of construction and demolition waste were also regarded as the dominant issues in industrial concerns. The list of highly cited patents in the periods before and after the declaration of SDGs are listed in Appendix D . Surprisingly, the declaration of SDGs has promoted many critical industrial participants to execute more responsibly in the past decade. The CDWM-related industrial fronts also show the same trend, as all the top 10 highly cited patents in the period after the declaration of SDGs underlined the role of waste processing, recycling, and regeneration. The leading patents in the citation count were focused on the discussions of crushing, screening, and processing devices for construction waste, which is beneficial for the sustainable CDWM.  3.2.2 Patents trends/keywords before and after SDGs declaration To compare and analyse the trend of the patents' content discussed in the periods before and after the declaration of SDGs, the NLP-based semantic analysis as introduced in section 3.1.2  was conducted. This included the counting of the frequency of words, which helps to further score the significance of any word, topic, and meaning. The involved title, abstract, and technology of each obtained patent were examined. While comparing the periods before and after the declaration of SDGs, the conclusion was that the keywords such as water, cement, powder, material, crushing, gas, steel, and device are the most trending keywords in pre and post-SDGs declaration periods (the top 20 keywords in each period are listed in Appendix D ). In terms of the unique keywords during the pre-SDGs declaration period includes biomass, cask, scrubber, texturized, and coppiced. In other words, most of the keywords from the pre-SDGs declaration period are underlining attributes and stages of CDW processing and management. However, during the post-SDG period, the unique keywords included wetland, graphene, atomizing, tartrate, and mycorrhizal. In other words, it can be concluded that during the post-SDGs declaration period, most of the unique keywords addressed the characterization of materials and process innovation. In the bird's eye view, it can be stated that there is no significant variation in patent content in the past fifty years because more than 80% of the highly occurring keywords were recognized as reduplicative among the patents that addressed the development and innovation in the collection, recycling, and regeneration processes of CDW during the pre-and post-SDGs declaration periods.  3.2.3 Patent technical areas before and after SDGs declaration DII classifies innovation/patents into three broad sections which include chemical, engineering, and electronic/electrical engineering. DII defines each patent in terms of its manual and classification codes which define further the implications and practical use of the patent. As compared to the patents in the pre-SDGs declaration era, DII's Class Codes entries increased from 162 to 190 (17% increase) since the SDGs were announced. The graphical view of top trending DIIs' class codes is shown in Fig. 4  . Moreover, as compared to the pre-SDGs declaration period, the number of DIIs' Manual codes have been increased from 1099 to 2158 (96% increase) since the SDGs declaration. The graphical view of top trending DIIs' manual codes is shown in Appendix D . In terms of overall leading DII's class codes, the highest count of 2046 was recorded for L02, including the manufacturing methods of limes, soil, cement, mortars, concretes preparation for buildings, which is beneficial to the recycling and regeneration of CDW. The second most noticeable technical area was P41, with a count of 1620, which addressed the crushing, centrifuging, and separating of construction waste. J01 was considered the third most visible technical area, with a count of 1142. And the evaporation, crystallization, and separation of solids from gases, liquids, and other solids were included in this area. Furthermore, the fourth and fifth most noticeable technical areas were identified as A93 (count = 1135) and P43 (count = 888), which focused on the roads, buildings, construction flooring, and sorting, cleaning, waste disposal, respectively. However, after the comparison of the patent contents in the periods before and after the SDGs declaration, there was no distinct variation in the trends of technical areas.  3.2.4 Traces of circular economy and sustainable/unsustainable practices at industrial front While comparing the content of each patent's novelty in the before and after SDGs declaration period, the attributes related to ‘recycling’, ‘reduce’, 'chemicals', ‘pollution’ and disassembly design’ noted as common ones. However, the priority of responsible industrial contributors noted with sustainable change. The most visible sustainable attributes included ‘sustainable procurement’, ‘material recovery facility’, ‘green infrastructure’, ‘circular building’, ‘sustainable demolition’, ‘green supply chain’ noted after the SDGs declaration in to the industrial practice. In terms of noticeable unsustainable attributes included ‘poor waste segregation’, ‘unsustainable land use’, ‘inadequate safety’, ‘illegal construction’, ‘water overuse’, non-bio gradable overuse’ and ‘Insufficient Regulations’. Thus, it can be concluded on the basis of the content analysis of patents' technological novelty that the institutional role, regulatory reforms and policies are one of the external controlling force of the construction industry. In other words, the national and international regulatory bodies can be one of the driving force to define sustainable future of CDWM. The redundancy among top 20 keywords addressing circular economy and sustainable/unsustainable practices in the related industry can be noticed, as shown in Fig. 5   below.    3 Discussion Unsustainable CDWM can potentially cause an impact on social, environmental, and economic fronts (Kabirifar et al., 2021 ). In other words, irresponsible CDWM can directly or indirectly affect SDGs. Moreover, the post-COVID-19 era is more challenging (Bhakta et al., 2021 ). The integrated efforts by academia and industry addressing CDWM can potentially help to address SDGs. Therefore, this study adopted a systematic approach to overview the publications and patents that related to CDWM in the pre-SDGs or post-SDGs to map the pace and growth/trends in academic research and industrial innovation. Concerning RQ1, this study comparatively analysed the development path of academia and industry in the period of pre-SDG or post-SDG declaration. At the academic level, the declaration of SDGs has significantly accelerated the growth of literature related to CDWM. The result showed a 350% increase in the growth in academic literature when comparing the periods before and after the SDGs declaration, which has facilitated the extension of the breadth and depth in the field of CDWM research. For instance, in the pre-SDG declaration period, the contents addressed CDWM while emphasizing engineering, environmental Science Ecology, and Construction Building Technology. However, in the post-SDG declaration period, the major research areas emphasized include environmental Science, Civil engineering, and green and sustainable science. The shift in academics illustrated that management, urban studies, computer science/theory methods, and engineering environment can be stated as emerging trends while addressing sustainability in CDWM. The findings concluded that the thematic view from the pre-SDGs declaration period was noted with thematic labelling i.e. ‘demolition waste recycling plants’ and ‘recovery planning’, which diverged into several emerging clusters in the post-SDG declaration period. Namely, it included “China's construction waste change ”, “recycled aggregate ”, “demolition waste generation ”, “circular economy ” and “environmental evaluation ” observed with SDGs related attributed in recent years. The detail of each thematic view addressing SDGs in the post-SDGs declaration period are discussed in Table 2  . The graphical view of thematic clusters in the pre and post-SDGs declaration periods is shown in Fig. 6  . In the author co-citation network analysis, most of the affiliations corresponding to the dominant authors who contributed to academia while addressing CDWM are from developed and developing regions simultaneously. However, this analysis emphasized that the contribution of developing regions is less prominent. Consequently, the findings from the current study revealed that authors from developed regions have a strong impact in the periods both before and after the SDGs declaration. Based on the country-level co-occurrence analysis, a similar trend of the prominent nodes represented in the developed region was also recorded. However, developing countries can be predicted as leading contributors in future studies. Especially the countries with larger populations, such as China, India, Brazil, and Pakistan can be concluded as the prominent nodes in developing countries. According to the analysis of the growth of registered patents, the findings revealed some interesting patterns. For example, during the pre-SDGs declaration period, Japan was noted as a dominant contributor to patent growth, followed by South Korea and the United States. However, China was observed as the prominent contributor during the post-SDGs declaration period. Even though, there is a controversial view regarding the market value of patents registered in China (Alex He, 2021 ). Still, the endless argument on the growth of patents related to CDWM in China is foreseeable. A bird eye view of Chinese national level policies regarding resource utilization of CDW are listed in Appendix E . (Note: Due to language dependency and as per the scope irrelevance of the current study, the policies at national level not aimed to be explored. Still it's been proposed as possible future study in Section 5 of this study). Furthermore, this study investigated the patents trend by performing text analysis of patents’ titles, abstracts, and technological innovation during the pre and post-SDGs declaration periods (Supplementary Material ). The top 20 keywords in the pre and post-SDGs periods showed that the most common trending keywords included “waste”, “water”, “construction”, “device” and “material” . However, the unique keywords that existed in the period of pre-SDGs were “apparatus”, “heat”, “containing”, “beam” and “biomass”  while the emerging keywords appeared in the post-SDGs declaration period included “rod,” “filter”, “rotating”, “discharging” and “pump” . Notably, the common characteristic of the keywords in the period of the pre-and post-SDGs emphasized the collection, recycling, and regeneration processes of CDW, which underlines that industrial innovation is focusing on design and engineering materials. Moreover, in the period after the SDGs declaration, a few keywords that focus the sustainable behaviour and practices were also noted. DII offers a manual coding scheme, which provides detailed application and usage of patents. The findings conclude that the most prominent manual codes focusing on the sorting, cleaning, and waste disposal (L02-A03), refuse collection and conveyors (A12-R01A), type of milling equipment or process used (P41-A03), and external energy input for crushing, pulverizing, disintegrating, or milling (P41-A05) when retrieving the patents related to CDWM. This observation is consistent with the analysis result acquired for keyword-based analysis of patents. Interestingly, it can be predicted that science and technology can potentially play a game-changer role in the registration of the patents related to CDWM, which can be demonstrated by the appearance of digital computers (T01) in DII manual coding during the post-SDGs declaration period. In particular, techno-driven innovations, such as mechanical sorting equipment consisting of a roller screening and an air separation unit, play an important role in sorting and managing the efficiency of construction and demolition waste (Hyvärinen et al., 2020 ). Concerning RQ2, this study discussed and analysed the keyword-based comparison, the presence of SDGs, and its related contribution by academia and the industrial sphere. In the academic sphere, after the analysis of the intellectual growth pattern, the findings showed a more than three times increase in the literature addressing CDWM-related literature during the post-SDGs declaration period. Additionally, the results illustrated that there were 285 keywords from 303 research publications in the period of pre-SDGs. However, in the post-SDGs period, the number of keywords and related research publications were 375 and 1056 respectively. According to the keyword co-occurrence analysis, “management” was noted as the most prominent node addressing SDGs in context, as the appropriate CDWM is crucial to achieving the SDGs, which emphasized the importance of soft factors i.e. organizational learning methods, institutional capacities, and governance structure (Opoku et al., 2022 ; Singhal et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, “circular economy” also appeared as a dominant keyword in the research field of CDWM. As Wang et al. (2021)  mentioned that the adoption of recycled aggregates in the construction industry can not only preserve natural aggregate resources but also reduce the amount of landfill. López Ruiz et al. (2020)  indicated that the circular economy in CDWM provides many efficient utilization methods of resources and energy, which contribute to waste minimization and the reduction of environmental impacts of CDW. On another hand, CDW has also been identified as a priority in CE policies (Brambilla et al., 2019 ). The application of the CE model based on the 3R (reduce, recycle, reuse) principle in the CDW sector was explored by some researchers (Ghisellini et al., 2018b ; Liu et al., 2020 ), which were demonstrated as the best management practices for CDW (Gálvez-Martos et al., 2018 ; Huang et al., 2018 ). However, the implementation of the CE method in CDWM has been a challenging task, as the waste management and business operation (Lieder and Rashid, 2016 ). Therefore, some extended research is necessary to facilitate the process of achieving the SDGs in the field of CDWM more resilient and agile. Lastly, another emerging keyword is noted with the caption “life cycle assessment.” A life cycle assessment (LCA) is an useful tool for assessing the environmental impacts of a given product or service throughout their lifespan, in which the leading standards of LCA are ISO 14040 (the principles and framework of LCA) and ISO 14044 (the specific requirements and guidelines of LCA) (Gasiorowski-Denis, 2006 ; JRC, 2010). LCA covers full life cycle of products or services from the extraction of resources, through production, use, and recycling, up to the disposal of remaining waste, which is consistent with the waste hierarchy of EU, prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and disposal (EC, 2008 ). Thus, it has been widely integrated in CDWM. Bovea and Powell (2016)  suggested that it is necessary to standardize the approach that adopts the LCA framework to assess the environmental performance of CDWM. Zambrana-Vasquez et al. (2016)  designed an evaluation method based on LCA to assess the environmental performance of different life-cycle building waste management strategies. Moreover, Jin et al. (2019)  indicated that LCA should be used in the project planning and design stage of CDWM. In order to more comprehensively assess the sustainability of Circular economy for CDWM, Ghisellini et al. (2018a , 2018b)  presented an integrated life cycle framework that combines life cycle cost (LCC) and Life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) with LCA. Similarly, Shashi et al. (2023)  proposed an three-dimensional life cycle framework that contains environmental LCA, social LCA, and economic LCA to complete investigate sustainability, in which social LCA focuses on the impact of more sustainable forms of construction on stakeholders while economic LCA emphasizes the financial sustainability of sustainable and circular projects. Sum up, LCA has been integrated into CWDM, and it has been extended from both vertical and horizontal perspectives. The analysis result of patent citation illustrated that the attention of stakeholders on CDWM in the construction industry has shifted from a linear point to a circular view. For instance, the highly cited patents included the innovation-focusing tools, techniques, and the processes of collection and disposal of CDW i.e. crushing, processing devices, and regenerated aggregates. The sustainable innovation related to CDW can substantially contribute to promoting the regeneration, and reuse of CDW and benefit the sustainable environment. Although many sustainable practices of CDWM have been confirmed by the findings while addressing RQ1, a machine learning-based algorithm introduced in Section 3.1  was adopted to further verify the execution of SDGs in the field of CDWM. The CDWM-related industrial evolution and its association with possible SDGs performed through the machine learning approach as discussed in section 3.1.2 . The graphical explanation of industrial innovation in the context of each SDG is shown in Fig. 7  . Findings illustrate that the 3687 patents addressed ‘SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation’. It was followed by the innovation addressed ‘SDG12: Responsible Consumption and Production’ with a total patent count of 1719. Moreover, 1211 industrial innovation related to CDWM was noted while addressing ‘SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities'. Besides this, the findings revealed that 784 and 422 industrial patents are addressing ‘SDG14: Life Below Water’ and ‘SDG7: Affordable and Clean Energy’ respectively.  4 Conclusion This study proposed a unique research method based on data visualization tools and machine learning techniques (NLTK and YAKE) with Python to understand the evolution of intellectual growth and footprint of technological advances in the field of CDWM. Findings concluded that the researches related to CDWM and its connected with SDGs have significantly increased after the declaration of SDGs in the year 2015, which have been addressed by academia and industry responsibly. The integrated efforts by academia and industry addressing CDWM can potentially help to address SDGs in the more realized manner. The growth of CDW related literature and innovation since the declaration of SDGs has significantly accelerated. The result showed that since the declaration of SDGs, results reported 350% increase in the growth of academic literature and a 278% increase in the growth in industrial patents as compared to pre-SDGs declaration period. The shift in academics illustrated that management, urban studies, computer science/theory methods, and engineering environment have potential to trigger emerging trends while addressing sustainability in CDWM. In academic literature, ‘SDG12: Sustainable Consumption and Production’ noted as leading SDG while emphasizing the reuse and recycle of CDW, and its relatedness with the economic, environmental, and social concerns. The recycle and regeneration of CDW has become a considerable part of the intellectual growth of CDWM-related literature. In the industrial sphere, ‘SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation’ noted as leading SDG in terms of patents registration. It emphasizing the issue of hazardous substances in CDW, unsustainable CDWM and water pollution. Findings reveals that the declaration of SDGs has promoted many critical industrial participants to execute more responsibly while dealing with CDW. Among several SDGs, ‘SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation’, ‘SDG12: Responsible Consumption and Production’ and ‘SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities' noted as most seriously addressed concerns by academia and industry. Along with the valuable findings for the academicians, industry and policy makers, the study holds a few limitations which can be addressed to maximize the proposed research questions as discussed in Section 1 . Firstly, the data repository for academia and industry can be extended further by considering Scopus and United States’ Patent and trademark (USPTO) office into consideration. Thirdly, The sustainable treatment of construction and demolition wastes management have been as a consensus worldwide, which has generated social, economic and environmental benefits. Hence, numerous national and local policies and regulations that related to sustainable and circular CDWM have launched to accelerate the sustainability of construction industry. Although there are many obstacles in the practice, such as cultural context, language barriers, and even governance regime, the effect of such policies and regulations will be a further research theme.
