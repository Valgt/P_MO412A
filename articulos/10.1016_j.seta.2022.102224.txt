                  The Sustainable Development agenda of 2030, which was adopted by all the member states of the United Nations provides a strategic blue print for peace and prosperity for all people on the planet. This blueprint provides 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call to action all countries regardless of economic status. The main interest of this paper is the goal on affordable and clean energy (SDG7). This requires developing an assessment model to evaluate economies on their progress towards achieving SGD7. Performing an effective assessment of energy markets in both developing and developed economies is cumbersome and challenging. The lack of a universal metric for assessing the health of energy markets further compounds this challenge. This study formulates an empirical structure to evaluate the advancements towards achieving SGD7. Using an unsupervised learning approach(ordinal K-Means clustering) we form eight health level statuses. In this study, health level status is the degree of closeness of an energy market to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7. This approach is used to track the changes in the energy markets under three weight priority assignments; equal, access and quality. The data used is from the World Bank indicators between 1990 and 2019 provided by the World Bank. The findings illustrates how machine learning enables a holistic approach when assessing the health of energy markets by combining multiple indicators into a single score. Furthermore, the machine learning approach confirms the poor performance of energy markets in Sub-Saharan Africa in accessibility, and the lack of significant strides in achieving sustainability in some of the developed economies like the United States and China. This study highlights the dangers of a myopic approach to energy markets evaluation: A sole focus on access assigns the United States a health level status of 7, while a focus on quality shows a health level status of 2. The policy implications of the cluster classifications for selected countries were provided in detail where relevant.

The Sustainable Development agenda of 2030, which was adopted by all the member states of the United Nations provides a strategic blue print for peace and prosperity for all people on the planet. This blueprint provides 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call to action all countries regardless of economic status. The main interest of this paper is the goal on affordable and clean energy (SDG7). This requires developing an assessment model to evaluate economies on their progress towards achieving SGD7. Performing an effective assessment of energy markets in both developing and developed economies is cumbersome and challenging. The lack of a universal metric for assessing the health of energy markets further compounds this challenge. This study formulates an empirical structure to evaluate the advancements towards achieving SGD7. Using an unsupervised learning approach(ordinal K-Means clustering ) we form eight health level  statuses. In this study, health level  status is the degree of closeness of an energy market to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7. This approach is used to track the changes in the energy markets under three weight priority assignments; equal, access and quality. The data used is from the World Bank indicators between 1990 and 2019 provided by the World Bank. The findings illustrates how machine learning enables a holistic approach when assessing the health of energy markets by combining multiple indicators into a single score. Furthermore, the machine learning approach confirms the poor performance of energy markets in Sub-Saharan Africa in accessibility, and the lack of significant strides in achieving sustainability in some of the developed economies like the United States and China. This study highlights the dangers of a myopic approach to energy markets evaluation: A sole focus on access assigns the United States a health level status of 7, while a focus on quality shows a health level status of 2. The policy implications of the cluster classifications for selected countries were provided in detail where relevant.   Keywords Energy health  Sustainable development goals  Clustering  Machine learning    1 Introduction Measuring the performance/health of energy services or classifying energy markets based on developed metrics is an on going practice amongst academics and policy makers. One thing remains constant; a lack of a universal metric or approach of categorizing energy markets based on performance or health. One mainstay of energy markets analysis is using the energy poverty measure as an assessment of the energy market. Using energy poverty as a proxy for energy services or as a way to classify energy markets based on an objective and holistic measure proves insufficient given the proposed metrics of energy poverty in literature and a lack of universality in the metric used to measure energy poverty. Advances in climate change literature presents a new perspective of assessing the health of energy markets and energy services. This new perspective includes an inclusion of the quality of the energy sources as part of the assessment of the performance of energy markets. The United Nations has developed 17 Sustainable Development Goals : ”…are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice [1] . This study focuses on goal 7 (SDG7): Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all [1] . In this paper, a holistic measure  is one that includes the main components of SGD7, which are Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all . The majority of energy services measures or energy markets classification focuses on the first two components of SGD7, which are affordability and reliability. The majority of energy markets for countries outside of Sub-Saharan already perform well from this perspective. However, SGD7 extends the way energy markets should be evaluated to sustainability and modernity of the source of energy production. What is sustainable energy? Lemaire’s definition captures what I will refer to as sustainable energy in this study and the sources of energy that are classified as sustainable sources: ”Effectively, the provision of energy such that it meets the needs of the future without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable Energy has two key components; renewable energy and energy efficiency.” [2] . Hollaway interprets this as ” This means that sustainable energy is power which is able to be replenished within a human lifetime and so cause no long-term damage to the environment. Sustainable energy includes all renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectricity, biomass, geothermal, wind, wave, tidal and solar energies.” [3] . In light of SGD7, any metric that can be used to holistically evaluate energy services or energy markets ought to include sustainability as part of the assessment method, or it is rendered inadequate at least in terms of SGD7. Modern energy includes both access to electricity and to clean cooking facilities (e.g. fuels and stoves that do not cause air pollution in houses). Grid electricity is a major component of modern energy services, therefore ensuring that not only do consumers have access to the grid but, also ensuring that the source of energy generation is environmentally friendly is of high priority in achieving or inching closer to the full realization of SGD7. The current methods of evaluating energy markets capture some of the main components of SGD7, but do not include all the components important in achieving SGD7. This paper proposes a machine learning approach/unsupervised learning for a holistic approach to evaluate energy services and energy markets in order to measure growth or decline over a period of time. This method incorporates all the major aspects of SGD7 to cluster countries based on their performance in a composite manner. An unsupervised learning approach has the following advantages over previously proposed composite scores for assessing energy markets’ health:• Labeling of data demands a lot of manual work and expenses. Unsupervised learning solves the problem by learning the data and classifying it without any labels.  • It is very helpful in finding patterns in data, which are not possible to find using normal methods.  • The labels can be added after the data has been classified which is easier than human  • It enables finding the degree of data similarity using probabilistic methods. This allows the evaluation of data changes over time.    This machine learning approach allows policy makers to customize the analysis to the needs of the specific market. This allows policy makers in sub-Saharan Africa to evaluate their markets on affordability and reliability while still tracking their performance on sustainability. The countries that have reached the affordability and reliability goals can focus their evaluation on the areas of sustainability and modern energy. This paper designs an evaluating system that weighs each component of SGD7 in classifying energy markets in different countries. This is achieved by using world bank indicators on energy accessibility, affordability and sustainability to form clusters that represent data points with high similarity in all the indicators provided. This system can take any number of indicators and group the data into similar clusters. It is important to note that this approach can also be extended to evaluations of other systems when implemented correctly. Interpretation of such results will need to be based on the context in which this approach is implemented. This paper provides a novel machine learning approach to assess the health of energy markets. The clustering methods is widely used in other data science application, but has not been applied to energy markets health assessment scores. This novel approach allows policy makers to assess energy markets without setting individual threshold for each energy market indicator. The application of clustering makes possible a definition of levels that takes into account the complexity of the set of factors involved in the topic analysed. The levels obtained will be clearly more homogeneous than the levels obtained by using other composite scoring methods. Using these indicators each energy market is put into a bucket that shows the changes in its health levels over a period of time. This approach allows policy makers to evaluate the effectiveness of their policies meant to achieve SDG7 over a period of time. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2   discusses the literature review on the measures of energy services and energy poverty, Section 3   provides the methodology used to design the evaluation system used in this paper, and details about data processing,Section 4  is a discussion of the results, and Section 5   is provides the conclusion and policy implications of the results observed in this study.  2 Literature Review: Measuring Energy Markets’ Health Energy scholars have developed a number of metrics for assessing the general health of energy markets in a way that can be interpreted for policy measures. It is challenging to assess the health of the energy market; a proxy measure for the health of the energy market is often used. One of the main proxies used for energy markets assessment is Energy Poverty . The lower the Energy Poverty  in any market, the better the health of that energy market. Using Energy Poverty  does not provide a robust solution for the difficulty in assessing energy market’s health. One of the main challenges of using Energy Poverty  is that there is no singular metric that is universally accepted to provide a threshold of what it means to be below the energy poverty line. Other measures of poverty e.g Income, have a well defined threshold for defining what it means to be below the income poverty line. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than $ 1.90    per day [4] . There is no relatable substitute for a unit of energy where utility can be derived from, and without this objective reference for energy poverty, the different energy poverty metrics developed in literature only serve to help policy makers and scholars have an informative way to understand energy poverty and a reference for improved energy health [5] . The following sections review some of the key metrics used for energy poverty assessment. This review includes the advantages and disadvantages of each metric. It is the limitations of these metrics that motivates the clustering approach used in this paper to assess energy health and classify countries in different health level buckets. 2.1 Energy Access Energy access is defined as the percentage of the population that has access to the grid and access to modern cooking fuels. One of the main advantages of using energy access as a measure of energy market’s health is the ease of energy access data collection and analysis of data. Energy access is reduced to a binary standard e.g. ’having/not having electricity’ and ’having/not access to non-solid fuels’, making it easier to collect [5] . Energy access data is kept and maintained by a number of international organizations, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). While the energy access indicator can be used as a proxy for energy market health, it has a number of limitations in the degree to which it captures the underlying dynamics of the energy market health. There are a number of limitations when using energy access as a sole measure of an energy markets’ health:• It is limited to household energy [5]   • It does not consider other alternative sources of energy which are pivotal for processing resources into food and products using machines that require energy.  • It does not capture the quality of the energy source. These measures of quality include availability, reliability, affordability and safety [21] . This study focuses on quality as a measure of environmental friendliness of the energy source. This is especially important given the realities of climate change and the role that some forms of energy production play in increasing global warming.    One of the main critics borne out of these limitations is that energy access metric does not fully reflect the degree or the extent of the energy access gap [7] . Other scholars have argued the simplistic nature of the energy access metric leads to what is called an ambition gap [8] . Culver summarizes the meaning of the ambition gap ; ”The ambition gap can be thought as the difference in the minimal electricity used when a household is first connected to the grid and the more significant amount of energy consumed to reach a minimum level of productivity and quality of life. Delivering a meaningful amount of energy to support development may require institutions and investments of a different character than that needed to increase energy access. ” [5] . One of the aims of this study is to close this ambition gap by including a number of indicators that not only capture energy access but fundamentally capture the dynamics of the energy ecosystem in a holistic way.  2.2 Measuring Inputs The limitations of using energy access as a measure of energy market’s health or poverty led to the development of other metrics to improve on this measure. Energy scholars have proposed as an alternative, a measure that takes into account energy consumed or inputs to produce the energy. The fundamental assumption in developing this surrogate measure is the minimal measure of energy services; that is if one has energy therefore they have energy services and are a participant in the energy market. This review focuses on the energy consumed part of the measuring inputs definition. Energy consumed has been measured in terms of primary energy, final energy, and useful energy. An energy services measure like, energy poverty threshold, can be set by using the average energy per capita for the countries that are classified as poor [5] . The classification of poor countries comes from the Human Development Index [9] . Using this classification, the threshold is set as the average energy per capita consumption of these poor nations. Varying energy poverty threshold definitions have been formulated around the consumption levels of energy. One such example, is the average final energy consumption of the households whose total income falls within ten percent of the national poverty line [10] . Unlike the threshold in [5]  which sets the threshold based on poor countries, this definition means the energy poverty line is energy consumed by poor houses. One challenge in establishing this metric is the lack of formal employment in some poor countries, for example, Zimbabwe, The employment rate of 2019 was reported as 79 % [23] , meanwhile there are conflicting reports from trade union organizations like the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions(ZCTU) which set the unemployment rate at 90%. This unreliability in data makes it challenging to accurately report the population living under the national poverty line. This makes the reliability of the metric by [10]  less reliable. Another threshold that has been used in analysis sets the energy poverty threshold as the energy consumption at the income level at which energy consumption will not increase with income [11] . This implies that there is an income level at which a household will consume the maximum energy necessary without income limitation. An increase in income will not result in a need in additional consumption of energy. While this metric provides an alternative view of what it means to be energy poor, its limitations are similar to the other measures; the lack of reliable data collection especially in countries with poor assessments institutions. Composite measures of energy consumption have also been proposed. One such measure is the Energy Access-Consumption Matrix [12] . This metric combines the availability of different sources of energy and the amount consumed for each type creating the row and column components of the matrix respectively. The population that has access to each type of energy is collected as data points. The poverty line is defined as a frontier across the matrix, the shape of the frontier is subjectively decided on by the policy maker. This approach provides insight on the distribution of useful energy consumed by the population. Like all the quality of data driven metrics it relies on the quality of the data. The frontier definition can be used to push for quality of energy, and that is one main advantage of the Energy Access-Consumption Matrix  frontier. The other measure of energy inputs is the household income spent on energy. One measure defines energy poverty as the households that use above a certain threshold percentage of the household income [13] . This metric is not reliable in countries where informal employment is rampant. An extension to this metric includes the amount of income spent on appliances that are required to use for energy purposes [14] . An absolute measure of the expenditure on energy is one of the metrics developed for energy poverty analysis purposes [15] . Besides the unreliability of data collection, the income measures vary differently from country to country therefore making it challenging to define a universal threshold. Also, there is evidence that shows that the poor tend to spend more income per unit of energy compared to the wealthy [16] . This complicates the definition of energy poverty based on income. While measuring inputs can be easily calculated and persisted, the definition of a threshold to measure the overall health of the energy markets is not clear. This poses the same analytical limitations for policy makers as the energy access measures. Even if a definition of the energy poverty level was to be defined, it will only cover part of the health of the overall energy health of an economy. The goal of this study is to develop a tool that captures the overall energy health, and that is not limited to just energy poverty.  2.3 Measuring Outcomes Another approach for evaluating the health of the energy markets is by measuring the outcomes of poor energy services. The underlying assumption is that in the face of poor energy services the welfare of the population declines resulting in poor outcomes. In contrast, if the outcomes are positive then the quality of the energy services are improving. One can measure the health outcomes of the populations based on the fuels used. An alternative measure could be environmental outcomes like deforestation, crop yields, changes in amount of rain fall. Econometric methods can then be used to measure welfare losses/gains as in [19] . A challenge in defining such a measure is the collection of data and the presence of confounding effects on the dependent variable. Economic outcomes can also be used as a measure of the quality of energy services. Crop yields over time can be a measure of changes in income due to the use of fuels that contributes to climate change. An alternative approach that studies the opportunity costs of energy poverty has been proposed; this analyze the time lost in securing alternative sources of fuel that may have been used to earn an income or engage in other economically productive activities. This opportunity cost will be different in each country based on the general economic status of the country. On a local level, this opportunity cost will differ based on the location of the community relative to sources of fuels gathered. The availability of choice can be used as a measure of outcomes [17] . In [17] , poverty is defined as the absence of choices and opportunities to live a basic human life. This is an alternative approach to the utilitarian definitions of poverty. The Asian Development bank extends the poverty definition by defining energy poverty as the absence of sufficient choice in accessing adequate, affordable, reliable, high quality, safe and environmentally favorable energy services to support economic and human development [18] . Using this definition, any household that lacks a choice in having energy services that captures this definition are in energy poverty. Therefore an energy market that does not accord these choices is an unhealthy energy market. Energy outcomes are not measured in units that can be used for objective analysis, making the interpretation of these outcomes a difficult task. Even though collecting data for health and environmental impacts is straightforward, the designing and collection of data for opportunity costs and choice is a challenge.  2.4 Energy Quality The World Bank has developed a metric that is based on the quality of the energy. The Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) is derived from the assumption that energy services are not limited to electricity connection nor just energy, but the quality of that energy or connection that can be classified using a number of attributes. This metric improves upon the energy access metric by assessing the quality of the energy services provided to households and businesses [21] . There are six ordinal tiers(0–5) defined in the MTF, with tier 5 being the highest level. The MTF measured using the following variables: household energy, energy for productive uses, and community energy with household energy index is further divided into electricity, cooking, and space heating. This paper will not elaborate on the details about this metric, however more details can be found in [21] . The MTF is an improvement from the stand alone metrics like energy access or measuring inputs. However, it does not fully capture the extent to which quality is measured. The failure to include the type of fuel used for energy production limits their definition of quality. In the age of awareness of climate change and our understanding of the contributions by different forms of fuels to climate change, the type of fuel used for energy generation has to be a major influence on defining the quality of energy services. This study takes into account the importance of the form of fuels used for energy generation in defining the quality of energy services. The sections above highlight the advantages and limitations of the stand alone measures. The main disadvantage of stand alone indicators is their inability to provide a holistic look at the state of the energy market. Literature has shown the introduction of metrics that incorporates multiple indicators to circumvent the limitation of the stand alone indicators, however these measures often lack sustainability indicators therefore limiting their usefulness in assessing progresss towards achieving SDG7. It is this lack of a holistic metric that motivates this paper. This study introduces a clustering approach that takes into account the most important energy market indicators as outlined in SGD7. This novel approach allows policy makers to assess energy markets without setting individual threshold for each energy market indicator. The application of clustering makes possible a definition of levels that takes into account the complexity of the set of factors involved in the topic analysed. The levels obtained will be clearly more homogeneous than the levels obtained by using other composite scoring methods. Using these indicators each energy market is put into a bucket that shows the changes in its health levels over a period of time. This approach allows policy makers to evaluate the effectiveness of their policies meant to achieve SDG7 over a period of time.   3 Methodology This study use an unsupervised learning to classify different energy markets based on performance or overall health. Unsupervised learning is used to find hidden patterns from data that is not labeled { x  ( 1 )   , … , x  ( m )   }  where  x ∈ R  d     . One of the most popular unsupervised learning method is clustering analysis. The clusters are defined by using a similarity measure on the variables on similarity metrics like a distance measure e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan or probabilistic distance. There are a number of different clustering methods; these include Hierarchical clustering , k-Means clustering , Gaussian mixture models , Self-organizing maps , Hidden Markov models . This study focuses on the k-Means clustering .K-Means clustering  stores k  centroids that it uses to define and assign clusters. k-Means clustering  leads to partitions which are efficient when measured on the within-class variance [22] . It is for this reason why this methods is applicable in this study. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closest to that cluster’s centroid than any other centroid. The algorithm as described by [22]  starts with a random set of k  center-points (μ   ). During each update step, all observations x  are assigned to their nearest center-point as in Eq. 1 . In the standard algorithm, only one assignment to one center is possible. If multiple centers have the same distance to the observation, a random one would be chosen. The following flow diagram shows how k-mean clustering works:Fig. 1   After the process converges, order the centroids,c , of the clusters based on the magnitude | | c | |   . This creates what can be labeled as ordinal k-Mean Clustering . The choice of the clustering method is reinforced by some of the properties of k-Means clustering . One of its properties is weight separable [20] . The following definitions, theorems and lemmas are results in [20] :Definition 1 A partitional clustering algorithm A    is weight-separable if for any data set (X, d) and any S ⊂ X   , where 2 ⩽ | S | ⩽ k   , there exists a weight function w so that x ¬ ∼ A ( w [ X ] , d , k ) y    for all disjoint pairs x , y ∈ S     Lemma 1 If a clustering algorithm A   is weight-separable, then A   is weight-responsive .  Proof Given any ( w [ X ] ; d )   , let C = A ( w [ X ] ; d ; k )   . Select points x and y where x ∼  C   y   . Since A is weight separable, there exists w ′    so that x ¬ ∼ A ( w ′ [ X ] , d , k ) y   , and so A ( w ′ [ X ] , d , k )  ≠  C   :  Theorem 2 k-Means is weight separable.   Proof Consider any S ⊂ X   . Let w be a weight function over X where w ( x ) = W    if x ∈ S   , for large W , and w ( x ) = 1    otherwise. Let m  1   = min  x , y ∈ X   d ( x , y )  2   > 0 , m  2   = max  x , y ∈ X   d ( x , y )  2     , and n = | X |   . Consider any k-clustering C where all the elements in S belong to distinct clusters. Then k-means( C , w [ X ] , d ) < km  2   ( n + n 2  W   )   . On the other hand, given any k-clustering C ′    where at least two elements of S appear in the same cluster, k-means( C ′ , w [ X ] , d ) ⩾ W  2   m  1    W + n     . Since lim  W → ∞   k - means ( C ′ , w [ X ] , d )  k - means ( C , w [ X ] , d )   = ∞   , k-means separates all the elements in S  for large enough W .   Since the k-Means Clustering  is weight separable  and weight responsive  it allows us to evaluate the health of an energy market from various perspectives. This study follows three perspectives for evaluating the health of the energy markets; 1) equal importance, 2) focus on quality of energy, and 3) focus on access to energy. This will be achieved by assigning a weight on the indicators that fall into either the quality or access category. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the health level of each country’s energy markets over time. This allows each country to track over time the changes in the energy markets’ health level relative to the rest of the world in an objective and holistic manner. This also allows countries to avoid focusing only on one score, but formulate an analysis on different approaches to evaluate the health of the energy market. This study follows three approaches of evaluating the health of the energy market; 1) equal importance, 2) focus on quality  of energy where quality is determined by the cleanness of the fuel used for generation, and 3) focus on access  to energy where access is defined as the percentage of the population that has access to the grid and access to modern cooking fuels. The section on indicator weights will show how each approach is defined. 3.1 Data The data used in the analysis is obtained from the World Bank database [6] . The definitions of all the indicators used in this paper are summarized in the appendix section.  3.2 Data Processing One of the main drawbacks of the World Bank dataset is its sparsity. Clustering methods are more efficient when the data is complete. In order to reduce the sparsity of the dataset, I implement data imputations. In this case we need to be more careful about the imputation method used in-order to not distort the final clusters. For any missing value, we have a three level hierarchical imputation method: Algorithm  1  Data Imputations   1: for  Each indicator do   2: if  df.groupby(’Country’)[indicator]!= NA then   3:   df[col].fillna(df.groupby(’Country’)[col].transform(’mean’))  4:  if  df.groupby(’Country’)[col] = NA then   5:   if  df.groupby(’Region’)[col]!= NA then   6:     df[col].fillna(df.groupby(’Region’)[col].transform(’mean’))  7:    if  df.groupby(’Region’)[col] = NA then   8:      df[col].fillna(df[col]. (’mean’))  9:    end if   10:   end if   11:  end if   12: end if   13: end for        The hierarchical level allows the missing values to be replaced by the mean of the category that is most closest to the missing value. Theoretically replacing the missing value with the mean of the available data for that country is more meaningful than replacing the missing value with the regional values. This is because the spread of economic health in a region is higher than the year to year spread of economic health within a single country.  3.3 Data Normalization vs Standardization Normalization rescales the values into a range of [0,1]. This might be useful in some cases where all parameters need to have the same positive scale. However, the outliers from the dataset are lost.(1) X  norm   = X - X  min    X  max   - X  min          Standardization rescales data to have a mean,μ    of 0 and standard deviation,σ    of 1 (unit variance).(2) X  std   = X - X  mean    X  max   - X  mean          The main assumption for standardization is that the underlying data is coming from a Gaussian distribution. The majority of the indicators used in the study are bounded by [ 0 , 100 ]   , therefore the Gaussian assumption does not hold. In this study normalization  is used for data scaling. Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values. For machine learning, every dataset does not require normalization. It is required only when features have different ranges. Normalization is important here since the indicators used in this study have varying ranges. Normalization will guarantee that each variable is scaled in the right positive direction. We have two competing directions for the predictors used. The two types of indicators are defined as follows:1. High is better : This implies that the higher the value of the indicator, the better the energy market is performing using that indicator e.g percent of renewable energy, electricity access etc  2. Low is better : This implies that the lower the value of the indicator, the better the energy market is performing using that indicator e.g percent energy from coal, system losses etc    The normalization used has to take into account the two types of indicators, and maximize that value in the right direction of the indicator. In this study the normalization is set to the [0,1]. The normalization is implemented as follows: Algorithm  2 : Data Normalization   1: for  Each indicator  2: if  indicator is in { Highisbetter }   then   3:df [ indicator ] = df [ indicator ] - min ( df [ indicator ] )  max ( df [ indicator ] ) - min ( df [ indicator ] )         4:  if  indicator is in { Lowisbetter }   then   5:df [ indicator ] = max ( df [ indicator ] ) - df [ indicator ]  max ( df [ indicator ] ) - min ( df [ indicator ] )         6:  end if   7: end if   8: end for        This normalization allows the ranking of the centroids from clustering in terms of the dot product magnitude. The dot product magnitude can be thought of as a composite score for the cluster. The higher composite score the better the energy market’s health of the cluster.  3.4 Indicator Weights The clustering approach used in this study, uses the Euclidean  distance as a measure of closeness to the center of each cluster. The distance can be influenced by changing the scale of one of the variables. The variable with a higher magnitude scale has a larger influence on the distance measure. This influence can be used to assign more influence to the variables of choice. Since normalization put all the variables on a [0,1] range, this implies equal weighting for each variable using Euclidean  distance. A new weight can be assigned by using a scalar multiple to the variable of interest. Assigning weights influences the formation of clusters that reflect the importance of specific indicators over others, e.g. If electricity access is twice as important as the quality of the sources, the access variable is doubled after normalization,X  access - indicators   , X  quality - indicators   → 2  *  X  access - indicators  norm   , X  quality - indicators  norm        This type of weight allocation can be applied to any of the indicators relative to the other indicators. In this study there are three weight allocations;1. Equal weights:X  access - indicators   , X  quality - indicators   → X  access - indicators  norm   , X  quality - indicators  norm         2. Prioritize Access:X  access - indicators   , X  quality - indicators   → α *  X  access - indicators  norm   , β *  X  quality - indicators  norm   , α > β       3. Prioritize Quality of Sources:X  access - indicators   , X  quality - indicators   → α *  X  access - indicators  norm   , β *  X  quality - indicators  norm   , β > α         If α ≫ β    or β ≫ α    the clusters will be mostly influenced by access indicators or quality indicators. This will be reduced to either the access indicators or quality indicators respectively.Proposition 1 For constant k  under all weights, if x ∈ C  i  access    and  x ∈ C  j  quality      therefore x ∈ C  l  equal    where  l ⩽ max { i , j } , ∀ i , j , l ∈ k       3.5 Optimal cluster determination One of the main challenges of using the cluster analysis method is determining the optimal number of clusters. An optimal number of clusters is the number of clusters that captures the variation in the data without over-fitting the data. One of the main methods used to determine the optimal number of clusters is the Elbow Method [24] . The Elbow Method  heuristic is used to determine the number of clusters in a given data set. It plots the value of the cost function produced by different values of k . As k increases, the average distortion is reduced, since each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and these instances will be closer to their respective centroids. However, these improvements in average distortion will decline as k  is increased. The optimal k  is the value of k  at which improvement in distortion declines the most. This occurrence of k  happens at what is called the elbow. This is the value of k  at which the data should not be divided into more clusters. In this study, the optimal value of k = 8   . The following plot shows the optimal k  for this study;Fig. 2     4 Results discussion The dataset for this study has 6510 observations with years ranging from 1990–2019. It is normalized to the same positive scale. The analysis of this model is built on the following key assumptions:• The ordinal clusters formed will be distinct from each other and the health of the country’s energy market can be inferred based on the cluster it falls under. Each cluster has a distinct centroid from other centroids, since no data point is assigned to more than one centroid, the clusters formed are also distinct.  • The clusters will show stages of energy market development. Each cluster has a centroid that has distance from the ideal centroid of 1 . This distance is used to infer the stages of energy markets health levels.  • Using one country’s data, we can track the evolution of the country’s energy market’s health by tracking the cluster jumps over time. The clustering method assigns each data point to the ordinal clusters, therefore given the historical data for any market one can map out the historical cluster assignments.    The weights used for analysis are:Equal weights  = [ α = β ]   , Prioritize Quality  = [ β = 2 , α = 1 ]   , Prioritize Access  = [ α = 2 , β = 1 ]   . The clusters returned at each weight are ordered in terms of the magnitude of the centroid for that cluster. This means that cluster  0   < cluster  1   < cluster  2   … … < cluster  n     . The magnitude of the centroids are comparable because all the centroids are normalized in the positive direction. Therefore the higher the magnitude the stronger the positive direction for that clusters. Countries that are near this centroid are close to that positive direction and magnitude. In this study the number of clusters selected are eight. Using the ordered clusters, we define the energy health levels as follows:• low level: This level includes clusters 0,1 and 2  • medium level: This level includes clusters 3,4 and 5  • high level: This level includes clusters 6 and 7    4.1 Global level The following table shows a raw count of the distribution of the three energy health levels as formed by the clustering algorithm; The results Table 1   above showcase the state of global energy markets. When quality of the energy is prioritized over other indicators, there is an increase in the years in which the energy markets fall into the low level tier, this is almost double the count compared to the number of countries in the low level when access is prioritized. Intuitively, countries have been focused on access of energy for the majority of the time and it is only in recent times that there has been a focus on investing in sustainable energy. On the other hand the low level count when access is prioritized shows that energy markets are moving towards higher access levels regardless of the means of power generation. The equal weight counts fall in between the counts of access or quality prioritization. This result is expected as the poor performance of global energy markets when quality is prioritized brings down the performance metrics when both quality and access are equally weighted.  4.2 Regional level Inorder to get more insight on this analysis, lets interpret the results from a regional perspective. The following table summarizes the results from the regional perspective; The results in Table 2   breaks down the percentage of years for each region that falls into the three levels at each given weight prioritization. Under Equal Weights: [ α = 1 , β = 1 ]   , the majority of years in Sub-Saharan Africa fall into the low level designation, with 87 %, the highest amongst all regions, of data points falling into this category. This highlights the poor performance of energy markets in Sub-Saharan Africa which is often captured by other metrics used to evaluate energy markets. The results confirm the advancement of the energy markets in Europe and North America as no data point falls in the low level categories. However it also shows that there is room for improvement even for the energy markets in developing countries as only 34% and 33% of data points are classified in the high level for Europe and North America respectively. Both regions have excellent performance using access metrics, therefore we can infer that the low percentage of high-level classification points is largely contributed by the lack of high quality sources of energy production. Overall, regardless of the region, the high-level classification has the lowest number of data points. This means that the global markets need to focus on sustainability and modern energies in-order to achieve SGD7. Under Access Prioritization: [ α = 2 , β = 1 ]   , we see that Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia perform poorly, with 93% and 63% of the data point being classified as low level. Note that the quality of energy sources is still a factor in this classification. The majority of the regions fall in the medium-level for access, this can be attributed to the quality being factored in the classification. We see a change in the classifications when a myopic approach is taken to heavily weight either access or quality at the expense of the other indicators. Under Quality Prioritization: [ α = 1 , β = 2 ]    Unlike access where the majority of the regions have high-levels of access, the majority of regions have medium-level classification. In this category Sub-Saharan-Africa performance is on par with the majority of the world. This doesn’t say much as the rest of the world performs poorly in this category. However, we gain insight that the Sub-Saharan African countries are not far behind the rest of the world in achieving the sustainability and modern energy categories in SGD7. Under a myopic approach where a policy maker is solely focused on evaluating the energy access metric, I set the weights as α ≫ β   . The following Table 3   summarizes the classifications by regions; The results in Table 3  shows that the majority of energy markets are either classified as medium-level or high level. Again, Sub-Saharan Africa has the majority of years where the markets fall in the low-level category. The policy implication of such a classification is encouraging investment in the energy market to facilitate ease access to electricity. This can be done by making electricity more affordable for urban and rural populations and the development of the grid to reach all parts in developing countries, specifically rural populations. According to the World Bank 59 % of Sub-Saharan African population live in rural areas, and only 31% of this population has access to electricity. Even though there is higher access to electricity among the urban population, 78.1%, the lower access to electricity in rural areas significantly reduces the overall performance of Sub Saharan Africa in terms of access. The other end of the myopic approach is where a policy maker is solely focused on evaluating sustainability and modern energies,in that case I have β ≫ α   . The following Table 4   summarizes the classifications by regions;  4.3 Country level While it is important to understand the dynamics of energy markets on the regional level, it is more important for individual economies to evaluate the health of their energy markets. This allows policy makers to track annual changes in the health of the electricity markets for a specific country or group of countries. I follow the same order of assigning weight to quality of energy indicators and the access of electricity indicators. In order to show an interpretation of the result, I pick 16 countries at random from the list of countries in the dataset. Fig. 3   shows the dynamics of the energy market health when the weights are equal. The majority of the countries in this set of countries have either maintained a consistent health level or improved. We have South Africa, Canada, United States, Belgium and Turkey as good examples of countries that have maintained a specific level of health for energy services. We have Morocco and Zimbabwe as examples of countries that have seen a positive change in the health of the energy services. The improvement can be attributed to increase in access levels in the case of Zimbabwe, and a focus on renewables in the case of Morocco. Fig. 4   shows the dynamics of the electricity market health when the weights are [ α = 1 , β = 2 ]    i.e there is a higher weight on the quality of the energy provided. South Africa, China, India and the United States, stand out as poor performers in this category. The higher demand for energy in China and United States increases the usage of fossil fuels in order to meet this demand. In the case of South Africa, 92% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels coal(70%) and oil(22%) [23] . I do not go through the results for every country, however I demonstrate how these results can be interpreted and be specific to a country. Fig. 5   shows the dynamics of the electricity market health when the weights are [ α = 2 , β = 1 ]    i.e there is a higher weight on accessibility of the energy provided. Ecuador and Canada, stand out as the best performers in this category. The United States maintains a level 5, even though it has high level of access, the poor performance in the quality category lowers its rating here. Fig. 6   shows the dynamics of the electricity market health when the weights are β ≫ α    i.e the energy quality indicators are the most important and determine the cluster formulation. South Africa, China, India and the United States, stand out as the worst performers in this category. South Africa, China, India have a level zero health status. The demand in the case of China and India drives the poor performance, while for South Africa the heavy use of fossil fuels for generation drives the poor performance. The United States had a level zero status in the 90s, but saw an improvement at the turn of the millennium into a level two status. Fig. 7   shows the dynamics of the electricity market health when the weights are α ≫ β    i.e the access indicators are the most important and determine the cluster formulation. This provides evidence of poor access health in Sub-Saharan African. We see statuses as low as zero for Rwanda and one for Zimbabwe. The results show how Morocco energy markets evolved from a poor access health status to reach a health status level of six in 20 years. This is a change in national electricity access from 18 % in 1990 to nearly 100 % in present times. Morocco currently falls in the same cluster as European countries like Italy and Turkey, which are one level below the highest health status level of seven. Overall, there is evidence that the equal weight model factors all the important components of SGD7 in creating clusters. This is deduced from the fact that the overall performance for each country falls between its performance when focusing on quality or access. While it might be important for each country to evaluate its energy market from the perspective that the policy maker deem necessary, an evaluation under equal weights provides an important evaluation in relation to SGD7.   5 Conclusion & policy implications The United Nation’s SDGs are an important step in establishing a planet that is peaceful and prosperous, not only for the current inhabitants of the planet, but also for future inhabitants of this planet. Ensuring access to affordable and clean energy is one of the main steps that will lead to a peaceful and prosperous planet. Therefore introducing methods that can determine the progress each nation is making towards achieving SDG 7 is important. The unsupervised approach introduced in this paper provides a holistic approach to evaluating the health of energy markets. Using the clustering method after normalizing all the indicators provided evidence of seven distinct and ordinal classes that can be used for policy development and evaluation of individual energy markets relative to the rest of the world. The results were interpreted under three different weight levels and two myopic approaches. The myopic approaches are used to validate the classification models. There is strong evidence that the clustering methods is consistent with stand alone indicators in assessing access and quality. However the ideal measure is the measure with equal weights for all the components of SGD7. A country with a high health level status under equal weights has made significant strides in addressing all the components of SGD7. One limitation of this method is that the clusters are formed based on the available data, but it does not give an evaluation based on the ideal state based on access and sustainability. The ideal state for any country after normalization is, 1   , a vector of ones. One can extend the work in this paper by computing the distance between each cluster centroid and 1   . This will give a different context on how far each cluster is from achieving SGD7. The work presented show a need in adoption or formulation of policy changes to improve electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa, as this region has the largest number of countries in the low level class for access. While Sub-Saharan Africa face access challenges, developed countries like China and the United States face sustainability challenges. Providing incentives in the form of subsidies and tax breaks can lead to improvements in the quality of energy generated. This study provides evidence, under equal weights, both access and quality are factored in creating clusters as no country has a higher status under equal weights than both access and quality focused weights.
