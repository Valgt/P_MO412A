                  Circular economy practices are considered an important initiative in achieving sustainable development goals; however, studies synergizing circular economy and sustainable development goals are limited. The leather industry, widely criticized for its adverse environmental impacts, has the strong potential to implement circular economy practices. Further, the leather industry is considered a foundational source for economically marginalized sectors and it is a major economic contributor to emerging economies. Thus, the leather industry plays a significant role in attaining sustainable development goals. Hence, a study on circular economy practices considering the leather industry is of significant importance. This paper proposes a methodological framework for evaluating the inhibitors to circular economy practices in the leather industry. For identifying the critical inhibitors to circular economy practices, this study uses a systematic literature review and identifies twenty-five inhibitors. A hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method combining the grey-decision making trial and evaluation laboratory with fuzzy complex proportional assessment method is employed for evaluating the inhibitors to circular economy practices. The findings of the study reveal that the uncertainty of consumer demand, lack of social awareness, stakeholders with short-term agendas, a lack of technologies and technical skills, and challenges in the safe return of waste to the biosphere are the five most influential inhibitors in circular economy practices. These findings can assist the industrial community and governmental agencies in formulating the required strategies to implement circular economy practices in the leather industry.

The leather industry, widely criticized for its adverse environmental impacts, has the strong potential to implement circular economy practices. Further, the leather industry is considered a foundational source for economically marginalized sectors and it is a major economic contributor to emerging economies. Thus, the leather industry plays a significant role in attaining sustainable development goals. Hence, a study on circular economy practices considering the leather industry is of significant importance. This paper proposes a methodological framework for evaluating the inhibitors to circular economy practices in the leather industry. For identifying the critical inhibitors to circular economy practices, this study uses a systematic literature review and identifies twenty-five inhibitors. A hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method combining the grey-decision making trial and evaluation laboratory with fuzzy complex proportional assessment method is employed for evaluating the inhibitors to circular economy practices. The findings of the study reveal that the uncertainty of consumer demand, lack of social awareness, stakeholders with short-term agendas, a lack of technologies and technical skills, and challenges in the safe return of waste to the biosphere are the five most influential inhibitors in circular economy practices. These findings can assist the industrial community and governmental agencies in formulating the required strategies to implement circular economy practices in the leather industry.

Loss of biodiversity has a detrimental impact on the earth's life support system (Du & Li,Â 2020 ). Additionally, growing environmental awareness and the need for corporate social responsibility has necessitated industries to implement new business models (KumarÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). Hence, environmental conservation has become a pressing issue for the industrial community; many feel pressured to adopt sustainable manufacturing practices (MoktadirÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). During the past few decades, circular economy (CE) practices have gained significant attention both from the academic researchers and from the industrial community because it improves social benefits and minimizes adverse environmental impacts (AgyemangÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; KorhonenÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). When viewed closely, it could be inferred that in CE practices, the available resource is kept in a closed-loop, i.e., even if a product reaches its end-of-life, it is used again (LoncaÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). In simple terms, CE practices convert the traditional linear manufacturing practice (in which raw material is the input) into a circular manufacturing practice (in which the already used material becomes the input) (DieckmannÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). SchroederÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  argue that CE practices may contribute to achieving a significant number of sustainable development goals (SDGs). SDGs are the successor to millennium development goals (MDGs), recognized as a set of reference goals proposed by the United Nations for the development of the global community for the period 2015-2030 (LeÂ Blanc,Â 2015 ). The study by SchroederÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  indicates that adopting CE practices may assist in meeting several SDGs, including: SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Another study by Rodriguez-AntonÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  revealed that adopting CE practices will assist in meeting four more SDGs: SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water) in addition to the five cited by SchroederÂ etÂ al.Â (2019) . The United Nations has expressed its discontent regarding global nations' performance on SDGs, and industrial communities in emerging economies have been particularly sanctioned. WuÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  indicated that Taiwan's plastic industry is slowly progressing towards CE practices and assured that transition towards CE practices will enhance the industry's performance. Abdul-HamidÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  highlighted that the palm oil industry faces many obstacles in adopting CE practices, but the industry is assured that CE practices will improve their reputation. A study by UrbinatiÂ etÂ al.Â (2021)  emphasized that the automotive industry is moving towards CE practices in an efficient manner; CE practices lower the production cost. As other industries move to CE practices, the leather industry is also positioned to adopt CE practices. The leather industry is a dominant industrial sector in emerging economies and is considered an economic booster and employment generator (MoktadirÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). For instance, in China, leather exports account for 43% of total exports; in Italy, it is 10%, Korea 7%, India 7%, Russia 6%, and in Brazil 6% (OmolosoÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). Counter to its community benefits, the leather industry is widely criticized for its generation of enormous waste and its adverse environmental impacts (DwivediÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). In converting raw material into finished material, leather industries generate wastes like animal fleshing, hairs, and unusable splits; these waste products unmistakably pollute the environment (KaruppiahÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). With a traditional, linear production system in practice, the leather industries currently do not consider their wastes for further use. However, by considering a closed-loop production system, it is possible to recover value from these wastes. As the United Nations mandate, by 2030, biodiversity must be conserved to meet the requirements of all sustainable development goals. However, in contrast, when one tonne of hides/skin is processed, nearly 650 kg of solid wastes are generated (SathishÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). Accordingly, 4 million tonnes of solid wastes are generated by the leather industry annually. Nearly 85% of the animal skins/hides are processed using chrome tanning because it is a cheap method. As a result, around 6,00,000 metric tonnes of solid chromium waste are generated (ManeraÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). To process one tonne of hides/skins, it is estimated that 60m3  of water is used. The effluent that is generated contains unused chemicals, tannins, solvents, and degraded products of skins/hides. Previous studies report that the processing of one metric tonne of hides yields 200 kg of useful leather product. In other words, only 20% of total raw material is suitably processed, and more than 60% (i.e., 600 kg) of the processed raw material becomes waste (Sivaram & Barik,Â 2019 ). Such undesirable results question the progress towards two important SDGs: Life on Land (SDG 15) and Life Below Water (SDG 14). Therefore, leather industries must adopt a new strategy to minimize and/or reuse the excessive collection of generated waste. Using CE practices, the leather industries may reduce their adverse environmental impacts and earn a more satisfactory reputation in society. Because other industries (such as the oil & gas industry, the palm oil industry, the automotive industry) are large scale industries, it is easier for them to adopt CE practices. However, the leather industry, predominantly located in developing countries and exhibiting limited technological accessibility, faces greater difficulties in adopting CE practices. Hence, transitioning towards CE practices is full of challenges for the leather industry. An exploration of the leather industry's most challenging potential inhibitors to CE practices is a helpful initial step. Several researchers have evaluated and assessed CE practices by focusing on various problems. For instance, Govindan & HasanagicÂ (2018)  analysed various drivers and barriers to CE practices from a supply chain perspective. GuptaÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  established the relationship between CE practices and big data analytics from a stakeholder perspective. SlorachÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  emphasised the need for CE practices to recover food waste resources in economic and environmental aspects. DieckmannÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  evaluated various barriers in the transition towards CE practices. YadavÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  developed a framework for addressing sustainable supply chain challenges in CE practices. Ghisetti & MontresorÂ (2020)  investigated whether the financial shortage still restricts small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from adopting CE practices. Considering the importance of CE practices, this study addresses the critical gaps in the literature. First, the study develops a comprehensive list of CE practices inhibitors under five constructs: organisational, regulatory, market, economic, and social issues. Second, the study identifies the weight importance of each inhibitor and reveals the interrelationship among the inhibitors. This assessment can assist academics and practitioners in better understanding the impact and relationship among the inhibitors that hamper the adoption of CE practices in the Indian context. The reason for selecting India as a reference is that India is one of the major leather exporters in the world and is also a fast-growing economy (KaruppiahÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). Based on the above discussions, this study raises the following research questions.a) What are the critical inhibitors that need to be considered if an industry is interested in adopting CE practices?  b) How can we prioritize the critical inhibitors in adopting CE practices?  c) How can we determine the cause-and-effect relationship among the identified inhibitors in adopting CE practices?    A systematic literature review (SLR) was initially performed to classify the inhibitors in the leather industry to address the above research questions. These inhibitors were then discussed with industrial managers to finalize them for further analysis. As multiple factors influence the success towards the adoption of CE practices, the use of the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique will provide a better understanding of the relationships among inhibitors. In this study, a hybrid MCDM technique combining the grey-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method and the fuzzy complex proportional assessment method (COPRAS) was employed for evaluating the inhibitors to CE practices. The DEMATEL methodology, developed by Gabus & FontelaÂ (1972) , was used to evaluate the inhibitors and reveal the interrelationship among the inhibitors. The fuzzy COPRAS method, introduced by Zavadskas & AntuchevicieneÂ (2007) , was used to calculate the weight and ratings of constructs using crisp numerical data. Here, an integrated method that combines the grey-DEMATEL and the fuzzy COPRAS was utilized for two reasons. First, DEMATEL is the only technique that reveals the causal interrelationship among the inhibitors, and it estimates their weight. The fuzzy COPRAS method is utilized for its capability and efficiency in simultaneous consideration of ratio to ideal solution. The paper is organised as follows: SectionÂ 2  explains the CE concept and SDGs, environmental problems of the leather industry, earlier work on CE, and research gaps. SectionÂ 3  provides the research methodology. SectionÂ 4  presents the real-time application of the proposed research methodology. SectionÂ 5  discusses the results obtained. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions, managerial implications, limitations, and scope of future work. An online supplementary file containing the tables representing the various steps performed during the evaluation of inhibitors and the constructs has been provided with the paper. The tables include the expert responses, impact matrix Z  , standardized matrix X  , total influence matrix T  , and weight normalized matrix Y  .  2 Literature review The literature review is presented under five sub-sections, namely: (i) circular economy and sustainable development goals, (ii) circular economy practices in developing countries, (iii) inhibitors to circular economy, (iv) existing works on multi-criteria decision-making approaches and circular economy, and (v) research gaps and contributions. These five sub-sections will assist in a better understanding of the nature of the problem and emphasise the crucial need to address the problem. 2.1 Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Goals Rapid industrialization has been continually adding pressure on the global environment. With the existing linear production model, it is difficult to reduce environmental pressures and attain sustainable economic growth (SuÃ¡rez-EiroaÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). According to Pomponi & MoncasterÂ (2017) , there are two types of value chains: linear and closed-loop value chains. In the linear value chain, resources required for manufacturing are collected from different sources but they are not used. The wastes generated during the manufacturing process are not re-utilized in the linear value chain. However, in closed-loop value, the waste generated during the manufacturing process is re-utilized and value is retained from the wastes (AccorsiÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). The concept of CE practices is almost an extension of the closed-loop value chain. CE is considered a potential alternative for a linear value chain that offers both economic and environmental benefits. Adopting CE practices can help solve environmental challenges related to the over-consumption of resources on both local and global levels. Also, CE practices help in addressing a waste management crisis in emerging economies. The concept of CE practices is not new and has been in practice for the last two decades, especially among the industries and policymakers in Europe and China (McDowallÂ etÂ al., 2017 ; SuÂ etÂ al., 2013 ). According to del Mar Alonso-Almeida & Rodriguez-AntonÂ (2019) , the concept of CE practices is still developing. While CE's concept has been gaining significant attention among the academicians, industrial sectors, and policy advocacy groups, the level of understanding differs as there is no concrete definition for CE practices (Prieto-SandovalÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). The large number of literature selections related to CE practices gives different definitions, so reaching a single conclusion is quite difficult. KirchherrÂ etÂ al.Â (2017)  analysed 114 definitions related to CE practices. Some of the CE definitions given by different researchers are summarized in TableÂ 1  . The transition towards CE practices may largely assist the industrial community and the nation in achieving their SDGs (SchroederÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). SDGs are the collection of 17 goals proposed by the United Nations designed to safeguard the environment, conserve natural resources, and improve humanity's living conditions (https:// www .undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html). Sustainable development is a process in which the available resource is used for meeting the present need without compromising the need for the future. In this context, CE provides an opportunity for industries to maximise resource utilization in an optimum manner. As a CE practices initiative, â3Râ (reduce, reuse, recycle) principles were widely preferred by the industrial community (Joshi & Visvanathan,Â 2019 ). As an evolution of 3R principles, â6Râ (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, redesign, re-manufacture) principles are followed by industries (SangwanÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). Also, practices like cradle to cradle (CruzÂ Rios etÂ al., 2019 ), blue economy (GrazianoÂ etÂ al., 2019 ), and reverse supply chain (Hosseini-MotlaghÂ etÂ al., 2019 ) are also followed by the industrial community. As CE practices focus on some of the SDGs, global nations can consider CE practices as a tool to achieve some SDGs. According to the hypothesis framed by Rodriguez-AntonÂ etÂ al.Â (2019) , CE practices are related to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 15 (Life On Land). TableÂ 2   summarizes some of the literature related to CE practices and SDGs.  2.2 Circular Economy practices in developing countries A study by FatimahÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  that analysed the impact of CE practices on waste management in Indonesia indicates that adoption of CE practices will be effective in managing the nation's waste and in achieving their SDGs. However, the study also underscored the lack of technological support and poor commitment from the industrial community as impediments in their CE practices. Another study by HaoÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  that examined the adaptability to CE practices in China revealed a difference in accepting and implementing CE practices between urban and rural areas. The major reason for this difference was cited as the absence of outreach of technological support. Similarly, GuarnieriÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  study evaluated CE practices success in Brazil and revealed that the industrial community partially adopted CE practices. The absence of stringent environmental laws and non-consensus among the stakeholders were indicated as the reason for the low level adoption of CE practices. From these studies, it is apparent that additional research on CE practices in developing countries is needed.  2.3 Inhibitors to Circular Economy A study by LiuÂ etÂ al.Â (2017)  about managing industrial waste through CE practices suggests 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) practices as a possible solution. By exploring the challenges in implementing CE practices, the study identifies the major hurdles as a lack of awareness about environmental conservation, poor commitment to meeting environmental goals, and insufficient commitment from top management. DjuricÂ Ilic etÂ al.Â (2018)  explores the mechanisms behind waste generation and the industrial community's management system. They state that the transition towards CE practices represents a significant leap for the industrial community. However, it is advised that industries must be prepared for such a transition since the need is imminent. In Mahpour'sÂ studyÂ (2018) , which examines CE practices in construction and waste management, the lack of recovery is identified as a major barrier. The lack of environmental regulations and laws, lack of public awareness, and lack of support from public institutions were identified as other hindrances in CE practices (BilalÂ etÂ al., 2020 ; Yong,Â 2007 ). A study by AvraamidouÂ etÂ al.Â (2020) , which explores both challenges and opportunities in CE practices, concludes that a lack of awareness among society and a low level of preference from the public remains major blocks to the implementation of CE practices. For this study, the inhibitors related to CE practices in the leather industry are identified through a literature survey; they are detailed in TableÂ 3  . The identified inhibitors are categorized under six constructs based on the study by Govindan & HasanagicÂ (2018) . Another study by deÂ Jesus & MendonÃ§aÂ (2018)  categorizes the barriers and drivers under five constructs: technical, financial, market, social, and regulatory constructs. KirchherrÂ etÂ al.Â (2018)  evaluated the barriers to CE practices by categorizing the identified barriers under four constructs: cultural, regulatory, market, and technological. UrbinatiÂ etÂ al.Â (2021)  evaluated the barriers and enablers of CE practices under six constructs. Likewise, in our study, the identified inhibitors are categorized under six constructs: organisational, regulatory, market, technological, economic, and social issues. Under the organisational construct, the inhibitors related to the managerial and internal issues of the company are categorized. Similarly, under the regulatory construct, inhibitors from the governmental side and respective bodies are included. Then, inhibitors concerned with the demand for the product developed through CE practices are grouped under the market construct. Inhibitors concerned with technological support for CE practices appear under the technological construct. Likewise, the problem related to financial assistance is categorized under economic construct, and issues related to the societal background are found under the social construct. The reason for categorizing the inhibitors under six constructs is that such categorization will assist academics and industrial practitioners in better understanding the key inhibitors to CE practices.  2.4 Existing Multi-Criteria Decision Making approaches to Circular Economy Studies The application of several MCDM approaches appear in the CE literature. For instance, MoktadirÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  used the Best-Worst method (BWM) to analyse the challenges to CE practices in the leather industry context. YadavÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  used a hybrid BWM - ELiminationand Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) approach to analysing challenges to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) involved in CE practices. In another study, KumarÂ etÂ al.Â (2021)  used an integrated analytic hierarchy process (AHP) - ELECTRE approach to evaluating the barriers of sustainable supply chain in CE practices. Garcia-BernabeuÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  used TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solutions) methodology to construct a set of indicators in CE practices. KhanÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  used a hybrid MCDM technique combining the DEMATEL with the analytic network process (ANP) to analyse critical success factors in the transition towards CE practices. KaragozÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  used a fuzzy assisted combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) method to analyse suitable CE practices in an Istanbul context. TableÂ 4   summarizes various MCDM techniques used in analysing CE practices in different areas. Regarding CE practices, none of the earlier studies has categorized the inhibitors under specified constructs nor have they revealed the interrelationships among the inhibitors. To address these gaps, an integrated approach of the grey-DEMATEL and fuzzy-COPRAS has been used in this study. DEMATEL, a multi-criteria decision-making technique, was introduced by Gabus & FontelaÂ (1972) . The DEMATEL technique was used in this study to reveal the interrelationships among inhibitors. Additionally, the inhibitors were categorized under cause-and-effect groups. Such categorization will provide better understanding about the inhibitorsâ nature for the industrial practitioners and for policymakers. This method has been successfully used in various applications. BhalajiÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  used the fuzzy DEMATEL approach to understanding the interrelationship among risk factors in the healthcare industry. GargÂ (2020)  used the grey-DEMATEL to reveal the relationship among barriers in e-waste management. Therefore, this method has been effective in analysing the relationships among the factors under consideration. Then, fuzzy COPRAS, introduced by Zavadskas & AntuchevicieneÂ (2007) , is used to rank the factors. COPRAS is utilized for its capability and efficiency in ranking the inhibitors based on the ratio value of reference data. GhoseÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  used fuzzy-COPRAS to select material for solar electric vehicles. Hence, this study proposes a hybrid method, combining the grey-DEMATEL and fuzzy-COPRAS to reveal the interrelationships among the inhibitors to CE practices and to prioritize the constructs.  2.5 Research gaps and contributions Alonso-Almeida & Rodriguez-AntonÂ (2019)  specified that CE practices research is still in the developing stage and requires more real case investigations, especially from emerging economies. KapoorÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  argued that society has a negative view of India's industrial community because of the environmental problems associated with poor waste management. In this regard, the adoption of CE practices will not only help the industrial community with their waste management but also will recover value from the waste products. As given in sectionÂ 2.3 , some of the studies have assessed the challenges and barriers to CE practices (MoktadirÂ etÂ al., 2020 ; AgyemangÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; deÂ Jesus & MendonÃ§a,Â 2018 ; TuraÂ etÂ al., 2019 ); however, none of these studies has evaluated the challenges faced by the Indian leather industry. Earlier research works on the leather industry have highlighted the need for adopting better waste management practices but have not emphasized CE practices (Famielec,Â 2020 ). For instance, Govindan & HasanagicÂ (2018)  suggested 4R (reduce, reuse, recycle, and recovery) and 6R (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, redesign, re-manufacture) practices as the solution to minimize the adverse environmental impact and to recover value from the waste. YadavÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  developed a framework for overcoming challenges faced by the automotive industry in sustainable supply chain management suggested integration of industry 4.0 and CE practices. Abdul-HamidÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  investigated the wastes generated by the palm oil industry and confirmed the adverse impact on the environment from that waste. They insisted that adoption of CE practices by the palm oil industry may help in reducing adverse environmental impacts and may help the industry gain a competitive edge. Further, studies by SchroederÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  and Rodriguez-AntonÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  argued that the adoption of CE practices will give more thrust in attaining SDGs. However, studies investigating the inhibitors related to CE practices in the leather industry of developing economy context are scarce. Further, studies on the challenges to adoption of CE practices failed to reveal the interrelationships among the challenges in CE practices. Understanding the cause-and-effect interrelationships among the inhibitors to CE practices cause is crucial to industrial managers before they can fully decide to implement CE strategies. By identifying the root inhibitors, industrial practitioners may eliminate or minimize the cause inhibitors, thereby avoiding other inhibitors that may emerge. The above-identified gaps clearly indicate the need to reveal the interrelationships among the inhibitors and to identify the key constructs that need more attention. To address these gaps, this study investigates the inhibitors to CE practices in leather industries in India. Also, this study develops a framework that evaluates the inhibitors, reveals the interrelationships, and identifies the key constructs needing attention. The overall contributions of the study are summarized as follows:â¢ A comprehensive list of inhibitors to CE practices is proposed by integrating several inhibitors from previous studies.  â¢ A multi-criteria decision-aid framework for analysing the inhibitors to CE practices in the leather industry of an emerging economy context is proposed.  â¢ Grey-DEMATEL method is employed to reveal the interrelationships between the inhibitors.  â¢ Fuzzy-COPRAS is used to prioritize the constructs under which the inhibitors to CE practices are categorized.      3 Methods This section explains the methods used in this study and illustrates the real-case application of the proposed methods. 3.1 Grey-DEMATEL Grey theory proposed by Ju-LongÂ (1982)  is capable of producing possible solutions with a small amount of data. Grey numbers are transformed into crisp numbers using the following three steps (XiaÂ etÂ al., 2015 ). Consider a grey number â x = ( â  Ì²  x i j   , â  Â¯  x i j    )   , where â  Ì²  x i j     is the lower limit and â  Â¯  x i j     is the upper limit of â x   .Step 1: Normalization(1) â  Â¯  x i j   = ( â  Â¯  x i j   â min â  Â¯  x i j    )  / Î  min  max   and  â  Ì²  x i j   = ( â  Ì²  x i j   â min â  Ì²  x i j    )  / Î  min  max         Where Î  min  max  = max â  Â¯  x i j   â min â  Ì²  x i j     Step 2: Standardization(2) Y i j   = ( â  Ì²  x i j   ( 1 â â  Ì²  x i j    )  + ( â  Â¯  x i j   Ã â  Â¯  x i j    )   )  ( 1 â â  Ì²  x i j   + â  Â¯  x i j    )         Step 3: Computation(3) Z i j   = min â  Â¯  x i j   + Y i j   Î  min  max          DEMATEL is an MCDM method proposed by Gabus & FontelaÂ (1972) . It is a simple method based on pairwise comparison and it illustrates the relationship between inhibitors using graph-theoretic matrix tools. Here, the DEMATEL technique is used to reveal the interrelationships among the inhibitors. Earlier studies used the DEMATEL technique to solve complex problems (BhalajiÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; QarnainÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). There are many studies combining grey theory with the DEMATEL technique that are used to solve various problems (Garg,Â 2020 ). It is a basic theory that analyses the causal relationship between the inhibitors and calculates the inhibitors' weight. The steps involved are as follows:Step 1 : Compute the direct influence matrix X   based on expertsâ opinions.    Based on the range of CE practices, the direct influence matrix is compiled by the experts.Step 2:  Obtain matrix Z   using Eqs.Â (1)  to (3) .  Step 3:  Compute standardized matrix X   by(4) X i j   = Z i j   S         where S = max { max 1 â¤ i â¤ n   â j = 1  n  Z i j   , max 1 â¤ j â¤ n   â i = 1  n  Z i j    }   . Step 4:  Construct comprehensive influence matrix T  (5) T = X ( 1 â X  )  â 1         Step 5:  Estimate centrality R  , causality C  , ( R + C  )   , and ( R â C  )   (6) R = [ â j = 1  n  t i j    ]  n Ã 1       (7) C = [ â i = 1  n  t i j    ]  n Ã 1           ( R + C  )    shows the degree of relation between each inhibitor with others. The larger the ( R + C  )    value, the larger the relationship with other inhibitors; the lesser the ( R + C  )    value, the lesser the relationship with other inhibitors. ( R â C  )    shows the severity of influence of each inhibitor. A positive ( R â C  )    value means the inhibitor will influence others; a negative ( R â C  )    value means the inhibitor will get influenced by other inhibitors.Step 6:  Calculate the weight of each inhibitor(8) w i j   = [ ( r j  + c j   )   2  + ( r j  â c j   )   2   ]   1  /  2   â j = 1  n  [ ( r j  + c j   )   2  + ( r j  â c j   )   2   ]   1  /  2              3.2 Fuzzy COPRAS COPRAS is an MCDM method first introduced by Zavadskas & KaklauskasÂ (1996) . It was used to determine the solution with the ratio to the best solution. Then, COPRAS in fuzzy context was introduced by Zavadskas & AntuchevicieneÂ (2007) . In the general COPRAS method, the alternatives' weight and ratings are calculated using crisp numerical data. However, the results are imprecise and inaccurate. Under such a situation, fuzzy COPRAS is considered as it can handle vagueness in decision-making. Fuzzy COPRAS is used to solve some critical problems like material selection, location selection, and renewable energy source selection (GhoseÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). The mathematical steps involved in fuzzy COPRAS are as below:Step 1:  Establish fuzzy decision matrix    Consider n   number of inhibitors and m   number of critical areas. Construct the decision matrix as follow:(9) D â¼  = [ x Ë  11   x Ë  12   â¯  x Ë  1 n     x Ë  21   x Ë  22   â¯  x Ë  2 n     â®  â®  â¯  â®   x Ë  m 1    x Ë  m 2    â¯  x Ë  m n      ]      and the inhibitors are constructed as follows:(10) W Ë  = ( w Ë  1  , w Ë  2  , â¦ , w Ë  n   )       Defuzzify the fuzzy decision matrix and fuzzy weight of the inhibitors using centre of area (COA) (JagerÂ etÂ al., 1992 ). The Best Non-fuzzy Performance (BNP) value for the fuzzy number R Ë  i  = ( L R Ë  i  , M R Ë  i  , U R Ë  i   )     is calculated as follows:(11) B N P = [ ( U R Ë  i  â L R Ë  i   )  + ( M R Ë  i  â L R Ë  i   )   ]   /  3  + L R Ë  i      Step 2 : Normalize fuzzy decision matrix(12) x i j    Â¯  = x i j   â j = 1  n  x i j           Step 3:  Weight normalized decision matrix Y  (13) x ^  i j   = x i j    Â¯  . q j        Step 4:  Sums P j    of alternativesâ values(14) P j  = â j = 1  k  x ^  i j         Step 5:  Sums R j    of alternativesâ values(15) R j  = â j = k + 1  m  x ^  i j         Step 6:  Calculate the minimum value of R i   (16) R min  = min i  R i        Step 7:  Estimate the relative weight of each alternative(17) Q i  = P i  + R min  â i = 1  n  R i   R i  â i = 1  n  R min  R i           Step 8:  Determine the optimality of the alternative K  (18) K = max i  Q i        Step 9:  Calculation of utility degree of each alternative(19) U i  = Q i  Q max   100 %         A real-world application of the proposed integrated methods is provided in SectionÂ 3.3  as follows.  3.3 A real-world application The Indian industrial sector's transition towards CE practices is in an embryonic stage and needs aggressive improvement (SinghÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). The Indian leather industry acts as a great employment generator, thus alleviating poverty and earning foreign exchange. According to a report from the Council for Leather Exports, the leather export from India has reached a value of US$ 5.69 billion during 2018-2019. This number reflects that the leather industry's annual economic contribution is significant (DwivediÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). Although the leather industry's economic contribution is substantial, India ranks 168 among 180 countries in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPIÂ report,Â 2020 ), which is a major concern for the nation. This report insists that Indian industrial community needs to adopt more eco-friendly practices to improve its image globally. In this connection, CE practices allow the Indian leather industry to reduce the adverse environmental impacts and create a more attractive brand in the world market. In this study, five leather companies (TableÂ 5  ) and ten experts (TableÂ 6  ) from Indian leather industries are invited to evaluate the inhibitors to CE practices. In this study, the purposive sampling technique was used. Initially, a total of fifteen experts having profound experience and knowledge in CE practices were approached for this study. However, only ten experts showed interest in sharing their knowledge on CE practices. These ten experts have sufficient working experience in leather industries and they know CE practices. According to LinÂ etÂ al.Â (2016) , a small number of experts would be sufficient in the decision-making analysis if they have more than 10 years of experience in the relevant field. The number of experts used in this study is acceptable. Several earlier studies also used five (Bhatia & Srivastava,Â 2018 ) or fewer experts (Rajesh & Ravi,Â 2015 ). Fig.Â 1   depicts the framework used in the study. 3.3.1 Identification of significant inhibitors In this section, the process of finalizing the inhibitors for further evaluation is explained. First, a systematic literature review (SLR) that identifies, selects, and measures the intended purpose of research was carried out using several keywords: âchallenges/barriers to CE practicesâ AND ârelation between CE practices and SDGsâ AND âbarriers/hindrance to CE practicesâ OR âinhibitors to CE practicesâ OR âdifficulty in implementing CE practicesâ OR âproblems related to CE practices in Indian contextâ. For SLR, various search databases like âGoogle Scholarâ, Science Directâ, âEmeraldâ, âScopusâ, âEBSCOâ, âISI WoSâ, âTaylor & Francisâ, âDOAJâ, âWileyâ and âInderscienceâ were used. The inclusion and exclusion criteria followed in SLR technique is given in TableÂ 7  . The inclusion and exclusion criteria are based on the studies of TranfieldÂ etÂ al.Â (2003)  and Denyer & TranfieldÂ (2009) . Initially, a total of 102 papers were collected. Then, these papers were checked for the suitability of the work to our study. In this stage, 30 papers were rejected for their proxy and repetitive work. Then, the remaining 72 papers were reviewed. Finally, 28 inhibitors of CE practices (TableÂ 3 ) were identified. A survey with the mentioned inhibitors was next carried out with each of the ten experts in two waves, i.e., at two different times. The initial survey was carried out on 13 July 2020. Then, with a two-month gap, the second survey was carried out on 16 September 2020. During these surveys, the experts were asked to analyse whether the identified inhibitors are relevant to CE practices. The reason for carrying the surveys in two different times was to check whether the time influences the significance of inhibitors. They were asked to indicate âYesâ if the inhibitor is accepted and âNoâ if the inhibitor is not relevant. The experts were also asked to suggest any additional relevant inhibitor to CE practices in a leather industry context. Cronbach's Î± value was calculated to check the reliability of the identified inhibitors as it is the most common measure of data reliability (AhmadÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). Generally, Cronbach's Î± value lies between 0 and 1. Mostly, a minimum Î± value of 0.70 is considered a criterion for establishing internal consistency. The calculated Cronbach's Î± value in this study is 0.85. Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin (KMO) test was conducted to measure sampling adequacy. The KMO value lies between 0 and 1. In most case, KMO value between 0.8 and 1 indicates the sampling adequacy (Chang,Â 1996 ). In this case, the KMO value is 0.892, which indicates the samples are adequate. Thus, the reliability and validity of the identified inhibitors to CE practices are justified. At the end of the survey, the experts rejected three inhibitors they felt were obsolete and finalized 25 inhibitors. During this data collection process, the experts who participated in the survey had a different perspective and understanding of CE practices. As the survey was carried out in two different times, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, there were some difficulties in receiving the inputs from the experts. The difficulties resulted in delayed expert inputs. Further, the experts were hesitant in revealing the waste management strategy followed by their respective companies. The final list of inhibitors to CE practices are Lack of CE culture among industries (OI1), Difficulty in reconfiguration of linear system to circular system (OI2), Lack of collaboration among supply chain partners (OI3), Lack of CE framework (OI4), Absence of stringent laws towards CE (RI1), Non-existence of global consensus for CE implementation (RI2), Lack of guidelines for re-manufacturing products (RI3), Lack of financial assistance from government (RI4), Lack of a standard system for measuring the industrial performance with respect to CE (RI5), Cheap cost of virgin materials (MI1), Absence of take-back system (MI2), High upfront investment cost (MI3), Low level of fund for circular business model (MI4), Inability to deliver the same quality as virgin products (TI1), Lack of technologies and technical skills (TI2), Difficulty in integrating various discarded material collectors (TI3), Challenge in safe return to the biosphere (TI4), Design challenge in re-manufacturing products (TI5), Absence of tax exemption (EI1), Lack of financial capability for long-term CE goals (EI2), Stakeholders with short-term agenda (EI3), High cost for establishing eco-industrial environment (EI4), Uncertainty of consumer demand (SI1), Lack of social awareness (SI2), and Lack of market mechanisms for waste recovery (SI3). The selected inhibitors are categorized under six categories (Govindan & Hasanagic,Â 2018 ). The number of inhibitors evaluated in this study is higher than in earlier studies. For instance, a study by MoktadirÂ etÂ al.Â (2020)  analysed eight barriers to CE practices in the leather industry. Another study by RizosÂ etÂ al.Â (2016)  analysed eight barriers and eight CE practices enablers. Similarly, KirchherrÂ etÂ al.Â (2018)  evaluated a total of fifteen barriers to CE practices. Thus, our study contributes to the literature by integrating various inhibitors from previous studies and applying those inhibitors to the leather industry of India.  3.3.2 Analysis of inhibitors with grey-DEMATEL In this phase, the ten experts were asked to make a pair-wise comparison between the inhibitors using the linguistics scale given in TableÂ 8  . The response of the experts is given in (Table A1 of Appendix A of Supplementary Material ). The impact matrix Z   shown in (Table A2 of Appendix A of Supplementary Material ) is computed using Eqs.Â (1) â(3) . Then, the standardized matrix X  is obtained using Eq.Â (4)  as shown in (Table A3 of Appendix A of Supplementary Material ). Comprehensive total influence matrix T   is obtained using Eq.Â (5)  as shown in (Table A4 of Appendix A of Supplementary Material ). Finally, the weight of the inhibitors, degree of relation ( R + C )   and severity of influence ( R â C )    is calculated using Eqs. (6) â (8) as shown in TableÂ 10 .  3.3.3 Evaluating the inhibitors using fuzzy COPRAS Here, the experts are asked to rate the influence of one inhibitor over the others using the scale given in TableÂ 9  . The weight calculated in grey-DEMATEL is used in this phase. By multiplying the weight of the inhibitors with normalized matrix, weight normalized Y   matrix is obtained. The obtained weight normalized matrix is given in (Table B1 of Appendix B of Supplementary Material ). Finally, the relative weight of each alternative and utility degree is calculated using Eqs.Â (17)  and (19)  as shown in TableÂ 11 .    4 Results and Discussion In this section, the results obtained using the grey-DEMATEL and fuzzy COPRAS are discussed in detail. The advantage of using this integrated grey-DEMATEL and fuzzy COPRAS is that with this framework, it is possible to estimate the importance (weight) of each inhibitor in CE practices and it is possible to identify the order in which the constructs need to be addressed. First, the results obtained using the grey-DEMATEL are discussed under four categories: cause, effect, the relation between the inhibitors, and weight. Next, using the fuzzy COPRAS, the key construct that requires immediate attention is identified and discussed in detail. 4.1 Cause group According to Fig.Â 2   and the (R-C) data set given in TableÂ 10  , the causal inhibitors are sorted as follows: RI1>TI1>TI4>RI2>TI2>MI4>OI2>SI1>SI2>RI5>RI3> EI3>MI3>OI1. These inhibitors impact other inhibitors and utmost attention must be given to overcome these inhibitors at the beginning itself. In our study, the inhibitor Absence of stringent law towards CE (RI1) is on the cause group's top level. Countering this inhibitor may assist in lowering other inhibitors. Stringent law towards CE concepts must be framed and enforced by the government and regulatory bodies to curb industrial waste's menace. Stringent laws like cancellation of industrial license and imposing heavy penalties on the circumstance of non-adherence to environmental norms will act as a strong driver in moving industries towards CE practices. This finding was endorsed by the study of AgyemangÂ etÂ al.Â (2019) , which states that the government and concerned regulatory bodies must promote CE policies and enforce laws that mandate CE practices. Regarding CE practices, the Indian government has framed several laws; however, these laws are not powerful enough against the defaulters. To accomplish CE practices, far-reaching changes are needed to be made in the existing laws (VelenturfÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). Next to RI1, the inhibitor TI1 (inability to deliver the same quality as virgin products) must be addressed. The quality of the recycled products is generally inferior to the virgin product. As the material used for recycling is already used, the material has lost its quality and texture. To improve the quality of the recycled products, a better technique must be found. The inferior quality of the recycled products negatively impacts the product among the customers (PhillipsÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). Then, the inhibitor TI4 (a challenge in a safe return to the biosphere) needs significant attention as it determines the CE concept's level of success. As an attempt to combat the waste menace, the concept of CE practices is postulated. However, the challenge in recycling the already used products as the waste generated during the recycling process is found to be more hazardous to the environment. KeijerÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  insist that the special chemical treatment required for recycling products needs to be safe. Failure to devise an improved chemical treatment may prevent beneficial CE practices from being adopted. Next, the inhibitor RI2 (non-existence of global consensus for CE implementation) remains a major bottleneck in CE practice's industrial progress. Realizing CE practice's significance, many countries have formulated and developed different strategies considering their socio-economic conditions. However, the absence of a universal standard results in partial success of CE practices. Hence, a global consensus will increase the feasibility of CE practice's complete success (Prieto-SandovalÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). Likewise, the inhibitor TI2 (lack of technologies and technical skills) also restricts the progress of CE practices. In an emerging economy like India, the road to CE practices is jeopardized by poor knowledge and limited financial assistance (Ghisetti & Montresor,Â 2020 ). Further, poor knowledge of CE practices results in a semi-skilled workforce. What is needed is a broader, more widespread knowledge base of beneficial CE practices and sufficient financial assistance given to the industries that are moving towards those CE practices. Apart from the above discussed five prominent cause inhibitors, the following inhibitors â MI4, OI2, SI1, SI2, RI5, RI3, EI3, MI3, and OI1 â also need immediate attention.  4.2 Effect group Based on the (R-C) data set values given in TableÂ 10  and Fig.Â 2 , inhibitors grouped under effect category are sorted as follows: SI3>MI2>EI2>OI3>MI1>TI3>EI1>EI4>TI5>OI4>RI4. These eleven inhibitors will be easily impacted by causal inhibitors as their (R-C) values are negative. Inhibitors SI3 (lack of market mechanisms for waste recovery) and MI2 (absence of take-back system) occupy the top two positions in the effect category. The SI3 inhibitor, lack of a market mechanism for waste recovery, is the major barrier in CE practices; this lack of market mechanisms for waste recovery is a direct result of the government's poor planning strategy. In developed countries like the US and Germany that are enhanced by high-end technology, a reliable waste recovery network has been established (Marino & Pariso,Â 2020 ). By contrast, India lags far behind when we compare its technological capability to that of developed countries. Because of poor waste recovery mechanisms, the existence of the take-back system is affected (MI2). Knowledge about recovering value from the waste is extremely low among the emerging economies (SlorachÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). As a result, industrial communities in the emerging economies do not emphasise take-back systems. Further, customers have a poor opinion of the product obtained from recovered material. The EI2 inhibitor (lack of financial capability for long-term CE goals) is an important barrier in CE practices. As most of the industries in the emerging economies are SMEs, their financial capability is limited. In assisting the SMEs in CE practices, the role of government is crucial. Hence, the government must financially support the SMEs in carrying CE practices (Aranda-UsÃ³nÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). Giving financial assistance may have a moral impact on industrial performance towards CE practices. Next, inhibitor OI3 (lack of collaboration among supply chain partners) is crucial in the CE practices execution; the parties involved in collecting the discarded material need to be coordinated systematically. Proper and systematic engagement of the multiple partners will assist in the integration of CE practices. Reliable seamless information flow among the supply chain partners will enhance the inclusiveness of CE practices (YadavÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). Inhibitor MI1 (cheap cost of virgin materials) will act as a major obstacle in CE practices progress. In our case, we considered leather industries, so this inhibitor is significantly important. The raw material used in the leather industry is raw animal skin. In India, cattle's presence is abundant; hence, the cost of virgin material used in the leather industry will remain cheap (GuptaÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). In addition to these inhibitors, inhibitors TI3, EI1, EI4, TI5, OI4, and RI4 are needed to be encountered promptly for successful CE practices.  4.3 Relation between the inhibitors Inhibitors with high relation value, i.e., (R+C) value, need to be encountered in the short run as these inhibitors greatly affect other inhibitors and are affected by other inhibitors. Based on the (R+C) values given in TableÂ 10 , the relation between the inhibitors is sorted as follows: SI1>SI2>EI3>TI2>TI4>OI3>MI4>TI5>RI4>OI4>RI1>TI3>SI3>TI1>RI3>EI4>MI3>MI2>RI5>OI1>EI2>RI2>OI2>MI1>EI1. In this case, the inhibitor SI1 (uncertainty of consumer demand) establishes a high degree of relation with other inhibitors. It is known that only consumer demand for a particular product will motivate and encourage the industrial management to manufacture such products in large numbers (RantaÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). Without significant consumer demand for the product, the industries will show no interest in manufacturing such products. As a result of the government's persistent effort to conduct awareness programs, the mindset of customers who prefer recycled products has shifted dramatically towards greater acceptance. However, to secure a better reach and greater endorsement of CE concepts, the government must promote more aggressive initiatives (Bolger & Doyon,Â 2019 ). Then, the inhibitor SI2 (lack of social awareness) needs much attention as it acts as the center of all other CE practices inhibitors. Lack of social awareness implies the drawbacks in the steps taken by the government to promote CE practices. Besides promoting CE practices, financial assistance and tax exemptions for recycled products will give a vital forward thrust (GengÂ etÂ al., 2012 ). Initiatives include amending stringent laws, rewriting guidelines for CE practices, and framing a parameter for measuring CE practice's industrial performance. Similar attention must be given to the inhibitor EI3 (stakeholders with short-term agenda). This inhibitor remains a hurdle in the progress of the industrial community towards CE practices. Any transition takes time for success in the market. Under such a situation, the support of the stakeholders is crucial. Next, the inhibitor TI2 (lack of technologies and technical skills) is a central impediment to adopting CE practices. A deficiency in technical knowledge leads to a shortage of skilled workforce. Without a skilled workforce, developing and adopting a reliable CE practices framework is difficult (Nascimento etÂ al., 2019 ). Further, lack of technological advancement puts into question the safe return of materials to the biosphere (TI4). This challenge violates the intended purpose of the CE concept. Waste generated during the recycling process is more hazardous than industrial waste. To ensure a safe return to the biosphere, using advanced technology is indispensable.  4.4 Weight of inhibitors According to the weight of the inhibitors given in TableÂ 10 , the inhibitor SI1 (uncertainty of consumer demand) occupies the top position. When the demand for recycled products increases, the industries may show interest in developing quality recycled products. So, awareness about recycled products must be created among the public and the public must prefer recycled products. It is commonly known that all manufacturing industries desire a good reputation among the public (KonaduÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). By delivering quality recycled products, the industries may yield a better reputation among the public. Next, inhibitor SI2 (lack of social awareness) also needs immediate attention. For creating awareness among the public, initiatives must be taken by the government and industrial management. Other than initiatives by the government, everyone must be aware of CE practices and the need to conserve nature. Among these initiatives, inhibitor EI3 (stakeholders with short-term agenda) is crucial. Acceptance of new concepts in the market takes some time and may face some initial setbacks. Bearing this in mind, the stakeholders involved in re-manufacturing products need to sustain a long-term visionary approach. GuptaÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  argue that mutual support and coordination among stakeholders play a major role in steering industrial progress towards CE practices. After revealing the relationship between inhibitors, using fuzzy COPRAS, this study intends to identify the predominant area which needs to be strengthened for successful CE implementation. The results obtained using fuzzy COPRAS are given in TableÂ 11  . The rank obtained in fuzzy COPRAS is based on the utility degree of each concerned area. Ranks obtained using fuzzy COPRAS are as follows: SI>EI>RI>TI>OI>MI. Results indicate that social inhibitors (SI) play a critical role in CE practices. Change in the mindset of society may increase the demand for remanufactured products, forcing the industries to develop a better quality product. To change society's mindset, collective efforts from both the government and from industrial society is essential. While it will take some time to bring about a change in society's mindset, that change is much needed. Once the required change is attained, all the related issues will be sorted down. Although this study contributes immensely to the literature on CE practices, it also has some limitations. This study was carried out in the Indian context. Future researchers can undertake a cross-country study. In this study, the interrelationship among the inhibitors was analysed. In future, the role of different inhibitors and their relationships on CE performance may be analysed using the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. Similarly, the DEMATEL technique used in this study may be integrated with the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach. Such integration will reveal both the interrelationships and hierarchical relationships among the inhibitors.   5 Conclusions While the adoption of CE practices could certainly benefit industries in attaining some SDGs, incorporating the same often remains a challenge for the industrial community. In this connection, this study analysed and evaluated the inhibitors to implement CE practices in the Indian leather industry sector. This study contributes to the integration of several inhibitors from the literature into CE practices and it reveals their interrelationships. Further, this study contributes to the existing literature by covering all six dimensions (organisational, regulatory, market, technological, economic, and social). These inhibitors were analysed using a combined grey-DEMATEL and fuzzy-COPRAS technique. The revelation of the interrelationship among the inhibitors provides a better understanding of the relationships among the inhibitors, which will be useful for industrial managers and policymakers. The findings of this study revealed that the uncertainty of consumer demand, lack of social awareness, stakeholders with short-term agendas, lack of technologies and technical skills, and challenge in a safe return of waste to the biosphere are the five most critical inhibitors of CE practices in the Indian leather industry context. The result shows that the uncertainty of customer demand is the most significant inhibitor in CE practices. In addressing this inhibitor, the role of government is crucial. It is the responsibility of the government to promote the benefits of using products developed through CE practices and, by extension, to stress the need for conserving the environment. Similarly, industrial organisations must strive to develop their image around social consciousness. Then, in creating social awareness, the knowledge of CE practices must be fostered among the industries and, more importantly, in society. For this, awareness programs must be created for the society, and stringent environmental laws must be enforced. Finally, giving subsidies to industries that follow CE practices will encourage industries to adopt those CE practices. In this study, the inhibitors to CE practices were identified only by considering the Indian leather industry. Hence, it is difficult to generalize the outcomes of this study. As a future scope of this study and to generalize the findings, a cross-country case study on CE practices might be carried out throughout multiple countries. A study revealing the hierarchical relationship among the inhibitors could be carried out using the ISM approach.
