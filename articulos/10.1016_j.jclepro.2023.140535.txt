                  Multiple cleaner strategies are being devised by governments worldwide to incorporate approaches aligning with sustainable development goals (SDGs), placing particular emphasis on the modal shift from unimodal road to intermodal railroad (IRR) freight transportation. This shift is gaining traction due to its documented positive impact on environmental, economic, and social sustainability. However, adopting IRR freight transportation in emerging economies faces hurdles, primarily attributable to inherent modal shift risks (MSRs). Addressing these MSRs requires the implementation of modal shift solutions (MSSs). This study aims to prioritize the MSSs to mitigate the impact of MSRs in IRR adoption, focusing on achieving SDGs with a case study conducted in the Indian logistics sector. The study is structured into four phases. The first phase identifies 37 sub-MSRs, categorized into seven main MSRs, accompanied by the 39 MSSs for IRR freight transportation adoption. The second phase employs the spherical fuzzy Bayesian best-worst method (SF-BBWM) to assess the relative weights of main and sub-MSRs. The third phase uses the spherical fuzzy C-means clustering (SF-CMC) algorithm to identify crucial MSSs. Finally, the fourth phase utilizes the spherical fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (SF-CODAS) to prioritize these crucial MSSs. From the identified MSSs, pivotal solutions include developing an integrated physical IRR network across the freight transport chain and fostering relationships between stakeholders through long-term contracts and strategic partnerships. The available results are discussed to facilitate logistics stakeholders’ understanding of the implementation of MSSs aligning with SDGs to mitigate the impact of MSRs.

Handling Editor: Giovanni Baiocchi Multiple cleaner strategies are being devised by governments worldwide to incorporate approaches aligning with sustainable development goals (SDGs), placing particular emphasis on the modal shift from unimodal road to intermodal railroad (IRR) freight transportation. This shift is gaining traction due to its documented positive impact on environmental, economic, and social sustainability. However, adopting IRR freight transportation in emerging economies faces hurdles, primarily attributable to inherent modal shift risks (MSRs). Addressing these MSRs requires the implementation of modal shift solutions (MSSs). This study aims to prioritize the MSSs to mitigate the impact of MSRs in IRR adoption, focusing on achieving SDGs with a case study conducted in the Indian logistics sector. The study is structured into four phases. The first phase identifies 37 sub-MSRs, categorized into seven main MSRs, accompanied by the 39 MSSs for IRR freight transportation adoption. The second phase employs the spherical fuzzy Bayesian best-worst method (SF-BBWM) to assess the relative weights of main and sub-MSRs. The third phase uses the spherical fuzzy C-means clustering (SF-CMC) algorithm to identify crucial MSSs. Finally, the fourth phase utilizes the spherical fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (SF-CODAS) to prioritize these crucial MSSs. From the identified MSSs, pivotal solutions include developing an integrated physical IRR network across the freight transport chain and fostering relationships between stakeholders through long-term contracts and strategic partnerships. The available results are discussed to facilitate logistics stakeholders’ understanding of the implementation of MSSs aligning with SDGs to mitigate the impact of MSRs.

In 2015, the United Nations introduced the sustainable development goals (SDGs) for nations to achieve by 2030 through ‘Agenda 2030’ (Subramaniam et al., 2023 ). Additionally, the increasing significance of climate policies has led to the setting of decarbonization targets outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Prioritizing the adoption of environmentally friendly transportation modes is imperative for green growth to attain sustainability and climate objectives. Supply chain and logistics researchers have explored numerous sustainable development strategies to achieve the SDGs (Jouzdani and Govindan, 2021 ). Intermodal railroad (IRR) transportation has gained attention, especially after the European Commission's (2015)  push to shift freight traffic from road to sustainable options like rail and water. IRR freight transportation can be defined as the movement of goods within a single intermodal unit, eliminating the need for handling during mode changes. Currently, the road mode handles most freight traffic, resulting in a 2.2% yearly rise in energy consumption and CO2  emissions (International Energy Agency, 2019 ). In contrast, rail transportation generates lower CO2  emissions, external costs, and congestion (Li and Zhang, 2020 ). Recent research studies have explored the relationships between IRR freight transportation and the three sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social. For example, Halim (2023)  investigated the impact of modal shift action programs, designed at varying levels of ambition, on CO2  emissions and total transportation costs and revealed that modal shift offers both environmental and economic advantages. The transition from road to rail reduces air and noise pollution, road accidents, and traffic congestion and significantly increases government revenue and the overall contribution of IRR freight transportation (Sina Mohri and Thompson, 2022 ). This discussion leads to the research question (RQ): RQ1: How does shifting freight traffic from unimodal road to IRR contribute to achieving elements of SDGs?  While some studies have discussed factors influencing IRR adoption, a few have focused on IRR policies. For instance, Elbert and Seikowsky (2017)  assessed the facilitators and barriers to the willingness to modal shift from unimodal road to IRR freight transport. Kumar and Anbanandam (2020a)  investigated the interrelationships between factors obstructing the adoption of sustainable intermodal freight transportation. Moreover, recent findings highlighted a slow adoption rate of modal shift to IRR in emerging countries such as India and Brazil. The experimental nature and substantial resource investments make logistics managers hesitant towards IRR adoption. These complexities bring up multiple modal shift risks (MSRs) in implementing IRR freight transportation. Moreover, recognizing the most influential MSRs among common ones is imperative, as this awareness can contribute to a smoother modal shift. Additionally, determining the relative significance of these MSRs is crucial for identifying practical solutions aligned with the SDGs. This discussion comes with the question: RQ2: What are the potential MSRs associated with shifting from unimodal road to IRR freight transportation?  To effectively address the MSRs associated with IRR freight transport, practitioners should deploy modal shift solutions (MSSs). The existing literature lacks focus on MSSs to mitigate MSRs. The logistics stakeholders, unfamiliar with IRR freight transportation, may struggle to implement risk mitigation MSSs due to a lack of understanding. Implementing MSSs can efficiently mitigate MSRs related to IRR adoption, highlighting a knowledge gap. Prominent MSSs aligning with SDGs for risk mitigation should be identified and prioritized using decision-making approaches to facilitate IRR adoption in the logistics sector. This discussion ends with the question: RQ3: What are the MSSs necessary to mitigate the impact of selected MSRs for IRR adoption, and how can the most crucial MSSs for achieving SDGs be determined?  To explore research questions RQ2 and RQ3 (RQ1 has already been addressed theoretically), this study examines the Indian logistics sector as a case study to identify essential MSSs for mitigating MSRs during the transition to IRR freight transport, aligning with the overarching SDGs. This analysis employs a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework, incorporating the inputs of decision-makers (DMs). Spherical fuzzy sets (SFS) are integrated into the MCDM approach to ensure input clarity. To address RQ2, this study applies the spherical fuzzy Bayesian best-worst method (SF-BBWM) to assess potential MSRs. To address RQ3, it initially utilizes the spherical fuzzy C-means clustering (SF-CMC) algorithm to identify the crucial MSSs and, finally, employs the spherical fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (SF-CODAS) method to prioritize these crucial MSSs. With these objectives, the primary research highlights include.• Identification of primary MSRs and potential sub-MSRs linked to IRR freight transport.  • Identification of necessary MSSs to mitigate the impact of selected potential MSRs for IRR adoption.  • Prioritization of MSSs to facilitate the successful adoption of IRR freight transport for achieving SDGs, focusing on the Indian logistics sector.    Multiple studies have developed risk assessment frameworks for optimal multimodal transportation. For example, Jiang et al. (2020)  considered the risk aversion level in an uncertain demand environment to investigate multimodal transportation network design problem with CO2  emission reduction target. Moreover, multiple studies have explored risks associated with logistics stakeholders sharing responsibilities for modal shifts to IRR freight transport. For instance, Eng-Larsson and Norrman (2014) , investigated risk-sharing contracts between logistics stakeholders to facilitate effective modal shift to IRR freight transportation. In the Indian context, research studies have assessed IRR inhibitors (Kumar and Anbanandam, 2020a , 2020b ) and sustainability risks (Shankar et al., 2018 ) of freight transportation. However, these studies lack an exploration of the link between MSRs and potential MSSs in the context of IRR freight transport. Despite potential opportunities, no prior research has integrated these identified gaps. Thus, this research introduces novelty by addressing this gap and integrating three phenomena: IRR freight transportation, MSRs, and MSSs. The novel framework contributes significantly both theoretically and practically. First, this study aims to strengthen the association between IRR adoption and SDGs, especially in emerging economies like India, by enhancing understanding of the link between MSRs and MSSs in the modal shift to IRR freight transport. Second, the prioritization obtained in this study facilitates the logistics enterprises to focus on high-ranked MSSs first compared to low-ranked MSSs for successful IRR adoption. Third, this study offers actionable implications from quantitative evaluations, benefiting logistics policymakers and contributing to developing the “PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan”. This article organizes a literature review in Section 2  , research methods in Section 3  , an empirical case in Section 4  , a discussion of obtained results, research implications in Section 5  , and conclusions with limitations and future directions in Section 6  .  2 Literature review This literature review aims to identify gaps in the existing research within the specified area of study. This section initially summarizes the current knowledge about IRR adoption and sustainability. Further, a three-step systematic literature review procedure (Fig. 1  ) is discussed to identify MSRs and MSSs, followed by a research gap analysis. Step 1 includes identifying research articles from the Scopus database, followed by a manual screening in Step 2 and corpus analysis in Step 3. 2.1 IRR adoption and sustainability The recent years have seen a surge in research studies concerning IRR adoption and SDGs separately. Despite the popularity of these topics, a notable scarcity of studies collectively addresses the modal shift to IRR adoption in conjunction with SDGs. The existing literature predominantly focuses on the sustainability aspects of IRR adoption rather than the direct correlation between IRR adoption and specific SDGs. For instance, Kurtulus and Cetin (2019)  employed discrete event simulation to evaluate the environmental advantages of shifting freight transport from unimodal road to IRR, noting a 6.56% reduction in GHG emissions. Pinto et al. (2018)  compared emissions from unimodal road and IRR routes, indicating potential reductions of 77.4%, 43.48% higher fuel efficiency, and up to 80% cost savings. Additionally, creating dry ports alongside rail transport is a vital carbon emission mitigation strategy (Tsao and Linh, 2018 ). Moreover, Nocera et al. (2018)  studied the reduction in external costs, comprising air pollution, noise pollution, congestion, and accidents, by achieving the modal share of 71% road and 29% rail by 2035 along the Brenner corridor. The results showed a 26% decline in external costs from the current level.  2.2 Risks associated with the adoption of IRR freight transport The adoption of IRR freight transport encounters delays amid challenges hindering its success. MSRs are the factors that obstruct the shifting of freight traffic from unimodal road to IRR. Previous studies have explored multiple MSRs by various authors. Shankar et al. (2018)  analyzed sustainability risks in freight transportation to create a risk analysis method ensuring visibility, predictability, and measurability for sustainable systems. Moreover, Kengpol et al. (2014)  recommended a quantitative risk assessment framework by considering six criteria of risks, i.e., freight damage, infrastructure and equipment, political and legislative, operational, environmental, and macro risks, for multimodal freight transportation. Kaewfak et al. (2021)  developed a risk assessment model to identify the optimal multimodal freight transportation route to improve logistics performance. Furthermore, Sears et al. (2022)  analyzed the perceived barriers to the movement of goods in major metropolitan regions of Canada to identify and understand the associated risks. Additionally, Kukulski et al. (2023)  developed a risk mapping method for multimodal transport systems that integrates various factors associated with the timeliness and safety of logistics services. Ahmady and Eftekhari Yeghaneh (2022)  considered the risk of connection disturbances in IRR networks, intending to minimize transportation costs, unsupplied demand, and mode shift. Moreover, Kumar and Anbanandam (2020a)  analyzed operational, technological and infrastructural, knowledge, organizational, government policy and regulations dimensions of inhibitors influencing IRR freight transportation system. Table 1   shows a list of selected 37 sub-MSRs classified into seven main categories of MSRs based on the above literature survey and experts’ consultation.  2.3 Solutions to overcome the MSRs The existence of MSRs impedes the process of transitioning from unimodal road to IRR freight transport. Consequently, MSSs are the proactive measures that must be taken to mitigate the MSRs. Researchers have proposed various diverse MSSs, aiming to overcome the majority of MSRs. Ouedraogo et al. (2022)  suggested solutions to enhance multimodal container supply chain efficiency, emphasizing real-time management to address risks associated with visibility, tracking, and tracing of shipments. Furthermore, encouraging IRR freight transport is boosted by internalizing external costs, enhancing information dissemination, and conducting education, training, and awareness campaigns (Pfoser, 2022 ). Moreover, Rogerson et al. (2021)  proposed a comprehensive solution to mitigate the risks associated with a modal shift by examining the interplay between power and trust between transport service providers and shippers. Eng-Larsson and Norrman (2014) , investigated the role of risk-sharing contracts between a service provider and its intermodal train operator to facilitate effective modal shift to IRR freight transportation. Furthermore, technological solutions are one of the major initiatives to encourage the adoption of rail freight transport (Gonzalez-Aregall et al., 2021 ). Kumar and Kumar (2022)  suggested leveraging digital technologies, such as internet-of-things, to optimize freight train operations for risk mitigation in modal shifts. Additionally, Kumar and Anbanandam (2020b)  analyzed the interrelationships between the inhibitors to adopting IRR freight transport and outlined the key policy recommendations and versatile solutions. Table 2   presents a list of selected 39 MSSs that mitigate impacts of MSRs based on the above literature review and experts’ suggestions.  2.4 Research gap analysis The current literature emphasizes the limited adoption of IRR freight transportation in developing nations. According to Kaack et al. (2018) , rail mode comprises merely 15% of the total freight volume in Brazil. Similarly, Gandhi et al. (2022)  observed that rail transportation handled only 20.36% of the overall freight turnover in India during the fiscal year 2020–21. Nassar et al. (2023)  further underscored the slow progress of the modal shift process, often overlooked, while emphasizing the potential impact on freight dynamics. The reluctance and indecision observed among logistics stakeholders give rise to the MSRs associated with IRR adoption. Determining the intensity of influence of MSRs is crucial for identifying effective MSSs aligning with SDGs, adding substantial value to the modal shift process. In the literature, no research has been conducted that highlights the interrelationship between MSRs and MSSs for modal shift from unimodal road to IRR freight transportation in the context of developing nations. This research developed a framework to bridge this literature gap by prioritizing MSSs aligned with SDGs for mitigating the influence of MSRs associated with IRR freight transportation.   3 Research methods This study proposes a hybrid decision-making framework consisting of four phases, as shown in Fig. 2  .Phase-I:  Identification and finalization of important MSRs and MSSs.  Phase-II:  Evaluation of MSRs' weights using SF-BBWM.  Phase-III:  Clustering of prominent MSSs using the SF-CMC algorithm.  Phase-IV:  Prioritization of MSSs using the SF-CODAS method.  Phases  II, III, and IV include three distinct research methods: SF-BBWM, SF-CMC algorithm, and SF-CODAS method. The integration of these methods is distinctive in this paper, signifying a novel contribution to the literature regarding methodology. This section outlines the rationale and steps involved in their application.    3.1 Spherical fuzzy sets A fuzzy set theory, introduced by Zadeh (1965) , allows DMs to use linguistic terms for opinions and manage vagueness and uncertainties in expressing precise judgments. SFS, a recent extension by Kutlu Gündoğdu and Kahraman (2019) , uses 3D spherical geometry-based fuzzy sets, merging type-II intuitionistic and nuetrosophic fuzzy sets. SFS allow for individual assignment of membership (μ), non-membership (ν), and hesitancy degrees (π) in a broader space, treating the sphere as a volume. This offers a more elegant solution to uncertainty challenges. Definitions and essential SFS operators are detailed in Appendix A  .  3.2 Spherical fuzzy Bayesian best worst method This study utilizes SF-BBWM to assess the weights of MSRs and sub-MSRs. The analytic hierarchy process involves comparing all n  decision criteria, resulting in n(n-1)/2  comparisons; whereas the BBWM requires only 2n-3  reference comparisons with improved reliability, usability, and compatibility with mixed methods (Govindan, 2023 ). Additionally, the best-worst method necessitates running the process m  times for m  DMs to acquire m  weights for each criterion, while BBWM computes the combined weight for each criterion in a single step (Mohammadi and Rezaei, 2020 ). This research introduces the spherical fuzzy version of BBWM, SF-BBWM, addressing ambiguity in human decisions. The technique involves the following steps (Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi et al., 2023a ; Mohammadi and Rezaei, 2020 ).Step 1  Set up decision criteria set C = {c1 , c2 , …, cn } based on literature review and expert inputs.  Step 2  Identify the best (most important) and worst (least important) criterion.  Step 3  Evaluate the preference of best criterion over other criteria using the linguistic variables (Table B1  of Appendix B  ), denoted as ÃB . Next, these pairwise linguistic comparisons are translated into corresponding spherical fuzzy numbers (SFNs) (Eq. (1)  ).   (1) Ã B  = ( ( μ B 1   , ϑ B 1   , π B 1    )  , ( μ B 2   , ϑ B 2   , π B 2    )  , … ,  ( μ B n   , ϑ B n   , π B n    )  )      Step 4  Assess the preference of other criteria over the worst criterion, denoted as Ãw . These pairwise linguistic comparisons are transformed into corresponding SFNs (Eq. (2)  ).   (2) Ã w  = ( ( μ 1 w   , ϑ 1 w   , π 1 w    )  , ( μ 2 w   , ϑ 2 w   , π 2 w    )  , … ,  ( μ n w   , ϑ n w   , π n w    )  )      Step 5  Assess the crisp value from the SFNs by using the prioritization function (PF) (Eq. (3)  ).   (3) P F ( x )  = 10 * μ z  * ( 1 − ϑ x   )  * ( 1 − π x  )      Step 6  Find the optimal weights using ÃB  and Ãw  vectors. The MSRs and sub-MSRs are treated as random occurrences, with weights representing the probability of each event. The multinomial distribution linked to the worst criterion Ãw  is represented by a probability mass function as follows:   (4) P ( A W  ∣ w  )  = ( ∑ j = 1  n   a j W    )  !  ∏ j = 1  n   a j W   !   ∏ j = 1  n   w j a j W         Here, “w” is the probability distribution, “a j W     ” is the superiority of the j th criterion to the worst criterion, and “!” represents the factorial.(5) w j  ∝ a j W   ∑ i = 1  n   a i W     , ∀  j = 1 , … ,  n .         Similarly,(6) w W  ∝ a j W   ∑ i = 1  n   a i W     = 1 ∑ i = 1  n   a i W          Using Eq. (5)  -(6) , one obtains, w j  w w   ∝ a j w   ∀ j = 1 , … , n   . Here, ÃB  essentially provides the inverse of the weight.(7) ( A B  )  ∼ multinominal  ( 1 / w )       Similar to the worst criterion,(8) w B  w j   ∝ a B j   ∀ j = 1 , … , n      The aggregated weights, represented as w *     = (w 1 *    , w 2 *    , …, w n *    ), along with the weights for each DM, w k   where k = 1, …, K , can be acquired by employing the following probabilistic model:(9) ( A B k  ∣ w k   )  ∼ multinominal  ( 1 /  w ) , ∀  k = 1 , … ,  K   ( A W k  ∣ w k   )  ∼ multinominal   ( w k  )  , ∀  k = 1 , … ,  K   ( w k  ∣ w *   )  ∼ Dir   ( γ x w *   )  , ∀  k = 1 , … ,  K γ ∼ gamma  ( 0.1,0.1 )  ,  w *  ∼ Dir  ( 1 )           Furthermore, SF-BBWM offers credal rankings to assess one criterion's preference over another among DMs, utilizing confidence levels.  3.3 Spherical fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm This study pioneers using the SF-CMC algorithm, a fuzzy clustering approach that offers flexible solutions to clustering problems without clear classification boundaries. Clustering algorithms organize data points into clusters based on attribute similarities or dissimilarities using a distance metric. Some data points may be equidistant from multiple cluster centers in practical applications, requiring more refined assignment. To address this, clustering algorithms have expanded to incorporate fuzzy logic, allowing overlapping data points to have varying degrees of membership in multiple clusters, in contrast to conventional algorithms that assign data points exclusively to a single cluster. SF-CMC algorithm optimally assigns each data point's membership to cluster centers using predefined parameters, solving objective functions and constraints, a novel approach in the literature. The SF-CMC algorithm consists of the steps listed below (Hashemi et al., 2023 ).Step 1  Determine the initial decision matrix using linguistic variables (Table C1  of Appendix C  ), assessing each alternative's significance relative to each criterion.   (10) D = ( C j  ( X i  )   )  m × n   = [ H 11   ⋯  H 1 n     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   H m 1    ⋯  H m n      ]      Step 2  Convert linguistic variables to corresponding SFNs (Eq. (11)  ).   (11) D = ( C j  ( X i  )   )  m × n   = [ ( μ 11  , v 11  , π 11   )   ⋯  ( μ 1 n   , v 1 n   , π 1 n    )    ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   ( μ m 1   , v m 1   , π m 1    )   ⋯  ( μ m n   , v m n   , π m n    )     ]      Step 3  Aggregate each DM's evaluations spherical evaluation matrices using Eq. (A8)  .   Step 4  Determine the defuzzied values using the defuzzification operator (Eq. (A9) ).  Step 5  Initialize the algorithm that calculates and stores the membership degrees for each data element.  Step 6  Calculate the fuzzy cluster centers ki , i = 1, 2, …, k using Eq. (12)  -(13) .    (12) u i j   = 1 ∑ p = 1  k   ( ∥ x j  − v i  ∥  ∥ x j  − v p  ∥   )  2 m − 1       w h e r e , 1 ≤ i ≤ k  a n d  1 ≤ j ≤ n         (13) v i  = ∑ j = 1  n   ( u i j   )  m  x j   ∑ j = 1  n   ( u i j   )        where uij  and vi  are the degree to which xj  is a member of the ith cluster and the ith cluster's center, respectively, and m  is a fuzzy parameter that is a real number higher than 1. Also, ∥ x j  − v i  ∥    represents the Euclidean distance norm of xj  and vi .Step 7  Compute the objective function J m   using Eq. (14)  -(15) .    (14) min  J m  ( u , v ; x )  = ∑ i = 1  k   ∑ j = 1  n   u i j  m  ∥ x j  − v i  ∥  2      (15) ∑ i = 1  k  u i j   = 1  ∀ j  , j = 1,2 , … . , n     Step 8  Terminate the algorithm if the objective function falls below the predefined tolerance value (ξ). If not, recalculate the membership matrix using Eq. (10)  .  Proceed to step 2 and run the procedure until ∥ J n e w   − J o l d   ∥ ≤ ξ    is reached.     3.4 Spherical fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment method CODAS, an MCDM technique by Keshavarz-Ghorabaee et al. (2016) , gauges alternative preferences based on their distances from the negative ideal point. Unlike other distance-based MCDM methods (e.g., CoCoSo), CODAS effectively addresses complex decision-making by computing both Euclidean and Taxicab distances from the negative ideal point. It uses Euclidean distance for close distances with a defined threshold and switches to Taxicab distance for larger preferences. Systematically combining favorable and detrimental factors, CODAS is suitable for reflecting the core principles of various MCDM issues, making it notable for its methodical approach to decision evaluation. This study extended the traditional CODAS method to SF-CODAS to address the limitations in handling uncertainty and ambiguity in human judgments. The SF-CODAS consists of the following computational steps (Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi et al., 2023b ): The initial four steps of the SF-CODAS method are similar to those explained in the SF-CMC algorithm (Section 3.3  ).Step 5  Normalize the decision matrix using Eq. (16)  .    (16) Normalized  H i j   = h i j   max j  h i j         Step 6  Develop the weighted normalized decision matrix using Eq. (17)  .    (17) r i j   = w j  * H i j       where, w j     (0 < w j     < 1) represents the weight of the j criterion and ∑ j = 1  n  w j  = 1   .Step 7 Assess the negative-ideal solution for each criterion as shown in Eq. (18)  .   (18) n h  j  = min j  r i j       Step 8  Calculate each alternative's Euclidean and Taxicab distances using Eqs. (19) and (20)  .    (19) E i  = ∑ j = 1  n  ( r i j   − n h  j  )  2        (20) T i  = ∑ j = 1  n  | r i j   − n h  j   |        Step 9  Evaluate a relative assessment matrix using Eqs. (21) and (22)  .    (21) R A = [ F i k   ]  m × m       (22) F i k   = ( E i  − E i k    )  + ( ψ × ( E i  − E i k    )  × ( T i  − T i k    )  )      where, k ϵ {1, 2, …, m} and ψ    represent threshold function as shown in Eq. (23)  .(23) ψ ( r )  = { 1  i f  | r |  ≥ τ ;  0  i f | r |  < τ  }      where, τ    (0 < τ    < 0.05) is a threshold parameter. In this study, we used τ = 0.02   . If the Euclidean distance between two alternatives is less than τ, they are compared using the Taxicab distance.Step 10  Calculate each alternative's evaluation score (Fi) using Eq. (24)  .    (24) F i  = ∑ k = 1  n  F i k       Step 11  Prioritize the alternatives by arranging them in the descending order of evaluation score (Fi ).      4 Assessment and analysis of MSRs and MSSs of IRR freight transportation This study examines the Indian logistics sector for case application. The significance of the Indian logistics sector is described in Section 4.1  , followed by the application of the proposed research framework in the subsequent sections. 4.1 Case illustration In India, the logistics industry is vital to the economy since it provides jobs for more than 22 million people. The Indian transport industry significantly contributed 4.77% to the country's GDP in 2017–18, with road transport being the significant contributor at 3.06%, followed by rail transport at 0.75% only (Ministry of Finance India, 2020 ). However, the logistics sector's transportation costs, constituting 14% of the country's GDP, present opportunities for future development and efficiency improvements compared to developed economies like Germany (8%) and the USA (9.5%) (Express Logistics Industry Report, 2022 ). Despite being the fourth largest rail network in the world, spanning 68,048 route km and handling 872,112 net tonne-km of freight traffic, the contribution of rail mode is only 20.36% in 2020–21 in India. Recently, India joined COP21, which underscores the need for sustainable practices, together with the “PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan” to reduce logistics costs below 10% and balance rail and road modal share by 2032. Moreover, by 2050, the Indian logistics sector will handle 15.6 trillion tonne-km of freight turnover. Failure to implement essential MSSs in India could hinder the adoption of IRR, posing a challenge to achieving the SDGs by 2030. Hence, this research aims to identify and prioritize crucial MSSs for effectively mitigating MSRs in the Indian logistics sector.  4.2 Phase-I: selection and finalization of important MSRs and MSSs The Indian logistics sector must identify and solidify these risks for thorough evaluation and solution implementation. As presented in Fig. 1 , the Scopus database is used to select the MSRs and MSSs. Initial research identified 32 sub-MSRs and 32 MSSs through literature analysis, forming the basis for a questionnaire presented to six diverse DMs representing Indian logistics stakeholders—transport service providers (TSPs), shippers, and Indian Railways officials. Each category included two knowledgeable field experts with at least ten years of industry experience. Upon validation with DMs, the list is extended to 37 sub-MSRs and 39 MSSs (Tables 1 and 2 ). The selected sub-MSRs are organized into seven categories based on DMs consultation, i.e., environmental risks (ENRs), economic risks (ECRs), social risks (SORs), operational risks (OPRs), demand-related risks (DERs), infrastructural & technological risks (ITRs), and government policies & regulatory risks (GPRs).  4.3 Phase-II: assessing weights of MSRs using SF-BBWM This research utilized SF-BBWM, detailed in Section 3.2  , to determine the weights of the main MSRs and sub-MSRs. Initially, the pairwise comparison matrices for main MSRs and sub-MSRs are completed by the same DMs in linguistic terms through a questionnaire and presented in Appendix B  . Here, the criteria weights of main MSRs and local weights of sub-MSRs are derived from the SF-BBWM results (Table 3  ). The sum of criteria weights of the main MSRs or local weights of sub-MSRs in each category is 1. Global weights for each sub-MSR are obtained by multiplying the local weight of a specific sub-MSR with the criteria weight of its corresponding main MSR category, collectively equating to 1. These global weights act as initial weights in the SF-CODAS method. Moreover, the criteria priorities are illustrated by a weighted directed graph (Fig. 3  ), where ITRs (w = 0.2653) demonstrate superiority with a confidence level of 1 over ENRs (w = 0.0587), ECRs (w = 0.1069), SORs (w = 0.0534), OPRs (w = 0.1176), GPRs (w = 0.1576) and confidence level of 0.7 over DERs (w = 0.2406).  4.4 Phase-III: clustering of prominent MSSs using the SF-CMC algorithm This study employed the SF-CMC algorithm, presented in Section 3.3  ,  in the Google Colaboratory platform using the Python programming language. Initially, the questionnaire form is distributed to the same DMs to record the importance of MSSs in mitigating the influence of sub-MSRs in linguistic terms (Table C2 ). The steps presented in Section 3.3   are applied for subsequent calculations. Utilizing four clusters, the algorithm generated membership degrees for each MSS in each cluster and determined cluster centers for all sub-MSRs within each cluster. The weighted Euclidean distances identify the pivotal cluster based on the global weights of sub-MSRs obtained in phase-II. Table 4   illustrates membership degrees for all MSSs. Applying a 0.5 (50%) minimum membership threshold selects 16 MSSs from the top and medium-level clusters to be prioritized in the subsequent phase using the SF-CODAS method.  4.5 Phase-IV: ranking of MSSs to overcome the MSRs using the SF-CODAS method In this stage, the SF-CODAS method ranks the crucial MSSs associated with MSRs. The global weights of sub-MSRs computed using SF-BBWM are employed in this phase. The 16 crucial MSSs identified from the SF-CMC algorithm are considered alternatives, and the sub-MSRs’ global weights obtained from SF-BBWM are considered criteria weights. The same MSSs values associated with the 37 sub-MSRs considered in the SF-CMC algorithm are used in this phase. The procedures outlined in Section 3.4   are employed for subsequent computations. Appendix C   summarizes the SF-CODAS calculations performed with the DMs’ inputs (Table C2 ). The final ranking of MSSs based on evaluation score is presented in Table 5  . The top five MSSs evaluated are MSS4 > MSS25 > MSS1 > MSS11 > MSS35.   5 Discussion The proposed framework offers a systematic approach for industrial practitioners in selecting and implementing the most prominent MSS to mitigate the influence of MSRs. This section validates and discusses the results by providing a rationale based on existing academic literature. Developing an integrated physical IRR network across the freight transport chain (MSS4)  is emerged as the top solution for addressing MSRs. It aligns with previous research on the IRR network's efficacy in mitigating risks from severe weather or unforeseen calamities (OPR3) (Ahmady and Eftekhari Yeghaneh, 2022 ). This solution mitigates the negative impacts of coordination challenges among transport modes (OPR4), service failures (DER1), and also addresses congestion issues (ITR4) and capacity constraints (ITR6) (Kukulski et al., 2023 ). Sustainable IRR infrastructure network designing by internalizing external costs holds the potential to achieve a more equitable distribution between rail and road transport modes. This reaffirms with the results of Ambrosino and Sciomachen (2021)  and Ambrosino et al. (2016) . MSS4 contributes to developing quality, reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure (SDG target 9.1)   and encourages public-private partnerships to construct IRR terminals and DFCs (17.17)  . Hence, this MSS also reinforces the foundation for components of SDGs. Furthermore, this result aligns with the Government of India's (GOI) plan in the “PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan” to establish various dedicated freight corridors (DFCs) and multimodal logistics parks. DFCs can reduce congestion in existing rail networks, increase the share of rail freight traffic, and play a role in decarbonizing the freight transport sector. Establishing relationships between stakeholders through long-term contracts and strategic partnerships (MSS25)  is ranked the second-most vital solution. This solution addresses risks such as varying demands (DER5), and fluctuating revenues (ECR3) by offering stability and predictability in revenue streams and operating expenses (Eng-Larsson and Norrman, 2014 ). MSS25, as highlighted by Shankar et al. (2018) , ensures cost stability for efficient budget planning in freight operations. Also, structured dispute resolution mechanisms mitigate conflicts related to pricing and delivery timeframes (OPR5). Furthermore, MSS25 directly encourages multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial resources (17.16)  . This collaboration fosters an environment of shared responsibility and resource utilization, promoting sustainable practices. The nationwide development of multimodal logistics parks in India will provide multimodal connectivity to more than 1200 industrial clusters, inviting long-term partnerships and pricing contracts between shippers and TSPs. This will also help reduce logistics costs under the GOI's logistics efficiency enhancement program. Establishing seamless digital communication channels among logistics stakeholders (MSS1)  is ranked third. Adopting standardized protocols and digital interfaces enhances system compatibility and interoperability, minimizing system integration failures (ITR3). Also, MSS1 promotes coordination transparency (OPR4) and minimizes miscommunication or delays (OPR6). Implementing collaborative digital platforms facilitates the exchange of critical information, supporting Kaewfak et al.’s (2021)  findings on seamless communication and information sharing. TSPs and shippers can optimize demand and capacity matching by leveraging digital platforms, mitigating the risk of unused capacity (DER3) (Eng-Larsson and Norrman, 2014 ). MSS1 helps diminish operational risks like cargo theft or tampering due to real-time cargo tracking, emphasizing the utilization of advanced information and communication technology (ICT) (17.8)  . Additionally, the recent initiatives by the GOI to establish a unified logistics interface platform, facilitating seamless data exchange among logistics stakeholders, are consistent with this finding. The platform is designed to offer real-time information to all stakeholders, promoting the efficient flow of goods across various transportation modes. Installing advanced ICT hardware within intermodal terminals (MSS11)  is ranked fourth. Robust cybersecurity measures enable counter cyber-attacks and protect information integrity and confidentiality (ITR1). MSS11 promotes seamless data exchange, bolstering interoperability and minimizing integration failure risk (ITR3) (Ouedraogo et al., 2022 ). IRR terminals equipped with cutting-edge technology, such as internet-of-things sensors, predictive analytics, and remote monitoring systems, can be of great assistance in avoiding supply chain disruptions (OPR3) (Kaewfak et al., 2021 ). MSS11 emphasizes enhancing the utilization of enabling ICT (17.8)  , contributing to sustainable practices by improving efficiency and data management in IRR freight transportation. Next, establishing risk-sharing contracts between IRR freight transport chain players (MSS35)  is ranked fifth. Well-defined roles, responsibilities, and expectations minimizes cargo theft (DER2), coordination issues (OPR4), and contractual disputes (OPR5). This aligns with the findings of Kukulski et al. (2023) . Also, risk-sharing contracts establish clear service level agreements and metrics (OPR6), emphasizing multi-stakeholder partnerships for service excellence and reliable delivery (17.16)  . Additionally, implementing these MSSs has a broader impact on various other elements of SDGs. For instance, reducing road traffic accidents (3.6), promoting sustainable transportation systems (11.2), reducing environmental impacts (11.6), integrating climate change measures (13.2), and improving awareness and capacity for climate change (13.3).   Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is a crucial tool to assess the stability and reliability of the results. It ranks the MSSs (alternatives) with the change of criteria (sub-MSRs) weights. In this study, a total of 37 cases are tested. The weights of sub-MSRs kept “tremendously high” (TH) one by one while keeping the weights of other sub-MSRs low or equal. For instance, in case 1, the weight of ENR1 is allocated TH, and the remaining sub-MSRs (ENR2-GPR6) weights are assumed to be equal. Details of all cases are presented in Table D1  (Appendix D  ). MSS4 consistently ranked first in all 37 cases, and MSS25 achieved the second rank in 36 cases (Figs. 4 and 5   ). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated, showing a strong association (average value of 0.9821) between the final ranking and sensitivity analysis cases. 5.1 Implications of the research This research work substantially contributes to the theoretical and practical dimensions of the Indian logistics sector. The subsequent sections thoroughly examine its significance for managers, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers, highlighting its relevance and applicability. 5.1.1 Implications for practitioners and managers The findings of this study offer various practical solutions for logistics managers and practitioners. First, the managers need to focus on controlling the highest-weighted sub-MSRs. SF-BBWM results highlight that competition hinders IRR adoption, particularly from road transportation. Thus, managers should incorporate external costs internally in IRR network planning as part of a decarbonization strategy for sustainable development. Second, private enterprises should coordinate with the government to implement cleaner production initiatives, such as developing rail connections between major ports and nearby dry ports or IRR logistics parks. Third, IRR terminal operators can enhance rail accessibility to shippers by establishing numerous IRR logistics parks. Fourth, IRR freight transportation companies should offer strategic partnerships to logistics shippers that provide stability in demand, revenue, and operating expenses. Fifth, IRR terminal operators can make their services more efficient and appealing through digital communication channels, advanced ICT hardware, and risk-sharing contracts for transshipment.  5.1.2 Implications for researchers This study provides significant insights and implications for the research community. This study is the first to integrate three phenomena: IRR freight transportation, MSRs, and MSSs. This integration would facilitate researchers in thoroughly exploring the suggested theoretical framework for the swift attainment of SDGs through adopting a modal shift from unimodal road to IRR freight transportation. Next, this study integrates three distinct methods, SF-BBWM, SF-CMC, and SF-CODAS, with the case application in the Indian logistics sector. Each method has been used in different stages to prioritize MSSs to mitigate the impact of MSRs. The proposed framework can be used as a benchmark for examining the country specific MSRs and MSSs in other emerging countries.  5.1.3 Implications for policymakers Policymakers can utilize the study results to establish focused policies that address the specific MSRs and MSSs of modal shift implementation. First, government policies and regulatory risks are recognized as significant MSRs, which signifies that government support is crucial for the modal shift from unimodal road to IRR freight transportation. Second, the modal shift from unimodal road to IRR freight transportation will primarily contribute to the decarbonization of the logistics sector, combating climate change and its impacts. For example, successfully mitigating top weighted sub-MSRs will contribute to achieving global missions such as SDGs by 2030 and national targets such as equal modal share between rail and road by 2032. Third, government policymakers may suggest policy measures, including private partnerships, to enhance DFC connectivity and port-hinterland rail connection.    6 Conclusions This study aligns with the global pursuit of SDGs, focusing on shifting freight traffic from unimodal road to IRR transportation. Adopting IRR freight transport is accompanied by various MSRs that hinder its successful implementation. The implementation of suitable MSSs can overcome the negative influence of these MSRs. This study offers a novel hybrid framework comprising of four phases to prioritize the MSSs aligning with SDGs that mitigate the influence of MSRs in the Indian logistics sector. In the first phase, 37 sub-MSRs and 39 MSSs are finalized from the Scopus database using a literature survey and DMs' consultation. In the second phase, SF-BBWM is employed to evaluate the main and sub-MSRs weights of IRR adoption. In the third phase, the SF-CMC algorithm is applied to identify 16 crucial MSSs. Next, in the fourth phase, SF-CODAS method is utilized to prioritize these crucial MSSs to mitigate influential MSRs of IRR adoption. The results suggest that developing an integrated physical IRR network (MSS4) and fostering long-term contracts between stakeholders (MSS25) as top MSSs for mitigating MSRs. Further, the sensitivity analysis showed a strong correlation, supported by the average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, emphasizing the reliability and stability of the proposed framework. The primary contribution of this study involves introducing a hybrid framework to prioritize MSSs, aiming to address significant MSRs and achieve SDGs. The present research provides a vital roadmap for academicians, industry practitioners, and government institutions through managerial implications. This paper highlights the significance of addressing MSRs for a modal shift to IRR freight transportation. The present research outcomes would facilitate logistics stakeholders to pinpoint the key MSSs for mitigating MSRs. Industrial practitioners and government policymakers should focus on top-ranked MSSs to mitigate the dominating MSRs and improve the effectiveness of IRR adoption. Adoption of these MSSs also collectively contributes to achieving SDGs, including reducing road traffic accidents (3.6), developing high-quality infrastructure (9.1), advancing sustainable transportation systems (11.2), minimizing environmental impacts (11.6), integrating climate change measures (13.2), and enhancing awareness and capacity for climate change (13.3), leveraging advanced ICT (17.8), promoting multi-stakeholder collaborations (17.16), and fostering public-private partnerships (17.17). 6.1 Limitations and future directions This study has limitations that can present opportunities to the research community for future research. First, the findings of this study rely on the inputs of the DMs from the Indian logistics sector. This may limit the ability to apply the study's conclusions to contexts outside India directly. The dynamics, challenges, and preferences of DMs in other countries or regions might differ from those in India. However, this limitation is mitigated by suggesting that the framework developed in this study can be adapted and modified for application in other developing nations. Second, the interconnections between MSSs indicate that implementing a specific MSS may trigger a ripple effect on other solutions. For instance, introducing a digital connectivity solution (MSS1) might affect information flow and have implications for security protocols (MSS11). Hence, future research could use methods like interpretive structural modelling to explore interdependencies among MSSs.
