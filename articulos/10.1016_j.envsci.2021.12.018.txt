                  In a world faced with constant and varied sustainability challenges, local communities stand at the forefront of global sustainability efforts. What happens at the local level may affect the larger social and environmental systems. Meanwhile, global environmental impacts are also experienced locally. The current global sustainability agenda, Agenda 2030, calls for local action to realise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, we have limited understanding of what enables and constrains local action, particularly in the context of the challenges related to trade-offs between goals, the complexity and uncertainty embedded in the social and environmental systems, and the necessity to align efforts with multiple levels of governance. In this paper, we aim to synthesise lessons learnt from the application of a previous major local sustainability agenda, Local Agenda 21 (LA21), to inform local action for the SDGs. Using a systematic review of 87 empirical cases of LA21 all around the world, we find that availability of reliable resources, supportive planning and policymaking practice, competent local actors, and trust between local actors appear most frequently as enablers of local sustainability processes in the context of LA21. In the end, we discuss the implications of these findings for SDGs implementation at the local level.

Because there is a growing recognition that many important decisions in sustainable development strategies, often tangled in a complex multi-level governance system, are taken at the local level (Lafferty and Eckerberg, 2013; Leck and Simon, 2013 ), it is crucial to strengthen local sustainability efforts. This urgency resonates with the call for consolidated bottom-up actions within the current global sustainable development agenda—the Agenda 2030. Set by the United Nations (UN) in 2015, the Agenda 2030 consists of 17 integrated global goals called the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Five years since the inception of the SDGs, numerous initiatives to embed them into local sustainability strategies have emerged in various scales and forms. Some are featured in international platforms or networks, such as the UN’s ‘Local2030: Localising the SDGs’ and the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)’s annual reports of local and regional governments’ actions to ‘localise the SDGs.’ Looking at those platforms, localising the SDGs manifests in various forms of adoption, from the incorporation of the goals into local development policy and planning, streamlining ongoing programmes by adopting some of the goals, using the goals and targets as benchmarking and planning tools, to raising general awareness about SDGs themes among the local population. To promote bottom-up local actions for the SDGs, scholars, and practitioners also call for joint efforts of multiple actors called the Local Agenda 2030 (Moallemi et al., 2019 ). This agenda recognises the need to incorporate a participatory and inclusive governance approach to realise the SDGs, involving local and national government, civil society, business, NGOs, researchers, and scientists. To turbocharge local sustainability strategies at the community level, we need to consider what actions and arrangements enable and constrain local sustainability processes from experience. Before the SDGs, the most prominent experience of local communities’ adoption of a global sustainability framework was the Local Agenda 21 (LA21) (ICLEI, 1997; Walker, 2002 ), a part of the United Nations’ non-binding action plan, the Agenda 21. LA21 called for local authorities all worldwide to have a participatory, multi-sectoral process to address local sustainable development concerns. Among a range of past local sustainability frameworks, LA21 was the closest one to the concept of SDGs, which are global in its implementation, directed to a broad range of relevant actors, and encompass social, environmental, and economic aspects in their understanding of sustainability issues. Other past local sustainability frameworks were either meant for specific regions (e.g., European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign) or specific aspects of sustainability issues (e.g., Cities for Climate Protection Campaign) (Rok and Kuhn, 2012 ). According to a report by International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability report in 2002, 6400 local governments in 113 countries have been engaged in at least a form of activity identified as LA21 actions, though the majority of these local governments were from high income countries and 80% were from Europe (Walker, 2002 ). Due to its voluntary nature, LA21 relied on local authorities' capability and motivation to initiate and proceed with LA21 action. Comprehensive studies of lessons learnt from LA21 all around the world are so far very limited. We found two studies analysing LA21 experiences at the global level: a systematic review of LA21 processes worldwide conducted by Echebarria et al. (2018)  investigating the perception of sustainable development within LA21 processes and the main drivers of the processes, and a study by Owen and Videras (2008)  analysing the role of trust and cooperation in the implementation of LA21, sampling approximately 66 countries worldwide. This scarcity of comprehensive lessons learnt studies of LA21 processes could be attributed to the absence of integrated parameters and mechanisms to evaluate LA21 overall results. LA21 was designed to be flexible so as not to dictate the timeline, targets, types of activities, and monitoring and evaluation mechanism for local authorities (Caruana and Pace, 2018; Selman, 1998 ). Though criticised, this accentuation on process can be seen as an attempt to establish the ecosystem that will give the local actors a “capacity for continuance” and “a self-perpetuating internal dynamic” (Selman, 1998 , 541) for sustainability efforts. However, as the consequence, lessons from LA21 experiences were scattered and anecdotal—outlined in a number of empirical studies on regional and national scales. The objectives within the mandate of LA21, outlined in the two-page chapter 28 of Agenda 21, were to be achieved through the following elements: a consultative process with the local populations and consensus building, a dialogue with citizens, representation of women and youth in decision making, planning and implementation, partnerships among relevant organs and organisations, implementation and monitoring of the programmes, increased levels of cooperation and coordination among representatives of local authorities, and human resource development and capacity building. Outside of the above elements, it was up to each local authority to decide what LA21 program consisted of, what needed to be achieved and how, as well as how to measure them (Barrett et al., 2002; Voisey et al., 1996; Ward, 1996 ), though other actors such as ICLEI and Commonwealth Government had published guidelines and reports for LA21 implementation with additional emphasis on elements such as ‘addressing priority local sustainability development concern’ and ‘cross-jurisdiction networking with other local authorities’ (Barrett and Usui, 2002 ; Cotter and Hannan, 1999 ; ICLEI, 1997 ). Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by presenting the lessons learnt in LA21 processes based on empirical cases and discussing them in the context of the current sustainable development agenda, the SDGs. Here we ask two questions: 1) what enables and constrains LA21 processes? 2) what can be learnt from them to inform local sustainability process in the context of the SDGs? Through the findings and discussions provided in this paper, we hope to inform relevant actors working towards local sustainability of what key action design and arrangements they need to consider and what cautions they need to be aware of.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 The elements of Local Agenda 21 process Drawing from all the referenced literature above, we list the following points as the key elements in an LA21 process, which we use to identify enablers and constraints of LA21 processes:1. Participatory process : a consultative or engagement process with the wider public or community members. While the interpretation of what counts as a consultative and/or engagement process and who are involved may differ across communities (Cornwall, 2008 ), this element points to any efforts within an LA21 process that promoted a more pluralistic approach.  2. Multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder partnerships : the cooperation between various stakeholders, both within and outside local governments, in different sectors. This cooperation may include stakeholders dialogue, cross-sector communication, joint implementation of projects, or policy coordination.  3. LA21 action(s) : all activities conducted on behalf of the LA21 process, including a pilot sustainability project, formation of an LA21 steering committee, or a publication of a community vision document or action plan.  4. Achieve the local and global sustainability goal of Agenda 21 : the addressing of local sustainable development concerns and how they contributed to global sustainability. In this case, the link between environmental, economic, and social objectives is particularly emphasised.  5. Long-term perspective : strategic arrangements that supported the continuation of sustainability actions within and beyond LA21 scope.  6. Cross-jurisdiction networking : increased levels of cooperation and coordination among representatives of local authorities to enhance the exchange of information and experience  7. Capacity building of local actors : the strengthening of local actors’ knowledge, skills and experience in community organising and/or sustainability issues.     2.2 Systematic review This study employed a systematic review of Local Agenda 21 cases. A systematic review was used to answer specifically-defined questions from a limited number of studies (Arksey and O'Malley, 2005 ). In this paper, we used the method from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)’ checklist (Moher et al., 2009 ), with the following steps:• Identify relevant literature using specific search strings.  • Screen the list of relevant literature using exclusion criteria.  • Full-text screen to assess the eligibility, resulting in a list of included studies.  • Qualitatively analyse the included studies to answer the research questions.    This systematic review was intended to find out the enablers and constraints of local sustainability processes within the scope of LA21 using its key elements. A Scopus database search of peer-reviewed articles and book chapters written in English was conducted on March 2020 using the search term “Local Agenda 21”, resulting in 290 studies. Given that studies of LA21 were contributed by scholars from various disciplines, Scopus database was chosen in this study for its coverage of wide-range disciplines (Falagas et al., 2008 ). An abstract screening was conducted using software called Covidence to manage systematic reviews and subsequently exclude those deemed irrelevant. The software automatically excluded two studies that were duplicated, resulting in 288 studies being abstract-screened. A study was included during the abstract screening if it incorporated empirical cases of Local Agenda 21 implementation, including individual case studies and comparison or survey of various case studies. This study excluded papers that discussed LA21 only on a conceptual level. When it was unclear whether a study had empirical aspects of LA21, we included it to be fully read before deciding. This abstract screening yielded a total of 195 studies, which then were assessed for eligibility through full-text screening ( Fig. 1 ). Studies were included if they discussed or mentioned what enabled or constrained any of the seven key elements in the LA21 implementation process. We identified a condition/situation as an enabler when it was reported to help certain key elements be enacted, achieved, or strengthened. Similarly, a condition/situation was a constraint when it was reported to obstruct or impede the achievement of certain key elements. It is important, however, to clarify that the relationship between the key elements and the enablers/constraints in this case is an associative one rather than causal. In other words, we acknowledge that there could be other factors, in addition to those enablers and constraints, that lead to a certain condition in LA21 processes. To ensure a rigorous screening process, studies that were considered more complex were read multiple times. One hundred twenty-one studies were excluded for the following reasons: full-texts were not in English, full-texts were not available to us (both online and offline), duplication that was missed by the software, and did not incorporate empirical lessons of LA21. The final number of included studies was 74. Some of these studies discussed more than one empirical cases of LA21. In total, 87 cases of LA21 were included in this systematic review.  2.3 Analysis The enablers and constraints of LA21 key elements identified in the included studies were extracted into a charting table. The list of enablers and constraints was firstly sorted from the highest (i.e., most frequently appear) to the lowest. This gave an overview of the conditions, arrangements, or interventions that were observed to influence LA21 processes. The enablers and constraints in the charting table were then qualitatively analysed to answer the research questions. During the analysis, similar enablers and constraints in each of the key elements were grouped together. As shown in the following section, this yielded a list of enablers and constraints for each LA21 key element. While extracting data, we observed that a condition/situation could be both an enabler and a constraint depending on the language used. For example, ‘having reliable funding’ is an enabler but can be a constraint if worded as ‘lack of reliable funding.’ We decided to use the wording used in their original studies. In the following section, enablers and constraints are presented side-by-side to enable readers to understand the key elements’ whole picture.   3 Results Almost two-thirds of the studies were located in Europe. Studies in Asia and Oceania included 14% and 10% of the total studies, respectively. LA21 studies from Africa (7%) and America (6%) region had the smallest percentage. In line with LA21’s focus on local authority, these studies used sub-national administrative entities as the unit of analysis. It is important to note that the scope of ‘local implementation’ of LA21 had various interpretations (Caruana and Pace, 2018; Echebarria et al., 2018 ), which spanned multiple sub-national administrative levels, including municipalities, cities, provinces, and states. Certain countries in the studies used certain administrative entities based on their specific jurisdiction systems, such as Japan (prefecture), Germany (city-states/Stadtstaaten, state/Länder), the United Kingdom (borough), and Australia (suburb). Across the key elements (see Materials and method section), the final number of enablers and constraints varied from 2 to 16. Some of the studies highlighted several key elements and did not include meaningful discussion about the rest. It was observed that key elements 1–4 were generally more discussed, resulting in more enablers and constraints, while key elements 5–7 were less discussed. The following tables show the top 5 most discussed enablers and constraints of each of the key LA21 key elements. The enabler of participatory processes in LA21 with the most frequent occurrence was the LA21 organisers’ effort to design the process in an open, more flexible way without losing the focus on action ( Table 1 ), for example, holding meetings in different public places such as community centres and markets (Astleithner and Hamedinger, 2003 ), separating citizens’ forum from politicians’ forum (Martinez and Rosende, 2011 ), and avoiding formal one-off events (Scott, 1999 ). Participatory processes were also enabled by various channels of participation for different segments of communities, such as study groups for officials (Jörby, 2002 ), forums for grassroots groups (Feichtinger and Pregernig, 2005; Novy and Hammer, 2007 ), and brainstorming teams consisting of citizen groups’ representatives (Jörby, 2002 ). Ensuring that members of local governments understand the significance and scope of LA21, innovative methods of participation and targeted outreach and involvement strategy to under-represented groups were also among the identified enablers of participatory processes in LA21. On the other hand, participatory processes in LA21 were inhibited by local governments’ persisting top-down values and practices (Table 1 ). An example identified in a number of LA21 implementations (Jörby, 2002 ; Barrett and Usui, 2002 ; Barrutia et al., 2007 ) was a narrow, one-sided flow of information between the local authority and citizen that rarely involved participation in the decision-making process. There were varied circumstances behind these persisting top-down practices. In the LA21 implementation in Gloucestershire (Selman, 1998 ), councillors were impatient with the innovative but lengthy approach of LA21, preferring methods like questionnaires that have ‘quick payback’ and 'value for money'. In the case of LA21 in Portugal (Schmidt et al., 2006 ), the country was a latecomer democracy where top-down practices were still very much entrenched in public administration practice. Aside from persisting top-down practices, a passive citizenry with a lack of incentives to actively participate was also one of the most significant constraints of the participatory process in LA21. In rural Portugal municipalities, communities were too preoccupied with providing basic amenities and infrastructure that a newly-introduced local sustainability programme did not attract enthusiasm (Carter et al., 2000 ). In Lancashire, a possibility of competition with a similar local strategy evoked a feeling of uncertainty about the long-term guarantee of LA21, subsequently demotivating people involved in the process (Jonas et al., 2004 ). Finally, other top constraints of the participatory process in LA21 were the domination of certain groups (cliques in local board, professionals, ‘old faces’ in civic organisations) in public meetings, the lack of financial and technical resources, and distrust between the local government and the public. This element was most frequently enabled by intermediary actors who facilitated collaboration between different stakeholders and entities ( Table 2 ). These intermediary actors included non-profit organisations (Barrett and Usui, 2002 ), regional governments (Barrutia et al., 2007 ), local councils (Worthington et al., 2003 ) or ad-hoc working groups (Sancassiani, 2005 ). Another frequent enabler was the representation of the partnering groups by competent and action-oriented people, as showcased, among others, in Leicester (Roberts, 2000 ) and Petaling Jaya (Mokhtar and Dali, 2017 ). A multi-sectoral partnership was also enabled by an established communication interface for communication and negotiation between different departments and organisations (Astleithner and Hamedinger, 2003; Feichtinger and Pregernig, 2005; Tuts and Cody, 2000 ), political and financial incentives for participating organisations (Llamas-Sanchez et al., 2013; Khakee, 2002 ), and a clear partnership arrangement at the beginning of the process (Barrutia et al., 2007 ; Roberts, 2000 ; Jörby, 2002 ). The absence of a legal, institutional and financial framework to help coordinate multi-sectoral partnerships was the greatest constraint for this key element. These frameworks were essential for authorities with huge administrative bodies (Astleithner and Hamedinger, 2003 ), compartmentalised internal structure (Ward, 1996 ), and limited common programmes across all departments (Echebarria et al., 2004 ). In line with the last point of enabler in previous paragraph (the existence of a clear partnership arrangement), its absence and partiality become the second-biggest constraint of multi-sectoral partnership. Reported issues related to this include incoherence of the overall programmes (Carter et al., 2000 ), time wasted for unnecessary discussion (Roberts, 2000 ), and LA21 programme gaining a bad reputation as an additional task to avoid (Patton and Worthington, 1996 ). A clash of interests and values between local actors also became a barrier to partnership. For example, in two suburbs of Blacktown and Ipswich in Australia, partnerships were difficult when pro-growth politicians, business actors, and landowners disagreed with the LA21 programme vision (Bajracharya and Khan, 2004 ). The lack of established collaborative relationships among different stakeholders, such as interdepartmental projects or engagement with local businesses (Fidelis and Pires, 2009; Khakee, 2002 ), and distrust between local actors also hampered partnerships. The two top enablers of LA21 actions in the studies were strong local leadership and adequate supports from national and/or regional government ( Table 3 ). The strong leadership was showcased by local politicians, mayors, or councillors through enthusiasm, long-term commitment, and early awareness of sustainability issues despite their unfamiliarity with LA21 (Barrutia et al., 2007 ; Fidelis and Pires, 2009 ; Douglas, 2014 ; Ward, 1996 ). The supports for local authorities to implement LA21 came from state governments or regional government, such as the European Union (EU), in the form of political endorsements, local investments, alignments with national programme, or technical supports that facilitated the sharing of methodologies and best practices about LA21 (Guerra et al., 2019; Hordijk, 1999; Jörby, 2002; Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998; Ward, 1996 ). Conducive political situations and policymaking practices also drove LA21 actions in many places, including the coincidence of LA21 initiation with the rise of local environmental policy activism, a region-wide policy mainstreaming of sustainable development, and the coalition between red and green parties in local governments (Evans and Theobald, 2003 ; Kern et al., 2007 ; Ward, 1996 ). Strategies focusing on tangible benefits to stimulate LA21 action, such as small-scale ‘demonstration projects’ or the promotion of LA21 as creating employment or strengthening local identities, were also listed as important enablers (Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998; Tuts and Cody, 2000 ). Finally, reliable resources in the forms of funding, baseline information, and expertise were also important enablers of LA21 actions (Tuts and Cody, 2000 ; Kern et al., 2007 ; García-Sánchez and Lorenzo, 2009 ). The lack of financial, technical, and human resources was the most frequent barrier of LA21 actions (Table 3 ). Due to a lack of budget, many LA21 officers hired by local governments were either non-permanent, on low salaries, or in relatively junior positions (Leslie and Hughes, 1997; Scott, 1999 ), affecting the overall handling of LA21 programmes. The lack of updated data related to sustainable development and an integrated database system (El Massah, 2016 ) also hindered local governments from deciding on what programmes to do and how to measure their progress. In certain cases, this lack of financial resources were linked to local or national circumstances such as a national debt crisis, national budget deficit, and low revenue base of municipalities (Guerra et al., 2019; Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998; Steinberg and Miranda, 2005 ). Aside from the lack of resources, LA21 actions were also constrained by the absence of legal frameworks and policy integrations. Local authorities reported difficulties in implementing LA21 when there was no statutory backing, policy initiatives, or coordinated programme at the supra municipal level (Carter et al., 2000 ; Bajracharya and Khan, 2004 ; Barrutia et al., 2007 ; Schmidt et al., 2006 ; Crilly et al., 1999 ). Even when local authorities managed to start LA21 initiatives and were enthusiastic about it, their performance was deterred by local actors' lack of experience and expertise in sustainable development, as reported in some studies (Voisey et al., 1996; Gram-Hanssen, 2000 ; Hordijk, 1999 ; Knight, 2000 ). Weak political commitments from national and local government, such as sending minor officials to meetings and making limited attempts to synchronise local policies with LA21 visions, also constrained LA21 actions (Harvold, 2003; Sancassiani, 2005 ). Finally, LA21 actions were hindered by insufficient intersectoral cooperation and collaboration, e.g. governments at different levels compete to implement LA21 and work separately, leading to duplications and waste of resources (Echebarria et al., 2009; Selman, 1998 ). Launching an LA21 action did not automatically mean addressing sustainable development concerns at the local and global levels. For example, as reported by Moser (2001)  and Feichtinger and Pregernig (2005) , the LA21 processes in Helsingborg and Mörbylånga majorly consisted of small-scale or single projects that were aimed to achieve small successes and to avoid complex sustainability issues. The cases in our studies suggested that having cohesive participation and collaborations helped address local and global sustainability concerns perceived by local actors ( Table 4 ). This process meant involving diverse stakeholders who were consistently engaged (Barrett and Usui, 2002 ; Douglas, 2014 ) and reaching political consensus to resist counterproductive policies in the LA21 process (Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998 ). Another enabler was specific regard to balance all sustainable development pillars during the LA21 process, which Agenda 21 outlined as the environment, economic, and social pillar. This specific regard to a balanced view of sustainable development was especially important, taking into account that LA21 had been predominantly understood as an environment-centred agenda such as waste reduction, water and air quality management and pollution control (Aall, 2012, 2000; Jörby, 2002; Douglas, 2014; Tuxworth, 1996 , Echebarria et al., 2004 ), hence limiting the extent of its impact to the overall well-being of local communities. Failure to integrate ongoing LA21 actions into the policy and planning structure, both at the national and local level, was one of the ultimate constraints to achieving local and global sustainability (Table 4 ). In four Sweden municipalities, despite running, the LA21 initiatives were eventually unable to contend with non-sustainable practices which had deeply embedded in local infrastructure planning (Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998 ). Another example is LA21 actions in Brazil, where there was a disconnection between the national rainforest management apparatus and the ongoing LA21 scheme to protect rainforest (Guerra et al., 2019 ). Aside from that, progress in local sustainable development issues was constrained when LA21 implementation was partial and insignificant, particularly when the scale of the projects was small (Jörby, 2002 ; Geissel, 2009 ), the processes were too far removed from the broader struggles for social justice (Charles and Thomas, 2007 ), the actions did not go far beyond awareness campaign (Mercer and Jotkowitz, 2000 ), and the LA21 actions only covered new big projects. They did not cover day-to-day activities, such as the maintenance of infrastructure and procurement (Schneider et al., 2018 ). Substantial progress was also prevented by local actors’ clash of values and principles with the LA21 vision, such as local councils favouring development projects (Bajracharya and Khan, 2004 ) and local communities resisting LA21 project because they believe it curbed their ‘freedom’ (Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998 ), for example by limiting the use of private cars through transportation policies. Progress was also hindered when commitment to LA21 was not accompanied by clear, well-defined goals and operationalisation mechanism of the agenda (Douglas, 2014; du Plessis, 2011 ) as well as community's capacity to implement them (Sofroniciu, 2005 ; El Massah, 2016 ). A long-term perspective was enabled by specific institutional arrangements such as a permanent eco-community forum (Barrett and Usui, 2002 ), a long-term partnership with charities to ensure sustainable funding (Roberts, 2000 ), the hiring of permanent staffs (Selman, 1998 ) and the efforts to document the whole LA21 process for future references (Roberts and Diederichs, 2002 ) ( Table 5 ). The involvement of educational institutions such as schools and daycare centres also enabled the perspective that the LA21 processes, and subsequently the sustainable development efforts, were to be conducted for the long run (Jörby, 2002 ). Knowing that organisational dynamics and local political change might have disrupted LA21 continuation, some of the LA21 officers, such as in Durban and Southeast England, deliberately secured widespread support and legitimacy in advance before their terms ended (Roberts and Diederichs, 2002; Sharp, 2002 ). The greatest constraint to a long-term perspective in LA21 processes was the absence of the mechanism to mainstream and integrate LA21 into the policy structure (Table 5 ). One of the examples was Vienna, where the LA21 process ended up as small projects that were not built on and integrated within a broader, more lasting programme (Feichtinger and Pregernig, 2005 ). The unavailability of long-term financial supports (Hordijk, 1999 ; Evans and Theobald, 2003 ), the loss of momentum to mainstream LA21 into a continuous process (Martinez and Rosende, 2011 ; Fidelis and Pires, 2009 ), the dynamic of political and organisational landscape (Kern et al., 2007 ; Lizama-Pérez et al., 2018 ), and the fading enthusiasm of LA21 participants during the process (Aall, 2000 ) were other constraints to a long-term perspective in LA21 processes. Cross-jurisdiction networking was enabled most by the establishment of a dedicated LA21-coordinating organisation at the regional, national, or global level ( Table 6 ). Some of the initiatives to create mutual learning platform came from state government (Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998 ) or global campaigns like ICLEI’s Model Community Program (Selman, 1998 ). Another enabler was the provision of incentives in the form of money-related complements and recognitions for those participating in the network (Barrutia and Echebarria, 2012 ). In certain cases, such as in Vienna and Sweden municipalities, local actors (civil servants, NGOs) pushed local authorities to participate in LA21 networks (Astleithner and Hamedinger, 2003; Eckerberg and Forsberg, 1998 ). Cross-jurisdiction networkings were hindered by local authorities’ own reluctance to network (Table 6 ). This happened, for example, when local authorities felt capable enough to implement LA21 in terms of financial resources and political means (Guerra et al., 2019 ). Aligned with the highest-ranked enabler, the absence of an established platform to network with other municipalities hindered the networking in LA21 processes. Beyond that, the lack of information regarding access to local government networks and experience sharing opportunities also prevented local authorities from fostering networks with each other. The most frequent enabler of the local actors’ capacity building in LA21 processes was the availability of resources and opportunities ( Table 7 ). In Basque, the regional government provided a web-page dedicated to assisting local officers in implementing LA21, in addition to free consultation calls to LA21 experts at the regional level (Barrutia et al., 2007 ). Opportunities to work with research groups, as what happened in Durban (Mehta, 1996 ), or the chance to be involved in thematic working groups (Sancassiani, 2005 ) became a tool for capacity building for local actors. External partnership and network with other municipalities or cities, NGOs, and universities also enabled local actors’ capacity building (Steinberg and Miranda, 2005; Selman, 1998 ). Resonating with the enablers, two constraints identified in this key element were the absence of adequate policy support and resources as well as opportunities for local actors to take active roles (Crilly et al., 1999; Bajracharya and Khan, 2004; Aall, 2012 ).  4 Discussion By dissecting LA21 based on its key elements and subsequently identifying what strengthens and weakens those elements, we attempted to look at local sustainability not as a single process but as multiple processes around some of the key elements, all of which with their enablers and constraints. To know which enabler and constraint play more important roles in which processes, we found patterns across all key elements and discussed what we could learn from them. Across all LA21 key elements, there were frequently appearing enablers and constraints. Because a lot of these enablers and constraints have the same themes and only differ in their wordings (for example, ‘the existence of reliable resources’ as an enabler is similar to ‘limited reliable resources’ as a constraint), for this discussion, we simplify them into just enablers. There were four enablers that most frequently appeared across all publications in the study: resources availability , supportive planning and policymaking practice, competent local actors , and trust between local actors . The most frequently appearing enabler was resources availability.  It appeared across five key elements; participatory process , local action , achieve the local and global sustainability goal of Agenda 21 , long-term perspective , and capacity building . In the included studies, resources mean financial (funding), technical (infrastructure), human (quantity and experience of personnel) and political (endorsement) resources. We observed that resources availability was important throughout the whole LA21 process; before, during, and after local sustainability action were implemented ( Fig. 2 ). Beyond merely being available, the resources needed to be adequate, sustained, on-time, and reliable. In Northern Ireland, for example, information and technology resources important for participatory process were limited because the process relied too much on voluntary and ad-hoc resources (Crilly et al., 1999 ). From this takeaway, we suggest that resources need to exist and be constantly available at each step of the local sustainability process, not only for the actual programme but also to foster participation, support multi stakeholder partnership and build local actors’ capacity prior to the start of the programme. Another repeating enabler was supportive planning and policymaking practices . They appeared in 3 key elements; local action , achieve the local and global sustainability goal of Agenda 21 , and long-term perspective . Here, the word supportive means the planning and policymaking practice supported decentralisation practices, welcomed sustainable development values, and were structurally conducive to integrating them into the existing policy system. Looking at the key elements where this enabler exists, it was noted that supportive planning and policymaking practices were especially important to direct LA21 into hard policy measures, turn action into result, and make it an enduring process. In other words, this enabler was particularly important at later stages of an LA21 process (Fig. 2 ), where action had been progressing, and local actors were anticipating substantial improvements in sustainable development issues. The larger policy circumstances at multiple levels of governance might have affected this process, such as when the lack of statutory power of LA21 hindered its formal integration into policy structure (Scott, 1999; Mercer and Jotkowitz, 2000 ). Other repeating enablers were competent local actors  and trust between local actors . Each appeared in 3 key elements; participatory process , multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder partnership , and local action . The competent local actors here referred to local governments, key community leaders, and representatives of non-government organisations who were action-oriented and demonstrated strong leadership and exemplary actions. Looking at the stages where these enablers exist, both were particularly important during the processes leading to LA21 actions (Fig. 2 ). By dissecting the LA21 processes based on its key elements and looking at their enablers (and constraints), we can see that a local sustainability process, in the case of LA21, was not a linear process with clear-cut steps. Local actors might not have found the entry points to implement a successful LA21 as straightforward, considering how certain important ‘ingredients’ in LA21 were contingent upon conditions that only emerged after the action itself had been progressing. For example, a successful local sustainability action needed local actors who were experienced in sustainability issues, but that experience usually only arose from capacity building in a local sustainability project. This point is supported by findings from a LA21 survey by ICLEI, which suggested that LA21 had positive impacts on organisational changes in the forms of inter-departmental coordination, multi-stakeholder partnership, and public consultation processes (Llamas-Sanchez et al., 2013; Walker, 2002 ), which at the same time also constituted LA21 key elements. Moreover, engaging with this analysis, we observed that some key elements were listed as enablers/constraints of other key elements, i.e., some enablers/constraints were inter-dependent (Fig. 2 ). Multi-stakeholder partnership  and capacity building of local actors  were listed as each other’s enablers. Those two elements, plus capacity building of local actors , enabled two key elements: local action  and achieve the local and global sustainability goal of Agenda 21 . Other enabling relationships among the key elements can be seen in Fig. 2 . From the findings, we observed that resources were the important enabler throughout the whole process. In Portugal, where municipalities were reportedly struggling to enact successful LA21 processes, a lack of resources was found in all key elements. Portugal municipalities, particularly those in rural areas, were preoccupied with a shortage of basic infrastructure and amenities that limited fundings availability for LA21-related activities (Carter et al., 2000 ). There was also a nationwide debt crisis at the time, along with a shortage of experienced staff at the local level (Guerra et al., 2019 ). Those conditions were suggested to be hindering local communities not only to start LA21 action but also to conduct engagement activities and to build trust among local actors (Fidelis and Pires, 2009 ), to invest in long-term projects (Guerra et al., 2019 ), to share best practice and information with other local government (Fidelis and Pires, 2009 ). The case of Portugal illustrates how resources are important throughout LA21 processes, from initiation, design, consolidation, to sustaining the process. Additionally, competent local actors and trust became points of strength during the enactment of participatory processes, multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder partnerships, and local action(s). In Pampas de San Juan, substantial efforts were made to consistently maintain the community’s level of trust in the LA21 process, to swiftly overcome conflicts among local actors, and to socially and politically engage with marginalised groups outside of the LA21 project scope to build trust (Hordijk, 1999 ). Competent local actors who push trust-building actions can help improve local participation and maintain multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder partnership, consequently consolidating LA21 actions. Supportive planning and policymaking practices, on the other hand, were important to sustain local sustainability efforts and to yield tangible results. In Norway, even though LA21 actions were enacted, a lack of intra-department integration and the absence of formal policy support from the national government prevented the LA21 process from sustaining and improving over time (Aall, 2000 ). 4.1 Implications for local sustainability in the contexts of the SDGs The discussions in this paper can provide some key points to facilitate local sustainability processes that are driven by the SDGs based on what enablers were present in some of the LA21 cases. These discussions can also be used to anticipate some key concerns the local implementation of the SDGs, such as where and how to secure financial, technical, and political resources at different stages of the process, what planning and policymaking set-up need to be prepared in advance, and how to identify and amplify the voices of competent local actors. However, it needs to be pointed out that the SDGs’ conceptualisation and terms of implementation as a global sustainability framework have evolved from those of Agenda 21 (A21). Firstly, on top of having a clear timeline, the SDGs also attempted to specify the aspirational targets of sustainable development through goals-and-targets model (Persson et al., 2016 ) with 17 global goals and 169 targets. In contrast with A21’s comprehensive-yet-not-systemic approach, the SDGs are “a system of interacting components,” acknowledging that contemporary challenges faced by our society are multidimensional and complex (Graute, 2016; Pradhan, 2019 ). Because of this complexity and interlinkages among the goals, scholars observed that the SDGs target can be synergistic or create trade-off situations. The SDGs can be said to be synergistic when certain actions contribute to multiple (nexus of) goals and targets, pose trade-offs when they negatively correlate with each other (Jimenez-Aceituno et al., 2020; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Secondly, for local actors, implementing these goals and targets demands planning and policy works that often are out of their domain and authorities (Arnold and Wade, 2015; Moallemi et al., 2020 ). The 17 SDGs are not to be treated as 17 silos with separate implementations, but rather as webs of goals at multiple governance level, including local, sub-national, national, and international government (Graute, 2016 ). With local communities having their dynamics in prioritising goals, understanding the interaction between SDGs goals can be the key to implementing the SDGs at the local level (Bandari et al., 2021 ). One example to address this challenge is by having a collaborative process to create several pathways to achieve local SDGs priorities (Szetey et al., 2021a, 2021b ). The creation of pathways with different fulfilment of the SDGs may assist local actors in imagining their most desired future and the level to which they can achieve that. Finally, there is a growing acknowledgement that achieving sustainability is not a linear and one-off event with a predictable trajectory of achievement (Bowen et al., 2017; Scoones, 2019 ). There are inherent complexities and uncertainties embedded in our social, political, and environmental systems, which require communities to go beyond sustaining their current socio-ecological condition and cultivating resilience after distress and adversities (Murphy, 2012 ; Walker et al., 2013 ). To navigate these complex and constant changes, the critical element needed is knowledge of a system’s variables, the interaction among these variables, the interactions’ implication, its probabilities, and the heuristics on how to value them in different contexts (Lempert et al., 2004 ). However, even with sufficient knowledge of social and environmental systems, decisions for sustainability actions may be hampered by conflicting values among different societal actors (Voss et al., 2007 ), especially when trade-offs between goals are required. Consequently, in contrast to LA21’s emphasis on building consensus during the participatory process, local sustainability within the SDGs might be more dynamic and conflict-laden in practice. The lessons from LA21 processes will therefore need to be taken into account with regards to these SDGs characteristics. More resources, especially technology, expertise, and funding, may be needed by local actors to navigate their ways through the complexities and uncertainties of social and environmental systems. Local actors may need to see beyond the provisions of the resources and pay more attention to the effectiveness of their distribution in order to leverage important synergy drivers in the SDGs. Furthermore, reliable resources may need to be secured not only to continue or scale up projects but also to adopt new strategies when unforeseen situations arise. This could be more challenging in a rigid setting where sustainability steering is done by delivering fixed projects with little room to change trajectories. Despite the above challenges, opportunities for more resources provision under the local implementations of the SDGs may emerge through new forms of partnerships of actors at multiple levels of governance. Governing local sustainability in the context of SDGs also needs planning and policymaking practices that are more accommodating towards cross-jurisdictional sustainability steerings at multiple governance levels. When sustainability innovations to amplify synergies across different sectors emerge, the existing governance arrangements need to be ready to integrate them into the planning and policymaking practices. This means creating a planning and policymaking environment that can efficiently bridge sectoral boundaries while at the same time maintaining accountability to all involved parties. Moreover, to be more adaptive in a rapidly-changing future, the planning and policymaking practices also need room for flexibility and constant reflection. This may prove challenging, especially for actors who are conditioned to see planning and policymaking as ways to integrate sustainability into ‘hard’ policy measures. With regards to the complexity, uncertainty, and ambivalence of sustainability values in the context of the SDGs, local actors need to be informed and experienced not only in sustainability issues but also the complexity, uncertainty, and ambivalence embedded in it, in such a way that conflicts arising in steering sustainability actions are not to be avoided but strategically overcame. Finally, not the least challenging is harnessing trust between local actors who may have different values and possess sector-specific knowledge. In LA21 processes, trust was particularly important in enabling participatory processes, multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder partnerships, and local action. In implementing the SDGs at the local level, trust may be more needed in resolving conflict and negotiating for the most appropriate sustainability strategies. Hence, the local sustainability process in the context of the SDGs need to create strategies to cultivate trust in ambivalent, conflict-laden situations. With the SDGs commencing for six years, some experiences of their local implementation can give illustrations of currently evident challenges for local actors. One of these challenges is the varieties in communities’ geographical and socio-economic profiles, making it difficult for global indicators to be downscaled for local implementations (Koch and Krellenberg, 2018; Weitz et al., 2018 ). Targets and indicators in SDG 15 (Life on Land), for example, will be most relevant for pastoral, agricultural-focused communities and less fitting for urban communities. Another challenge is the difference in local capacities to implement the SDGs, particularly regarding budget, staff, and expertise (Belda-Miquel et al., 2019; Jones and Comfort, 2020; Krantz and Gustafsson, 2021 ). Consequently, even though some local communities may want to maximise their operationalisation of the SDGs, they may have to prioritise certain targets or activities that are more feasible to them. In this regard, frontrunner communities and cities in urban areas may have more advantages in engaging with the SDGs and translating the global goals into locally-relevant actions. While there are cases where smaller-size and non-urban communities adopt the SDGs to guide their local sustainability actions, such as Shimokawa Town in Japan and Harelbeke municipality in Belgium, it is not rare to see communities adopting the SDGs in a symbolic way, such as ‘aligning’ their existing plans and policies with a couple of SDGs goals (UCLG, 2018 ). In cases where they have limited capacities, local communities prioritise some of the most relevant SDGs goals and targets and embed them into local planning (Oosterhof, 2018; Tremblay et al., 2021; UCLG, 2018 ). There are also cases where they integrate SDGs with locally existing sustainability plans (Krantz and Gustafsson, 2021 ) or combine them with existing initiatives like the 100 Resilient Cities Network or the New Urban Agenda (Croese et al., 2020; Krantz and Gustafsson, 2021 ). Local communities are also using the SDGs beyond progress reporting, particularly as tools to develop the local community’s vision of sustainability (Jönsson and Bexell, 2021 ) and as a common language to communicate sustainability across multiple sectors and institutions (Simón et al., 2021 ). The important task to turbocharge the SDGs achievement at the local level is to ensure that local sustainability processes engage with the SDGs in meaningful and effective ways.   5 Conclusions In this paper, we attempted to answer the following two research questions: 1) what enables and constrains LA21 processes? 2) what can be learnt from them to inform local sustainability process in the context of the SDGs? In our findings section, we listed down the enablers and constraints to LA21 key elements, which were obtained through our systematic review. To know which enabler play more important roles in which processes, we also tried to find patterns across all key elements and highlighted four components: resources, planning and policymaking practice, competent local actors, and trust between local actors. To answer the second research question, we discussed our findings in the specific context of SDGs and suggested the way to move forward with governing local sustainability in Local Agenda 2030. While our study provided a general overview of what enables and constrains LA21 processes from the inception of this agenda in 1992 till now, it is important to note that some of the LA21 cases are still ongoing projects. They may face new enablers and constraints in the future that were not obviously identified in our current review. Our analysis was also solely based on peer-reviewed research reported in primary studies, which sometimes had various interpretations of LA21 key elements (e.g., different interpretations of what constituted a ‘participatory process’) and used different datasets and research methodologies. We, therefore, were not able to independently assess and validate the conclusions reported in these primary studies concerning their data and methodologies. While we limited our research to peer reviewed publications (and excluded practical reports and strategic documents), it ensures that what we assessed is based on robust analyses, already tested and peer-reviewed for their credibility. On a reflective note, we are aware that other enablers of LA21 processes may not be captured in this study because they are not documented in peer-reviewed, English-language publications. It is also important to be mindful of the geographical distribution of LA21 cases included in this study. Similar to other studies of global LA21 experience (Echebarria et al., 2018 ; Owen and Videras, 2008 ; Walker, 2002 ), the European LA21 cases were highly represented due to a stronger LA21 mainstreaming and documenting practice. Within the context of the local implementation of the SDGs, communities that were previously underrepresented in LA21 and are starting their local sustainability processes driven by the SDGs (Jimenez-Aceituno et al., 2020; UCLG, 2018 ) can complement the lessons drawn from this study with lessons from other context-specific studies. Future studies could assess current strategies to implement local sustainability actions and how they fit into the needs and context of the SDGs. Studies related to important synergy drivers in local implementation of the SDGs could further investigate what important resources are needed to leverage those synergy drivers and how local actors can secure them. Beyond exploring ways to sustain and scale-up sustainability projects, studies on sustainability transformations at the community level could also explore how resources can be more flexibly used when unforeseen situations arise. Studies on partnerships in sustainability can also explore new forms of partnerships at multiple levels of governance that could create enabling environment for local sustainability strategies. Finally, research on sustainability education and campaigns could also delve into how local actors are exposed to the idea of complexity, uncertainty, and ambivalence in sustainability actions.
