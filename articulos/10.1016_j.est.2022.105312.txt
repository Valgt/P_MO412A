                  In this paper, the optimization and multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of a stand-alone photovoltaic and battery energy system (PV-BES) has been used to supply power to a desalination plant in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). To provide a continuous power supply, different types of battery technologies have been used as a renewable energy storage system in this study as Nickel Iron (NiFe), Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4), and Lead Acid (PbSO4) with three different depths of discharges. Six different configurations of the PV-BES were modeled. In total, nine metaheuristic optimization algorithms were used in the MATLAB environment to provide an optimal sizing of the PV-BES. The mayfly optimization algorithm has provided the best optimal Annual Levelized Cost (ALC) values compared with the remaining algorithms. The mayfly algorithm has more robustness and faster convergence in providing the optimal global best values. Furthermore, three different approaches of MCDA and weights methods were used. The inputs and the results for the optimization process in addition to the sustainable development goal (SDGs) from the united nation (UN) were used as criteria for MCDA. The PV-Li-ION at 50 % depth of discharge (DOD) was the best option among all cases based on the six configurations and nine optimization algorithms.

Department of Sustainable and Renewable Energy Engineering University of Sharjah Sharjah 27272 United Arab Emirates       In this paper, the optimization and multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of a stand-alone photovoltaic and battery energy system (PV-BES) has been used to supply power to a desalination plant in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). To provide a continuous power supply, different types of battery technologies have been used as a renewable energy storage system in this study as Nickel Iron (Ni Fe), Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4 ), and Lead Acid (PbSO4 ) with three different depths of discharges. Six different configurations of the PV-BES were modeled. In total, nine metaheuristic optimization algorithms were used in the MATLAB environment to provide an optimal sizing of the PV-BES. The mayfly optimization algorithm has provided the best optimal Annual Levelized Cost (ALC) values compared with the remaining algorithms. The mayfly algorithm has more robustness and faster convergence in providing the optimal global best values. Furthermore, three different approaches of MCDA and weights methods were used. The inputs and the results for the optimization process in addition to the sustainable development goal (SDGs) from the united nation (UN) were used as criteria for MCDA. The PV-Li-ION at 50 % depth of discharge (DOD) was the best option among all cases based on the six configurations and nine optimization algorithms.

Although two-thirds of the earth is covered by water, only a few percentages are suitable for usage and the rest is saline one needs a proper desalination method(s) before usage. Although of the good achievement in desalination technology, it consumes a huge amount of energy that is come mainly from fossil fuels with their high environmental impacts [1 ]. Waste heat recovery in different water desalination techniques demonstrated promising results in terms of increasing efficiency and reducing pollution [2 ,3 ], however, an effective solution to this problem could be achieved by using renewable energy sources [4 ,5 ]. Renewable energy sources are sustainable, have low environmental impacts [6 ,7 ], are used for the whole day length [8 ,9 ], and can be used in isolated areas where are no grid connections [10 ,11 ]. Even though the renewable energy devices required enhancement as in solar energy applications [12 ,13 ]. The effective usage of renewable energy sources requires a prober energy storage to overcome the intermittence property of some types of renewable energy sources, such as the case of solar energy [14–16 ] and fully and partially shading of solar PV systems [17 ,18 ]. Moreover, prober energy management must be considered for accurate decoding of the required size and type of the energy storage system [19 ,20 ]. The methods used for sizing microgrids can be categorized into (a) applying software tools such as HOGA and IHOGA, RETScreen, HOMER Pro, and others [21 ]; (b) using mathematical methods such as probabilistic and analytical methods, linear programming, numerical, graphical construction, and others; (c) using metaheuristic algorithms such as PSO, GWO, GOA, GA, and others. A new tool using used 3D plots to test the direct self-consumption and self-sufficiency of the battery was provided by [22 ]. The new tool will help to test the system, and properly size the array power and the rated capacity from either an energetic or profitability approach. A new methodology to jointly optimize the size of PV power was presented by [23 ], electric vehicle charging load, household consumption load, battery bank (BB), and power converters. The obtained results were able to confirm that the battery bank is considered a cost-effective way of enhancing PV self-consumption by decreasing the LCOE. Optimized modeling for single-family housing PV Panels was developed by [24 ], and they are able to increase the frequency containment reserve (FCR) to 14.01 %. Although the software tools are easy, selecting the suitable components is not easy, and the performed calculations and algorithms inside them are invisible to the users. While software tools are less efficient than mathematical methods [25 ]. However, for complex study cases of microgrids such as the sizing of microgrids, the solution is tricked to a locally optimal solution that eventually resulted in missing the accurate global best optimal solution. Based on these facts, metaheuristic algorithms are extensively used as the best choice compared to the other methods. Several metaheuristic optimization algorithms had applied during the last decade that has covered the approach of microgrid size [26 ]. Few optimization methods such as GA, PSO, DE, etc., were used by both computer scientists and many scientists in different areas. They are considered versatile methods that prevent local optima entanglement and find a better solution. These optimization methods have a lot of benefits, allowing them to solve any optimization problem and imitate living creatures to solve problems with optimization [25 ]. But, as per the No Free Lunch theorem, a particular metaheuristic algorithm may provide global optimal results for certain specified objective functions, while using other objective functions for the same algorithm offer poor results [27 ]. The abovementioned factors motivated scientists to examine maiden algorithms for the sizing of microgrid problems [28 ]. Energy and sustainable development goals are interlinked. ‘Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted at the UN Summit for Sustainable Development on 25 September 2015, shown in Fig. 1  . The SDGs aim to provide a balance between the three pillars of sustainable development (social, economic, and environmental). In addition, the SDGs provide the platform for the stakeholders to ensure that their services work toward sustainable development [29 ]. The agenda includes a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and tackle climate change by 2030 [30 ]. Making energy supplies secure provides a road to a sustainable future. Lack of access and unpredictable supply to modern energy services is a serious hindrance to economic and social development and must be reduced to achieve sustainable development goals [31 ,32 ]. This has severe socio-economic costs. A lack of energy services keeps people in poverty, undermining social services, limiting opportunities for women, and exacerbating environmental degradation—while increasing child mortality and contributing to the spread of disease. Lack of access to clean, affordable, and uninterrupted electricity and heavy reliance on the inefficient, unsustainable and unhealthy use of traditional biomass fuels (i.e., fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural waste, and animal dung) are both manifestations. In come conventional energy cases, if one was to drill down, energy aggravates the inequities in the world through the costs and benefits of its use. There are many metaheuristic algorithms available in the literature such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [33 ], Genetic Algorithm (GA) [34 ], Differential Evolutionary Algorithm (DE) [35 ], Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) [36 ], Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) [37 ], Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) [38 ], Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) [39 ], Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) [40 ] and A Mayfly Optimization Algorithm (MFA) [41 ]. On other hand, there are many Multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) methods that help the maker decision to select the best solution for any technology-based on alternatives and criteria, such as Technique for the Order of Prioritisation by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), and Multiplicative Exponent Weighting (MEW). Moreover, different weight estimations can be used with the MCDA method such as Standard deviation (SD), CRITIC, and Entropy.1. The research on the availability of freshwater from desalination plants with PV/battery (PV/BES) configurations with different batteries such as Ni Fe, Li-Ion, and LA batteries is not identified. In addition, a numeral of studies identified the optimum size of the microgrid by just using one or two optimization algorithms. The limitations and gaps listed above need to be addressed to optimize the microgrid's size. By keeping these in mind, in this study and according to the author's knowledge, the nine metaheuristic algorithms optimization were used for the first time to find the size and cost of six configurations of PV/Battery technology micro grid system for a desalination plant. The nine metaheuristic algorithms optimization were used to reach the accurate global best optimal solution instead to trick at a locally optimal solution. Moreover, Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based on the results of the optimization process and the sustainable development goals of the united nation was used to find the best configuration of PV/BES. Three different approaches of MCDA (TOPSIS, SAW, and NEW) and three different weights (standard deviation (SD), CRITIC, and Entropy) were used in this study. This research paper consists of eight sections. The second section presented the location, metrological data, and demand. The mathematical modeling of the PV-BES components is described in the third section. The fourth section explained the economic analysis. The objective functions and their constraints are presented in section five. The sixth section described the methodology. The multi-criteria and weight estimation are explained in the seventh section, and finally, the result and discussion are mentioned in section eight.  2 Location, metrological data, and demand United Arab Emirates (UAE) received a high annual solar radiation compared with other locations in the world [42 ,43 ]. Metrological data for temperature and solar radiation is shown in Fig. 2  . A desalination plant is located in the Emirate of Sharjah and is owned by Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (SEWA). The plant uses a Reverse Osmosis (RO) method to treat the seawater and produce distilled water from seawater. More detail of the desalination plant can be found in [44 ]. The RO process required power for the electrical motor because solar radiation is widely available in Sharjah, therefore the Photovoltaic (PV) system generates power with a battery energy system (BES) was used in this study [45 ]. The AC load profile for the average month is shown in Fig. 3  .  3 Mathematical modeling of the PV-BES components The architecture of the proposed PV-BES for the desalination power plant in Sharjah is shown in Fig. 4  . The system consists of a PV array, battery energy storage system (BES), and bidirectional converter with a charge controller (BDC-CC). The detail of the system component is presented in Table 1  . 3.1 Solar energy system Various models for the evaluation of the output power of the PV were suggested in previous studies. In the current analysis, the PV (P PV  (t )) panel power was calculated by means of Eq.1  using a simplified model, with the hourly ambient temperature (T amb  (t )) and irradiation (G (t )) [51 ].(1) P PV  t  = P V rated  × G t  / G ref    × 1 + K T  × T C  − T ref          PV rated  : PV panel’ rated power, G ref   is the intensity of radiation “1000 W/m2 ” at T ref   250 C, and K T   : temperature coefficient “3.7 × 10−3  (1/0 C)”. The temperature of the cell temperature (T C  ) is obtained using:(2) T C  = T amb  t  + 0.0256 × G t        T amb  (t ): hourly ambient temperature (°C). The panels' energy (E PV  ) is determined as follow:(3) E PV  t  = N PV  × P PV  t  × ∆ t     ∆t: time period “one hour”.  3.2 Battery bank Batteries are used to store the excess energy during the daytime when there is a surplus of energy, and they provide the energy again at shortage energy times, such as at night or during higher energy consumption periods. The following equation is used for describing the batteries' charging process [51 ,52 ].(4) E Bat  t  = 1 − σ   × E Bat  t − 1   + E G  t  − E L  t  / η Conv    × η CC  × η rbat     E Bat  (t ), and E Bat  (t  − 1) are battery's energy content at times ‘ t ′ and ‘ t  − 1′, σ : hourly self-discharge rate, E G  : produced energy, E L  : energy consumed, η Conv  : is the converter's efficiency, η CC   : charge controller's efficiency, and η rbat  : the battery's round trip efficiency. The produced, i.e., generated, electrical energy (E G  ) is estimated using:(5) E G  t  = E PV  t    × η Conv      The battery energy is used in case the required load is higher than that supplied by the renewable source. This load can be calculated using:(6) E Bat  t  = 1 − σ   × E Bat  t − 1   − E L  t  / η Conv  − E G  t    / η rbat       3.3 Bidirectional converter with charger controller A bidirectional converter with a charge controller (BDC-CC) is used to convert between AC and DC, the rectifier mode converts AC into DC, while the inverter mode converts DC into AC. The charge controller is important for avoiding exceeding limits during the charging or discharging process of the batteries. The rating power of the BDC-CC (P BDC −CC  ) is determined using [51 ].(7) P BDC − CC   = E T , max   × 1.1    where E T , max   is the maximum energy transferred between the inlet and outlet of the converter, and 1.1 is presented as the percentage of overloading capability of the converter which equals 10 %.   4 Economic analysis The economic viability of the PV-BES was evaluated based on the Annual Levelized Cost (ALC) as shown in Eq. 10  [52 ].(10) ALC = ACC + A O & M   + A REP      The annual capital cost (ACC) was calculated as follows(11) ACC = N PV  × C PV , cap   + C PV , erect   + C PV , mech     +   N BES  × C BES , cap   + C BES , erect     + C BDC − CC , cap   + C BDC − CC , erect     +     × CRF    where the subscripts of C PV , cap  , C BAT , cap  , and C BDC −CC , cap  , are the PV, BAT, and BDC-CC initial capital costs, respectively, and those of C PV , erect  , C BAT , erect  , and C BDC −CC , erect   are for PV, BAT, and BDC-CC erection costs, respectively; while that of C PV , mech   is for PV panel mechanical structure cost. It is worth mentioning that erection costs were 20 %, 3 %, and 3 % for the PV, BAT, and BDC-CC, respectively; while the replacement cost was 100 % for all components as described in [34 ]. The capital recovery factor (CRF) and its value are presented in [53 ,54 ]:(12) CRF = y × 1 + y   N   1 + y   N  − 1      where N is the life span of the project, and y is the discount rate value and is described based on a nominal interest rate (I nom  ), inflation rate (x) as follow:(13) y = I nom  − x  1 + x       The annual operation and maintenance cost (A O &M  ) is calculated based on the following equation [54 ]: [(N PV   × C PV , o &m  ) + (N BES   × C BAT , o &m  ) + (C BDC −CC , o &m  )] (14) Where C PV , o &m  , C BAT , o &m  , and C BDC −CC , o &m   are the components operation and maintenance costs for the PV, BAT, and BDC-CC, respectively. Some components of the PV-BES system have a lifetime less than the lifespan of the project, therefore, the replacement cost (A REP  ) was presented annually as [54 ].(15) A rep  = N BES  × C BAT , rep   × ∑ b = 1  N r   1 1 + y   b N c       + C BDC − CC , rep   × ∑ d = 1  N r   1 1 + y   d N c         × CRF    where, C BAT , rep  , and C BDC −CC , rep  are the replacement costs of the BES and BDC-CC respectively and the N r   is the number of replacements needed for each component and defined as follows [53 ,54 ]:(16) N r  = int N − N c   N c       where, N c   is the component life span. All of the energy production systems used the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to evaluate the economic feasibility of the energy system as shown in eq. 17  [55 ].(17) LCOE  $ / kWh   = ALC ∑ t = 1  8760  E L  t          5 The objective functions and their constraints In this study, Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Annual Levelized Cost (ALC) functions were used as objective functions for the optimization algorithms used. The objective functions depend on both NPV  and NBAT  as shown in the following equation(18) min  ALC N PV  N BAT   = ∑ C = PV , BAT , BDC − CC  min  ALC  C      5.1 Upper and lower bounds During the optimization process, the linear constraints were applied for both PV panel and battery energy storage systems as shown below:(19) 0 ≤ N PV  ≤ N PV − max      (20) 0 ≤ N BAT  ≤ N BAT − max      where N PV   and N BAT   are the number of PV panels and the number of batteries, respectively.  5.2 Limits values of battery energy storage The limit of the energy charging in the battery at any time step t is expressed as follows [52 ]:(21) E Bat _ min   ≤ E Bat  t  ≤ E Bat _ max       And the two energy limits, i.e., maximum (E Bat _max  ) and minimum (SOC min −bat  ), of the battery bank, is determined using the following:(22) E Bat _ max   = N BAT  × V BAT  × S BAT   1000   × SO C max − bat      (23) E Bat _ min   = N BAT  × V BAT  × S BAT   1000   × SO C min − bat      V BAT   and S BAT   are the batter's voltage (V) and rated capacity (Ah), respectively.(24) SO C min − bat   = 1 − DOD    (25) SO C max − bat   = SO C min − bat   + DOD    DOD: battery's discharge depth.  5.3 Power reliability index The power system's reliability is defined as the capability of the system to sustain, supplying the necessary power for a definite time in specific conditions. The reliability power of PV-BES is determined using LPSP “loss of power supply probability”. The LPS at time t (LPS (t )) can be determined based on the generated energy (hourly), the amount of load demand, and the level of energy in the battery bank [56 ]:(26) LPS t  = E L  t   η Conv   − E G  t  − 1 − σ   × E Bat  t − 1   − E Bat _ min     × η rbat      The LPSP is examined using the following equation [57 ]:(27) LPSP = ∑ t = 1  T  LPS t   ∑ t = 1  T  E L  t          6 Methodology The simulation for the PV-BES starts in MATLAB by reading the hourly metrological data for the location such as ambient temperature, solar radiation, the electrical load demand, and the specifications of the PV-BES components as shown in Figs. 5  . Each configuration of the six configurations was studied separately by applying the ‘for’ loop for the aforementioned five modes as shown in Table 2   under the constraint of LPSP equals zero as shown in Fig. 5 . The energy management strategy (EMS) is very important for the work of any PV-BES. It has many advantages such as improving the overall efficiency, saving energy, annual Levelized cost as well as the optimal power flow distribution between various components [52 ]. The EMS was carried out based on an hourly basis for 8760 h using MATLAB code built for this process. All metrological data such as ambient temperature, solar radiation, and input parameters such as demand profile and techno-economic values of PV-BES system components were involved when calculating the total energy production from the system based on Eqs. 29 to 31 .(29) E L  t  = E Load  t  / η Conv     where EL  (t) is the electrical energy demand at any hour (t).(30) E G  t  = E PV  t  × η Conv      The net energy production from the PV system at any time step (t) is described as follows:(31) E net  t  = E G  t  − E L  t      The total energy produced in the study area is solely from PV energy resources. The simulation will begin and run for 8760 h. The simulation process will be carried out as follows every hour. First, the net energy will be determined by subtracting the total energy generated from the total load demand. If the net energy is equal to zero, it means that the generated energy is sufficient to meet the load demand. Suppose that if the net energy is greater than zero, it means that the generated energy exceeds the load demand. So, the extra energy can be used to charge the batteries. If the batteries are fully charged, the excess energy will be discarded to dump energy. As a result, there is no power outage under these conditions. If the net energy is less than zero, the generated energy is less than the load demand. In such cases, the batteries supply the deficit load demand. As a result, there is no interruption in power supply. If the batteries fail to supply the load demand due to a lack of energy storage in the batteries, there will be a loss of power supply. There are six modes of operation used in this study based on the ‘if’ statement conditions and ‘for’ loop as shown in Table 2  below and Fig. 5 .  7 Multi criteria and weight estimation 7.1 TOPSIS TOPSIS is a simple ranking approach in design and application. TOPSIS is an effective and useful method in ranking and selecting the possible options. This approach measures the distance of alternatives (options) from the reference elements, which are respectively positive and negative best or the ideal solution. The phases for implementing this method are as follows [58–60 ]:1- Assuming that the decision matrix D, calculate the normalized decision matrix R = [r,j]   (32) r ij  = d ij  ∑ i  d ij 2     , i = 1 , … m , j = 1 , … k    2- Measure the weighted decision matrix V  = [v ij  ]   (33) v ij  = w i  r ij  , i = 1 , … m , j = 1 , … k    3- Find the ideal solution A * and the negative-ideal solution A −    (34) A j ∗  = max i  , v ij  , j = 1 , … , k , A j −  = min i   v ij  , j = 1 … k     For each alternative i  = 1,…,m, calculate the separation measures S j  ∗  and S j  − ,(35) S j ∗  = ∑ j  v j i  − A j ∗    2     , S j −  = ∑ j  v j i  − A j −    2        4- For each alternative i = 1,…,m, calculate the relative closeness C i  to the ideal solution,   (36) C i  = S i −  S i −  + S i ∗        Finally rank alternatives with the descending order of C i  .  7.2 SAW One of the oldest MCDA methods is Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), and it is a quite known and practically used method [61 ]. The implementation of the SAW involves the following steps:1- Assigned weighting factors [w 1 , w 1 …w n  ] to the criteria by the Decision Maker (DM).  2- Aggregated the multiple criteria values together with their weighting factors are into a single metric  3- Determine the most preferred alternative A ∗  which has the highest weighted result, using the following Equation. It should be noted that the greater criteria values are preferred.   (37) A ∗  = A i  max i  ∑ j = 1  n  w j  x ij         where x ij   is the normalized i-th criteria for j-alternative.  7.3 MEW Multiplicative Exponent Weighting (MEW) is another sorting method that is commonly used in the MCDA [62 ]. Equation < is used in MEW to.(38) S i  = ∏ j = 1  N  x ij w j      where i  is the row, j  is a column, x ij   denotes attribute j  of candidate network i , w j   denotes the weight of attributed j , and ∑ j = 1  N  w j  = 1  .  7.4 Methods for weight estimation 7.4.1 Standard deviation (SD) The following equations were used to calculate the SD weight(39) δ j  = ∑ i = 1  m  [ r ij  − r j  ]  ¯  2   m   , i = 1 , … m , j = 1 … , n    and(40) w j  = δ j  ∑ j = 1   n  δ j       where δ j   is the standard deviation for criterion j.  7.4.2 CRITIC-method For weight evaluation using the CRITIC method the following phases were followed: Phase 1:  Find out the ‘best’ (B) and ‘worst’ (T) solution ([1xn ]-vector) for all features. Phase 2:  Find out relative deviation matrix V [m xn ](41) v ij  = a ij  − b j    b j  − t j         Phase 3:  Calculate the standard deviation (St) (Sdr)  ([1xn ]- vector)  for colls of V.  Phase 4:  Calculate the correlation matrix (Cr)(Crm) ( [n xn ]- matrix)  for colls of V.  Phase 5:  Finally calculate the vector (c ) and calculate the weight of criteria wk. (42) c k  = Sdr k  . ∑ j = 1  n  1 − Crm jk    , k = 1 , … n    (43) w k  = c k  ∑ k = 1  n  c k         7.4.3 Entropy Entropy weight is measure as follows [62 ]: Normalized the outcome using:(44) E j  =  ∑ i = 1  m  P ij   ln P  ij      ln m    ; j = 1 , … n  and  i = 1 , … m    where the Pij  form the normalized decision matrix and is measure by(45) P ij  = r ij  ∑ i = 1  m  r ij    ; j = 1 , … n  and  i = 1 , … m    where r ij   is a feature of the decision matrix. The weight (wj ) of elements measured as follows:(46) w j  = 1 − E j   ∑ j = 1  n  1 − E j      , j = 1 , … n    where Ej  is the information Entropy value for each jn  criteria, and (1 − Ej ) is the degree of diversity of the information involved in the outcomes of the jn  criterion. The flow chart that describes the structure of this work based on the metaheuristic algorithms of optimization and MCDA is shown in Fig. 6  .    8 Results and discussion 8.1 Modeling different configurations of PV-battery technologies A total of six configurations of PV-BES system technologies were modeled with different DODs. An optimization algorithm based on the lower and upper limits defined before for the variable parameters was used to control the sizing of PV and BES components as mentioned in Section 5 . While the size of the converter was considered a fixed parameter during the modeling (28,196 kW). The configurations of PV-BES technologies were distributed based on DODs as follows: two configurations of PV-BES (LA) at 50 % and 80 % of DODs, three configurations of PV-BES (Li-Ion) @ 50 %, 70 %, and 80 % of DODs, and one configuration of PV-BES (Ni Fe) @ 80 % of DOD. The details of the components for these six configurations are shown in Table 1 . These DODs were selected based on the best value for each type of battery as in [52 ]. The daily energy generation for all optimum configurations of different battery technologies for one week in the winter and summer seasons are shown in Figs. 7 and 8   . The Figures show that the PV system was responsible for all energy production during daylight and this energy production reaches its maximum at noon. The excess energy production from the PV system was used to charge the BES during the daytime, while BES provides the energy required for a load of the desalination plant during the night (i.e. discharging process) during the night period. The techno-economic of BES is evaluated during the night period when the battery operating temperature is relatively low compared with the daylight period. The judgment of the BES technology will be fairly based on the specification mentioned in Table 1 . The proposed MFA algorithm was compared to eight other well-known and proven algorithms, including GA, PSO, DE, GWO, ALO, DA, MFO, and GOA, to determine its efficiency and robustness. To obtain the optimal configuration for the study area, the proposed configurations are tested in the MATLAB environment.  8.2 Algorithms robustness and efficiency The results show that the MFA algorithm provided the global best optimal values for all the six configurations. This algorithm ranked first for finding the optimal size of the microgrid; whereas the MFO and ALO provided the globally best values for five configurations and they ranked second. Moreover, the PSO, GWO, and GOA provided the globally best values for four configurations, and they ranked third. Furthermore, GA, DE, and DA only provided the globally best values for three configurations, and they ranked fourth. From Fig. 9  , it is obtained that the LA battery-based PV system with @80 % DOD provided the global best optimal values with DA, DE, GA, GOA, GWO, MFA, MFO, and PSO algorithms at 60th, 48th, 50th, 87th, 76th, 21st, 88th,  and 17th iterations respectively. From Fig. 10  , it is obtained that the Li-Ion battery-based PV system @70 % DOD provided global best optimal values with DE, GA, GWO, MFA, and MFO algorithms at 60th, 82nd, 87th, 39th, 31st, and 24th iterations, respectively. From Fig. 11  , it is obtained that the Ni Fe battery-based PV system provided global best optimal values with ALO, DA, DE, GA, MFA, and MFO algorithms at 98th, 55th, 22nd, 60th, 31st, and 19th iterations, respectively. Thus, from a robust and convergence speed point of view, the MFA algorithm has shown itself to have the global best optimal values compared to the remaining algorithms. Therefore, the MFA algorithm is strongly recommended to find the microgrid size.  8.3 Optimal configuration of PV-BES The PV-BES system for a desalination plant in UAE has been simulated at @70 % and 80 % DODs, @ 50 %, 70 %, and 80 % DODs, and @ 80 % DOD for PV-BES (LA), PV-BES (Li-Ion), and PV-BES (Ni Fe) configurations, respectively. The results of all six configurations are shown in Table 3   .  The results show that the ALC and LCOE of PV-BES (Ni Fe) are the optimum value among all configurations for electrifying the demand for a desalination plant for all nine algorithms used in this study. The LCOEs were noticed as 0.3613, 0.7391, and 0.1897 for PV-BES (LA), PV-BES (Li-Ion), and PV-BES (Ni Fe), respectively. Unfortunately, all the battery technologies need to replace at least twice during the life span based on the installed ambient temperature condition. In addition, the optimization analysis based on the sizing and cost only is not enough to select the best battery technology for the desalination plant. Therefore, the techno-economic and environmental analysis based on the high operating temperature capability, round trip efficiency, durability, longevity, capital and replacement costs, the annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, and the environmental impact were involved in detail for the multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). From the above discussion, the previous optimization algorithms were selected based on size and cost criteria (# of PV and battery, ALC, and LCOE) without considering the SDGs as explained before in the introduction section. To find the optimal battery energy storage by considering the size, the cost of the PV-battery system, and the SDGs from the United Nations, the multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is applied to solve this issue. The values from Table 4  , were taken as an input for the MCDA. The first four criteria were based on the results of optimization results for the six configurations done by the nine-optimization algorithms while the other six criteria were based on the SDGs as shown in Fig. 1 . To determine the weight for each criterion, three methods were used SD, CRITIC, and Entropy. Moreover, to verify the results three approaches were used namely TOPSIS, SAW, and MEW. The findings were linked to the SDGs, which could support the decision-makers to determine which battery energy storage has the highest contribution to the SDGs. The results for the three different methods of weight (CRITIC, Entropy, SD) are shown in Figs. 12 to 14     for all nine algorithms. As shown from the figures the PV / LA system for both DOD has the lowest weight among all configurations, while the PV / li-ion AT 50 % DOD has the highest weight. The rank for all six configurations of the PV / battery system and the nine-optimization algorithms was distributed between 1 and 20 instead of 1 to 54 as many of the cases have the same inputs criteria as shown in Table 4 . Figs. 15 to 17     show that the PV / li-ion at 50 % DOD has the first rank among the 54 cases studied using all nine optimization algorithms and MCAM approaches. While the other cases of DOD (70 % and 80 %) for PV / Li-ion has a second and third rank, it is worth mentioning that the rank of these DOD (70 % and 80 %) PV / li-ion system depends on the approaches used for MCDA and the type of optimization algorithms. Moreover, the average rank for all approaches is shown in the last figure for each optimization algorithm, where the 80 % DOD for the PV / li-ion system has the second rank and the 70 % DOD for the PV / li-ion system has the third rank, except the PSO algorithms, where the tow DOD for PV / li-ion system are very close to each other. The PV / Ni Fe 80 % has the middle rank and the PV / LA at 80 % DOD has the last rank. The lithium iron phosphate battery has been ranked first because its round trip efficiency is higher, 92 %, when compared to the LA and Ni Fe batteries, which are 85 % percent and 80 %, respectively. It can also operate at three different depths of discharges (DODs): 50 %, 70 %, and 80 %. Similarly, the battery's self-discharge rate per day is only 0.2 %, which is a very low value when compared to the LA and Ni Fe batteries, respectively as 0.3 % and 1 %. It can also operate at a wide range of temperatures, making it more suitable for off-grid electrification. The criteria used for MCDM in this study were based on the optimization results for the sizing and cost of PV/Battery system and for the desalination plant and SDGs from the united nation. The results of the optimization show the Ni Fe 80 % is the best in term of cost criteria only, but when considering the SDGs 7 and 15 related to technical and environmental aspects, the Li-ion battery become the best technology because it provides more feasible techno-economic results. Moreover, even though the cost of 50 % and 70 % DOD Li-ion batteries were 0.7761 $/kWh and 0.6721 $/kWh for the highest and lowest, respectively, the cost of 80 % DOD was 0.7392 $/kWh. The 50 % DOD ranks number one among the other DOD. The Li-ion at 50 % DOD delivers a high number of discharge/charge cycles than the 70 % and 80 % before the battery capacity drops to 70 %. The capacity losses are higher for high DOD 70 % and 80 % according to the dynamic stress tests. However, the results of MCDM are very sensitive to criteria, and since one of the criteria is the cost any change in the cost will result in a change in the ranking as it is happing currently due to the weight of each selected criteria.   9 Conclusions In this paper, the power required for the desalination power plant was provided by solar PV and battery energy systems. Six configurations based on Nickel-Iron (Ni Fe), Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion), and Lead Acid (LA) battery technologies at different depths of discharges were modeled and simulated using MATLAB software. Nine optimization algorithms were used to find the optimum configuration of the PV-BES among these six configurations based on the system's size and cost. Three different approaches of MCDA and three different weight methods based on TOPSIS, SAW, and NEW and slandered deviation RITI and entropy were used. For the optimization process, the Annual Levelized Cost (ALC) or Levelized cost of energies (LCOE) was used as objective functions, with zero value of loss of power supply probability as a constraint and the number of PV panels and batteries as decision parameters. The Mayfly algorithm provided the global best optimal values in all six configurations and demonstrated robustness and fast convergence efficiency by finding the global optimal solutions. The results show that the PV-BES based on the Ni Fe battery has the lowest ALC and LCOEs when compared with the Li-Ion and LA battery-based configurations. The optimal ALC and LCOEs were identified as $20,498,766 and 0.1897 $/kWh, respectively. While the MCDA used twelve criteria based on the DOD %, type of algorithm size, and cost results from the optimization process in addition to the SDGs from UN. The results for MCDA show that the PV/ Li-ion systems at 50 % DOD is the best choice among all six configurations.
