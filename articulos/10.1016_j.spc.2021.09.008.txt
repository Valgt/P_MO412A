The inner circle represents the sectors in which mitigation occurs. The second ring shows different generic types of mitigation actions (A to G), with the symbols showing which sectors they are applicable to. The third ring indicates different types of climate related co-benefits (white white letters) and adverse side effects (red letters) that may be observed as a result of implementing each of the mitigation actions (as indicated by the letters A-G). Here I relates to climate resilience, II-IV economic co-impacts, V-VII environmental, VIII-XII social, and XIII political and institutional, with the classification adapted from (Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016). The final ring maps co-benefits and adverse side-effects to the SDGs.
