                  Malnutrition affects millions of people globally, especially women, children, and other vulnerable populations. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives and prospects of everyone by 2030. To achieve the SDG goals effective nutrition interventions and programs need to be efficiently delivered to those most in need. Nutrition directly affects 2 SDGs (2 and 3) and indirectly influences five others. In addition, almost all SDGs influence nutrition and thus attaining the SDG goals is also a pre-requisite to achieving the Global Nutrition targets set in 2012. Evidence-based nutrition interventions, for which there is strong evidence of their biological impact, have the potential to directly influence SDGs 2 and 3 if successfully delivered at scale in high-burden countries. Nevertheless, delivery of nutrition programs is a complex process, where policy, government commitment, adequate budget allocation, supplies and delivery systems, training of service providers, informed beneficiaries and program monitoring and evaluation all need to be in place and aligned with each other. Although in the past decade there has been progress in the SDGs that nutrition directly affects, many goals are still off-track, likely due to several pending gaps at policy-level, program-level, and intervention-level. To accelerate the progress toward reaching the SDG goals that are directly influenced by nutrition, countries need to be supported to successfully and sustainably deliver proven interventions and to scale-up and deliver new interventions in new and innovative ways, and the evidence base should be built in promising areas especially integrating (rather than prioritizing over each other) nutrition-specific and sensitive approaches.

Box 1 Successful delivery of vitamin A supplementation programs  Box 1 In settings where vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health problem, WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for children 6−59 months of age to reduce morbidity and mortality in the population [52 ]. One high dose capsule given every four to six months apart starting at the age of six months, and continuing until the child is five years old has been proven to reduce the incidence of common childhood illness like measles and diarrhoea by 50% and 15%, respectively, and all-cause mortality by 12% [53 ]. The protective effect of a single, large (age-appropriate) dose of oral vitamin A (VA) has been shown to last for up to, but not exceeding, 4–6 months [54 ]. As such, children 6−59 months of age are considered fully protected for a calendar year when they receive their age-appropriate dose every semester (4–6 months apart), for a total of two doses over 12 months. In addition, because of the potential for high impact among vulnerable children under five, efforts must be made to reach every child who is at-risk, including those living in hard-to-reach areas, without missing a dose. Successful delivery of VAS programs therefore requires:• Strong commitment at senior levels of government and Ministry of Health  to continue to prioritize, budget for and monitor the program to ensure that all children receive their two doses per year.  • Adequate financial and operational planning within the health system  in the form of annual health plans, biannual reviews, and monthly microplanning at lower levels for the delivery platforms are required to reach children twice per year. Depending on the context, some health systems can reach an adequate number of targeted children through routine services, whereas others require campaigns to reach critical mass of the population. Some campaigns are organized to gather the community at fixed sites, while others are delivered door-to-door. The cost-effectiveness of campaigns can be improved by delivering a package of preventive services at the same time, for example VAS together with deworming, and in some settings, also delivering bed nets and other essential services.  • Supply procurement and supply chain management . VAS is a supply program, one that requires a reliable source of quality assured VA syrup or capsules. The right quantity of each dosage form (100 000 IU VACs for children 6–11 months of age; 200 000 IU VACs for children 12–59 months) needs to be in place to ensure no gaps in coverage.  • Training : Supplementation is the responsibility of front-line health workers (FLW), who usually have many primary health care services to deliver to the population. As such, regular training and supervision is needed to ensure FLW have the knowledge of the importance of VAS for children, and the motivation to reach every child with their age-appropriate dose every 4–6 months.  • Monitoring : A successful VAS program requires all eligible children be reached every six months, therefore tracking coverage must also be done on that basis. Knowing the coverage at a single time point in the year does not enable program managers to know if their program is effective and having the desired impact. It is therefore recommended to track two dose coverage by monitoring the number of eligible children reached in the first six months of the year, and those reached in the second six months of the year. For example, if 90% of children 6−59 months of age are reached Jan–June, and 30% reached July–December, then the maximum considered as being adequately protected in that given year is 30%. Monitoring systems need to be able to track, review and report on this indicator, at the local, district and national level so that course correction can be put in place in a timely way.  • Social and behavior change communication : Caregivers of children 6−59 months of age need to be informed of the importance of supplementation for their children at the age of six months, and every four to six months until the child reaches the age of five, and where to receive the service.

Malnutrition affects millions of people globally, especially women, children, and other vulnerable populations. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives and prospects of everyone by 2030. To achieve the SDG goals effective nutrition interventions and programs need to be efficiently delivered to those most in need. Nutrition directly affects 2 SDGs (2 and 3) and indirectly influences five others. In addition, almost all SDGs influence nutrition and thus attaining the SDG goals is also a pre-requisite to achieving the Global Nutrition targets set in 2012. Evidence-based nutrition interventions, for which there is strong evidence of their biological impact, have the potential to directly influence SDGs 2 and 3 if successfully delivered at scale in high-burden countries. Nevertheless, delivery of nutrition programs is a complex process, where policy, government commitment, adequate budget allocation, supplies and delivery systems, training of service providers, informed beneficiaries and program monitoring and evaluation all need to be in place and aligned with each other. Although in the past decade there has been progress in the SDGs that nutrition directly affects, many goals are still off-track, likely due to several pending gaps at policy-level, program-level, and intervention-level. To accelerate the progress toward reaching the SDG goals that are directly influenced by nutrition, countries need to be supported to successfully and sustainably deliver proven interventions and to scale-up and deliver new interventions in new and innovative ways, and the evidence base should be built in promising areas especially integrating (rather than prioritizing over each other) nutrition-specific and sensitive approaches.

Introduction Given the importance of good nutrition for proper growth, development, and well-being, the World Health Assembly endorsed six Global Nutrition Targets (GNTs) in 2012 to improve maternal, infant, and young child nutrition by 2025. In 2015, all 193 UN Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development including 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives and prospects of everyone by 2030 [1 ]. The SGDs importantly build on the Millennium Development Goals which aimed to end extreme poverty, hunger, disease, and other core issues by 2015 [2 ]. To achieve both sets of goals (GNTs and SDGs) effective nutrition interventions and programs need to be efficiently delivered to those most in need. The following review will provide an implementing perspective on the successful delivery of nutrition interventions and programs with their link to achieving the SDGs.  Global malnutrition situation Malnutrition, which encompasses both undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and overweight/obesity, affects millions of people globally, disproportionally impacting women, children, and other vulnerable populations. Currently, 21.3% of children under five are stunted [3 ], 41.7% have anemia [4 ], and 29.0% have vitamin A deficiency [5 ]; all conditions hinder their potential to survive and thrive. Further, 54.3% of women are overweight or obese [6 ,7 ], and 30–40% are anemic [8 ,9 ] (Figure 1  , Panel a). In addition, it is estimated that 17.0% of the world’s population is at risk for zinc deficiency [10 ] and that 12.0% of countries globally have inadequate iodine intake [11 ]. All forms of malnutrition can co-exist in the same individual, household or population, which is defined as the double or at times triple burden of malnutrition. Despite significant progress in delivering effective interventions, childhood and maternal mortality continue to be prevalent at a global level [12 ] and the current COVID-19 pandemic will increase these rates, both directly and indirectly [13 ] (Figure 1 , Panel b).  Proven nutrition interventions Evidence-based nutrition interventions are those proven to effect on nutrition, health and/or mortality indicators. The 2008 Lancet’s Maternal and Child Undernutrition Series and subsequent 2013 update provide the basis for understanding which nutritional interventions have shown to be effective in improving the nutritional status and health of children and women and/or reducing child and maternal mortality [14 ,15 ]. We conducted a literature review to identify any additional evidence that had been published since 2013. Table 1   describes those nutrition interventions for which there is strong evidence of their biological impact and identifies which of them have a direct effect on the SDG targets. Successful delivery of these interventions at scale in high-burden countries would have a significant impact on SDGs 2 and 3. To achieve this impact, successful programs need to be implemented; key elements for success will be discussed below (‘Successful delivery of nutrition programs’).  Successful delivery of nutrition programs Delivery of nutrition programs is a complex process, which requires many pieces of a puzzle to be in place and aligned with each other. National policies, regulations and guidelines need to be in place, commitment and adequate budget allocation are needed from government, adequate supplies and delivery systems need to be in position, service providers within the program have to be trained and motivated, beneficiaries need to be informed of benefits of the program and how to access the program and the program requires continuous monitoring to track and resolve any issues may arise during program implementation and evaluation to assess the program effects. A specific example of this is provided in Box 1  . Globally, nutrition-specific interventions are dependent on health systems for their successful delivery, but their coverage in many developing countries is low and sometimes not part of the essential package of services. These are integrated with various programs, including Integrated Management of Childhood Illness and Community Case Management (IMCI/iCCM), Child Health Days, immunization, ECD (Early Childhood Development), and Social Safety Net Programs. Despite the general paucity of information, it is shown that integrated nutrition interventions within the health and relevant social sectors is associated with a significant increase in breastfeeding initiation rates, improved recovery, and reduced relapse of children with SAM and MAM and improved coverage of vitamin A supplementation as well as a potential positive impact on the primary program. For example, integration of nutrition into IMCI platforms led to significant improvements in care seeking for danger signs and correct pneumonia treatment, and individual programs also reported improved coverage with antenatal and postnatal care, facility delivery, and vaccines. Most programs are effective in using existing modes of service delivery and health workforce staff to deliver the services, and the integration in governance ensures future sustainability. In contrast, information systems, financing and supplies/technologies are not adequately integrated [16 ]. A common framework for nutrition integration, and uniform methods for measuring outcomes including gender-equity analysis, are major current gaps in integration at this point. There are missed opportunities for scaling up nutrition-specific interventions through health and other sectoral platforms (education, ECD, social protection, agriculture, etc.). Developing clear program pathways for nutrition intervention within multiple platforms will allow for more intentional integration. The persistent and significant gaps between global targets and actual achievements call for effective and sustainable actions that result in impact at scale. It is not enough to know that a nutrition intervention is efficacious; it is also necessary to know how to identify barriers, build upon strengths, and address weaknesses in actions in real-world conditions [17 ]. Effective implementation uses existing and emerging knowledge such as, tools, and guidelines typically underutilized, knowledge brokering [18 ] and tailored capacity building, technical assistance, and coaching [19 ], complemented by practical context-based assessments to identify or clarify the weaknesses, strengths, and bottlenecks in various domains and phases, and to adapt interventions to local contexts. Contextual knowledge and experience of planners and implementers can have profound implications for the performance and prospects of a program, intervention, or innovation, and should be better integrated within the decision processes of the international development agenda. PROSPERA (formerly Progresa and Oportunidades) is a conditional cash transfer program in Mexico that is globally known for its success in reducing poverty and in improving the health and nutrition of its beneficiaries [20 ,21 ]. Although not a nutrition-specific program, PROSPERA involves a cash transfer that is conditional on the recipient household engaging in a set of behaviors designed to improve health and nutrition. In addition, it delivers a free nutritional supplement for children under five years old, and for pregnant and lactating women. It has been documented that key elements of the program’s success include strong political support, secured financing, and strong, and transparent structures rooted in rigorous monitoring and evaluation systems.  Contribution of nutrition to SDGs Nutrition directly affects or indirectly influences seven SDGs and addressing malnutrition is a key element required to achieving them. Nutrition directly affects the second and third SDG (Figure 2  ); specifically to ‘[e]nd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture’, and ‘[e]nsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’. A main determinant of the global burden of disease, nutrition is especially integral in the success of SDG 3. Nutrition influences five SDGs indirectly (Figure 2 ). Well-nourished children are 33% more likely to escape poverty [22 ] based on their improved learning performance (SDG 1: No poverty); in the case of improving performance of well-nourished school-aged girls [23 ] this translates to gains in gender equality (SDG 5). Conversely, children who are stunted, iron deficient and/or iodine deficient suffer impaired cognitive development [24 ,25 ] ultimately diminishing their learning potential (SDG 4: Quality education). The financial toll experienced as a result of malnutrition is approximately 10% of GDP globally [22 ] diminishing chance of success for SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth). Finally, nutrition is multi-disciplinary, investing in nutrition through global partnerships yield high returns; investing USD$1 to address malnutrition yields a return of USD$16 [22 ] (SDG 17: Partnership for the goals). Almost all SDGs influence nutrition (Figure 2 ) and thus attaining the SDG goals is also a pre-requisite to achieving the GNTs. Poverty, agriculture, infections and disease, education, inequality, climate change, desertification, and war and conflict all have an important impact on nutrition outcomes.  Progress in the SDGs that nutrition directly affects SDG 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Chronic malnutrition resulting in child stunting is lower in 2019 than 2000, however one in five children remain stunted globally (144 million) with 47 million wasted children under five (Figure 3  ). More intensive efforts are needed to achieve the global targets of stunting and wasting below 15% and 5% by 2025, respectively. 5.6% of children are overweight globally with little or no progress observed in child overweight trends globally. Preventative actions are urgently needed to reduce this public health problem and thus reach the 2025 goal (<7%). One in three women of reproductive age (WRA) are now anemic — a prevalence that has increased in the last decade (Figure 3 ) — indicating the serious risk for reaching the 2025 goal of <15% anemia among WRA.  SDG3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality globally with a 2.9% annual reduction over the last decade (Figure 3 ). Nevertheless, maternal mortality remains three times higher than the SDG target — 211 deaths per 1000 live births versus 70 deaths per 1000 live births, respectively — and annual declines are at an insufficient rate to achieve the SDG target. Globally, progress in reducing child mortality has been successful in the past 20 years, with an overall reduction of 49%; from 77 deaths per 1000 live births in 2000 to 39 deaths per 1000 live births in 2017. The observed trend has been on track to reach the proposed goal of 25 deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on health systems and access to quality diets. As a result, additional avertable deaths among women and children are expected to occur; under five deaths could increase between 10%–45% per month and maternal deaths between 8%–39% per month, over a period of six months [13 ]. Reductions in the prevalence of breastfeeding due to COVID-19 disruptions could result in up to 138 398 child deaths across 129 low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) over a one-year period [26 ]. Further, COVID-19 may seriously hinder past progress towards the SDGs, pushing 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020 adding them to the global burden of 690 million hungry people the previous year [27 ].   Pending gaps in the progress toward SDGs from a nutrition lens • Gaps at Policy-level  ̵ Gaps in nutrition policies at country level : policies often fail to adequately respond to the critical needs of populations, include evidence-informed interventions in a comprehensive manner or address the underlying and basic causes of malnutrition [28 ,29 ].  ̵ Gaps in integrating nutrition into other sector policies and plans and vice versa : national development plans and poverty reduction plans seldomly address nutrition and nutrition policies sometimes fail to address policies and plans from other sectors, which, for example, hinders nutrition-specific interventions.  • Gaps at Program Level  ̵ Gaps in Program level data : One of the gaps that exist in progress toward achieving the full impact of nutrition specific interventions is in program level data. As discussed earlier in this paper, nutrition-specific interventions are best delivered as part of an integrated program. Achieving high coverage and maximizing the impact of any given nutrition intervention is therefore dependent on the success of the delivery of the program itself, and while coverage of a specific intervention within a program may be tracked, other elements that drive the success of the delivery platform are very often not [30 ]. One example of this is IFA supplementation for pregnant women delivered through the health system’s antenatal care program. While the number of women receiving 90+ IFA tablets during their pregnancy may be monitored, without data on the quality of ANC care provision or the number of trained health care workers and midwives, program managers will not have the information they need to improve IFA coverage to achieve its maximum impact. There are very few evaluations of large-scale nutrition programs, and even fewer that evaluate the program processes and approaches to scale. Investing in implementation research, and process evaluations of key programs that deliver nutrition interventions will go a long way in informing scale-up and best practice to accelerate the impact, and hence progress toward SDGs.  ̵ Gaps in implementation : As recently found by a global consultation involving 15 LMIC across five regions, the academic and scientific community is not adequately engaged in research activities to support SDG implementation [31 ].  ̵ Equity : Programs that deliver the proven nutrition interventions at a population-level are needed to improve the health and nutritional status of the population. However, coverage without equity, quality, and sustainability will not help reach the SDGs. Equity in coverage may be the biggest driver of impact toward the SDGs. Studies have shown that the child who is missed by immunization, is often the same child missed with all other interventions [32 ]. Additional strategies to reach the hard-to-reach are needed in all nutrition programs to ensure the most vulnerable and most-likely-to-benefit receive the proven intervention.  • Gaps at Intervention Level  ̵ Gaps in intervention-level data : Quality, appropriate, and regular data collection for each intervention is critical to inform both intervention and program decision-making and drive coverage. Periodicity of nationally representative household surveys average 3–5 years making it challenging for nutrition organizations, national governments and donors prioritizing limited resources to understand the true landscape programs may be operating in and the associated health burden being experienced by a population. Data on biomarkers of key nutrients such as iron are even less available. Data collection can be costly and therefore depth and breadth of surveys and/or program assessments — and their frequency — must be justified.  ̵ Modelling based on real data : Evidence-based nutrition interventions are part of the development puzzle. Leveraging the strong evidence supporting key nutrition-specific interventions, together with quality implementation for populations in need, can translate to meaningful impact. By making program data, especially for coverage, of these select interventions more readily accessible — and timely — key stakeholders may then estimate a more accurate picture of program achievement. Importantly, this timely information and associated modelling unearths gaps in program coverage and the remaining work left for reaching the SDGs. Simple open access tools allow for wider use of analytical tools by a variety of decisionmakers.  ̵ Developing new interventions : Using data to identify at risk and/or underserved populations, implementors can both shape and inform the development of innovative interventions to address identified gaps. Building cross-disciplinary alliances (e.g. between nutrition and information technology) and fostering innovation is needed to bring new ideas to the field and address emerging problems such as the COVID disruptions to health systems.     What is needed to address the nutrition-related gaps to advance the SDGs To address gaps in the progress toward SDGs and to be more resilient in dealing with new challenges, such as the COVID pandemic, countries should be supported to successfully deliver programs based on proven interventions and to scale-up and deliver new programs in new and innovative ways, and the evidence base should be built in promising areas, especially integrating (rather than prioritizing over each other) nutrition-specific and sensitive approaches. Interventions that make a measurable difference: vitamin A supplementation, iron-folic acid supplements for pregnant women and exploring multiple micronutrient supplements for pregnant women and young children, weekly iron and folic acid for adolescent girls, zinc and ORS to treat diarrhoea, the proper treatment for severe acute malnutrition, exclusive breastfeeding (the most important part of the food system), and food fortification need to be fast-tracked globally. A measurable, evidence-based plan to achieve the SDGs that nutrition directly, or indirectly, affects needs to be planned. Many countries have built or are building national nutrition plans with support from partners. Nevertheless, organizations and structures must come forward with concrete plans in nutrition with evidence-based actions, adequate costing, and clear demonstration of how they will contribute to achieving the SDGs. In addition to investing in scaling up evidence-based interventions; integration with relevant sectors such as education, water, sanitation and hygiene, early child development, agriculture, and food systems should be considered in the right contexts. For example, in-school adolescent girls where anemia rates are high should be able to access weekly iron and folic acid via school platforms. These platforms should be used to advance awareness about the importance of healthy diets and other issues such as sexual and reproductive health, which are often much more difficult to establish in isolation. Existing delivery channels should be used to roll out new nutrition innovations as well as improve update and referral to existing nutrition services. For example, social protection programs should be strengthened so they provide vulnerable populations with fortified quality food instead of the cheapest, lowest-quality staples, provide targeted interventions to young children and pregnant and lactating women, and improve their linkages to the health system.  Conclusions Nutrition can directly and indirectly influence the SDGs. Proven nutrition interventions can directly influence some of the SDGs. The key elements to meet the SDG targets are known, but although great progress has been made in the past decade, there are still many gaps that hinder this effort. Given the importance of the moment, and the fragmented nature of the nutrition ecosystem, nutrition leaders must pull different voices, agendas, and organizations together behind common objectives. Vision, creativity, diplomacy, and a good understanding of political economy are needed now more than ever to navigate differences, create alignment, increase momentum, and generate impact. Meaningful progress should focus on people, especially women, adolescent girls, and children — and put them at the center of everything we do because they hold the key to ending malnutrition. Countries, donors, and partners need to be encouraged to bring clear commitments that demonstrate how they will accelerate progress against the SDG targets, with a detailed accountability framework and plans for transparently measured investments. Finally, science and academia have an important role in accelerating the progress against the SDG targets by generating evidence, especially in the area of implementation science, by providing evidence-based policy recommendations, and in building the capacity of stakeholders at country-level.
