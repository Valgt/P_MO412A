                  Homestead agroforestry is one of the recognized agroforestry practices in Bangladesh. While the monoculture cropping system is enormously intensified, homestead agroforestry has added dimension to rapid economic growth. But despite having significance, homestead agroforestry is not gaining concern in further development. The study was done to bring this topic into focus by compiling the prospects of homestead agroforestry in Bangladesh by highlighting the significance and necessity. A secondary analysis was done by reviewing the findings to do this research. To collect paper keywords, “Bangladesh homestead agroforestry”, “Homestead agroforestry practices”, “Homestead agroforestry status”, “Homestead biodiversity’', “Homestead and SDGs,” “Dominant species,” and “Home garden agroforestry system” were entered. Following the PRISMA framework, 337 papers were collected, among which 113 met the inclusion or eligibility criteria. The interrelated publications of homestead agroforestry with SDGs were assessed from the 113 shortlisted articles. The interrelated publications assessment on homestead agroforestry in the context of Sustainable Development Goals figured out that major research output was oriented towards no poverty (44%), decent work and economic growth (27%), zero hunger (20%), indicating its link to achieve SDGs from Bangladesh perspectives. The shortlisted articles were reviewed in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), food security, livelihood improvement, environmental resources conservation, and dominant species coverage. Consequently, the dominant species were tabulated along with their respective coverages according to their uses. The study identified that in all localities of Bangladesh, Mango, Areca, Coconut, and Mahogany are the highly preferred dominant species, while Jackfruit, Acacia, and Banana also prevailed. Hence, the study concluded that homestead agroforestry has significant prospects in food security, livelihood improvement, and environmental resources conservation, and its contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goals cannot be ignored. But homestead agroforestry system is exposed to vulnerability due to constraints. The systematic elimination of prevailing constraints can help in successfully executing sustainable development goals, and fruitful consequences can be derived by imposing potential concerns on this sector.

Table 3    SDGs Homestead Agroforestry Relevance Reference   No Poverty In household income, homestead apportioned 20.65% of total annual income with profitable production of fruit and timber species such as Mango, Jackfruit, and Mahogany [46 ]  Zero Hunger On the off-shore island, 42.72% of vegetation was occupied by homestead products, and farmers preferred fruits (76%) and timber (62%) production that acted as a reservoir of food and income. [7 ]  The vegetable production by small, marginal, and landless farmers was 511 kg/year, 499 kg/year, and 422 kg/year, respectively. [47 ]  Good Health and Well-being Homestead agroforestry was found as a prime source of medicinal plants, and they were recorded at 32.6% in Feni. [48 ]  Involvement in homestead vegetable production increased the yielding of plant protein (by 171%), vitamin A (189%), vitamin C (290%), and iron (284%). [49 ]  Quality Education Homestead agroforestry in Bangladesh was found not directed towards this ground. Not available  Gender Equality 53% of women were connected in input organizing, selecting, and planting tree species and post plantation management comprising preservation of seeds and selling in Natore district. [50 ]  Clean Water and Sanitation The involvement in homestead agroforestry-related projects or agricultural diversification projects caused 100% of farmers to obtain good sanitation and safe drinking water [51 ]  Affordable and Clean Energy The homestead fuelwood utilization helped reduce 0.22 mg CO2 eH/Ha and contributed as an alternative to fossil fuel use in Bandarban. [8 ]   Fuelwood produce helped in earning US$71.9 annually.

Climate-Smart Agriculture & Geo Spatial Lab Department of Agroforestry and Environmental Science Faculty of Agriculture Sylhet Agricultural University Sylhet 3100 Bangladesh       Homestead agroforestry is one of the recognized agroforestry practices in Bangladesh. While the monoculture cropping system is enormously intensified, homestead agroforestry has added dimension to rapid economic growth. But despite having significance, homestead agroforestry is not gaining concern in further development. The study was done to bring this topic into focus by compiling the prospects of homestead agroforestry in Bangladesh by highlighting the significance and necessity. A secondary analysis was done by reviewing the findings to do this research. To collect paper keywords, “Bangladesh homestead agroforestry”, “Homestead agroforestry practices”, “Homestead agroforestry status”, “Homestead biodiversity’', “Homestead and SDGs,” “Dominant species,” and “Home garden agroforestry system” were entered. Following the PRISMA framework, 337 papers were collected, among which 113 met the inclusion or eligibility criteria. The interrelated publications of homestead agroforestry with SDGs were assessed from the 113 shortlisted articles. The interrelated publications assessment on homestead agroforestry in the context of Sustainable Development Goals figured out that major research output was oriented towards no poverty (44%), decent work and economic growth (27%), zero hunger (20%), indicating its link to achieve SDGs from Bangladesh perspectives. The shortlisted articles were reviewed in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), food security, livelihood improvement, environmental resources conservation, and dominant species coverage. Consequently, the dominant species were tabulated along with their respective coverages according to their uses. The study identified that in all localities of Bangladesh, Mango, Areca, Coconut, and Mahogany are the highly preferred dominant species, while Jackfruit, Acacia, and Banana also prevailed. Hence, the study concluded that homestead agroforestry has significant prospects in food security, livelihood improvement, and environmental resources conservation, and its contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goals cannot be ignored. But homestead agroforestry system is exposed to vulnerability due to constraints. The systematic elimination of prevailing constraints can help in successfully executing sustainable development goals, and fruitful consequences can be derived by imposing potential concerns on this sector.   Keywords Bangladesh  Dominant species  Environmental resources  Food security  Homestead agroforestry  Prospects  SDGs    1 Introduction Bangladesh has become self-sufficient in food production. The geographical position, climatic conditions, and arable land have made Bangladesh a vibrant economy. The geographical location of Bangladesh is between 20.34′ & 26.38′ north latitudes and 88.01′ & 92.41′ east latitudes of South Asia. The average temperature ranges between 11° and 20° during winter whereas 21°–38° during summer. The subtropical monsoon is the climatic characteristic where rainfall ranges between 1100 mm and 3400 mm from June to August. According to World Bank data, 38% of total employment is from the agriculture sector [1 ]. Agriculture is the primary employment sector for a maximum number of people, where maximum land is utilized for agricultural production. In the era of the 21st century, addressing Sustainable Development Goals is mandatory through which the progress of a country can be measured. The agriculture sector triggered the accomplishment of such goals. According to the report of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 2020, 13.02% of the GDP of the country is contributed by the agriculture sector, and it is recognized as a productive sector in the economy as 87% of rural people directly or indirectly rely upon agriculture (BBS report, 2020). The rural economy is dependent upon this sector for food security. People are intimately connected with crop production as well as forestry practices. The forest and its natural resources provide food, timber, fuels, and fodder. Meanwhile, ecological functions of carbon storage, wildlife habitat maintenance, and environmental resource protection are also carried out by forests. But the agriculture sector is vulnerable due to population problems, deforestation, and natural hazards. Every year certain localities of Bangladesh undergo natural disasters such as floods, hailstorms, soil erosion, landslide, heavy rain, drought, etc. People are exposed to diseases and malnutrition, still living below the poverty line, and are hungry. In response to this vulnerable situation, agroforestry is a potential sector that can effectively respond. While monoculture is commonly preferred by farmers who deal only with a mono-cropping pattern, agroforestry joins two dominant aspects of tree and crop cultivation on the same land with or without animals. Agroforestry has the potential to improve living standards through poverty elimination [2 ]. The appropriate management practices of agroforestry can respond to climate change and acts as a mitigation option for climate change [3 ]. The opportunity for greater output becomes broadened by adopting homestead agroforestry. While home gardens occupy 0.88 million hectares of land, rural areas' home gardens occupy 0.81 million hectares, with 11% occupied for the plantation of vegetables [4 ]. Consequently, such areas and practices enlarge the beneficiary output by providing fuel, wood or timber, fruit-bearing plants, medicinal plants, non-timber products, and forages with significant economic value. As a result, homestead agroforestry fulfills the objectives of food security and cash return, nutritional security, environmental sustainability, and positive climatic action. In developing countries like Bangladesh, homestead agroforestry has added new dimensions to food and nutrition security and poverty alleviation by creating the opportunity for income generation, inequalities reduction, and execution of women empowerment. At the same time, the natural agroforestry offered by homesteads has the potential to protect natural habitats or lives on land, such as plant biodiversity, and store carbon, thereby protecting the environment from greenhouse gas emissions and saving the climate. As a result, people can lead a healthy life, and developing countries like Bangladesh can move towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the economic significance, homestead agroforestry is an underrated topic beyond the focus and concerns. Most empirical studies identified the existing species without explaining the potential prospects for Sustainable Goals Development Achievement. Again, most of the studies identified farmers' barriers in homestead production practice and recommended possible strategies to upgrade this sector. Hence, the study’s objective was to address homestead agroforestry prospects in the context of Bangladesh. The prospects were figured out in a significant dimension by reviewing published information regarding homestead agroforestry. Through secondary qualitative research, the study aimed to address the significant aspects in the context of Bangladesh to achieve Sustainable Development Goals effectively. We overviewed the scope of homestead agroforestry towards sustainable development targets. This study’s primary objective was to identify homestead agroforestry’s potential in achieving Sustainable Development Goals in Bangladesh. Besides, the paper aimed to figure out the link of homestead agroforestry to food security, livelihood improvement, and environmental resources conservation from Bangladesh’s perspective. Dominant species and coverage of various species prioritized by farmers for production on homesteads assessment was another focus to determine the preference for major species among farmers in multiple localities. Consequently, the study aimed to determine constraints that hinder the efficient adoption of homestead agroforestry practice and identify recommended strategies to improve the homestead agroforestry system. This study comprises contribution to policy implications as it can help in figuring out all favorable prospects of homestead agroforestry that can add value to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals by acting as a policy option. The implications of policies in terms of minimizing existing constraints and executing recommended strategies can bring out the welfare of rural farmers. The study highlighted synergies between Sustainable Development Goals and the food system, livelihood improvement, and protection of natural resources.  2 Methodology 2.1 Article search and inclusion Sources of information were collected from online electronic journal databases of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science to proceed with the review. The content search was carried out by searching key phrases of the review topic. Key terms “Bangladesh homestead agroforestry,” “Homestead agroforestry practices,” “Homestead agroforestry status,” “Homestead biodiversity”, “Homestead and SDGs,” “Dominant species,” and “Home garden agroforestry system” were entered. Initially, all articles collected from respective online databases were listed in an excel file with their title. The total number of identified articles was 337. In the next step, duplicate articles were removed and marked excluded, were 100 in number, and a list of recorded 237 papers was screened. A systematic approach undertook the proceeding of reviewing 237 articles. A set of eligibility criteria (Table 1  ) was determined, and articles were excluded based on eligibility criteria. The articles, mainly book chapters, review papers, conference or workshop or seminar papers, full text unavailable, not in English, published in a predatory journal, not relevant to the study region, and irrelevant to the research topic, were excluded. The total number of excluded articles was 124 based on eligibility criteria. Such criteria were used in article selection in previous studies [5 ,6 ]. A total number of 113 articles were selected and forwarded for further qualitative analysis. The detailed methodology of the PRISMA framework of article selection is depicted in figure.  2.2 Article analysis From the shortlisted 113 articles, the interrelated publications in the context of SDGs were assessed (Table 2  ) based on sustainable development goals. Later, a comprehensive review regarding the potentiality of homestead agroforestry was conducted from shortlisted articles in the context of the implementation of SDGs, food security, livelihood improvement, and environmental resources conservation was made from shortlisted articles. The dominant species and coverage according to various usage were also tabulated from the literature (Table 4 ). The frequency of species was categorized into three levels: low (frequency below 5), moderate (frequency ranging between 5 and 10), and high (frequency greater than 10) to analyze dominancy levels in terms of their frequency determined in different localities (Table 5 ). Again, the division-wise frequency of the dominant species was also determined (Table 6 ). Finally, the constraints and recommended strategies from the literature were reviewed structurally. All the analyses were done using SPSS software and MS excel. Data were systematically reviewed considering historical and updated referenced papers to determine the potential contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goals and targets. Data were presented in tables and relevant figures. Most literature had addressed homestead agroforestry’s efficiency in food security, employment opportunity, and economic growth that were efficient enough to accomplish Sustainable Development Goals of “No Poverty,” “Decent work,” and economic growth.” Again, the significant number of literature highlighted the significance of homestead agroforestry in fulfilling the goals of “Zero Hunger” followed by “Affordable and Clean Energy,” “Climate Action,” “Life on Land,” “Good Health and Well-being,” “Reasonable Consumption and Production,” “Reduced inequalities” and “Gender Equality” respectively. Most of the publications were directed toward the goals mentioned above.   3 Homestead agroforestry in the context of sustainable development goals In tropical and subtropical regions, homestead agroforestry can be extended due to favorable climatic appearance. This ultimately helps implement the attributes of sustainable development goals, including sustainable production, food security, and nutritional security. It has been clarified that homestead agroforestry has the potential to contribute to achieving sustainable development goals. In developing countries like Bangladesh, most rural people depend on homestead products to get their required fruits, fodder, medicinal plants, and fuelwood species from homestead areas. After fulfilling the self-consumption, the rest of the products are marketed. That eventually helps in the reduction of their poverty level and also encourages economic growth through employment opportunities. Besides, an enormous contribution lies in environmental resource conservation, such as greenhouse gas emission mitigation, carbon stocking, and exotic species preservation. Hence, homestead agroforestry is greatly directed toward achieving sustainable goals as it greatly connects to fulfilling sustainable development targets (Table 3  ). Homestead farming led maximum farmers to prefer a high vegetable intake of 51–100 g per person per day, which was responsible for improving the farm economy and livelihood in Narsingdi and Gazipur [51 ]. The great extent of the production of vegetables and fruits not only satisfied self-consumption or food and nutrition security but also generated a profound net return [57 ]. In the case of landless, marginal, and small farmers, net benefits were derived from selling products such as homestead woodlots [58 ]. In Sandwip Upazila of Chattogram, fruit, timber, and fuelwood plantations were preferred by 75%,63.3%, and 45% of farmers, respectively, and succeeded in obtaining 13.5% of total annual income by securing nutritional and wood fuel requirements and climate resilience [59 ]. Farmers found interest in homestead agroforestry for fruit, timber, and fuelwood, and common species were recorded Jackfruit, Citrus, Litchi, Pineapple, Banana, Guava, Mango, Beechwood, Teak, Albizia spp., Mahogany, Acacia in Chattogram hill tract [60 ]. The presence of species fulfils the need for affordable energy utilizing fuelwood. In the south-central Noakhali district, the study revealed that 58% of respondents depended on home gardens for biomass fuel, while 87% used homestead products (wood, dry leaves, crop residues, etc.) as a source of fuelwood [14 ]. Homestead forests were responsible for increasing ecosystem services for which the average biomass density and carbon density were recorded at 9.33 ton/ha and 4.57 ton/ha, respectively, with the economic value of USD 80.96 ± 25.52 in Fatikchari, Chattagram [61 ]. While land fragmentation is a threat to sustainable cities and climatic change, homestead agroforestry eliminates the threats by increasing carbon stock and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Subsequently, life on land is protected by the maintenance of biodiversity. The presence of species richness revealed that Bangladesh could protect life on land [62 ]. In South Surma of Sylhet, most women showed positive opinions toward traditional homestead vegetable production practices [63 ]. The high Survival rate of tree species is assured by women’s involvement in site selection and maintenance within their domain, which indicates Bangladesh has the scope to intensify homestead agroforestry [64 ]. Women and minorities get the opportunity to access homestead production. For instance, the Manipuri community applied their indigenous management practices in the home garden in Sylhet, which expressed the probability of inequality reduction by ensuring their accessibility [65 ] (see Fig. 1  ). Meanwhile, among religious communities, the highest source of tree species was derived from home gardens in Narsingdi Sadar, Raipur, and Palash sub-districts of Narsingdi district [66 ]. Hence, homestead agroforestry paves the way for livelihood improvement. Women’s engagement in homestead agricultural activities, consumption, marketing, and decision-making hinted at the opportunity for optimum production through further training facilities, technical support, and encouragement [67 ]. Fig. 2   depicts the potentiality of homestead agroforestry for Sustainable Development Goals in Bangladesh by combining all targets. 3.1 Prospects of homestead agroforestry in food security Homestead facilitates self-consumption, thus securing food requirements in Bangladesh. Farmers of different regions depend on homesteads for household food security and have opted to plant diverse plants in their homestead areas. A study in 2015 revealed that the homestead area increased by 55–57%, spreading from a low elevation to a high elevation over eight years [68 ]. A study in Northern Bangladesh expressed that 9% of land found utilized as homestead agroforestry with conspicuous characteristics of the upper layer, intermediate layer, the herbaceous layer of the fully grown tree, fruit, medicinal, emergent, vegetable species for home consumption, and market supply [69 ]. In the Meherpur district, 21% of the land was utilized for agroforestry, where the majority of, 92% of farmers preferred practicing agroforestry in homesteads [70 ]. The prospects of homestead agroforestry are praiseworthy as farmers had their homesteads for planting trees [71 ]. Farmers prefer diverse species that can fulfill their dietary needs and act as an influencer of food security. The record on diversity and species richness in the Gazipur district revealed that farmers were willing to adopt homestead agroforestry for basic needs such as fruit, fodder, vegetables, fuel, cash, timber, etc. [16 ]. The common deltaic, plain, hilly, and dryland species identified Mango, Pineapples, Papaya, Jackfruit, Banana, Guava, Betel nut, and general uses of the products marked as food, fruit, timber, fodder, medicine, fuelwood, etc. [72 ]. In the Bhola, Patuakhali, and Barguna regions of southern districts, over 80% of households were associated with producing fruit tree species, whereas over 65% of households preferred timber species [17 ]. In Keshabpur of Jessore district, many farmers preferred homestead agroforestry and possessed a positive attitude toward its contribution to offering tangible and intangible benefits of diverse products, selling them, and providing environmental service [2 ]. Fruit species were dominantly present in 75% of respondents' homesteads, whereas 80% of respondents preferred timber species of Mahogany, Eucalyptus, and Acacia in Gopalpur, Tangail district [18 ]. In Sandwip, 75% of the homestead was occupied by dominant species of Coconut, Betel nut, Guava, Musa sp., Papaya, Date palm, and Mango for subsistence and cash need; 62.2% of farmers preferred Mahogany, Acacia, Teak, Eucalyptus for timber while preference for horticultural species helped in generating monetary benefit and nutrition demand [73 ]. Sixty-eight percent of farmers were found practicing homestead agroforestry with woody perennials (Mango, Litchi, Citrus, Jackfruit, Guava, Acacia, Jujube, Beechwood, Neem, Teak, Sal, Khaya sp., Bamboo) and crop (Papaya, Banana, Taro or Colocasia alba, Yard long bean, Sponge gourd, Malabar Spinach)species in Tangail and Mymensingh district [74 ]. Dominant practices found Mahogany-Turmeric, Mahogany-Acacia-Turmeric, and Litchi-Banana-Turmeric in the Nakla sub-district, and it was interpreted that not only food security but also annual income positively related to tree species diversity [15 ]. Farmers of Kaliganj sub-district, Satkhira district, produced Betel nut, Coconut, Mahogany, Spinach, Plum, Date palm, Tal, Neem, Jackfruit, and Kaora with vegetables, crops, and 98% of farmers were positive regarding homestead agroforestry [75 ]. In the Naogaon district, common species, timber, gum, medicinal, and exotic species (Sissoo, Eucalyptus, Mahogany) were planted by farmers, and dominance indices followed an upward trend with increased landholdings [19 ]. The IVI (Importance Value Index) value was found 42.34% and 54.74%, respectively, for Acacia in Lakshmipur and Narsingdi villages respectively [20 ]. The nutrition supply, economic return, employment opportunities, and poverty reduction were consequences of adopting homestead production practices. The formation of smallholder farmers' subsistence and income was shaped by the homestead garden and its various cropping schedule, which acted as production units of food, cash, firewood, and year-round production facilities in Kishoreganj, Nawabganj, Satkhira, and Dhaka districts [76 ]. While smaller farm holders depended on their home gardens for income, the large farm holder depended on self-consumption in the Thakurgaon district [77 ]. Edible species contained the greatest proportion of overall uses that meet daily subsistence and dietary requirements and the rich traditional heritage hints at the necessity of species conservation in respective regions. The home yard, front yard, approach road, and boundary microsites should be aligned with appropriate design and management [78 ].  3.2 Prospects of homestead agroforestry in livelihood improvement Adopting different agroforestry practices in homestead areas widens the opportunity for livelihood improvement. The SDGs of poverty alleviation, well-being, decent work by employment opportunity, and economic growth is boosted by homestead agroforestry. In support of livelihood, commercial benefits, household expenses, and annual income, the contribution of intense food-producing and fruit-producing species was undeniable in deltaic, hilly, dryland, and hilly areas [79 ]. Income from the homestead, credit and homestead area had a significant positive relationship with Gazipur Sadar’s biodiversity [80 ]. In Bhaluka, Fulbaria, Mymensingh Sadar, and Muktagacha of the Mymensingh district, farmers constructed a great deal of traditional and indigenous knowledge for homestead agroforestry that essentially delivers economic and environmental benefits [21 ]. The empirical study of those sub-districts figured out that a correlation existed between income and homestead practices, and such forestry practices could be enriched by synthesizing existing indigenous knowledge [81 ]. In the Kalroa and Tala sub-districts of the Satkhira district, tree diversity was significantly related to annual income [82 ]. As a means of livelihood improvement, nutritional security, and food security, plant diversity is regarded as a commendable scope, and it maintained a positive correlation with annual income in Kamalganj Upazila of Moulvibazar district [22 ]. Net benefit increased with increased landholdings of homesteads in the Ganges valley and a multilayered cropping system [10 ]. Meanwhile, tree species diversification was significantly correlated with annual income in Madhupur, Tangail district [23 ]. Income correlated with tree species diversity, and homestead was responsible for diversity maintenance and increased productivity [24 ]. Forty-nine percent of the contribution to the annual income of hillsides in the peninsula, Cox’s Bazar, was kept by homestead forests [11 ]. Meanwhile, another study in Teknaf Peninsula revealed that 25% of total annual income was derived from homestead produce as 85% of homesteads contained diverse species, and farm sizes of 1.1–2 ha contained greater species richness [83 ]. The agro-silviculture (62%) was found to be the most prevalent practice in homesteads of Kamalganj Upazila in the Moulvibazar district, and fruitful outputs from homestead agroforestry by farmers were noted in the shade, the daily need, additional income, soil erosion management, N-fixation [84 ]. In mid-hill, timber and bamboo facilitated high revenue generation that contributed to the household economy [8 ]. The economic prosperity of the Khasia community occurred due to the practice of betel leaf-based agroforestry in a home garden,s which contributed 79.73% of total agroforestry income [25 ]. Homestead forest served wood fuel by keeping a contribution of 78.75% where most identified species were Bot, Koroi, Mango, Tentul, Bamboo, Akashmoni, etc. [85 ]. In damar Upazila of Nilphamari district, Betel nut, Jackfruit, and Mango occupied homestead areas of 19.17%,10.34%, and 7.96%, respectively, and contributed 6.63% of household income [26 ]. In southwestern Bangladesh, 40% of species were used for multipurpose was 31% contributed to cash generation, which indicated livelihood subsistence significantly supported by homesteads in those localities [12 ]. Homesteads offered 11.8% of total household income and provided potential subsistence as 39.1% of homestead forests were utilized for household consumption, and 60.9% were utilized for marketing [27 ]. More than one-third of farmers were associated with planting Eucalyptus for multiple purposes, including pole and post, fuelwood, shade, soil rehabilitation, windbreak, and protection, while the mean annual increment stood at 10.68m3 /ha/year in Mir Sarai Chattogram [86 ]. In the Jessore district, 13% contributed to subsistence, followed by cash generation, where monthly contribution stood at 9% of average household income [28 ]. 72.97% of total species were recognized as economically useful, among which medicinal, timber, fruit, ornamental, vegetables, fuelwood, oil, spice, and fiber were detected 55.42%,10.24%,11.45%,10.84%,9.03%, 7.83%,4.22%,1.5%,2.41% respectively in respective districts of Tangail, Dhaka, Manikganj, and Gazipur [87 ]. Contributions in average annual income in Teknaf Peninsula were 49,36 and 6% in the hillside, beachside, and Shahpariar dwip, respectively [11 ]. The percent of usage of total homestead products was 33.2 contributed to self-consumption, whereas 66.8% of products were utilized for selling and 15.9% contribution generated by average household income [29 ]. The Homestead area occupied 61% of Tal trees, and it substantially helped in improving the rural economy through income and employment opportunities in the Jhalakathi district [88 ]. An analysis of investment return in Sandwip Upazila of Chattogram disclosed that homestead agroforestry was responsible for yielding a high benefit-cost ratio, high return, and net value by the production of Jackfruit, Coconut, Teak, Mahogany, etc. [30 ]. In char Gobadia, Mymensingh district, livelihood improvement relied upon the agroforestry system by increasing income related to plant richness [18 ]. Homestead agroforestry fulfilled the objectives of maximum production and increased income of large farmers who adopted multipurpose tree species greater than five Tangail district Gopalpur Upazila [31 ]. In terms of generating profitability, the identified species were Black plum, Hog plum, and Betel nut among fruit species, and Mahogany, Teak among timber species in Chhagalnaiya subdistrict, Feni district [32 ]. In the Moulvibazar district, the cash return annual income of Khasia tribes was increased by adopting betel leaf-based homestead agroforestry practices alongside the production of Jarul, Chapalish, Rata, Toon, Jackfruit, Simul, Kadam, Mango, Betelnut and others [89 ]. The agroforestry system of bean-betelnut was found most prevalent in the char land of Mymensingh, Sherpur, and Jamalpur, whereas Turmeric-ginger-mango was top-ranked in the hill ecosystem of Rangamati and Bandarban [33 ]. In the Panchagarh district, home gardens were partially allocated for planting betel leaves and nuts for sustainable profitability [90 ]. Farmers realized the economic importance of citrus production to satisfy their needs as annual income perceived a significant relation with the increasing number of citrus species in Barlekha, Moulvibazar [34 ]. Mahogany, Jackfruit, Mango, Date palm, etc., were profoundly planted by farmers to secure food requirements and alleviate poverty through their contribution to household income [2 ]. In northeastern Bangladesh, people planted a wide range of drought-tolerant plants such as Khair, Babla, Bel, Kadam, Betelnut, Jackfruit, etc., as a supplement to resin, timber, medicine, gum, nutrition, etc. [91 ]. A study of the northwestern agroecological zone found that Bamboo, Jackfruit, Mango, Betelnut, and Jujube were common trees in homesteads where women played a role in species selection, such as indigenous trees and exotic species [92 ]. Sweet gourds, Mahogany, and Mango, were planted as profitable species along with other perennial species of Coconut, Jackfruit, Date palm, Blackberry, Guava, Sissoo, Betel-nut, and Bamboo in the Rajshahi district [35 ]. The identified species for cash growth were Jackfruit and Mango in the Thakurgaon district [36 ]. In the ship-breaking area in Sitakund of Chattogram documented dominant species were Coconut, Eucalyptus, and Mango, where the dominant purpose of the plantation was deposit [93 ]. In the Natore district, the homesteads contained an average of 21.25 tree species, 10 agroforestry systems, and timber plants that had great economic value [37 ]. Farmers encountered planting trees on homestead primarily for economic purposes, which indicated that in poverty alleviation and household income ascendance, agroforestry practices on the homestead are capable enough [94 ]. Meanwhile, in Kapasia, Gazipur’s annual production was contributed mostly by home yards of homesteads [78 ]. Such practices in a piece of homestead render income opportunities and improve the livelihood. For instance, homestead gardening develops employment opportunity for women, ameliorate the environment through environmental resource conservation and sustainable management, and significantly impacts economic condition and home garden investment [38 ]. Meanwhile, for livelihood improvement and sustainable land use in Chattogram, homestead agroforestry practices were found efficient for nursery establishment, women’s employment opportunities, and increased productivity [95 ]. Training, varietal development, and seedling raising were found to be positive influencers, and farmers' preferences for these were responsible for improving the farm economy and livelihood. In terms of decision-making on homestead agroforestry, savings and expenditure decisions were predominantly taken by females in Kamalganj, Moulvibazar district [96 ]. The Agrosilvopastoral system was found to be followed by the Garo tribe, where homestead forest management was rendered by women [39 ]. In terms of affordable energy, both household categories of rich and medium farm size obtained biomass fuel of 44% and 49%, respectively, from homesteads, where 63% of females contributed to the collection of biomass fuel in the Chattogram region [97 ]. The evidences indicated that homestead agroforestry is capable enough in improving the livelihood status of rural people which can consequently result in rural empowerment.  3.3 Prospects of homestead agroforestry in environmental resources conservation Bangladesh is exposed to increased environmental pollution, where greenhouse gas emission is a major threat. In this aspect, homestead agroforestry could effectively measure sustainable resilience to climate change and biodiversity maintenance. The provisioning services of fruit consumption, fuelwood collection, bamboo extraction, and regulating services of climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, cooling effects, and environmental resource protection are supported by homestead agroforestry that increases ecological benefits such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. To satisfy self-consumption and expenditure, homestead areas could be a sustainable option through which disaster risk also could be reduced [98 ]. Farmers believed home gardens were an influential attribute of livelihood improvement by providing subsistence, family income, and efficient responsiveness towards climatic change [99 ]. Homestead gardening is an efficient platform for ecological balance maintenance and environmental stabilization [15 ]. It was explained as one of the contributory factors developed in response to food and cash demand, deterioration of water, and soil quality [100 ]. The unavailability of forests led farmers to depend on the homestead that fulfilled their requirement of wood fuel, nutrition, income, and protection from cyclones by homestead agroforestry products in Sandwip, off-shore Island [59 ]. The study in the Satkhira district revealed that almost all farmers adopted homestead agroforestry [101 ]. In Ullarpara of Sirajganj district, the average farmland size of a home garden was 0.07 ha which was the second major contributor to species diversification, and from there, 80% of farmers derived their fodder [102 ]. In biodiversity maintenance, the potential contributor identified Betel nut, Snake gourd, Red amaranth, and Mahogany in Ajmiriganj of Habiganj district [40 ]. To avoid shade problems for shade-intolerant species, farmers preferred Mahogany, Eucalyptus, Date palm, Indian ash tree, etc., in Ullarpara of Sirajganj [102 ]. Besides contribution to increasing income, sales, revenue, and land utilization, the total energy supply, biomass fuel harvest, multiple provisioning services, and substantial reduction in CO2 gas emissions were also accompanied by home gardens in Moheshkhali island, Cox’s Bazar district [103 ]. The high tree coverage, basal area, and height helped in carbon sequestration by storing substantial amounts of carbon and biomass carbon in Dighalia Upazila, Khulna district [104 ]. In the Rangpur district, the study revealed that total biomass and carbon stock were found above 53.53 mg/ha, whereas small home gardens contained 69.15 mg/ha of carbon stock [41 ]. In Peninsula, Cox’s Bazar biomass of 235.45 mg/ha and carbon of 117.73 mg/ha were recorded above ground coverage [11 ]. Such records of carbon sequestration pose a positive impact on the environment. Homestead forests can assure emission reduction and carbon sequestration. The homestead of high and medium altitudes detected containing efficient biomass carbon stock where one unit increased in species diversity elevated biomass stock by 23 mg C/ha and carbon sequestration detected by 89 mg C/ha [105 ]. In Northern Bangladesh, the analysis from a soil depth of 0–10 cm shrub homestead (soil organic carbon: phosphorus = 0.011, Soil nitrogen: phosphorus = 0.023),0–10 cm tree shrub homestead (soil nitrogen: phosphorus = 0.03), and 10–20 cm depth of soil (Carbon: nitrogen = p < 0.05) revealed that mixed plantation, diversifications or species richness were more effective for resources Conservation [106 ]. In Moheshkhali island of Cox’s Bazar, the determined carbon stocks due to one unit increase in diversity and species richness were 30 Mg C/ha and 22 Mg C/ha, respectively, where carbon stock was found greatest in the inland forest (51 Mg C/ha) and soil surface of hillside forests [107 ].  3.4 Dominant species coverage The farmers of Bangladesh are associated with planting diverse species of fruits, fodder, timber, medicinal, etc., among which most acted as Muti Purpose Tree Species (MPTS). As a result, the economy benefited from the significant coverage of tree species. Table 4   represents the dominant species and their respective coverage in different localities of Bangladesh.  3.5 Frequent dominant species in different localities Among all dominant species, Mango (N = 31), Areca (N = 28), Coconut (N = 25), Mahogany (N = 22), Jackfruit (N = 22), Acacia (N = 14), Banana (N = 14) were highly dominant in terms of prevalence whereas Bamboo (N = 10), Neem (N = 10), Papaya (n = 10), Raintree (N = 9), Turmeric (N = 8), Citrus (N = 7), Eucalyptus (N = 7), Guava (N = 7), Date palm (N = 6), Teak (N = 6), Sajna or Drumstick (N = 5) prevailed moderately. The rest of the detected dominant species were found at a lower frequency (Table 5  ). Fig. 3   depicts the intensity or prevalence of the dominant species. The division-wise distribution of dominant species revealed that Areca, Mahogany, and Jackfruit were common among all those found in all divisions as dominant species (Table 6  ). Mango and Coconut were also significant dominant species preferred by farmers in all divisions except Barisal and Rangpur. In Dhaka, the dominant species, Mango, followed by Jackfruit and Acacia, covered most of the cultivated homestead. Meanwhile, Coconut, followed by Mango and Areca, was most abundant in the Chattogram region. A similar scenario was quite evident for Khulna and Sylhet divisions. But the difference was that in Sylhet, Mango was the most frequent. Rajshahi and Barisal divisions had minimized coverage of dominant species where Mango and Jackfruit were quite popular. In contrast, Acacia and Areca were the most abundant dominant species in Mymensingh, followed by Mango, Coconut, and Jackfruit. Finally, in Rangpur, Mango, Mahogany followed by Areca and Jackfruit, were the most prevalent dominant species. In all respective divisions, Mango, Areca, Coconut, and Mahogany are the most significant dominant species farmers of Bangladesh prefer for their homestead area.  3.6 Homestead agroforestry scope towards sustainable development targets in Bangladesh From the above literature, it is quite evident that being an integrated part of life science, homestead agroforestry has already been accepted by all groups, including marginalized farmers. In this case, homestead agroforestry has developed the criteria for fulfilling SDGs directly, and in some cases, it acts as a pathway for fulfilling some vital targets indirectly (Table 7  ).   4 Constraints identified regarding homestead agroforestry expansion The major constraints of homestead agroforestry expansion are farmers' preference for conventional planting systems, monoculture cropping, manufacturing activities, natural disruptions, financial crisis, technological unavailability, etc. (Fig. 4  ). Traditional uses and a wide range of homestead plants indicate that Bangladesh needs to initiate the conservation of plant biodiversity [56 ]. Monoculture cropping, anthropogenic activities, natural causes, and pest intensifications disrupt biodiversity and species compositions [19 ]. Interspecific biodiversity of moderate to high exists in Bangladesh, where environmental and social factors of salinity and family need, respectively, the direct distribution pattern of species [42 ]. The backdated management system and inadequate scientific information are constraints, and it requires facilities of training, NGO (Non-Government Organization) support, and a management plan [44 ]. As a home garden is an effective ecological tool, the management plan requires carbon sequestration and tree diversity conservation [41 ]. The fruit and crop diversification system requires special attention for sustainability and biodiversity maintenance [43 ]. Farmers are exposed to impediments regarding quality planting materials supply, land scarcities, and financial instability, which urgently require emphasis on Nursery development and capacity building. Inadequate modern technological facilities, arable land, and inputs impede food security, and priority should be given to the efficient utilization of homesteads by intensifying the diversity or composition of tree species [82 ]. The limiting factors in expanding plant diversity were identified as insufficient quality planting stock [108 ]. The unavailability of planting materials and reliable sources are limiting constraints of betel leaf-based practices, which require technological support, infrastructure development support, GOs and NGOs support, and training for greater conservation and income generation [25 ]. Urbanization, sanitation, and homestead fragmentation were marked as factors responsible for decreasing plant biodiversity [80 ]. Along with urbanization, decreased farm size is described as a factor in restricting plant biodiversity in homesteads [109 ]. The reasons for fuelwood scarcity were high price, unsustainability, and fragmentation of homestead land in the Narsingdi district, and these necessitate sustainable management of forests, technical information, and support of the institution, extension workers, and forestry professionals [110 ]. Participatory action research programs unveiled the fact that farmers prioritize homestead tree plantation, but it is exposed to technical barriers, financial problems, and energy shortages [111 ]. Lack of interest, dissatisfactory market price, and environmental problems were responsible for declining citrus production [34 ]. Despite the existence of common species of Mango, Banana, Jackfruit, Neem, and Betelnut, the mismanaged cultural practices, lack of space and extension support, and unavailability of organic fertilizers and technologies, the homestead agroforestry were hindered [77 ]. The empirical study in the Mymensingh district concluded that even in small areas, homesteads were enriched with the sporadic distribution of plant species that urged an emphasis on providing training to homestead dwellers for technical and managerial flexibility [21 ]. In the Chattogram hill tract, shifting cultivation is exposed to vulnerability as unsuitability has been increasing due to population pressure, and in this situation, agroforestry is the alternative solution [112 ].  5 Recommended strategies in response to identified constraints To minimize the potential hindrances, structural emphasis should be given to aspects of socio-economic characteristics, conservation practices by genetic diversity maintenance and technological advancement, strong institutional support from government and non-government authorities, utilization of available land and resources, and further research and adoption of participatory approaches. Improving socio-economic characteristics is a way, as socio-economic characteristics of annual income, farm size, and knowledge positively affect plant species diversification [96 ]. The socio-economic status and livelihood can be advanced by appropriate agroforestry practices implementation [113 ]. In homestead afforestation, maximum women interplayed medium roles where their performance was positively influenced by training exposure, annual income, education qualifications, and Knowledge in the Mymensingh district [114 ]. As the education of forest owners was a determining factor in increased productivity in Bagerhat Sadar, education needed to be increased among farmers along with implementing forest policy [29 ]. Livelihood could be improved by increasing education levels and diversification [46 ]. In Teknaf Upazila of Cox’s Bazar, the income of large farm holders was comparatively higher, and all farm holders' income could be improved by designing a homestead system with compatible species [45 ]. In response to decreasing production of cereal, agronomic and horticultural crops, the homestead can be utilized for greater economic stability. The involvement of women can broaden income opportunities and species diversification [83 ]. In the aspect of conservation practices, the creation of genetic diversity and cash generation can be done by homestead agroforestry as it is the best alternative to monoculture cropping [16 ]. For species richness, propagation, provision, protection, and popularity, building for rare species need implementation for livelihood betterment, environmental resilience, and biodiversity conservation [9 ]. The disaster risks of cyclones and storm surges can be escaped by planting timber and fruit trees in homestead areas [98 ]. Technological advancement could be induced through conventional planting system improvement, lac culture, and sericulture can enlarge economic opportunities [79 ]. Scientific knowledge and techniques need improvement [91 ]. In homestead afforestation, women are exposed to underperformance due to a lack of quality planting materials, infestations by biotic agents, lack of knowledge, etc., which need solutions by supplying quality seeds, training facilities, encouraging social system and extension services, etc. [114 ]. Increasing tree coverage needs to be encouraged with institutional support from respective authorities, including govt and non-govt support [10 ]. Initiatives by authorities for positive attitude generation are commendable approach [75 ]. NGOs can play an active role in the utilization of land [95 ]. Govt should integrate high-value crops and betel leaf-based forests [89 ]. The Forest Department, local government, and council can ensure Sustainability and Conservation by providing technical advice and incentives on material support [103 ]. Insufficiency of technical knowledge and land area, finance, and awareness ranked as major constraints that could be improved by external support, financial support, technological advancement, and management plans [99 ]. Management practices, extension services, and research are important in improving species richness [36 ]. Home gardens should be enriched to reduce pressure on forests by utilizing marginal households, public roads, river banks, and railways [14 ]. The agroforestry system of jackfruit pineapple [115 ] could be an effective contributor to satisfying nutritional demand. Further studies for broadening the scope of increasing local biodiversity are recommended [20 ]. The efficiency of this sector can contribute to household need satisfaction and sustainable wood fuel distribution [85 ]. To expand livelihood capital, degradation reduction and the conduction of upland settlement projects are effective approaches to greater exploration [116 ]. Participatory forestry can be an effective strategy for livelihood improvement by employing farmers in tree plantations that contribute to income generation and encourage plantation [117 ]. Hence, the strategic and structural approaches need execution for broadening the scope of homestead agroforestry expansion in the context of Sustainable Development Goals.  6 Conclusion Homestead agroforestry is a thriving forestry practice that is enormously adopted in every rural household. Regarding food security, nutritional security, and welfare, homestead agroforestry is recognized in Bangladesh. The preference for this practice is also commendable. Again, it is widely adopted among various groups regardless of the farm category, social status, community, etc. As a result, different groups of people get the opportunity to improve their livelihood by introducing a wide range of plant species that satisfy self-consumption and generate income opportunities. The participation of a different group of people, including men, women, and ethnic community, in homestead agroforestry help in broadening their employment opportunity. As a result, these positively impact the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction and carbon stock. Hence, climatic resilience is obtained. The abundant species coverage fulfils the objectives of self-consumption and subsistence that ultimately bring out well-being. The propensity of beneficial outputs has great remarks on achieving sustainable development goals. Hence, the literature review on food security, livelihood improvement, and environmental resources conservation expressed that homestead agroforestry possessed a great connection with sustainable development goals. Homesteads of Bangladesh possess a satisfactory plant species diversity and coverage that facilitate species conservation and provides food, fuel, or timber, besides contributing to livelihood improvement and resource conservation. As a result, the contribution is praiseworthy in achieving SDGs and fulfilling the relevant targets. Therefore, Bangladesh has enormous scope to utilize its potential success. Although this sector is exposed to limitations such as the rapid practice of conventional planting systems and monoculture cropping patterns, anthropogenic and environmental influence, lack of technology and institutional support, backdated knowledge, scarcity of land, and lack of enthusiasm towards the practices. The elimination of such constraints through a structurally recommended strategic approach in terms of socio-economic development, conservation practices, technological advancement, institutional support improvement, sustainable land utilization, intensive research, and homestead agroforestry program implementation can help in the successful execution of sustainable development goals. Fruitful consequences can be derived by imposing potential concerns on this sector.
