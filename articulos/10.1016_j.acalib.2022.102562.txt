Keywords United Nations 2030 agenda  Sustainable development goals  The Chinese University of Hong Kong Library    Introduction The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a global plan to fight poverty, to establish equality and justice, and to achieve sustainable development for all countries. It consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets covering a wide spectrum of social and economic development issues. To enhance graduate's global competitiveness, the Chinese University of Hong Kong has been promoting the wide understanding of the SDGs within the university community. In 2021, the Chinese University of Hong Kong Library (CUHK Library) launched its Strategic Plan 2021–2025 to align with the University's Strategic Plan 2021–2025 in education, research and Innovation, resources, global and alumni engagement, and infrastructure. CUHK Library embraces social responsibility and sustainable development when upgrading its infrastructure to support the University developments. This study discusses the way in which the Chinese University of Hong Kong Library supports the SDGs in the university community (The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Library, 2022g ).  Sustainable development goals in the Chinese university of Hong Kong Launched on 8 January 2018, the Hong Kong Chapter of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN Hong Kong) is co-hosted by The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and The Chinese University of Hong Kong. It aims to mobilize experts from different backgrounds in Hong Kong including academic institutions, government organizations, business enterprises, and other knowledge centres to focus on practical problem solving for sustainable development. The roles of the SDSN Hong Kong include:➢ Raising awareness about the SDGs and ‘localizing’ the goals;  ➢ Promoting solution initiatives for sustainable development in the region;  ➢ Promoting education for sustainable development;  ➢ Assisting the government in identifying local, national, and regional sustainable development challenges and in devising long-term strategies. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2022c )    In terms of governance, the SDSN Hong Kong consists of two levels, namely the SDSN Hong Kong Leadership Council and the SDSN Hong Kong Executive Committee. The remits of the SDSN Hong Kong Leadership Council are: (1) To develop the vision and goals that will guide and direct the work and development of SDSN Hong Kong; (2) To encourage and support by providing guidance to the implementation of sustainable development projects by SDSN Hong Kong including its youth chapter; (3) To review and approve major outputs and reports issued under SDSN Hong Kong; and (4) To mobilize strategic partners and members of SDSN Hong Kong for the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2022e ) Being the executive arm of the SDSN Hong Kong Leadership Council, the remits of the SDSN Hong Kong Executive Committee are: (1) To consider and note financial, programmatic and other operational matters on behalf of the SDSN Hong Kong Leadership Council; (2) To advise the SDSN Hong Kong Leadership Council on strategic matters before such matters are brought for discussion at the Council; (3) To recommend to the SDSN Hong Kong Leadership Council on the filling of any vacancies of the Council and council committees; and (4) To deal with any matters that may be referred to it by the SDSN Hong Kong Leadership Council from time to time. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2022d ). In the past four years, SDSN Hong Kong has been engaging in a wide range of activities which can be broadly categorized into the following three major scopes:➢ Scope A: Communicating Sustainable Development Goals  ➢ Scope B: Research and Knowledge Transfer  ➢ Scope C: Engagement and Action (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2022f )   Unlabelled Table    Scope A Scope B Scope C   ▪ CUHK Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change  ▪ SDG Youth Survey  ▪ SDG Forum Series  ▪ Distinguished Lecture on Sustainable Development  ▪ Jockey Club UNESCO Hong Kong Association Global Citizenship Education Project  ▪ Philanthropy for Better Cities Forum  ▪ ‘Why are we so miserable when things are getting better?’ Seminar    ▪ CUHK Institute of Environment, Energy and Sustainability  ▪ Institute of Future Cities  ▪ CUHK–University of Exeter Joint Centre for Environmental Sustainability and Resilience  ▪ The CUHK Jockey Club Institute of Ageing    ▪ Jockey Club–CUHK Climate Action  ▪ The Drama of Climate Change: The Creation of a Low-carbon Future  ▪ CUHK I•CARE Programme  ▪ SDSN Youth          The CUHK is a socially responsible institution of higher education and is determined to contribute to sustainable development in Hong Kong and beyond. As stipulated in the CUHK Strategic Plan 2021–2025, Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development is one of its seven key areas of success matrix in this five-year plan. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2022b ) Established in January 2021, the Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development Office (SRSDO) ‘is charged to advise senior management on key areas of university social responsibility and to execute, evaluate and enhance the university social responsibility action initiatives outlined in the Strategic Plan’. In terms of management, the SRSDO consists of four sections including:▪ Sustainable Development Section    Responsible for on-campus and inter-institutional sustainable development matters through the following initiatives: Energy Efficiency implementation Fund, Green Office Programme, Plastic Free Campus, and Sustainable Development Goals Action Fund.▪ Smart Campus Section    Responsible for managing the smart campus initiative and space planning including Campus Planning Matters and The Smart CUHK Challenge▪ Climate Action Section    This Section is the outreach arm of the University's sustainable development and climate action function and the manager of the Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change to support the MoCC, Virtual Tour, Exhibitions, and News & Events.▪ Global Communications Section    Responsible for liaison with CUHK's global partners in USR and sustainable development and serving as the secretariat of SDSN Hong Kong to support both the SDSN Hong Kong and the SDSN Youth Hong Kong. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2022a ).  Strategic implementation of SDGS in CUHK library Recognizing the holistic approach of adopting sustainability in the library strategy and setting up a clear environmental policy and strategy embedded in library routines, CUHK Library was awarded the Runner Up of the IFLA Green Library Award in 2017. (Charney, 2017 ). It is however beyond the scope of this paper to address the green policy and strategy implemented by CUHK Library. In the following sections, the authors focus on the way in which CUHK Library supports the SDGs, including healthy lives and wellness (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being), reading promotion and digital and information literacy (SDG 4: Quality Education), encouraging innovation and creativity (SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and access to information (SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), in the university. Healthy lives and wellness (SDG 3: Good health and well-being) Activities on good health and well-being Cultivating students' well-being is one of the key areas in the CUHK Strategic Plan 2021–25. CUHK Library has been collaborating with different units in the University to develop activities and programmes on this area. Dr. Dog visits during examinations CUHK Library has been working with uBuddies, a student programme under the management of Office of Student Affairs, to organize Dr. Dog visits in the main and branch libraries. Dr. Dog is an animal-assisted programme offered by an organization Animals Asia (Animal Asia, 2022 ). During the visits, pets, pet owners and the Dr. Dog Programme Manager went to the main library and branch libraries during the examination period to let students take a break from the tight schedule of the examinations. These Dr. Dog visits are popular among students. (Office of Student Affairs, 2022 ).  Cheer-up measures during the final examination Free candies for students are available at the helpdesks in CUHK Library during the final examination period to show support to students. Students also set up display kiosks for sharing encouragement messages among peers in the Library.   LibGuide on positive psychology CUHK Library has also been developing resources on good health and well-being of students such as the library guide on positive psychology aims at introducing available resources from CUHK Library and the University to students. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Library, 2022b ).   Reading promotion and digital and information literacy (SDG 4: Quality education) Reading promotion To let students enjoy the sheer of reading, CUHK Library has set up the Good Reads Corner at the main library and Library's Pick at its branch libraries. It aims to promote a wider reading culture and encourage more leisure reading on campus. The library regularly selects a list of books with international and local book awards, or in bestseller lists. Students can browse the print books at the Good Reads Corner or Library's Pick. They can also access the booklists online at the Good Reads webpage. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Library, 2022c ). The Library collaborated with other departments and units to organize campus-wide reading promotion activities. During the pandemic, the library has invited teaching staff from different faculty to conduct online book talks to students.  Digital and information literacy CUHK Library has been promoting digital and information literacy as life-long skills to students. CUHK Library has participated in developing the MOOC: InfoLit for U. This is a self-paced, non-credit bearing MOOC on information literacy which is designed by the library of all 8 UGC-funded universities in Hong Kong. It is suitable for students in all years of undergraduate study and it includes two main parts: “Inquiry & Research” module and 8 discipline-related elective modules. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Library, 2022f ). CUHK Library has been developing different series of workshops to promote digital, data and information literacy, such as Sharpen Your Information Research Skills Series, Academic Honesty Series, Assignment Season Series, Research Skills Workshops Series, Publishing Your Research Workshops, E -Resources Workshops, Researcher Workshops, Open Access: OA Publishing Pilot @CUHK, Digital Scholarship and Research Data Workshops and Maker Skills Series.   Encouraging innovation and creativity (SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure) Digital scholarship lab CUHK Library has redesigned the library space to develop the Digital Scholarship Lab. It aims to create a technology-rich space to showcase digital scholarship research as well as to provide venue support to research meetings, seminars, workshops, conferences, instructional classes. Digital Scholarship team offers consultation to digital scholarship tools and methods, application of specific software, data visualization and metadata creation. Digital Scholarship projects include: GIS Mapping and Archaeology of Early China - Phase I: Shang Archaeology, Text Data Preparation: A Practice in R using the Sheng Xuanhuai Collection, “(Re-)Mining” An Annotated Bibliography of the Classical Writings of Hong Kong Poets for Social Network Study, etc. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Library, 2022a ).  Learning garden and MakerSpace The Learning Garden has been providing 3D printing and scanning equipment, and a collaborative working space alongside with high-performance multimedia workstations. To move forward, a MakerSpace in the Learning Garden has been renovated to support creative learning. It contains:• Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) concept applications and development  • Creative media production of digital content  • A flexible prototyping and fabrication workspace with hot benches, laser cutter, 3D printers and scanners for hands-on workshops and classes    It aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration among CUHK students and staff. A number of workshops on maker skills have been organized. In 2021, the Library has collaborated with various departments to organize CUHK Data Hack. It aimed at promoting innovation skills, including data and digital competency and enhancing multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional collaboration among CUHK students and staff. The Data Hack was organized in both on-site and online mode. In total around 70 students registered and around 30 students attended the final presentation. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Library, 2022d ).   Access to information (SDG 16: peace, justice and strong institutions) A shared integrated library system: LibrarySearch  The CUHK Library has upgraded from a separate library management system to a shared integrated library system since 2017. This shared system manages the print, electronic and digital collections of eight government funded university libraries in Hong Kong. It aims at improving workflow among the eight university libraries in Hong Kong and providing a single point of access to print, electronic and digital collections to library users (The Joint University Librarians Advisory Committee, 2022 ). CUHK Library has branded its library system as LibrarySearch , which provides a one-stop search of the Library's collection including books, audio-visuals, journal articles. It can also search the CUHK Examination Papers, CUHK Thesis and Dissertations, Special Collections via LibrarySearch .  (The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Library, 2022e ).  CUHK digital repository To preserve significant works from the Library's special collections and donation, CUHK Library has started creating its digital collections since 1995. The CUHK Digital Repository is a one-stop repository for accessing all the publicly available digital content created and maintained by the CUHK Library. It aims to promote access and sharing of these materials and to support research and learning. CUHK Digital Repository houses millions of digital files in different disciplines ranging from literature, culture, arts, politics, society and religion. Formats include rare/semi rare books, journal articles, correspondences and manuscripts, oracle bones, photos, and audio-visual files. The latest collections are Lingnan Rare Book Collection, Chinese in Cuba Archive, Hong Kong Early Tabloid Newspapers, etc. (The Chinese University of Hong Kong Library, 2022a ).    Concluding remarks In this paper, the authors first introduce the way in which the Chinese University of Hong Kong has been promoting the wide understanding of the SDGs within the university community by co-hosting the SDSN Hong Kong and setting up the SRSDO. Second the authors review the strategic implementation of SDGs in CUHK Library by examining SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions with practical examples. The authors conclude that academic library can contribute to the student development of global citizenship by implementing the SDGs of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Despite the increasing emphasis of sustainability in libraries globally, there has been little discussion in the scholarly literature about the adoption of SDGs in Hong Kong academic libraries. The findings of this paper can also contribute to the discussions of SDGs in academic libraries from regional as well as international perspectives.    References Asia, 2022, April 17 A.
