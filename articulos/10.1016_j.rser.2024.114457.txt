                  Under the banner of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), governments, industry, and civil society organisations have supported many energy access projects since 2015. Notably, funding and investments allotted to renewable energy are regarded not only to provide ‘energy for all’ but also support the delivery of other SDGs related to climate change, food security, health, and poverty reduction, among others. With less than 10 years left to meet the SDG 7 targets, it is timely to take stock and examine how the provision of access to energy is driving development initiatives, impacting local communities, and influencing governance processes. This paper offers a critical review and analysis of the impact of access to energy projects based on empirical work from eight country case studies across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It interrogates how these projects contribute towards achieving SDG 7 and other sustainable development goals, highlights challenges, and then draws lessons for research, policy, and development practice. To advance SDGs, it recommends action in four areas: addressing rural-urban disparities, ensuring that energy is linked to sustainable outcomes, balancing top-down and bottom-up agendas, and appraising implications of techno-economic factors.

Under the banner of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), governments, industry, and civil society organisations have supported many energy access projects since 2015. Notably, funding and investments allotted to renewable energy are regarded not only to provide ‘energy for all’ but also support the delivery of other SDGs related to climate change, food security, health, and poverty reduction, among others. With less than 10 years left to meet the SDG 7 targets, it is timely to take stock and examine how the provision of access to energy is driving development initiatives, impacting local communities, and influencing governance processes. This paper offers a critical review and analysis of the impact of access to energy projects based on empirical work from eight country case studies across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It interrogates how these projects contribute towards achieving SDG 7 and other sustainable development goals, highlights challenges, and then draws lessons for research, policy, and development practice. To advance SDGs, it recommends action in four areas: addressing rural-urban disparities, ensuring that energy is linked to sustainable outcomes, balancing top-down and bottom-up agendas, and appraising implications of techno-economic factors.

Energy access projects under the SDG 7 banner have therefore received increased support from governments, industry, and civil society organisations, with funding and investments directed towards renewables and clean energy. Despite these, assessments show that progress in delivering the SDGs remains slow; 675 million people do not have access to electricity, and 2.3 billion still lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking [2 ]. Many reasons account for this, including: (1) population growth leading to an increase in energy demand (2) increase in the use of traditional biomass (e.g., fuelwood, charcoal), for heating in energy-intensive regions such as parts of Asia and Africa, (3) context-specific challenges related to geographical conditions and technological limitations such as availability of resources, and (4) governance, where the lack of high-level political commitment, ambitious national and subnational strategies, and slow mobilisation of investment present barriers to delivery [3 ]. These multi-faceted challenges mean that the current scale of efforts to increase progress towards the delivery of the SDGs has not been sufficient to meet the targets set by 2030 [4 ]. This paper takes stock and examines where gaps and opportunities exist for addressing these challenges. Its aim is to identify lessons that will be helpful in replicating good practices and maximising co-benefits from increased energy access. To do so, it seeks to answer the question: what have the academic, industry, and development sectors learned about the implications of delivering energy projects in the Global South since the implementation of the SDGs?  Current academic literature has been useful in providing environmental, economic, and technical assessments to review SDGs and their progress. However, with limited empirical work based on real-world data and field research to complement quantitative assessments, implementation of energy access projects can have unintended consequences (e.g., in terms of governance and resource access) or unfulfilled co-benefits [5 ,6 ]. This paper helps to fill this gap by offering evidence on the ‘realities’ of renewable energy access projects in the Global South, drawing lessons from eight countries across Africa (Kenya, Malawi, Ghana, South Africa), Asia (Myanmar and the Philippines), and Latin America (Colombia and Chile). It does this by examining the strategies employed to deliver access to energy projects in these countries, and critically analysing their effectiveness in contributing to SDG 7 and other sustainable development goals. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2  reviews the wider literature on SDG 7, its specific targets and current progress. Section 3  describes the case studies in each country and provides contextual insights around the policy, governance, technologies, business models, livelihoods, and climate and natural environment that impact on energy access projects. Section 4  presents the analysis, centring discussions around emergent key areas of action should SDG 7 achieve its targets by 2030. Based on these, Section 5  offers recommendations for policy, research, and development practice.  2 Review of progress and challenges in delivering energy access There are three distinct targets under SDG 7: provision of access to electricity and clean cooking, deploying renewable energy, and increasing energy efficiency [7 ]. This section summarises progress against each target based on the 2023 Energy Progress Report [2 ] and then discusses factors that limit progress. 2.1 What has been achieved 2.1.1 SDG 7.1 – increase in access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services, with national and regional variations In 2021, 91 % of the global population had access to electricity (SDG 7.1.1) compared to 87 % in 2015 when SDGs were first introduced (Fig. 1  ) due to the accelerated deployment of affordable on- and off-grid electrification options. This leaves 675 million people without access to electricity, with inequalities within and between nations. Most of those lacking access to electricity live in rural areas where electrification rates are approximately 80 % compared to 97 % for urban areas. Sixty-nine per cent (69 %) of the global population who lack access to electricity are in Sub-Saharan Africa which has significantly lower levels of rural access (27 % of rural population) compared to 47 % in total. There are variations within the region, for example Malawi has just 10 % rural access compared to 72 % in Kenya. Access to clean cooking solutions (SDG 7.1.2) remains mostly unchanged since 2015, partly because population growth is outpacing the rate at which people gain access to clean cooking technologies. Globally, over 2.3 billion people still rely on traditional biomass, kerosene, and coal as fuel. In contrast to electricity, 64 % of the population who lack access to clean cooking are in Asia compared to 32 % in Africa. Similar to SDG 7.1.1, there are significant variations between urban (83 %) and rural (37 %) areas, most notably in the Sub-Saharan and Oceanian (excluding Australia and New Zealand) region. Overall, Asian countries made significant improvements in clean cooking by using gaseous fuels (liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas and biogas) while advances in Sub-Saharan Africa have stagnated.  2.1.2 SDG 7.2 – increase in share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, mainly in the power sector The increase in the share of renewables (including traditional biomass1  1 Traditional biomass refers to residential consumption of solid biofuels (wood, charcoal, agricultural residues, and animal dung) burned with basic techniques, such as traditional open cookstoves and fireplaces in non-OECD countries. In OECD countries, biomass (split logs) is used in fireplaces, but they are not covered in this analysis. Although in principle, the focus of renewables for biomass is to encourage modern generation and use.  ) in total final energy consumption (TFEC) has been relatively small since 2015, rising to 19.1 % in 2020 from 16.7 % (Fig. 2  ). The fastest growth in renewables was in the power sector accounting for about 25 % of global electricity consumption with lower deployment of modern renewables in the heat and transport sectors. Whilst transport has the lowest share of renewables, REN21 [8 ] reports that this sector has one of the fastest rates of renewable energy adoption (more than 7 % yearly) along with agriculture. Traditional biomass still provides 12 % of global heat consumption, and modern renewables 9.2 %. For transport the share of renewables was just 3.3 %, mainly as liquid biofuels, with 60 % of consumption coming from the US and Brazil. The distribution of renewables and the role of traditional biomass differs regionally. Traditional use of biomass is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, which is gradually being replaced by gaseous fuels and modern renewables. Similar trends are observed in Central and Southern Asia and to some extent Latin America and the Caribbean regions.  2.1.3 SDG 7.3 – varied rates of improvement in energy efficiency regionally, with biggest sectoral improvement in transport The goal of SDG 7.3 is to double energy efficiency improvements by 2030, which requires at least 3 % reduction in energy intensity per year from 2020; there have been some improvements in energy intensity across all economic sectors since 2015, but they vary between regions (Fig. 3  ) and end-use sectors. The transport (freight and passenger) sector has achieved the biggest improvements in energy intensity, followed by the service and agriculture sectors. In Sub-Saharan Africa, energy demand is driven by an energy intensive pattern of economic growth whereas in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia economic growth has been less energy intensive. Latin America and the Caribbean have the lowest energy intensity. Improvements in manufacturing processes such as automation, a shift towards high-value activities that create more GDP per unit of energy consumed, and the use of digital technologies have all contributed to facilitating progress toward improved energy efficiency in Eastern and South-Eastern Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and China. Despite progress towards achieving all areas of SDG 7, much work is needed if 2030 goals are to be met. Addressing challenges will differ between nations and sectors, but both centralised and decentralised renewable electricity generation have a major role to play in achieving SDG 7 and SDG 13 (Climate Action) along with increasing electrification of heat and transport [9 ]. These energy transitions must be enabled with new policies, business models, and investment which must be inclusive and enabled by improved understanding of energy use by all social groups, including women and children. This will help achieve SDG 7 whilst offering opportunities to support the achievement of other SDGs.   2.2 What limits progress 2.2.1 Synergies and trade-offs The SDGs are intended to apply to all countries and actors (universal goals) and should be achieved through integrated policies across SDGs (indivisible goals). That said, whilst it is intended that the SDGs should be treated holistically, interactions between the goals and their policy implications are neither specified nor well understood [7 ]. Academic researchers have sought to fill this gap to support policy development [3 ,10 ], with a large, and ever increasing, number of studies that aim to improve the understanding of the interactions between SDGs. To understand the complex links between SDGs, modelling studies can quantify current and future synergies and trade-offs [11 ,12 ], and reviews can synthesise insights from a large body of work [3 ,10 ,13 ]. The synergies and trade-offs between energy (SDG 7) and other SDGs have been the focus of reviews by Castor et al. [4 ], Rosenthal et al. [14 ], Fuso Nerini et al. [13 ], and McCollum [3 ]. SDG 7 cuts across all SDGs with 113 of the 169 SDG targets requiring changes to energy systems [13 ]. Energy policies, and the way they are implemented, affect other SDG objectives; however, the positive interactions between SDG 7 and other SDGs outweigh, both in size and number, negative ones [3 ,13 ]. A trade-off with SDG 1 (No poverty) could occur where the costs of renewable energy deployment fall more on the poor as a result of poor policy instrument design. To counteract this, for example, revenues from carbon pricing could be recycled to protect lower income households from price rises [3 ]. Similarly, if bioenergy production competes with food production for land or water, this will impact SDG 2 (Zero hunger) [3 ,13 ]. Synergies occur, for example, where access to modern energy services, such as lighting or cook stoves, frees up time for other productive uses (SDG 1) [3 ,13 ]. The SDGs are a global agenda implemented through actions on the ground, hence the interactions between SDGs and their consequences are context specific [3 ,10 ,13 ]. The outcomes of these interactions will differ at different timeframes and in different places depending on many factors including geography, resources, institutions, policies to achieve targets, and governance structure. Context is particularly important for the Global South, where levels of access to clean energy are lower than in the Global North (Fig. 1 ). Increasing access to clean energy occurs within the context of a need, and will, to support efforts to reduce poverty (SDG 1), improve healthcare (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4). These come alongside related challenges and opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13) and the need to increase the renewable energy share (Fig. 2 ) and reduce vulnerabilities of those living without access to energy. Energy systems must, therefore, evolve to support meeting these development needs, which at the same time will increase demands for clean energy (SDG 7) [11–13 ]. Meeting this challenge will differ according to the context, as every region, country, or community will have different resources and capacities to implement projects that seek to achieve the SDGs.  2.2.2 Contextual influences Achieving SDG 7 is most important to rural communities in the Global South, where 59 % of the world's poor continue to rely on agriculture for income and traditional use of biomass to meet their energy needs [15–17 ]. Deploying new energy sources in these areas has the potential to benefit local communities, reducing poverty and pollution and improving health. However, poorly designed projects – for example, the building of large-scale renewable generation, often with international funding, changes traditional access and resource use rights of local communities – can have significant negative consequences for host communities, exacerbating poverty and food security [6 ,18 ,19 ]. Similarly, deployment of renewable energy could support the development of domestic manufacturing supply chains, but it is often an opportunity for international companies to exert and enhance their market dominance [20 ]. These contexts are often not considered in energy access statistics which present access as a binary (have/have not). However, access to energy does not guarantee that the supply is affordable, clean or reliable [21 ]. Poor supply affects households, businesses, and services such as medical care alike, impacting on health and productivity to name but two, bringing additional costs where back-up generators are provided [22 ]. Access to energy is a continuum, and thus can have varying approaches to provision, diverse inputs, and dissimilar outcomes depending both on the scale and location of the system deployed [23 ]. Location and scale of energy systems.   There are debates on the relative effectiveness of the deployment of large scale, smaller scale, or off-grid energy systems to provide energy in rural areas and achieve SDG 7. Large-scale grids, bringing electricity from centralised production, can provide significant demand provided significant infrastructure investments into rural areas can be secured from governments, international donors, and private companies. However, the power generated by large-scale schemes may not meet local, rural demand for electricity and local communities may suffer adverse impacts and reap few benefits. Kenya's 365 turbine Lake Tukana wind farm, built with international investment and providing 17 % of the country's installed renewable energy capacity, is one example of a large-scale project that is central to national development plans, but controversial locally. A report for the overseas investors by NIRAS Africa [24 ] concluded that there are positive benefits for those working at the site, through the provision of new water sources and that the projects brings stability to an area long-marginalised. The approach to development, however, and the economic value placed on the land, has ignored the historic and cultural values of local pastoralist communities, and the economic, social and cultural rights of local people have not been protected [25 ]. Schilling et al. [19 ] highlight that the project did not provide expected compensation for changes in access to land or meet expectations for local employment. Small-scale grids and off-grid systems can be built by a more diverse range of investors for the specific area, so whilst many Governments in sub-Saharan Africa are planning for electrification via the extension of national grids, electrification may be better achieved via decentralised solutions [22 ]. In sub-Saharan Africa, research by Aliyu et al. [26 ] and Chirambo [27 ] suggests that lack of financing and interest from investors in small-scale energy systems has constrained the deployment of renewable energy systems in the region. This lack of investment is due to the high upfront costs required for renewable energy deployment, the low incentives available (from governments or outside donors like the UNDP) for private investment in the Global South, and lack of legal frameworks that support renewable energy investment in sub-Saharan Africa [22 ]. To overcome these challenges, investment in localised, small-scale energy systems can not only bring electricity and contingent development opportunities to unelectrified rural villages across the Global South but also reduces the high infrastructure costs of grid extension to largely remote rural areas [28 ]. Design and business model.   A key noted element of successful deployment of small-scale energy systems is the use of innovative business models. For example, shifting from a grants-based financing model to unlocking private sector investment through venture capital, debt financing, cross-subsidies, or equity financing [29 ,30 ]. Alongside innovative payment solutions such as pay-as-you-go, fee-for-service, leasing and renting, and third-party financing [30 ], these innovative solutions have markedly narrowed the energy access gap. However, from an environmental standpoint, small-scale solar systems, for example, lack regulatory control on standards. Therefore, they have shorter life-spans and lower energy yield compared to larger installations, causing a significant environmental burden when considered in terms of their full life cycle [31 ,32 ]. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, solar energy projects are in the nascent stages of implementation, however clear policy guidelines and investment in facilities for handling end of life waste are required to ensure that the sector does not create a pollution legacy. This needs to be considered at the outset, and novel business models will, therefore, be an essential part of a process that will require time, resources and capacity to be properly implemented [33 ]. Accordingly, the design and model for ambitions of a fully 100 % renewable energy system have been presented in the literature [34 ], but work in the Global South, including countries in Africa [35 ] and in small island developing states [36 ] have mainly focused on electrical power without significant integration with other forms of energy demand. There is also a research gap on implementation pathways that ensure equitable access to the benefits of renewable energy. If the development of energy systems and business models remains limited to local and short-term strategies, acceleration of progress in SDG 7 will remain slow. Policy and financial drivers.   In Asia, small scale and decentralised systems such as solar home systems, micro-hydro, and small wind systems can improve access to energy in off-grid areas [37 ]. However, where such projects are deregulated and led by private enterprise electrification becomes subject to market forces, which can lead to higher costs for consumers and the environment [38 ]. Barbier [39 ] highlights the importance of understanding sectoral and economy-wide implications of energy policies upon poorer people, in order to design and implement policies that reduce poverty rather than hinder its alleviation. One example of this is payment for avoided deforestation, a project which contributes to climate change mitigation and eases pressure on forest resources for traditional biomass, but leaves local communities either without access to energy, with more expensive alternatives (e.g. modern cookstoves), or forced to ignore the law [39 ,40 ]. A number of studies (e.g., Refs. [41 ,42 ]) have also highlighted how renewable energy initiatives especially those which deliver technocratic solutions, can bring an unintended financial burden to local communities they are targeting [43 ,44 ]. These tensions between achieving SDG 7 and other SDGs emphasise the importance of planning for energy access whilst also considering the impacts that projects may have on local development and the needs of the rural poor. Scholars also see the provision of localised and affordable energy as a way of delivering justice-based energy systems – where energy is distributed fairly and democratically with recognition of prior economic positioning [13 ,45 ]. For example, Bhattacharyya [43 ] suggests that under fair financing schemes and/or cost-sharing, renewable energy systems can be instrumental in delivering access to electricity and supporting livelihoods in rural or off-grid communities. Institutional structures.   The integration of dedicated off-grid renewable energy policies across various agendas, financing mechanisms, and institutions is pivotal to achieving universal access to modern energy. Off-grid solutions are relevant, particularly in the isolated rural areas, where grid connections are not viable and reductions in the cost of technology creating a competitive alternative for extension of electricity access [46 ]. In some countries, however, achieving a transition to environmentally friendly, inclusive, and socially sustainable energy systems is hindered by institutional structures that favour-centralised approaches to energy provision and a preference for market-based approaches [47 ,48 ]. Market actors can therefore drive investment decisions, influencing participatory planning and restricting the participation of communities. This has led to options for decentralised or distributed energy generation not always being considered [47 ]. Delivering the SDG 7 targets is challenging, and the challenges differ across regions, depending on many factors including economic and institutional capacities, geographical resources, and the starting point of energy access. The next section presents case studies from eight countries that have achieved different levels of progress towards energy access, and which offer lessons for achieving SDG 7 in a variety of contexts. In particular, examples from Kenya, Myanmar, Philippines, Ghana, Malawi and Colombia illustrate the importance of affordable on and off-grid electrification together with decentralised technologies, particularly for off-grid areas in lower income economies. Cases from Kenya and the Philippines additionally demonstrate how off-grid solutions and newer business models could be key to meeting energy and development needs, including improving the environmental legacy of energy provision. Whilst examples from Chile and South Africa highlight policy approaches for the deployment of renewable energy.    3 Case studies Eight countries from the Global South were selected for this study to evidence a variety of on-the-ground realities about the challenges and opportunities for SDG 7 implementation (See Table 1  ). These countries represent different economies, energy markets, levels of energy access, and integration of renewable energy technologies, and thus have different pathways and priorities for SDG 7. This allowed drawing of lessons across a range of contexts. The case studies are grouped geographically in this section to allow the investigation of varied themes and contextual issues from the intersection of SDG 7 and other SDGs by region. Each case study employed different methodological approaches relevant to the countries' challenges, providing a range of social and technical perspectives on SDG 7 implementation. Table 2   provides an extensive list and description of the methods used in each case study. In Malawi, semi-structured interviews were conducted with farmers involved in energy crop production in the Blantyre region. Interviews with farmers were also conducted in Myanmar's Ayeyarwady region, as well as focus group discussions with actors in the rice value chain to explore the potential of rice husk bioenergy. Technical process modelling, economic assessment, and life cycle assessment (LCA) were the main methods used in the Philippines to explore off-grid electrification and in Colombia to evaluate the potential of coffee residue gasification to supply energy to coffee farms. The Kenya case study also used LCA and combined interviews and workshops to analyse business models for solar energy generation. Document and policy analysis were used in case studies of national renewable energy transitions in Ghana, Chile, and South Africa. Whilst Global South countries are heterogenous and the situations presented here are context-specific, the aim of this paper is to identify transferable lessons from these cases. The case studies described here explore advances in energy access and transition, environmental and socio-economic issues, and policy and governance by referring to a question relevant to energy challenges of the country. The implications of the findings and emerging themes across the cases are then discussed in Section 4 . 3.1 Africa 3.1.1 Ghana: do national policies on access to energy and electrification promote climate action? Supplying electricity to Ghana's remote and inland communities is challenging due to their distance from the main electricity grid. Compounding this challenge is the inadequate quality of the electricity network infrastructure, resulting in frequent power outages. Meanwhile, the demand for electricity is rapidly increasing [64 ,65 ]. Effective implementation of policies aligned with Climate Action (SDG 13) faces obstacles arising from competing institutional agendas and interests, institutional capacity, lack of coordination between sectors and institutions, and competing planning priorities for SDGs and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) [51 ,65 ]. Ghana's first Strategic National Energy Plan (SNEP) from 2006 to 2020, aims to provide universal access to national electricity to all communities by 2020 and achieve 10 % renewable energy (excluding >100 MW hydro) supply in 2030 [50 ]. However, there is significant under-investment for the integration of new renewable systems and in reality, <1 % was achieved [51 ,64 ]. Reliance on large power stations such as Akosombo hydro (1020 MW) for electricity does not necessarily provide energy access to the rural population nor contributes positively to poverty reduction, health, and education outcomes within those communities [4 ]. Additionally, new large hydropower in the tropics is inconsistent with the Paris climate objectives and adversely impacts SDG 13 [51 ]. Promoting energy efficiency, demand management and renewables through solar, wind and bioenergy using microgrids in remote communities could enable both SDG 13 and SDG 7 better than relying on the grid electricity. Moreover, they positively contribute to energy security in a changing geopolitical world order. The microgrid study shows that even a 100 % capital investment from the government yields superior net present costs compared to a grid-based option over the life of the project [66 ]. Energy efficiency improvements are vital as electricity demand is increasing, yet energy intensity advancements in the Ghanaian economy have been slow since 2010 (9 % reduction by 2020 compared to 2010) [2 ,67 ]. Whilst the Ghanaian government has introduced several programmes to raise public awareness of energy conservation, management and efficient appliances there are significant governance challenges to implementing those [49 ,68 ]. For example, a large fraction of appliances in Ghana are imported, second-hand, and inefficient [68 ] consuming at least twice the energy of that in the US or Europe, contributing to the growing demand. Implementing further standards and regulations on end-use appliances and awareness programmes can improve the efficient consumption of energy. With regards to SDG 7.1.2, access to clean cooking in Ghana is faced with several challenges. Ghana's Renewable Energy Master Plan (REMP) targets 3 million improved cookstoves by 2030 using pellets and briquettes whilst the SNEP aims for a 50 % national penetration for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [49 ,50 ]. The uptake of LPG has been hindered by inadequate bulk storage capacity, high cost, and users' perception of the risk of using LPG in homes [50 ]. Challenges to improved cookstoves and biofuels include low awareness, lack of standards, and high capital costs [49 ].  3.1.2 Kenya: how do new business models for energy access mitigate environmental impacts of solar energy? In 2022, Kenya generated 90 % of its electricity from renewable energy sources, primarily hydropower (868 MW) and geothermal (830 MW) [69 ]. The country seeks to achieve universal access to electricity by 2026, an increase from 75 % access in 2018 [53 ]. However, regional disparities in electricity access between urban and rural areas persist, 98 % and 68 %, respectively (Table 1 ), with sparsely populated off-grid areas remaining largely underserved. Grid expansion and decentralised off-grid solutions such as solar PV mini-grids are least cost solutions being implemented to address the access challenge. The off-grid installed capacity of renewable energy in the country was 131.8 MW in 2022 of which 101.9 MW was solar PV [70 ]. According to the IEA [52 ], Kenya is a testbed for business models for distributed solar PV and is unlocking private and public sector investment to finance SDG 7. The pay-per-service business model for mini-grids and the pay-as-you-go model for pico PV systems and solar home systems are rapidly displacing the use of kerosene and diesel generators in off-grid areas (supporting SDG 13) by providing cheaper and cleaner alternatives of electricity generation. Of concern are the environmental impacts of the influx of off-grid solar technologies in the country. The incumbent business models are mostly linear and, thus, hotspots of environmental impacts stemming from both supply and demand sides. Impacts are a result of material, energy, water, and emission flows from the use of virgin materials during the production of solar PV systems, premature obsolescence during the use stage, and waste disposal in landfills and open dumpsites. Business model innovation based on LCAs can inform incremental or radical changes in the supply and demand side, value proposition, and revenue model of solar energy companies to deliver environmental value cost-efficiently whilst satisfying customers' needs. Integration of circular economy strategies such as leasing and renting solar panels, digitalisation and maintenance for performance optimisation, part replacement and take-back, second-life use, and recycling significantly reduce life cycle environmental impacts of incumbent business models in Kenya. For example, carbon intensity can be reduced by at least 10 % by transforming from linear to circular business models. The carbon intensity of a solar mini-grid coupled with lead acid battery can be reduced from 122 gCO2e/kWh to 54 gCO2e/kWh while reductions of a solar home system from 73.5 gCO2e/kWh to 65.3 gCO2e/kWh. Such transformations can attract new financial investments to cover innovation costs and capture new revenue streams [71 ,72 ] for solar energy companies to ensure that circular business models are economically viable.  3.1.3 Malawi: how do top-down and bottom-up leadership of energy access interventions differ in terms of levels of success? Malawi's relative lack of energy access (55 % in urban, 10 % in rural areas) Table 1 , as well as energy security, is directly linked to its low level of economic development [53 ]. At the highest level of government, the priority has been and remains the creation of a nationwide grid system. Like many countries of similar economic development, Malawi's electricity mix is currently dominated by renewable energy, namely hydropower; however, it is unreliable, due to poor maintenance and threatened by declining rainfall, and grid distribution is very limited. A two-tier system of access exists even within urban areas in which electricity access is surging but only affordable to the wealthiest. In rural areas expanding the current grid connection would be prohibitively expensive, and access to funds to achieve this at a national or community level would be almost impossible [73 ]. Findings suggest that leadership from within Malawi will have to come from both the ‘top’ and the ‘bottom’, from the ‘top down’ being high-level governance decision making, through large private investment companies or international donor organisations. For projects to succeed, there needs to be a wide view taken to funding projects in order to maximise delivery of new forms of energy that can retain a whole systems perspective. This system can recognise both co-benefits and potential trade-offs from a techno-economic, environmental, and social perspective as well as coordinating and enabling the roles of stakeholders and decentralised groups. The ‘bottom up’ refers to decentralised and traditional governance structures in rural areas, including local NGOs who work directly with these communities. There is both local knowledge and a track record of innovation, however, this needs to be directed in the most suitable activities. Results further reveal that projects that actively engaged both traditional and modern forms of decentralised governance were much more popular with farmers and agricultural extension workers. For projects that can target both SDG 7 and SDG 13, there has to be a realistic consideration of present social structures and understanding of limitations [74 ]. In this sense, paying for fuel is extremely rare and undermines the finances of alternative cooking projects, as well as decentralised and external policy in particularly rural areas [75 ]. Interviews revealed that previous interventions in the energy access field, namely stove manufacture and growing of bioenergy cash crops to create an internal biodiesel marketplace, have limited input from farmers who had extremely limited access to information and support. In such circumstances, it is unsurprising that despite best intentions they are often unsustainable. Of the projects observed, the most successful were those that were co-developed with devolved and traditional authorities, whilst conforming to explicitly stated government aims.  3.1.4 South Africa: how effective are national and sub-national strategies in delivering access to energy? In the last 10 years, South Africa has made great strides in attracting investment into the renewable energy sector [76 ]. Despite this, coal is still meeting around 85 % of the country's electricity needs [77 ]. Some of the main drivers of renewable energy investment have been their commitments to reduce emissions from business-as-usual projections by 42 % in 2025. South Africa's NDC builds on these targets and sets a national GHG emissions reduction target of 212–428 MtCO2e by 2050 [78 ,79 ] despite rising coal-generated electricity costs [80 ] and the growing need for security of supply to mitigate against the rolling national blackouts. Various national policies and legislation have been developed in support of SDG 7 and SDG 13. These include the National Development Plan 2030 [81 ], the country's blueprint for national electricity infrastructure development, and the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) – a living document updated annually [82 ]. Both plans highlight South Africa's ambition to increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix. The IRP for example states that by 2030, a total of 20, 400 MW would be commissioned, of this 6000 MW will be new solar PV and 14,400 MW of new wind capacity [82 ]. At the local government level, renewable energy remains an underdeveloped sector, evident in the lack of investment in building technical skills and capacity across decentralised municipality electricity and energy departments. This has resulted in local government not being fully equipped to participate in the energy transition that is currently underway. Individual municipalities such as the City of Cape Town, Nelson Mandela Bay, and eThekwini municipality have nonetheless set their own renewable energy and climate change targets [83 ,84 ]. Although it has not yet been updated or achieved, the City of Cape Town had a longstanding target of generating 20 % of its electricity from renewables by 2020, while Nelson Mandela Bay has become a leader in small-scale embedded generation in South Africa [85 ]. The role those subnational entities, such as local governments, can play in the development of renewable energy projects in South Africa remains limited. This is caused by restrictive national legislation and outdated governance frameworks, power struggles, and vested interests in the energy sector around coal, and more recently, renewables – a sector which continues to be dominated by international investors [54–56 ]. Lastly, there is a growing discourse around a just transition - how do we ensure that the energy transition that is currently underway does not further displace poor and already marginalised segments of society? For subnational structures to adequately support national (and global) efforts towards sustainable development targets, such as SDG 7, more concerted effort, especially from the national government, is needed to support and build the technical capacity of electricity departments across municipalities.   3.2 Asia 3.2.1 Myanmar: how can access to electricity improve rural livelihoods? Myanmar's urgent need for access to electricity has been the focus of several donor-funded projects aimed at improving the country's resilience and economy [57 ]. However, traditional biomass continues to dominate energy use (47 % TPES in 2020) [86 ]. Without access to reliable and modern energy sources, locals have limited opportunities to improve their livelihoods and increase their incomes. For many off-grid communities, heat and electricity for household lighting and livelihood activities are provided through steam and combustion, or gasification of rice husk – a by-product of rice milling. With an estimated over 3 million tonnes of rice husk produced every year, Myanmar has the potential to utilise this residue for income-generating activities and energy generation to support agricultural production and rural livelihoods [58 ,87 ]. However, interviews with small scale farmers and millers reveal that challenges, with regards to lack of access to fair and affordable financing, mean they cannot consider opportunities from rice husk bioenergy. This is true both for supporting livelihood activities and for upgrading current technologies to ones that are less polluting [58 ]. Access to modern energy, therefore, is only considered by smallholders in the context of cost, despite being regarded as important in supporting their livelihoods and rural development [88 ]. These insights encourage wider thinking about the role of energy in poverty alleviation, vis-à-vis urgency and justice – what is needed now and what is fair, especially to smallholders in rice production. Results from interviews in Myanmar (See Ref. [58 ]) show that there are more urgent needs to be addressed before “using rice husk as feedstock for energy production” can improve agricultural livelihoods.  3.2.2 Philippines: how can we provide sustainable access to electricity and heat (for cooking) to isolated communities? The Philippines is making good progress towards achieving 100 % access to electricity by 2030. At 97 % access to electricity in 2021, however, this still leaves over 3 million people without sufficient, reliable, and affordable electric power (SDG 7) [2 ]. Most of this population are in remote rural communities, where off-grid electrification that is funded by private entities is encouraged by the government. These remote communities have locally available renewable resources such as solar, wind, and biomass that enable the feasibility of different technologies and system designs [59 ,60 ]. LCA shows that the use of solar and wind energy instead of diesel to electrify remote communities also contributes to SDG 13 by reducing GHG emissions by up to 71 % relative to a diesel-only system [60 ]. Net avoided impacts in life cycle carbon emissions can be attained through using agricultural waste such as rice straw and coconut shells as a feedstock for bioenergy [59 ]. Another indicator that needs to be addressed to achieve SDG 7 is access to clean cooking, where the Philippines attained only 48 % in 2021 (Table 1 ). Traditional cooking fuels such as charcoal, firewood, and crop residues, do not contribute as much to climate change due to their biogenic origins but can still have significant impacts on local health (SDG 3) with the potential to generate six times more particulate matter and smog formation than LPG [89 ]. While electric stoves are categorized as a clean cooking technology [90 ], their environmental performance relative to other clean cooking technologies is strongly affected by the source of the electricity. If electric stoves are powered by diesel generators, these have higher negative environmental impacts than kerosene and gas stoves [89 ]. Biogas from livestock wastes using anaerobic digestion can be an important alternative for clean cooking without increasing net GHG emissions. However, any fugitive emissions and disposal of trace metal content of digestate from anaerobic digestion needs to be considered [89 ].   3.3 Latin America 3.3.1 Chile: how can the government support a sustainable electricity transition? Chilean society has endured the consequences of the energy crisis that started in 2004, which arose as a result of shortages of supply for various reasons, including the highly concentrated electricity market, fossil fuel import dependence, high hydrology variability (accompanied by long drought episodes), and strong social opposition to new projects [61 ]. Since then, the economy has been affected by the high costs of electricity resulting in a loss of external commodities (e.g., copper) competitiveness, loss of economic dynamism, productivity, and growth. The environment has been impacted through the release of local contaminants and GHG emissions (SDG 13) due to the massive investment in coal power plants (e.g. Tocopilla and Quinteros “sacrifice zones'' in Carranza et al. [91 ]), and the deployment of hydroelectricity projects have caused losses of biodiversity (SDG 14, in water and SDG 15, on land) and cultural heritage (e.g. Pangue Ralco hydroelectric project in Orellana [92 ]). Social implications are also related to economic and environmental issues, leading to energy poverty and then negative impacts of new energy projects on low income-communities [47 ,93 ]. Chile has abundant renewable resources; solar energy is particularly cost-effective due to its high availability. This has facilitated the country to experience substantial investment in solar photovoltaics, increasing its share from 0 % to 10 % of the electricity mix in only five years [93 ]. To accelerate the solar and wind deployment, as a way to address public concerns over the sustainability implications of a high share of fossil fuel in the power system, the government developed the National Energy Policy 2050 through a participative process; this policy pursues the reductions of barrier of entry for variable renewables [94 ]. Two aspects can be highlighted due to the implementation of the policy: (1) enabling competition by improving the tender procedure for long-term contracts with regulated consumers that account for 50 % of overall consumption in the country, and (2) the interconnection of the two large power systems that has enabled transmission from solar power plants in the north to the central zone where most consumption occurs [95 ]. The tender procedure adapted the terms of reference to allow solar PV and wind investors to bid for hourly blocks that fitted their generation profile. Previously, it was highly risky for variable renewables to bid into the market as one of the fundamental requisites was that generators must provide energy whenever required by the consumer; forcing renewables to buy into the spot market when not generating. This change increased competition by introducing new bidders and reducing consumers' energy cost. Thanks to these changes and the country's high renewable resource availability, Chile has been able to reduce fossil fuel dependency and its associated impacts, reduce electricity costs and was one of the first countries to demonstrate that variable renewables could successfully present competitive bids without subsidies [96 ].  3.3.2 Colombia: what is the potential of agri-residues in supplying sustainable bioenergy in rural areas? Colombia has a vast potential for power generation from renewable sources [97 ]; however, less than 1 % of the installed power generation capacity derives from non-hydro renewable energy [62 ]. A more decentralised and source-diverse power generation scheme could enhance access to clean and affordable energy in rural areas [98 ] and support sustainable development in rural communities. For example, by using agri-residues from traditional biomass practices in more efficient and sustainable bioenergy systems. An integrated feasibility assessment of the gasification of coffee residues to generate bio-electricity and bio-heat in Colombia showed that deploying these systems, at suitable small operating scales, could be a feasible and sustainable solution to meet the energy demand of coffee farms [63 ]. These systems could reduce GHGs emissions by 48%–68 % and particulate matter formation by up to 98 % when traditional biomass practices and fossil-based energy uses are replaced [99 ]. However, potential negative environmental impacts could arise when displacing, in some cases, relatively low-carbon (hydro-sourced) electricity or introducing fossil fuels as alternatives for clean cooking fuels. From an economic perspective, the bio-electricity system costs could equalise those from diesel-electricity when the bioenergy system reaches high-capacity factors. However, matching grid-electricity tariffs is more difficult to achieve since grid electricity in Colombia is relatively cheap (0.14 USD/kWh [100 ]). Analysis also revealed that integrating pathways for low-grade heat recovery through cogeneration is key to increasing the process efficiency and the relevance of this bioenergy system for the coffee rural sector [63 ]. Furthermore, balancing the energy demand and availability of agri-residues at farm level is important to enhance the system's utilization. Large farms and community coffee processing plants with a larger availability of biomass resources could benefit from the production of both electricity and heat during coffee harvesting seasons. Small farms, however, could require just a constant electricity supply for household and farming activities. Developing these types of small-scale bioenergy systems could contribute to SDG 7 and SDG 13, but also to wider co-benefits like promoting SDG 3 (improve health) and SDG 8 (economic growth) when synergies are identified, and trade-offs addressed. These systems, however, have only been deployed at pilot scales. Current bottlenecks to commercial deployment have been the lack of government incentives, financing schemes, and awareness of the real resource potential for renewables [101 ]. The rationale behind this case study was based on the socio-economic characteristics of the coffee sector in Colombia, where approximately 91 % of coffee production concentrates on small and medium farms requiring energy access solutions for small-scale applications. This context sits with the aim of this study case on assessing the feasibility of bioenergy technologies integration at small scale applications in rural areas, as are the ones that are lagging in agricultural development with less technical, financial, and policy-related support in Colombia. Different from other agricultural sectors in the country, like the sugarcane and palm oil industry, the coffee sector is structured on small and medium-scale landholders that could potentially receive wider socio-economic and environmental benefits from the implementation of such bioenergy systems.    4 Lessons for research, policy, and development practice This section brings together lessons from the case studies presented in Section 3  by critically reflecting on the gaps and opportunities in SDG 7 implementation. Four themes emerged as key areas of action if SDG 7 targets were to be achieved and effectively contribute to wider goals of sustainable development. 4.1 Addressing rural-urban disparities in energy access Progress in energy access has been largely isolated in urban areas whilst the majority of the still to be reached population are in remote and often inaccessible areas. The first theme to emerge from the literature is that large disparities between energy access in rural and urban areas are common, some reasons for which, and potential solutions, are given throughout the case studies. One of the main challenges in achieving SDG 7, and related synergies, persists in providing and improving access to off-grid remote areas, which have little or poor electricity access and/or security of supply. This paper shows the importance of understanding particular rural dynamics and context, namely: identifying energy needs, socio-economic realities, and availability of energy resources within a rural area and/or agriculture sector, and understanding the balance between energy demand and resource supply to positively influence the technical, environmental, and economic performance of the local energy system. For example, the Malawian case study showed a discrepancy existing between development priorities of ‘top-down leadership’ and that of the farmers and rural communities such development was designed to serve. In the Colombian study case, the coffee farm's size (e.g., small, medium, large scale, or cooperative-based farms), location (on or off-grid), and type of coffee processing used (e.g. natural or mechanical drying) determined the type of energy demand. Hence, biomass resources required to meet the demand. Aiming to adequately balance both sides could enhance the bioenergy system's performance and its contribution to economically feasible and sustainable renewable energy access. Projects focusing on increasing generation capacity and national electrification rates lead to high electrification in urban areas, leaving rural areas vulnerable to trade-offs that may directly cause negative issues, such as disputes over land rights and energy justice as in South Africa, or indirectly slow progress on other SDGs, such as access to clean cooking in the Philippines. This is also demonstrated in the Chilean and Ghanaian case studies. There is limited evidence that these project outcomes will ensure electricity reaches out to rural communities that have no access to energy or whether it contributes positively to poverty, health, and education within those communities [4 ]. This is particularly significant for Sub-Saharan Africa, where rural electrification projects and policy can link to access for agricultural development and carry significant political capital [27 ]. The Ghanaian study on hybrid energy systems shows support for decentralisation of projects to provide wider benefits to the community [66 ]. Moreover, a 100 % capital investment support from the government yields superior net present costs when compared to a grid-based option over the lifetime of the project [66 ]. Hence, financial initiatives that consider enhanced rural electrification are essential for 100 % electricity access rather than simply increasing generation capacity through large projects that may undermine SDG 13. For most of the poor and ultra-poor countries within the literature and evidence presented here, it may be advantageous to invest in a large number of smaller projects as opposed to single grid electrification projects.  4.2 Ensuring that energy projects are linked to sustainable outcomes As shown in all the case studies, whilst SDG 7 and its associated targets explicitly call for the growth of the energy sector, it is vital to understand that energy provision often underpins the majority of the other non-explicitly energy-related SDGs. However, the interplay between SDGs is not entirely mutually positive, approximately 35 % of SDG targets will have to be balanced against the provision of modern, clean energy [13 ]. This is caused by economic tension between the need to rapidly meet the demand for far wider access to a wide range of basic services, such as education or healthcare, and the need for large scale investment to ensure both the efficiency and sustainability of new energy systems that must largely be carried by renewable energy sources [13 ,102 ]. For many off-grid areas in the Global South, energy access issues are undeniably linked to poverty and inequality. The provision of energy (SDG 7) can support poverty alleviation (SDG 1) and reducing inequalities (SDG 10) via employment creation, additional income opportunities, and improvement in public services and infrastructures [103 ,104 ]. However, lessons from rural areas in Myanmar show that governance is key in unlocking multiple benefits from energy access. Firstly, financing technologies to support energy generation from rice husks via local value chains will be key. Yet, this is also most difficult to meet as the poorest are most limited in credit accessibility and institutional support (e.g., Ref. [58 ]). Community cost-sharing and private-public partnerships may also be instrumental in addressing this [43 ]. However, governance tools such as fair financing schemes should be used to avoid burdening the poorest as they could face a disproportionate share of costs, as in Myanmar [103 ]. Trade-offs, such as higher total GHG emissions, fossil and metal depletion, and displacing energy systems with relatively low carbon intensities (i.e., large-scale hydro-electricity) can cause premature failure of energy-related projects as well as limit project efficacy. To deliver SDG 7 at the expense of the other targets without detailed planning and collaboration with local communities, only risks damaging communities and relationships for often poorly considered solutions. To limit the negative impact of trade-offs, and maximise synergies, case studies such as those assessing renewable energy to provide sustainable energy access to rural and isolated communities in Colombia and the Philippines, show the importance of context-specific knowledge. Many of these trade-offs have been central reasons for the failures of previous efforts in the bioenergy industry. In the Kenyan case study, collaborations in the solar PV value network that transform incumbent linear business models of take-make-use-dispose to new circular economy business models of take-make-use-reuse-recycle, can significantly mitigate environmental impacts of decentralised solar energy. It is clear across the breadth of the case studies however that SDG 13 is the clearest linkage with SDG 7. Whilst in Chile and South Africa there has been a drive for a centralised push towards renewable energy, particularly in terms of market intervention and investment, ensuring the success of renewable energy interventions. Part of this could be investment to grow domestic manufacturing of renewable energy technologies (e.g., PVs) but with policies to protect local production and support development of national capabilities [20 ]. With case studies discussing solutions to rural energy access, it was shown that solar PV, wind, and bioenergy offer viable solutions (when paired with innovative business plans and good practice) for access, security, and environmental sustainability of the energy source.  4.3 Balancing agendas of top-down and bottom-up governance actors Several challenges for effective implementation of SDG 13 related policies exist because of competing institutional agendas and interests, institutional capacity, lack of coordination between sectors and institutions, and planning priorities for SDGs and Paris related NDCs. Access to renewable and clean energy is fundamental to those objectives but requires significant investment and resources [105 ]. As seen across the case studies, whilst there are a plethora of policies and guidelines to develop the renewable energy sector, in Ghana failure to effectively implement them has resulted in planning and construction of fossil-based thermal power plants [64 ,106 ]. Policy support for clean energy and climate change related goals are often undermined via lobbying by the fossil fuel industry [107 ]. Institutional weakness, ambiguous regulatory frameworks, implementation challenges, lack of proper planning and coordination, and dependencies on donor support are all responsible for the poor development of renewables. Harmonisation of numerous climate finance and energy access programmes are beneficial to ensure new schemes are genuinely low carbon [106 ]. In summary, energy access is not constrained by technical challenges or policy guidelines but lack of business models, regulatory frameworks, and institutions to implement those [28 ]. Decentralisation of energy has become a feasible solution to tackle the challenge of energy access in remote areas and boost the integration of renewable energy technologies at micro-small-scale operations. Building local capacity can help to reduce the cost of installation, generation, transmission, and distribution since local experts will be involved along the chain [65 ]. Actors in local value chains can be excluded, by the exertion of power by the incumbents for example [20 ] or otherwise overlooked, but can, and must be key participants in sustaining energy access projects [58 ,108 ]. In Myanmar, small-scale farmers and millers have necessary roles in generating energy from rice husk and can therefore benefit from support, specifically: financial support to lower cost of rice production, technical support to upgrade facilities, and capacity building to create roles in managing community energy. These could also enable local actors to adopt value-adding activities that could increase their income, and thus, maximise potential benefits from energy access [16 ]. In cases where NGOs and other non-state actors (e.g., private individuals, local businesses, civil society organisations) take the role of facilitating energy access [41 ,109 ], policy will be necessary to sustain progress. NGO-initiated projects are often bound by timeline and funding requirements of donors which may be unsustainable in the long term or unscalable [110 ]. Having policy and institutional support can encourage investments and help to upscale initiatives for example, via private-public partnerships, but these need to be carefully planned to avoid legitimising existing income inequalities, especially in rural communities [43 ,111 ].  4.4 Appraising the implications of techno-economic factors Promoting energy efficiency is vital when improving the energy access rates. Energy efficiency is internationally recognised as a low-cost, readily available resource that could help improve the security of electricity supply to meet rapidly growing demand [68 ]. In Ghana energy efficiency improvements are slow while demand is rising fast, leading to poor quality of electricity supply. Whilst there are several programmes to raise public awareness on energy conservation and management in both the industrial and residential sectors, such as in Ghana, tighter regulations, and standards for appliances as well as for solar panels are essential for improving energy efficiency and reducing waste. The Colombian case study showed that certain technical operating conditions allowed the transition to bioenergy systems to be more economically feasible and environmentally sustainable compared to former diesel-based electricity generation. Results indicate that harnessing the biomass energy conversion by implementing heat recovery pathways and maximising the utilization of the system (plant's capacity factor) enhances the technical and environmental performance, as well as the costs competitiveness against fossil-based systems. Furthermore, the Kenyan case study highlights that business models are also essential in determining the economic viability of renewable energy systems, particularly any innovative strategies adopted to improve their environmental performance. The Kenyan case study also shows that circular economy business models for solar PV result in environmental benefits from a life cycle assessment standpoint by reducing the demand for virgin raw materials, optimising system performance and lengthening their lifetime, and promoting reuse and recycling of waste. Innovative financing models and new revenue streams are essential to incentivise solar energy companies to transform their incumbent business models from linear to circular economy without lowering their return on investment. The use of waste agricultural biomass as a fuel for electricity or heating is competitive to fossil fuel-based options (e.g. diesel, kerosene) in economic terms as shown in the Philippines and Colombia case studies. However, technical feasibility of waste biomass utilization has to be verified on the ground as availability of the resource may fluctuate throughout the cropping season. There was also enthusiasm for these schemes shown in the other Sub-Saharan examples; however, uptake of clean cooking has been relatively slow in the sub-Saharan region, particularly rural areas. While Asian countries made significant improvements by switching to gaseous fuels, the rural population in sub-Saharan Africa is still faced with issues such as affordability, sufficient provision of LPG and awareness of using new technologies as demonstrated in Ghana and Malawi.   5 Conclusions SDG 7 explicitly targets actions within the energy sector, but it also underpins the majority of the other sustainable development goals. Some of the synergies included explicitly in this paper show the positive impact of low-carbon energy sources on health (i.e., reduction of particulate matter through cleaner cooking solutions), reduction of fossil fuel use and improved income generation in rural and remote areas. However, to deliver SDG 7 at the expense of the other targets without detailed planning, and collaboration with local communities only risks damaging both communities and relationships for, often poorly considered, solutions. The case studies presented in this paper show the necessity worldwide for good governance that integrates both top-down and bottom-up strategies to maximise delivery of energy access and maintains a whole systems perspective that considers both co-benefits and potential trade-offs from a techno-economic, environmental, and social perspective. Providing energy to remote communities remains a challenge in the Global South. Large disparities exist between rural and urban communities around energy access, where rural electrification rates are lagging behind national averages. The high cost of grid infrastructure from large-scale and centralised power plants to remote rural areas, with scarce prospects for return on investments for investors, is a key contributing factor for rural-urban divide as shown in the Ghanaian, Colombian, and Philippines’ case studies. Similar to electricity, uptake of clean cooking also has been slower than anticipated, particularly in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This is largely due to issues around affordability, sufficient provision of LPG, and awareness of using new technologies as demonstrated in the Ghanaian and Malawian examples. Cost is also an issue in Myanmar, where lack of financing prevents locals from access to modern bioenergy (i.e., from rice husk) that could improve livelihoods. Increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix is a vital element to both increase energy access and tackle climate change, as shown in Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. Energy access has not been particularly constrained by technical challenges or policy guidelines, but rather a lack of business models, technical skills, regulatory frameworks, and institutional commitment. The case studies from Ghana and South Africa show that enhanced coordination between sectors and institutions, institutional capacity development, harmonisation of climate finance and energy access programmes, and setting planning priorities for SDGs and NDCs are all fundamental for a viable energy transition towards renewables. The solution to rural electricity access in remote areas, which supports climate action, seems to rest in decentralised off-grid renewable energy systems; however, decentralisation presents its own set of challenges. In this sense, the Malawian case study shows the need for a realistic consideration of present social structures, both contemporary and traditional forms of governance, and understanding of the limitations of both these institutions and of the difficulty of dispersing new technologies and energy systems among the ultra-poor. The implementation of new business models (e.g., pay-per-service or pay-as-you go) could help the development of these off-grid systems, increasing the affordability and reducing the associated environmental impacts, particularly if applied for renewables and utilising circular economy principles. Energy efficiency improvements can play a crucial role in avoiding electricity supply shortages and expanding energy access rates. Deployment of power generation capacity is generally too slow to match the rising electricity demand in developing countries. Initiatives such as public awareness, standards for appliances, and tighter regulations are all essential for improving the energy efficiency in all end-use sectors, whilst also reducing waste (Kenya) and avoiding supply shortages in Ghana. Biogas (from anaerobic digestion) and producer gas (from gasification) using agricultural residues is another component to a possible solution in low electrification rates in rural areas, as demonstrated in Myanmar, Colombia, and the Philippines. Particularly in Colombia and in the Philippines, techno-economic assessments showed that bioenergy systems have proven to be a more economically feasible and environmentally sustainable alternative to fossil-fuel based energy systems such as diesel. However, careful consideration should be given to the bioenergy system's scale and to the context in which systems are deployed, to support optimal performance and co-benefit. With regards to the contribution of biomass to clean cooking, the potential negative impacts of biogas on local health (e.g., fugitive emissions and trace metal content of digestate) remain an area that warrants further consideration. Despite this, biogas from anaerobic digestion of locally available biomass such as livestock waste can be an important component of a fuel mix that provides clean cooking without increasing net GHG emissions as demonstrated in the Philippines. The Chilean and South African experiences demonstrated how enabling policy frameworks at the national level can be a key driver to the growth of any renewable energy technology. In South Africa, constitutionally, the generation of electricity remains a function of the national government, with the role of municipalities confined to reticulation, a shared function with the national power utility. Additionally, with the rise of the prosumer in the South African electricity space, flexibility of the electricity system should be a defining factor to a successful renewable energy transition, as centralized generation is no longer as desirable. In both countries, a competitive tender process has not only improved the tender process for long-term contracts, but it has also contributed to significant cost reductions in renewables. In addition, the availability of existing network and transmission infrastructure to transport renewable-based power from various sites, i.e., solar plants, to where most of the consumption occurs has been one of the key enablers for the success of the renewable energy transition in these areas of the Global South. To advance SDG alignment between international, national, and regional policies is crucial. Policies should not only focus on large-scale energy projects and grid expansion, but also on integrating off-grid renewable energy to ensure access in isolated rural areas which alleviates poverty (SDG 1), improve health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) within those communities whilst contributes to climate action (SDG 13). These goals are challenging and need a hybrid governance approach involving all the stakeholders. The case studies demonstrate that it is not the lack of policy guidelines or technical challenges but rather a lack of business models, technical skills, regulatory frameworks, and institutional commitment that delay progress. The Covid-19 pandemic has also slowed down the SDGs [112 ]; however, it also created opportunities for governance actors to recalibrate spending, re-focused attention on new priorities, and highlighted possible connections among the SDGs [113 ,114 ]. Most relevantly, the pandemic has exposed that energy access saves lives. So, a new opportunity is available to advance SDG 7 by reflecting on the failures and lessons learned so far.
