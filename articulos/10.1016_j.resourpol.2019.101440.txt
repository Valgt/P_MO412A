                  For millennia, mining was not only a source of great economic wealth, but also of social and environmental concern. It, therefore, was a focus of the business and public policy sustainable development agenda for many years. Thus, many international programmes, such as the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tried to capture this concept by developing frameworks to guide in their implementation by the mining sector. However, there is scarce knowledge about the mining sector's contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - the broadly accepted and politically legitimised post-2015 development agenda. This paper investigates the extent to which mining innovations that are employed, or that will be employed in the future, can make a contribution to achieving the SDGs in Europe. To this end, the authors identified current and future mining Innovation Concepts and challenges, as well as designed an SDG impact framework for identifying the impacts of innovation, concluding that almost all innovation concepts show repercussions on individual SDGs. This indicates that innovation concepts not only depict synergies between the SDGS, but also trade-offs or imbalances between individual SDGs. Further research is required on the overall environmental impact of technological innovations, the implications for absolute de-coupling of environmental impacts and economic performance, and the possibility of rebound effects.

Table 2   Group Innovation concept   Economic Autonomous equipment and operations  Mining operations use autonomous equipment (trucks, drills, trains, etc.), with the ultimate goal of running autonomous operations. This includes also the use of remote control centres, robotics, and 3D printing. Key results are operating cost reductions, a lower environmental footprint and reduced, but higher skilled (local) jobs. It might also facilitate the opening of new mines that otherwise would not be economically feasible. Innovation example:  Rio Tinto's AutoHaul (RioTinto, 2014 ), Codelco's driverless trucks ((E&MJ, 2014 )  IT platforms and process control systems  Use of IT for process control, incl. The “Internet of things” with more and better sensors, (big) data management and use of Artificial Intelligence („real time information and mass flows“). Key results include lower operating costs, improved resource use and reduced but higher skilled (local) jobs. It might also facilitate the opening of new mines that otherwise would not be economically feasible. Innovation example:  Strabag's matDOC Softwaresystem (MIN-GUIDE, 2017b )  Continuous mining processes  A combination of new technologies, such as continuous excavators and better use of existing technologies, such as conveyors, lead to continuous mining processes, replacing traditional drilling, blasting, and haulage. Key results include operating cost reductions, a lower environmental footprint and reduced, but higher skilled (local) jobs. It might also facilitate the opening of new mines that otherwise would not be economically feasible. Innovation example:  Sandvik's MX650 continuous excavation system (MIN-GUIDE, 2016 ), Vale's S11D mine (MIN-GUIDE, 2017c )  Better resource characterisation  A combination of (new) technologies, including sensors, analytical equipment and better geological modelling systems, allow for better resource characterisation. Key results include cost reductions, a lower environmental footprint (e.g. lower land demands) and better structural control providing safety improvements. It might also facilitate the opening of new mines that otherwise would not be economically feasible. Innovation example:  Outotec's OreMet Optimizer (Outotec, 2017 )  Better mine design  A combination of technologies, including (new) surveying methodologies (e.g. drone use) and better mine modelling and visualisation, lead to better mine designs. Key results include productivity improvements and lower environmental footprint, i.e. land use and biodiversity impact. Innovation example:  Rio Tinto's RTVis Software (RioTinto, 2014 )  Equipment Scale Up  To improve economy of scale, the scale up and improvement of production equipment continues. Key results include higher productivity and reduced environmental impact. Innovation example:  Belaz's 75710 haul truck (BELAZ, 2017 )  Digitally enabled worker  Use of (new) technologies, such as augmented or virtual reality enabled communication devises, tracking technologies and virtual collaboration, lead to a digitally enabled worker. Key results include improved productivity and safety. Innovation example:  VR safety trainings at UNSW in Australia (UNSW, 2016 )  Disruptive new or alternative mining methods  New and/or alternative mining methods, such as in-situ leaching emerge, replace traditional mining methods. Key results include cost reduction, a lower environmental footprint (i.e. energy, waste, land use and biodiversity) except for water and low numbers of (local) jobs. It might also facilitate the opening of new mines that otherwise would not be economically feasible. Innovation example:  H2020 project BioMOre (BIOMOre, 2017 )  Deep Sea Mining  New (use of) technologies enable mining in extreme environments, such as the deep sea, extreme depths or the arctic, etc. Key results include new mines that provide economic benefits, new environmental impact and (low numbers because of technology used) new jobs or local procurement. It might also facilitate the opening of new mines that otherwise would not be economically feasible. Innovation example:  Nautilus Mining (NautilusMinerals, 2017 )  New financing models  New models for financing of mining, such as community or crowd funding, enable new and more mining companies to open mines. Innovation example:  EU-Canada Mineral Investment Facility (Ernst&Young, 2017 )  Societal New business models and customer relations New business models, such as collaborative business models or values based models (social enterprises) and models based on different customer relations, such as leasing of metals, emerge. Key results include higher local economic participation, a lower environmental footprint and increased local jobs. Innovation example: Chilean ENAMI Network (ENAMI, 2017 )  Enhanced transparency and traceability  The combination of technologies including open source databases to enhance transparency or block chain technology usage for tracking resources to improve product stewardship and (new) initiatives enhance transparency and traceability in the mining value chain. Key results include better access to markets, improved environmental performance, especially at small mines, and better working conditions (human rights, safety). Innovation example:  SITRA NETWORK for sustainable mining (SITRA, 2017 )  Better land use planning  More collaborative governance and better data usage will allow for new models/analysis to better incorporate mines into regional development plans (incl. modelling of site level vs. cumulative impact at regional level). Key results include improved economic integration (local procurement, diversification, etc.) and a lower environmental footprint. Innovation example:  MINATURA 2020 (Minatura, 2015 )  Shared infrastructure  Infrastructure is planned and built for multi-purpose usage by means of application of new business models or contracts and accessible to other stakeholder groups, i.e. (renewable) electricity, internet and other communication and “mine to market” transport infrastructure. Key results include increased economic growth and more jobs, but also an increased environmental footprint. Innovation example:  Vale's Nacala railway corridor in Mozambique (RailwayGazette, 2017 )  Low environmental footprint mining  A combination of (new) technologies and management approaches is introduced mainly to reduce the environmental footprint of mining i.e. in areas such as land use, energy and CO2, water or waste. Innovation examples:  Sleipner's new transport solutions to reduce fuel demand (MIN-GUIDE, 2017a ), Filtered tailings disposal (Gunson et al., 2012 ), QMM's biodiversity approach (Temple et al., 2012 )  Renewable Energy solutions  The supply of electricity from renewable sources (provider and in-house generation), on the one hand, and technologies to replace or electrify fossil fuel based equipment, on the other hand, lead to significant reductions in CO2 emissions. Innovation example:  Liebherr's T236 hybrid haul truck (Liebherr, 2016 )  Towards zero accidents  Various safety innovations including psychology based programmes leading to behaviour change and new technologies, such as personalised warning systems or augmented reality lead to improved safety performance. Innovation example:  Caterpillar's Driver Safety System (Caterpillar, 2016 ), Du Pont's STOP behavioural safety system (DuPont, 2017 )  Better skills base  Innovations in management programmes, social business models or community cooperation lead to higher skills levels or local procurement actions.

Keywords Sustainable development  Mining  Innovation  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction Mining for mineral and metal raw materials faces significant societal challenges. On the one hand, the negative impacts of mining, such as disasters and rising global concerns about the safety and management of impacts, have put a strain on public acceptance of mining projects in general. On the other hand, EU Member States (EC, 2012 , 2017 ) have recognized the importance of the mining sector in being able to satisfy the raw material demand for consumer products, as well as for a successful transition towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Being both a part of the solution and the problem, the supply of primary raw materials plays an important role in the trajectory of sustainable development. Thus, several international organisations and initiatives, such as the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have developed frameworks and guidelines to bring the mining sector more in line with sustainable development. These frameworks, or guidelines (ICMM, 2003 ; UNEP et al., 2016 ), provide information on that which constitutes sustainable development in the mining sector and provide practical guidance for its stakeholders on how to achieve it. While only a handful of international studies contextualise the corporate perspective with an integrative sustainable development framework that carries both societal relevance and legitimacy, none of these studies provide a European perspective. In this regard, an outlook on which, and how, corporate practices contribute to an accepted and politically legitimised framework for sustainable development would be of immense utility for both private and public sector decision-makers. Given the recent development of a European Agenda for the implementation of the UN SDGs (EC, 2016 , 2017 ), the purpose of this study is to investigate to what extent the mining sector in Europe can make a contribution to achieving the SDGs. To this end, this paper first explains the importance of a sustainable mineral supply in the context of sustainable development and then explores the specific challenges the mining sector in Europe faces in order to contribute to sustainable development. The second part clarifies the methodological approach with regard to the design of Innovation Concepts (Innovation concepts characterise a broader definition of concrete, previously identified industry innovation examples such as Rio Tinto's AutoHaul and Codelco's driverless trucks based on the intended outcomes “autonomous equipment and operations”) and the screening of innovation impacts on an SDG framework for the mining sector. Through the analysis, the future innovation potential for achieving individual SDGs, as well as identifying strong points and blind spots in the sector's current and future innovation efforts, was investigated. The discussion on Innovation Concepts and the prevalence or absence of impacts on certain SDGs identifies both promising future practices for industry players, as well as guidance for policymakers on programming of supportive R&D&I policy instruments. 1.1 Sustainable development and the mining sector Since its inception on the international political agenda through the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in 1987, the concept of sustainable development has been present in many societal and academic debates. Due to its normative nature and the different disciplinary backgrounds of professionals dealing with sustainable development (Waas et al., 2011 ), such as the mining sector, the concept is open to interpretation in different contexts (Hopwood et al., 2005 ). As outlined by Hilson and Murck (2000) , most of the discussions on mining, minerals, and sustainable development to date are concerned with sustainability at the global and national scales. While some scholars (Ali et al., 2017 ; Auty and Warhurst, 1993 ; Calas, 2017 ; Mikesell, 1994 ; Pokhrel and Dubey, 2013 ; Tilton, 1996 ); amongst others) provide perspectives on how the benefits of mineral production and use can be sustained over longer time frames, others discuss the value of sustainable development as a management approach to resolve the growing concerns in balancing the needs of the environment, economy and society. Although sustainable development is a multi-dimensional concept, which follows an integrative approach based on socio-economic and institutional development objectives with environmental ones (Christen and Schmidt, 2012 ; Lele, 1991 ; Robinson, 2004 ), most research on sustainable development in the mining sector does not follow this conceptual consideration. Research relating explicitly to the concept of sustainable development mostly focuses on one of its three dimensions, thus, a compartmentalized or sectoral approach to SD (see, for example, the social dimension: (Gunarathne et al., 2016 ; Petkova et al., 2009 ; Suopajärvi et al., 2016 ; Tiainen, 2016 ); or environmental dimension (Schoenberger, 2016 ; Shen et al., 2015 ):). In this regard, academic debates from both the sustainable development (Giddings (Atlin and Gibson, 2017 ; Christen and Schmidt, 2012 ; Giddings et al., 2002 ; Kates et al., 2005 )) and mining science field (Hilson and Murck, 2000 ; Onn and Woodley, 2014 ) caution that sustainable development has multiple dimensions, where focusing on only one dimension might undermine the achievement of the others. The current discussion on an integrative sustainable development approach is taken forward by scholars investigating both a corporate management perspective (see for example (Dashwood, 2014 ; Espinoza and Morris, 2017 ; Espinoza and Rojo, 2017 ; Fitzpatrick et al., 2011 ; Govindan et al., 2014 ; Hilson and Murck, 2000 ; Pedro et al., 2017 ): and a public policy management perspective (see for example: (Endl, 2017 ; Everingham et al., 2013 ; McAllister et al., 2014 ; Prno and Slocombe, 2012 ). The fact that sustainable development is open to a multitude of interpretations (Hopwood (Hopwood et al., 2005 ), and that the danger of engaging in silo-thinking or one-dimensional approaches exists, there is a need to develop holistic and integrated sustainable development frameworks and guidelines for action. Since the inception of sustainable development, some international organisations (UNDP, World Economic Forum (WEF), ICMM) have strived to interpret the concept in the context of the mining sector (Buxton, 2012 ; ICMM, 2003 ; Sethi and Emelianova, 2006 ; UNEP et al., 2016 ) to provide a broadly accepted framework for action. While some frameworks acquire their legitimacy from broadly accepted stakeholder consortia consisting of private sector actors (ICMM principles), others are delineated from politically derived sets of international development goals (UN, 2015 ). Among these, the SDGs have the benefit that they provide 169 discernible sub targets for different countries and/or sectors that can be more readily transferred to more concrete criteria in other contexts, such as mining (Costanza et al., 2016 ). However, there is little debate on the relationship of corporate practices in the mining sector and the SDGs in Europe. In this regard, research assessing the contribution of corporate sector practices towards sustainable development mostly focuses on scientifically constructed sustainable development frameworks (Bui et al., 2017 ; Moran and Kunz, 2014 ; Moran et al., 2014 ; Ogan et al., 2016 ; Pimentel et al., 2016 ; Yaylacı and Düzgün, 2017 ) that lack societal legitimacy from more broadly accepted or negotiated sustainable development frameworks. Only few studies (Pesmatzoglou et al., 2014 ; Sethi and Emelianova, 2006 ; Sethi and Emelianova, 2011 ; Tost et al., 2016 ; UNEP et al., 2016 ; Yakovleva et al., 2017 ) contextualise the corporate perspective in an integrative sustainable development framework that carries both societal relevance and acceptance. Among these, the report “Mapping Mining to the Sustainable Development Goals: An Atlas” is one of the most comprehensive approaches to interpret a broadly accepted and integrated sustainable development framework in the context of the mining sector. In this regard, it shows what kind of mining corporate practices on a global scale contribute to specific SDGs. According to Starke (2016) , a future-oriented and widely accepted approach, such as the SDGs, would be a change for the mining industry to integrate their practices within a broader sustainable development framework. At the European level, however, there is little to no evidence as to what extent the mining sector contributes to the multi-dimensional framework of the SDGs. Given the recent developments of the European Union to implement a European Agenda for the implementation of the SDGs (EC, 2017 ; Pisano et al., 2016 ), the authors investigated the extent to which the European mining sector can make a contribution to achieving the SDGs.  1.2 European Mining sector challenges and innovation responses The literature review the authors conducted suggests that innovation plays a key role in addressing mining challenges. However, there are two different approaches towards the role of innovations: The first, as supported by e.g. (Mudd, 2010 ; RioTinto, 2014 ; RTC, 2012 ) (Batterham, 2017 ), represents an “inside-out” approach, as it sees the geology (declining grades, deeper and remote ore bodies) and economic viability of an ore body as key, with safety, legislation and the environment seen as major constraints that need to be considered. The focus of innovations is on technology, and their driver is mainly increased profitability. The second approach, representing an “outside-in” approach (e.g. (Buxton, 2012 ; EC, 2013 ; Franks and Cohen, 2012 ; Hilson and Murck, 2000 ; WEF, 2015 ), looks at mining from a broader, sustainability driven, societal perspective, which includes challenges, such as mining's role in a circular economy, supply security, contribution to climate change, and increased consumer demand for transparency. In this case the typology of innovations focuses not only on technology but also on societal concerns as their key drivers. “Mining & Metals in a Sustainable World 2050”, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), provides a summary of the challenges the mining industry will face in the future (WEF, 2015 ). WEF identifies five drivers of change (environmental, technological, societal, geopolitical and geographical) and six “areas of transition” and related key challenges for each area of the mining industry as shown in Table 1  . Particularly relevant in the European context is security of supply and a move towards a circular economy, which touches on all areas in the table below. In summary, the challenges the mining industry faces in the future are strongly linked to sustainability and related frameworks, including the SDGs, with innovation, and, in particular, technological innovations, seen as part of the solution. Comparing current and future challenges of the European mining sector and the recent developments for implementing the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development in Europe, it was investigated to what extent the mining sector can make a contribution to achieving the SDGs in Europe. More specifically, it was analysed which industry innovations exist that can respond to these challenges and what their impact on the SDGs is. In this regard, this paper focuses on the following research question: What is the impact of the current and future Innovation Concepts in mineral extraction on individual SDGs?   2 Materials and methods Overall, this paper engages in an exploratory and qualitative assessment of European innovation trends in the mining sector and their contribution to the SDGs and follows a step-wise approach:• Identification and description of Innovation Concepts in the mining sector: The first step aimed at describing current, as well as upcoming, Innovation Concepts in the mining stage of extraction taking place in Europe.  • Design of a mining sector impact framework based on SDGs: The second step concerned the elaboration of an impact framework based on the SDGs adapted to European mining sector challenges.  • Screening of impacts of Innovation Concepts: The third step characterised Innovation Concept impacts on the SDG impact framework.    Identification and description of Innovation Concepts in the mining sector. First, desk-research was conducted in order to identify: 1) major challenges for the mining sector; and 2) current innovations that are applied in mining in Europe to address these challenges. In this regard, company innovation reports, international organisation or research project reports on best practice examples of mining sector innovations in Europe were screened. Most of the innovations have been identified in the Horizon 2020 Project MIN-GUIDE (Tost et al., 2016 ). The authors compiled 30 responses from a questionnaire and conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with experts from academia, mining companies, NGOs, geological surveys, government, and independent consultants from 14 different European countries, the US, Canada and Brazil to both validate desk-research results on previously identified industry innovations and expand the number of industry innovation examples. The final list consisted of 24 industry innovations currently applied in European mining or corresponding R&D&I projects. In a second step, the authors aggregated industry innovation examples into 18 Innovation Concepts. Innovation concepts characterise a broader definition of concrete, previously identified industry innovation examples (e.g. Rio Tinto's AutoHaul and Codelco's driverless trucks) based on the intended outcomes (“autonomous equipment and operations”). Finally, the Innovation Concepts were clustered in two distinctive groups, aligned with the “inside – out” and “outside-in” approaches mentioned in the introduction (see for example (Enkel et al., 2009 ): 1) innovation concepts improving economic viability/productivity; and 2) innovation concepts responding to societal needs. 2.1 Design of an SDG impact framework The aim of this step was to develop an impact framework that contextualizes the SDGs with the mining sector and, in particular, with regard to the European Mining sector challenges. The work conducted was primarily based on the Mining Atlas (United Nations Development Programme, 2016 ) that describes the mining sector's contribution to each of the SDGs. First, the authors structured individual SDGs in the Mining Atlas (UNEP et al., 2016 ) into separate sub-components (‘SDG Aspects’) that represent more detailed information with regard to the mining sector's contribution to an individual SDG. Second, the authors compiled additional information on each of the SDGs by conducting a literature review on academic and non-academic sources about SDGs in the mining sector (key words used “sustainable development goals”, “mining”). The individual ‘SDG Aspects’ have been used to enhance the understanding of previously elaborated SDG aspects by adding information to the additional explanatory text from academic and non-academic sources.  2.2 Screening of innovation concept impacts During this step, the authors identified and described the impacts of individual Innovation Concepts on the SDG impact framework. A mixed-method approach was once again used: First, desk-research was conducted with accompanying document analysis to identify SDG aspects using concrete innovation examples mostly from Europe (in some cases, examples from outside of Europe, but with equal relevance for Europe, were used), as well as the text describing the elaborated Innovation Concepts. The nature of real impacts of mining on the SDG framework are manifold, reveal themselves in a complex societal network, and sometimes manifest themselves only years after a mining project has started. The main challenge was, therefore, to screen recent and un-tested Innovation Concepts for their potential, ex-ante, direct causal impacts on a sustainable development framework. The screening of Innovation Concepts and their related concrete examples focused on direct and causal effects of the individual innovation examples and should, therefore, not be seen as an assessment of an innovation as a whole. The direct impacts concern company level impacts on their immediate and direct environment as relevant to the specific Innovation Concept. Second order effects, or rebound effects, and effects on the broader socio-economic system, were purposefully excluded. The authors distinguished four types of potential innovation impacts on the SDG framework during the screening and validation process: a) no expected impacts; b) negative expected impacts (mostly based on the description of the innovation and direct relation to an ‘SDG Aspect’); c) positive expected impacts (either explicitly stated in the background documents or based on the description of the innovation and direct relation to an SDG aspect); and d) yet undetermined or controversial expected impacts (in case there are different scientific views on the subject). In a second step, these impacts of Innovation Concepts and their concrete examples were validated by interviews with six experts from academia and industry.  2.3 Scope and limitations • Focus on mining stage extraction: The authors purposefully chose to relate only to innovations in the extraction phase of the mining activity (i.e. extraction involves the development, the opening up of an ore deposit for production, and exploitation, the large scale production of ore in a mine). However, some of the listed Innovation Concepts go beyond extraction, but are still very relevant for, or have a strong influence on, the actual extraction process (e.g. resource characterisation).  • SDG based framework versus other sustainable development frameworks: The SDGs, as a politically tailored and driven approach to achieving sustainable development, are one among many other frameworks currently applied by the mining sector. Although, the SDG framework has some disadvantages to other frameworks, for example, with regard to scientific rigor or specificity (Nilsson and Costanza, 2015 ), it nevertheless represents a universal, integrated and transformational set of global goals and targets for sustainable development and the political declaration on the post-2015 development Agenda.  • System boundaries of impacts: The direct impacts concern company level impacts on their immediate and direct environment as relevant to the specific Innovation Concept. For example, this can be a specific mine and its surrounding stakeholders in the case of “autonomous equipment and operations”, or can be a company and its customers in the case of “new business models and customer relations”. We purposefully excluded second order or rebound effects.  • Data limitations: As this is an exploratory study, the data on Innovation Concepts, while aligned with desktop research on the topic, is based on a low number of expert interviews and questionnaire input, which was conducted with a limited mix of stakeholders mainly from Europe. The validation of impacts was also based on a low number of interviews.      3 Results The results section is divided into two major parts: The first part provides descriptive information on European Innovation Concepts and the analytical SDG framework against which these innovations have been tested for impacts. The second part elaborates on a storyline of impacts describing the impacts of Innovation Concepts on the SDG framework. 3.1 Innovation concepts and examples Table 2   Describes the innovation concepts, lists concrete examples and groups them into “economic” or “societal”, based on the methodology described above. The innovations in the economic group include concepts that can be applied to existing mining operations to improve their profitability or to increase the economic viability of new projects. They are ‘autonomous equipment and operations‘ (which was mentioned in the interviews and questionnaires as most significant for European mining), ‘IT platforms and process control systems‘, ‘continuous mining processes‘, ‘better resource characterisation’, ‘better mine design’, ‘equipment scale up’ and ‘digitally enabled workers‘. The other concepts in this group, ‘disruptive and new mining methods‘, ‘deep sea mining and new financing models‘, mainly apply to new projects and increase their economic viability. The innovations in the societal group are driven by environmental and social concerns and include ‘new business models and customer relations‘, ‘enhanced transparency and traceability’, ‘better land use planning’, ‘shared infrastructure’, ‘low environmental footprint mining’, ‘renewable energy solutions‘, ‘towards zero accidents‘ and ‘better skills base‘.  3.2 Elaboration of an SDG impact framework In this step, an impact framework was developed that contextualizes the SDG framework with the mining sector and, in particular, with regard to the European Mining sector topics and challenges. The work was primarily based on UNEP (UNEP et al., 2016 ) - the Report “White Paper - Mapping Mining to the Sustainable Development Goals: An Atlas” (henceforth referred to as “the Atlas”) – which contextualised the Sustainable Development Goals for the mining sector. In order to develop a suitable impact framework for screening innovation impacts, individual SDGs were structured into separate ‘aspects’ that helped to more clearly identify these impacts. First, SDG aspects in the Atlas were identified that provided a detailed and operationalised description of the SDG. Secondly, based on research on SDGs and the mining sector (de Mesquita et al., 2017 ; Yakovleva et al., 2017 ) existing SDG Aspects were complemented or new ones added. Thirdly, the description of identified SDG Aspects has been complemented with important European policy documents (EC, 2013 , 2016 , 2017 ). A full documentation of identified SDG Aspects can be found in the Annex of this paper, whereas the full description of SDG Aspects (i.e. explanatory text) can be found in the “Supplementary file ”. Table 3   shows SDG 12 “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” as an example that comprises three different SDG Aspects: 1) Minimise resource use and waste; 2) Incorporate life cycle thinking; and 3) integrate sustainability information into reporting. The individual SDG Aspects have been further elaborated with additional explanatory text, such as for the SDG Aspect “Minimise resource use and waste”: minimise use of water, land, energy, and chemicals; minimise production of waste, effluent and emissions; re-purpose waste rock. SDG 12 ″Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. This resulting framework enabled the authors to provide a contextualization for the mining sector and a distinct and valid structure of an SDG impact framework for the latter assessment of Innovation Concept impacts.  3.3 Innovation concept impacts on the SDG impact framework This section provides an overview of the most frequent impacts of the above described Innovation Concepts on the individual SDGs. The full impact screening of all Innovation Concept impacts on the SDGs, which is too large for inclusion in this paper, can be accessed in the “Supporting file” section . Table 4   shows an example depicting the explanation for each impact, of ‘disruptive new or alternative mining methods’ on SDGs 1 to 5. It has two negative impacts on SDG 1, both a positive and a negative impact on SDG 2, an undetermined impact on SDG 3, a positive impact on SDG 4 and no impact on SDG 5. SDG1 “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”.• Aspect “inclusive employment”  • Aspect “Local Procurement”    The majority of negative impacts indicate an overall reduced employment and fewer opportunities for local workers with lower skill levels: the deployment of technologically advanced equipment and machinery requires highly specialised skills and an educated and trained labour force, which is normally not present in remote mining areas. On the contrary, innovation approaches, such as “Shared infrastructure” or “New business models and customer relations”, facilitate, in particular, local procurement and employment opportunities. SDG 2 „End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”• Aspect “Synergies with agriculture”    The majority of positive impacts describe a decreased demand of land for mining purposes, and, thus, reduced pressure of land use for other purposes, such as agriculture. SDG 3 “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”.• Aspect “Occupational health and safety”  • Aspect “Preventative care”    The majority of positive impacts describe a mining installation environment where overall fewer workers are exposed to hazards or improved hazard recognition systems will be in place. Furthermore, positive impacts comprise the reduction of (toxic) emissions to the mine site environment and the local communities. SDG 4 “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”.• Aspect “Train and educate workforce”    The majority of positive impacts describe that technological advancement requires an upgrade of the skills base in the mining sector that leads to training of existing work- and potential labour force, particularly in the area of engineering and computing. SDG 5 “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”: No impacts have been reported for aspects described in SDG 5. SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”.• Aspect “Conserve and recycle water”  • Aspect “Manage water holistically”    The majority of positive impacts describe water conservation and recycling of waste water due to better process controls. Integrated land use planning and monitoring tools positively contribute to a more holistic water management approach. SDG 7 “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”.• Aspect “Improve energy efficiency”    Most positive impacts indicate an increased efficiency in the use of energy in mining operations. SDG 8 “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”.• Aspect “Communicate opportunities and limits of mining”    Most positive impacts deal with improving the economic viability of future mining projects, as well as an increase in employment opportunities for higher skill levels. SDG 9 “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation”.• Aspect “Support local procurement”  • Aspect “Shared infrastructure”    Most positive impacts originate from the benefits of shared infrastructure projects that may: 1) lead to collaborative business models in the area of transport or power generation; 2) better integrate mining site developments into regional development; or 3) facilitate spill-over effects for broader economic development into other sectors/areas. SDG 10 “Reduce inequality within and among countries”.• Aspect “Anticipate inequality related risks”    Negative impacts indicate the inequality related risks with regard to job opportunities in the local community: Job opportunities requiring higher skill levels in urban areas (due to mining control centres) will become more frequent compared to rural/mine site area job opportunities. SDG 11 “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”.• Aspect “Mine unconventional deposits”  • Aspect “Plan land use carefully”    Most positive impacts concern the mining of unconventional deposits, such as new innovations providing access to urban waste landfills or the recovery of critical metals from difficult sources. New collaborative models of mining operations with other economic sectors or integrated regional development plans facilitates better life-of-mine planning and protection and safeguarding of cultural or natural heritage. SDG 12 “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”.• Aspect “Minimise resource use and waste”    The majority of positive impacts concern the waste reduction through reduced fuel use and a minimisation of waste material through more efficient operations. On the contrary, some innovations might cause negative impacts through increased use of water resources while reducing waste material (Bio-leaching) or create new environmental impacts in previously unmined environments (deep-sea mining). SDG 13 “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.• Aspect “Reduce emissions”    The majority of positive impacts describe energy efficiency gains and a consequent reduction in GHG emissions, whereas only a few impacts indicate the use of renewable energy or low-emission fuels as important contributions. SDG 14 “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”.• Aspect “Approach seafloor mining with pre-caution”    One specific Innovation Concept is directly related to this SDG: the emergence of deep sea mining as a new concept of mining. Even if taken with precautions, mining in new environments will cause new environmental impacts to oceans. SDG 15 “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”.• Aspect “Achieve net positive or no net loss impact”  • Aspect “Preserve ecosystem services”    The majority of positive impacts state that a reduced land use for mining activity will lead to a lower impact on eco-system services. Other, less frequent, positive impacts describe that certain biodiversity management approaches and better integrated land use planning procedures achieve a net positive, a no net loss impact, or minimise impacts on biodiversity. SDG 16 “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”.• Aspect “A strong SLO approach”    The impacts listed under SDG 16 provide a more ambivalent picture of both positive and negative impacts: The provision of jobs in the mining sector for the local community was always a strong driver for acquiring a social licence to operate (SLO). However, the deployment of technologically advanced equipment and machinery requiring highly specialised skills and an educated and trained labour force not normally present in remote mining areas might reduce employment opportunities in the local community. However, Innovation Concepts, such as “Shared infrastructure” or “New business models and customer relations”, facilitate, in particular, local procurement and employment opportunities that in turn facilitate a social licence to operate. SDG 17 “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development”.• Aspect “engage in R&D&I collaboration facilitate good practice innovation transfer”    Most positive impacts concern the setup and coordination of (R&D&I) partnerships: The further development, deployment, as well as operation and maintenance of certain Innovation Concepts, requires additional expertise from other sectors, such as computing or robotic engineering. Lastly, the four impact types were plotted (”+“,“-”, “+/−”; blank spaces representing “no impact”) as shown in Table 5   for analysis of the impacts and to identify differences and trends.   4 Discussion and conclusion The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the extent to which current and future mining innovations in Europe can make a contribution to achieving the SDGs. To this end, the authors identified current and future Innovation Concepts, as well as designed an SDG impact framework for identifying the potential direct innovation impacts. In response to current and future Innovation Concepts in mineral extraction in Europe and their impact on individual aspects of the SDGs, the following conclusions can be drawn:• There is no one-size-fits-all single Innovation Concept that will resolve mining's challenges and contribute positively to all the SDGs. Quite on the contrary, almost all Innovation Concepts show repercussions on individual SDGs; i.e. this indicates that Innovation Concepts not only depict synergies, but also trade-offs or imbalances between individual SDG aspects. However, trade-offs implying negative impacts on one SDG might undermine the success of other directly linked or interdependent SDGs (Gibson et al., 2005 ; Onn and Woodley, 2014 ). Thus, making explicit the interdependencies of both goals (e.g. SDGs), as well as measures (e.g. Innovation Concepts), is an important step to anticipate unintended side-effects and design accompanying measures to mitigate these ex-ante.  • The “inside-out” economically driven technological innovations change the societal contract of mining: The promise of increased employment opportunities in the mining sector for the local community was always a strong driver for acquiring a social licence to operate (Joyce and Thomson, 2000 ; Prno and Slocombe, 2012 ). In this regard, SDG 1 (employment and local procurement), SDG 3 (workers' health and safety), SDG 10 (regional inequality), SDG 16 (SLO) provide an interesting nexus of impacts: The majority of negative impacts on SDG 1 indicate overall reduced employment and fewer opportunities for local workers with lower skill levels. In addition, the deployment of technologically advanced equipment and machinery requires highly specialised skills and an educated and trained labour force that is normally not present in remote mining areas, which might reduce employment opportunities in the local community even further. However, innovation approaches, such as “Shared infrastructure” or “New business models and customer relations” facilitate, in particular, local procurement and employment opportunities that, in turn, facilitate a SLO (Collier and Ireland, 2015 ). Furthermore, job opportunities requiring higher skill levels in urban areas (due to mining control centres) will become more frequent compared to rural/mine site area job opportunities, increasing regional inequality related risks. However, the deployment of advanced equipment and machinery, for example, originating from other economic sectors might lead to increased cross-sectoral R&D&I collaboration (Sparc, 2016 ).  • Overall, many of the Innovation Concepts analysed have positive impacts on the environmental SDGs, which is generally due to efficiency improvements compared to currently applied approaches, particularly in the area of GHG emission mitigation and innovation concepts, which generally provide positive impacts. Compared to the high prominence of GHG reduction, the issue of adaptation measures or measures for building up adaptive capacity for future impacts is non-existent: More specifically, none of these innovations takes a precautionary approach towards the integration of climate change impacts on the local environment, which might have serious repercussions on mine site safety, for example. These aspects concern the recognition of climate change in planning and investment, as well as building capacity for increased climate change resilience (Arent et al., 2015 ; Northey et al., 2017 ).  • Innovations do not contribute to SDG 5 on gender equality and empowerment: The topic of gender equality and empowerment of woman was among identified mining sector challenges, as well as innovation concepts and their impacts. Although several authors (Laplonge, 2014 ; Ranchod, 2001 ) point out that gender inequality is a topic of concern for the mining sector overall, this research did not identify it as a cross-cutting issue or stand-alone innovation concept.  • Given their very nature, the societal innovations are mainly positive for the SDGs, i.e. social and environmental, but often have negative implications on the direct economic viability of mining operations, but in the long-term might have positive second order impacts (i.e. SLO).    Further research is needed on the following topics:• The overall environmental impact of these innovations, i.e. the technological ones (see above), needs to be assessed as to whether it leads to an absolute de-coupling, or if there is even a possible rebound effect due to the increased economic viability of additional mines.  • Looking differently at the value chain of materials - an innovation perspective driven by downstream producers and consumers: In the context of SDG 12 “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” and the current circular economy discussions in Europe, a different look on the whole value chain of materials might be needed – while the innovation theme “Enhanced transparency and traceability” was mentioned, the research was as yet unable to find a practical example for driving materials stewardship more towards the raw materials producer, so they are invested in the future use of the materials they mine, e.g. through leasing of metals rather than selling them (Hagan et al., 2019 ), responsible sourcing or materials stewardship programs facilitated by manufacturing companies (Apple, 2017 ; Fleury and Davies, 2012 ).     Declaration of interest None.
