                  This paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the construction of sustainable business models (SBMs). It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI’s association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs.

The results of this experiment, which appear promising, are presented, together with guidelines for its practical application. Potential benefits include dramatic reductions in the effort and cost of forecasting; the provision of an expert 'assistant' for specialist forecasters; and increases in forecasting accuracy.

This paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the construction of sustainable business models (SBMs). It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI’s association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs.   Keywords Artificial Intelligence (AI)  Machine learning sustainability  Cultural drift  Sustainable business models  Knowledge Management System (KMS)    1 Introduction In the last fifty years, the topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received renewed attention from academic scholars. The Dartmouth Research Project defined AI as the problem of “making a machine behave in ways that would be termed intelligent if a human being behaved like this” (McCarthy et al., 1955 ).1  1 http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html    Therefore, AI has to be understood as the ability of a system to act intelligently and to do so in ever wider regions (Nilsson, 1983 ), correctly interpreting external data and using these teachings to attain specific objectives and activities by a flexible configuration (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019 ). In this sense, the AI is a different concept from the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data, albeit connected. The IoT allows the acquisition of external data to be used as input for AI, while Big Data includes data collected by any means (Kaplan, 2012; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2016 ). Furthermore, intelligent systems can faithfully reproduce human behaviours, “which have cognitive, emotional and social intelligence” (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019, p. 6 ). In the same way, AI and machine learning are available in several ways (Brynjolfsson & Mcafee, 2017 ). Still, the aim is to provide and manage intelligent products, services and experiences through the sharing of information for cooperation or creation of optimal and sustainable value (Gretzel, Sigala, Xiang, & Koo, 2015 ). However, AI is still in its infancy, and it is difficult to predict what will be the future of AI. For a better understating and implementation of AI, the world must consider AI requirements and expectations, i.e., enforcement, employment, ethics, education, entente and evolution (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019a,b ). Thus, AI has not only changed the way to generate and use information for decision-making (Mikalef, Framnes, Danielsen, Krogstie, & Olsen, 2017 ). AI has also revolutionised the ways of doing business (Schneider & Leyer, 2019 ), influencing trade and management practices in several sectors that offer increasingly competitive and sustainable products or services (Govindan, Jafarian, & Nourbakhsh, 2019; Kuo & Smith, 2018; Ding, Zhang, & Duygun, 2019; Garbuio & Lin, 2019; Tuan, Thanh, & Le Tuan, 2019; Wirtz & Müller, 2019 ). Indeed, the interaction between artificial technologies and human intelligence bases on algorithms that should help managers make the right decisions, generating a cultural drift in which a large number of data, connections and interactions become part of the standard management of organisations (Schneider & Leyer, 2019 ). These mathematical models simplify the work of managers. They have well catalogued and organised information sets, so much so that previous research has even shown that in many situations, these models are more efficient than human decisions (Kahneman, Rosenfield, Gandhi, & Blaser, 2016 ). Sousa and Rocha (2019)  proposed a model of skills need development – innovation, leadership, and management – for disruptive business managers because AI has applications to business, i.e., intelligence processes. In this context, Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) promote the management of intelligent work (Johannessen, Olsen, & Olaisen, 1999 ) because they bring together human, organisational and technological factors in the process of creating value through the sharing of knowledge (Tsui, Garner, & Staab, 2000; Hlupic, Pouloudi, & Rzevski, 2002; Thomas, Kellogg, & Erickson, 2001 ). KMS constitute the channel for the formation of a corporate culture (Liebowitz, 2001 ) that exploits AI for the improvement of operational processes and business models (Hoeschl & Barcellos, 2006 ) through symbiotic cooperation between man and machine (Miller, 2018 ). This trend can help companies to find a connection between innovation and sustainability (Kuo & Smith, 2018 ) aimed at integrating AI into decision-making processes as well (Duan, Edwards, & Dwivedi, 2019 ) for the achievement of the SDGs. The business sector is at the centre of strategies for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 because it drives the growth of the economy. In fact, companies of any size or production specialisation can develop more responsible business models, giving a decisive boost to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through investments in technological innovation and multi-partnership involvement. Innovation is the engine of business because through innovative technologies, it is possible to implement sustainable models of production and consumption, perfectly in line with the goals of the UN 2030 Agenda, in particular with the SDG#12 (responsible consumption and production – ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns)2  2 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg12 .  . New social and environmental needs must integrate the standard of the company with neoclassical economic theory (Brenner & Cochran, 1991 ; Key, 1999; Stormer, 2003 ), protection of the ecosystem and people, and ensuring social equity (Stubbs & Cocklin, 2008 ). This has led to the spread of sustainable business models in which sustainability consists of balancing all three dimensions (economic, environmental and social) that are “indissolubly connected and interdependent” (Bansal, 2002, p. 123 ). Moreover, several authors have shown that SDG outcomes depend on the interaction between human, technical and natural systems (Nilsson, Griggs, & Visbeck, 2016 ). With this systematic literature review (SLR), we try to understand if and how the introduction of AI contributes to SDGs. More precisely, we investigate the role that KMS should play in redesigning SBMs by fuelling a cultural drift that considers AI not only as a result but above all as a tool capable of redefining operational and decision-making processes to create value. We try to bridge the literature gap by answering the following research questions:(i) What is the role of AI in the development of SBMs from the perspective of the SDGs, in particular the SDGs#12, through KMS?  (ii) How does AI for SBMs generate a cultural drift (CD) which, through KMS, involves the company’s operational and decision-making processes to create value?    To answers these questions, this paper examines the results achieved in this academic field by employing a bibliometric analysis of 73 articles in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019. This study offers a comprehensive review of AI and SBMs through KMS literature in light of SDGs. The key contribution of this study is to provide insights into the state of the art of AI and SBMs, as well as future research directions. According to Boobier (2018) , there might not be a problem conceptualising or crystallising what can be done with AI; however, how AI can be effectively and sensibly deployed may be problematic. The main objective of the paper is to examine the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in creating sustainable business models (SBMs). The main motivation is to conceptualise the role of AI in the development of SBMs from the perspective of the SDGs using KMS. First, there have been recent updates to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12 that discusses artificial intelligence in current and future trends in business, including its association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. Second, the role of AI in SBMs internationally is a permanently hot topic among governments, practitioners, politicians and academics. It is worth discussing developing and testing the role of AI in SBMs through KMS. Finally, there are rare studies on this topic in academic literature. This study intends to help practitioners and policymakers in understanding the importance of AI in SBMs. In addition, this paper is one of the pioneers that discusses the role of AI in SBMs. Although the study on the relationship between AI and SBMs is not new, few studies document the role of AI and SBMs through KMS, particularly in light of SDGs. Thus, this paper contributes to the literature by providing valuable insights into AI and SBMs. Findings reveal that the existing literature covers only some aspects involved in sustainable development through AI, especially achieving high sustainability standards by introducing advanced AI technologies to improve the technical-scientific quality of the production systems. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2  provides a framework for AI in the SDG perspective. Section 3  introduces a theoretical framework for AI and SBMs through KMS. Section 4  describes the method used to conduct the research and the software used for data analysis. Section 5  presents the results, and Section 6  the discussion. Finally, Section 7  puts forward the conclusions and limitations of the study, revealing practical and theoretical insights obtained.  2 Contextual framework for AI in the SDGs perspective The emergence of AI and the potential for its development in the different sectors of society determine the evaluation of its effects on sustainable development (Vinuesa et al., 2019 ). This is because companies are increasingly required to face the challenge of sustainability by trying to improve the scope of innovations to preserve the integrity of the ecosystem and improve the use of natural resources (Joyce & Paquin, 2016 ). The Oxford Dictionary defines sustainability as “avoiding the depletion of natural resources to maintain an ecological balance” . To achieve sustainable development, it is essential to harmonise three fundamental elements: profit, social protection and environmental respect. These elements cannot be separated but are dependent on each other for ensuring the well-being of individuals and societies. In the past, countries adopted the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and its 17 SDGs in 2015. The SDG objectives indicate global priorities for 2030 and establish an action program for people, the planet, prosperity and peace (de Paula Arruda Filho, 2017 ). The goals are addressed to multiple classes of actors and institutions, organisations and civil society; besides, they are intended to boost the business world. The era of SDGs establishes the new sustainable development strategy for companies. A robust and proactive approach is required in the creation of responsible organisations, which also invest in technological development through partnership actions with other companies, to start a global and universal sequence of sustainable development for all companies. Furthermore, the key element for business is represented by innovation, which must concern not only the finished product but also involve all the business processes through innovative technologies and new sustainable solutions in line with the SDGs. Therefore, the SDG#12 is aimed precisely at businesses and aims to guarantee sustainable models of production and consumption, promoting an efficient and responsible approach to natural resources, to “do more and better with less”. In this context, AI plays a decisive role in allowing new technologies to improve efficiency and productivity (Vinuesa et al., 2019 ) through technological improvements that can overcome some current limitations. According to Vinuesa and colleagues (2019) , AI can have a positive impact on all SDGs through technological innovations that lead to better results in different sectors, improving development and having significant effects on civil society and the environment. But these effects can also be negative, considering that some aspects of AI, if not addressed, can inhibit the achievement of different objectives. First of all, the vast wealth that AI can generate could go mainly to those who are already well-off and educated, leaving all others behind. This could also lead to disparities due to unevenly distributed education and resources around the world. Other issues involve enterprises more because they are related to the lack of robust research methods to assess the long-term impact of AI, and there are privacy issues associated with the intensity of AI application data (Sachs et al., 2019 ). Many of these aspects still need a response from governments, even before international organisations are called upon to ensure the protection of progress without compromising the equality and well-being of all individuals (Sachs et al., 2019 ).  3 Theoretical framework for AI and SBMs through KMS Starting from the business model, sustainable change can be encouraged through the renewal of the corporate purpose and organisation, oriented by innovation strategies that push towards the creation of long-term value (Bocken, Short, Rana, & Evans, 2014 ). A business model (BM) provides a “concise representation of how a related set of decision variables in the areas of business strategy, architecture and economics are addressed to create a sustainable competitive advantage in defined markets” (Morris, Schindehutte, & Allen, 2005, p. 727 ). A BM draws the boundaries of the operational and physical structure of the company (Osterwalder, Pigneur, & Tucci, 2005 ), presaging the consequences of corporate operations in the system architecture, encouraging sustainable choices through innovative strategies for the creation of value (Zilahy, 2016 ). The BM is connected to the corporate strategy, but these are distinct concepts because the former looks at the company as a system and describes its functioning. In contrast, the strategy involves the executive processes, the execution and the implementation (Osterwalder et al., 2005 ). Several theoretical approaches have tried to explain the evolution of the BM, as illustrated in Fig. 1  . The approach based on the company’s resources maintains that the resources linked to physical, human and organisational capital determine the competitive advantage when they are integrated into the company operations in an unusual and inimitable way (Barney, 1991 ). In comparison, the theory of transaction costs investigates its relationship with the BM, claiming that the use of modern information technologies favours the reduction of costs in some transactions and the integration of new resources (Coase, 1960 ). Technological development, in its various applications, can affect business management, creating the conditions for reducing costs and increasing value, combining profit and sustainability (Dirican, 2015 ). Thus, technological innovation can facilitate a systemic outreach perspective that includes the need for collaboration and education for SBMs (Bocken et al., 2014 ). SBMs unite economic, social and environmental value according to a multi-stakeholder approach, which is based on maximising the advantages linked to the company’s activity for society and the environment (Lenssen et al., 2013 ). In this regard, according to the theory of contingency, it is necessary to encourage alignment between business management and the external environment (Venkatraman & Prescott, 1990 ), favouring digitisation paths – focused on machine learning and the management of large amounts of data – capable of align business models towards sustainable goals (Brenner, 2018 ). In this scenario, companies are called to implement knowledge management systems capable of exploiting human resources to obtain a competitive advantage through AI (Tsui et al., 2000 ). In more detail, according to the innovation theory, KMS has been suggested as a tool for the management of intelligent work (Johannessen et al., 1999 ) because it favours the collaborative acquisition of information and the sharing of knowledge (Tsui et al., 2000 ). KMS accompanies the adaptation of companies to technological change, bringing together human, organisational and technological factors in the process of value creation (Hlupic et al., 2002; Thomas et al., 2001 ). In trying to exploit the internal and external knowledge of organisations, AI encourages new techniques of knowledge acquisition and representation, improving managers’ awareness that KMS is the substratum of corporate company and culture (Liebowitz, 2001 ). In this way, AI does not replace human resources but tries to imitate rational thinking by improving the flow of management and data processing through systems that exploit digital information (Hoeschl & Barcellos, 2006 ). Moreover, according to Miller (2018) , “human beings and machines must work symbiotically to increase and improve each other’s abilities”, generating a cultural drift that considers AI as a tool for integrating human reasoning and knowledge management (Duan et al., 2019 ). KMS should mainly be acquired in the organisational and business strategy process and integrated with AI (Liao, 2003; Baskerville & Dulipovici, 2006; Strandhagen et al., 2017 ) to improve the company’s sustainable performance and problem-solving skills (Haseeb, Hussain, Ślusarczyk, & Jermsittiparsert, 2019 ). The use of AI in SBMs can support managers’ choices in decision-making and management processes through the use of data to make forecasts and reducing the cost of projections themselves, encouraging a change in the culture and behaviour of organisations (Duan et al., 2019 ).  4 Methodology In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR). SLR adopts a replicable, scientific and transparent process (Tranfield, Denyerd & Smart, 2003 ). Compared to traditional narrative reviews, SLR has the following advantages: i) higher quality of the review process and outcomes (Danese, Manfe, & Romano, 2018; Leonidou, Christofi, Vrontis, & Thrassou, 2018 ); ii) minimise bias and errors (Dada, 2018 ); iii) more validity of the process because of the replicability of the steps applied during the review process (Wang & Chugh, 2014 ); iv) SLR provides literature mapping of a specific research area and data synthesis (Kauppi, Salmi, & You, 2018; Witell, Snyder, Gustafsson, Fombelle, & Kristensson, 2016 ); and v) it offers a framework that integrates existing knowledge to researchers and practitioners (e.g. Dada, 2018; Nofal, Nicolaou, Symeonidou, & Shane, 2018 ). Our methodology is divided into two research steps: the first involves identifying, reading, and understanding significant documents; and the second involves a bibliometric examination of the identified articles. The initial process involves (1) extraction of articles from databases, (2) identification of relevant articles, (3) manual localisation of highly cited articles and (4) identification of other influential articles. Fig. 2   describes in detail the procedure for collecting and analysing data for each level of research to guarantee a reliable methodology. In the first step, we started with the selection of the databases. Following Fink (2019) , the selection process concluded with the selection of the ISI Web of Science (WoS) database. Indeed, WoS is one of the most-used databases in socio-economic disciplines. Moreover, WoS has content comparable in size to Scopus (Hicks & Wang, 2011 ), but it has a standard format and requires less or no data-cleaning operations (Zupic & Čater, 2015 ). During the process of extraction of articles, we completed by manual research on Google Scholar (GS) through the monitoring of citations of further relevant articles in high-ranking quality journals (Rashman, Withers, & Hartley, 2009 ) to avoid neglecting any important and relevant reference for our research (Massaro, Dumay, & Guthrie, 2016 ). The selection of journals was made based on relevance to the topics investigated. Therefore, journals are known to receive documents on AI, sustainable development and technological change were consulted, such as Journal of Knowledge Management , Journal of Management Education , Business Strategy and the Environment , Sustainability , Journal of Business Research and Business Horizons  (Okoli & Schabram, 2010 ). To collect all the studies undertaken on AI and SBMs, we chose a vast period for research – from 1990 (imposed by default by WoS) to 2019 (Table 1  ). In addition, to identify relevant contributions, we launched several searches through truncated associations of two groupings of search strings:- Grouping 1 : including all documents on AI and sustainability.  - Grouping 2 : collecting all the contributions on AI and business model.    The identification of the relevant articles was focused on these two combined groups in order not to exclude interesting contributions concerning the topic studied, but above all to highlight the potential correlations between the results obtained in the two groups. This choice allowed us to gather all the studies on AI in the field of sustainable development (SD), without neglecting the effects of AI on business models (BM). Indeed, AI is a constant reference in the search strings, as it constitutes the core topic of our research from which analyses of the relationships with SD and BM have been developed. In the second step, we selected the relevant articles through a content analysis carried out by a meticulous reading of the abstracts, according to the guidelines of our research. In particular, we highlighted the correspondence of each article with the issues addressed in our study. The analysis of the content allowed us to systematise the data in a replicable way; hence, all the authors worked separately, analysing the connection of each document with respect to the issues investigated; after that, they compared their results. Indeed, the individual and comparative method regarding results guaranteed greater reliability of the research (Krippendorff, 1980 ). In the penultimate step, considering that the WoS might neglect some documents sensitive to our analysis framework, we conducted integrative research on GS according to the same standards. Also, we considered GS for articles before 1990; therefore, we verified that previous articles had considered the same goals as our research. The fourth and final phase is based on the independent work of each author. They critically analysed each article to identify the aspects of interest concerning the research issues. After excluding insignificant articles and duplicates, all authors discussed their results and prepared the various paragraphs of the SLR. The final list of works was composed of 73 articles. The bibliometric analysis of these selected articles is explained in Section 5.1 .  5 Results This section presents the results which are organised as follows: (1) the bibliometric aspects of the selected articles; (2) the content of the articles; and (3) the classification by secondary topic. 5.1 Bibliometric aspects of the selected articles The selected articles were analysed on Bibliometrics to process statistical and graphical testing clever enough to recap the research and highlight the spatio-temporal aspects of the results obtained. Indeed, bibliometric analysis allows one to perform a “transparent” and “reproducible” SLR (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017, pp. 959–960 ), providing more reliable results in the systematic process of scientific information on a topic, without the danger of neglecting past documents. Fig. 3   presents the “WordCloud” of the abstracts and highlights the most common words in the abstracts of the articles that are available in databases. The size of words in the image solely depend on word occurrence in selected articles. As the figure shows, the keywords of our study are AI and business model, located in the centre of the map. The word “business” occurs 45 times in the articles of our collection, followed by the word “model”, which appears 41 times. The words “artificial” and “intelligence” occur 36 and 33 times, respectively, in the articles of our collection and were constant throughout the research period (ex multis Arinze, Kim, & Anandarajan, 1997; Cui & Wong, 2004 ; Min, 2010; Omoteso, 2012; Yoo & Kim, 2018 ; Govindan et al., 2019 ; Wirtz & Müller, 2019 ; Barro & Davenport, 2019; Ding et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019a ). Next, the words “neural” (24), “networks and systems” (16) and “decision and data” (14) recur in most of the articles examined and are introduced in Table 1  of the Appendix. Based on the bibliometric analysis, we rebuilt the conceptual diagram that expresses the degree of correlation between the keywords in the database (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017 ). Fig. 4   shows that the keywords are pigeonholed according to a colour match. This conceptual diagram facilitates the reading of the concepts and their connections, making the analysis timelier (Liu, 2004 ). Fig. 4  shows the correspondence by colour, which measures the index of recurrence of words in terms of frequency, thus depicting the intertwining of the questions examined. Regarding the correspondence by colour, it is interesting to note, ex multis , that the words “model, cognition, big data, consumption, decisions” have connections. So do the words “performance, determinants, AI methods, competencies, business strategy, critical success factors” or “integration, technology, agent-based framework, customer satisfaction, circular economy”. This co-occurrence index demonstrates how close the link is between AI and business models; AI is able to affect business performance, ensuring customer satisfaction in the circular economy. During the period of study (from 1990 to 2019), the topic of investigation has increased since 2014, as evident from the dynamic analysis of the main sources of the dataset (Fig. 5  ). This figure is interesting with respect to the aims of our research because, in 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda and its goals. Consequently, such a surge, especially for the publications Sustainability, Business Horizons, Computers & Operations Research and International Journal of Logistic Research and Applications, would seem to point to close correlations between technological development, AI and SDGs. The peak of interest on the part of scholars is recorded in 2018. Moreover, this interest has been registered more among American authors, followed by Germany, China and Korea (Fig. 6  ). This may be because the US represents one of the world’s major economic powers – along with Germany, China and Korea – that are affected by programs of technological development and AI. Additionally, it is interesting to note that most of the studies conducted on our topic took place in countries that are not part of the EU. However, the presence of Germany and, to a lesser extent, Spain, Denmark and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Community, bodes well for an economic and cultural commitment to the issues of AI and sustainable development.  5.2 Content of the selected articles Following the various stages through which this study was carried out, we obtained the following results from the bibliometric analysis performed on 73 studies. Regarding the content of the articles, Table 1  in the Appendix shows a framework of analysis based on the following categorisations: (a) year; (b) author; (c) journal; (d) article type; (e) subtopic; (f) aims and findings; and (g) methodology. The classification of the articles carried out with Table 1 , through the schematisation of the subtitles and a brief description of the purpose of each article, revealed that most scholars had studied the implications of technological development and artificial intelligence in general on models of business (Lacher, Coats, Sharma, & Fant, 1995; Fish, Barnes, & AikenAssistant, 1995; Arinze et al., 1997; Klauck & Müller, 1997; Zhang, Hu, Patuwo, & Indro, 1999 ; Hsieh, 2009 ; Min, 2010 ; Govindan et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ; Metcalf, Askay, & Rosenberg, 2019 ). Some had instead studied in particular the implications that AI has for SBMs, considering that sustainability has become a relevant issue in commercial operations (Hsieh, 2009 ; Min, 2010 ; Yoo & Kim, 2018; de Pádua Pieroni, McAloone, & Pigosso, 2019; de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2019 ; Govindan et al., 2019 ; Metcalf et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ). Moreover, AI has a key influence on the development prerogatives of companies in more and different sectors that are increasingly interested in combining profit with sustainability requirements. Thus, if companies neglect the environmental or social effects, their reputation and, consequently, their income could be negatively affected (Babu & Mohan, 2018 ). Thus, AI represents a powerful tool for competitiveness (Jackson, 2019 ); in terms of a long-term vision, it can contribute to sustainable development, which puts man at the centre and puts technological progress at its service. According to Govindan et al. (2019) , many companies strive to identify and put into practice more sustainable solutions for supply chains. This is due also to the stimuli and prerogatives of the interested parties, such as consumers, social activists and non-governmental organisations, who require an increased commitment to sustainable solutions on the part of the companies. Recalling the lesson of Turing (1950) , who said that “if a human being interacts with another human being and a machine and is unable to distinguish the machine from the human, then the machine is said to be intelligent”, AI is based on advances in machine learning, value creation through the analysis of numerous series of data and the understanding of decision-makers, and improvement and acceleration of decision-making (Hsieh, 2009 ; Min, 2010 ; Govindan et al., 2019 ; Metcalf et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ). A growing body of research shows that AI helps people make better decisions (Barro & Davenport, 2019 ; Wirtz & Müller, 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ). Therefore, in the perspective of sustainable development (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2019 ), it becomes fundamental for companies to identify the strategies that would allow them to dominate their competitive sector and extract new information from large sets of data that could be useful for making decisions and management (Orriols-Puig, Martínez-López, Casillas, & Lee, 2013 ). Above all, according to Kuo and Smith (2018 ), most companies considered the development of sustainable products as competitive opportunities. However, many of them were unable to expand these products on their own. Therefore, to create a sustainable business model, they united all the members of the supply chain. Decisions regarding product implementation and supply chains are necessary for determining a significant improvement in management. Changes in technology support the creation of these optimised business models (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2019 ). Efforts to create adequate business models have attracted much attention from scholars and practitioners. Still, in all the models examined by scholars, there is no general framework for instructing AI-based management systems that distribute roles, individuals, authority and decision-making responsibility without neglecting the ethical implications connected to AI (Wirtz & Müller, 2019 ). Most advances in AI technology have taken place in the private sector, where risk management is quite important because it contributes directly to value creation (Allayannis & Weston, 2001; Lewellen, 2006 ). In particular, it has been shown (Ding et al., 2019 ) that AI could be applied to forecasts of the volatility of raw material prices by exploiting all the information available on the market. Otherwise, there is little experimentation with the use of intelligent administrative systems for the public sector (Wirtz and Müller, 2019 ). The main reason for using AI in public sector organisations could be the provision of public value (for example, to coordinate and meet service demands) to citizens (Eggers, Fishman, & Kishnani, 2017 ). For instance, in the health sector, which represents one of the main drivers of the economy of each country, the most considerable difficulties lie in the patients’ big data and hospital and laboratory information systems (Wang, Kung, & Byrd, 2018 ). Therefore, several studies have investigated how new technologies can increase productivity in the health system by improving decision-making processes through information management. Indeed, Tuan and colleagues (2019) have shown that promoting the use of AI and Big Data in the Vietnamese health system (not yet digitalised) could provide high-level services. Using intelligent systems, people would have the power to administer their health through intelligent technologies and to receive specific treatments through web content. People could also gain access to more affordable health systems and even improve health outcomes (Hajli & Featherman, 2018 ). In this way, AI could also revolutionise how health professionals and managers collect information and treat requests from patients and their families, as well as medical and service staff (Garbuio & Lin, 2019 ). Indeed, health care services based on AI not only promote the quality of service for the recipients of direct and indirect services but also have to ensure an efficient cost plan for healthcare professionals. Sivarajah, Kamal, Irani, and Weerakkody (2017)  highlighted that Big Data offers both Big Opportunities (i.e., value creation) and Big Challenges (i.e., data integration complexities, data security and privacy issues). Also, current and past studies on Big Data have only contributed conceptually and empirically to the expansion of Big Data Analytics among organisational resource management and technology disciplines. Hence, it is necessary to build business models that consider the specificity of a context characterised by specific regulation and the presence of numerous stakeholders (Chen, Wen, & Yang, 2014 ). AI is encouraging new managerial approaches for performance analysis, improving understanding of the market and user preferences, and optimising processes (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019a ). Recently, research has also tried to make the financial distress forecasting models more efficient by testing various business analysis overtures, including statistical methods and AI (Kim, Lee, & Ahn, 2019 ). An inaccurate credit rating based on a forecast of inadequate financial difficulties can cause an improper asset valuation, which threatens the financial sustainability of a company. Therefore, Kim and colleagues (2019) suggested a new type of hybrid model to improve the performance of the typical algorithm for predicting financial distress. Also interesting is the survey of AI analytical applications in the universities, with significant consequences for faculty members and students due to the simplification of teaching and learning (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019a ). Indeed, studies on AI have also examined the problem of the displacement of human labour-power by machines (Omoteso, 2012 ; Orriols-Puig et al., 2013 ; Wright & Schultz, 2018 ; Klumpp, 2018 ; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019a ). The extensive capabilities of AI combined with increasingly accurate data production lead us to believe that the transition to artificial intelligence will also have significant effects on the workforce because it will allow us to perform a multitude of activities faster, better and at lower costs (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019a ). In the same way, managers aware of the loss of human resources will have to re-evaluate the skills and know-how of the workers called to work alongside the machines (Huang, Rust, & Maksimovic, 2019 ). This will require structuring KMS that allow the expansion of the framework of individual knowledge with the implications of AI, thus ensuring an adequate level of training for personnel capable of exploiting the potential of AI (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2020 ). However, the main concerns relate above all to the loss of jobs for less qualified workers and the shift in the distribution of income from labour to capital (Sachs et al., 2019 ). The use of computerised techniques based on artificial intelligence seems to have substantial utility for professionals searching for great methods to interrogate the data sets to improve the marketing function of an organisation (Orriols-Puig et al., 2013 ). Indeed, AI can improve productivity in two ways: by automating some activities previously performed by people; and by bringing the systems to work and adapt to circumstances with increasingly reduced, if not absent, human control3  3 OECD, 2019: Artificial Intelligence in Society.  . Primarily, an architecture of integrated, human and artificial knowledge can select and store huge amounts of data from operating systems to offer answers on objectives, models and relationships, creating a vortex of knowledge that includes man and machine (Nemati, Steiger, Iyer, & Herschel, 2002 ). The integration of AI into processes and corporate strategy has changed the way organisations do business (Strandhagen et al., 2017 ), revealing a renewed logic of creating value that influences corporate culture by involving sustainability in the business model (Duan et al., 2019 ). AI can cope with the changes required by social and environmental issues related to corporate activity, directing the BM towards a logic of value creation (Zilahy, 2016 ), which is founded on new forms of governance based on sharing knowledge and skills (Buzko et al., 2016 ). Planning AI through KMS can contribute to the development of a BM that generates opportunities for growth and well-being for all individuals in the context of a 5.0 Society “able to provide the goods and services needed by the people who need them at the right time and in the right amount; a society capable of responding with precision to the most varied social needs; a society that can provide the goods and services needed by those in need; a society in which all types of people can get high-quality services, beyond any difference in age, sex, religion and language, and live a vigorous and comfortable life”4  4 The 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan, 22 January 2016, Government of Japan, https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/english/basic/5thbasicplan.pdf   .   6 Discussion and analysis of the results Starting from the analysis of the results of our research, the progress made around AI gives rise to the need to investigate not only the economic but also the cultural and social implications of the use of intelligent systems. Most growing economies recognise the revolutionary character of AI and have experimented with variable overtures that consider their political, economic, cultural, and social systems, through more or less important investments5  5 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the regions, Brussels, 25.4.2018 COM (2018) 237 final.  . The data management that is increasing seems to be the leading reason for enterprises to implement an AI architecture. In this direction, public and private organisations are engaged in a cultural change to improve the reach, speed, and accuracy of information processing (Wirtz & Müller, 2019 ). This is achieved by using mathematical algorithms that facilitate learning or knowledge management software that helps to allocate resources more efficiently and effectively. For public entities, the goal is to manage the affairs of citizens with higher speed and quality when facilitating access to public services (Min, 2010 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Wirtz & Müller, 2019 ; Tuan et al., 2019 ). For private organisations, the use of AI is for identifying solutions to improve the competitiveness of business (Govindan et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ; Metcalf et al., 2019 ) and limit the negative effects on the environment (Kuo & Smith, 2018 ) while pursuing sustainable development goals (Yoo & Kim, 2018 ; Govindan et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ; Metcalf et al., 2019 ). AI has the potential to address some of the most pressing challenges for the future of humanity, such as the achievement of the SDGs (McKinsey, 2018 ). SDGs represent common goals about several important development issues, including AI. However, health (SDG#3), education (SDG#4) and resilient infrastructures (SDG#9) see a high number of practices already in place (McKinsey, 2018 ; Vinuesa et al., 2019 ). Our study has shown that there is still a research gap concerning the implications that AI may have for SDG#12. Hence, this goal encourages enterprises, particularly large multinationals, to adopt sustainable practices and to support developing countries in improving their scientific and technological capabilities to create and implement more sustainable models as well as production and consumption tools to monitor the impacts of sustainable development. Businesses, true drivers of the world economy and development, can increase investments in AI and related technologies; support the adoption of digital technologies based on AI in the production processes; strengthen the educational offers at every level to bring AI to the workforce; and exploit the potential of the data economy, the real fuel for AI. In this way, they can contribute to the new cultural drift (CD) that aims to combine progress and socio-environmental well-being through the development of KMS (Liebowitz, 2001; Buzko et al., 2016; Jia, Guo, Li, Li, & Chen, 2018; Haseeb et al., 2019 ). SDGs also represent support for the institutions and governments of each country called to decline and calibrate the objectives of the 2030 Agenda in the context of their economic, social and environmental planning, with significant effects in regulated sectors, including the AI sector. According to Barro & Davenport (2019 ), the success of organisations will depend on their ability to innovate operations, products and services through their human capital. On the other hand, competition between AI and HR is emerging with respect to activities that can be automated, allowing workers to engage in higher-profile tasks (Chelliah, 2017; Maduravoyal, 2018 ). However, while the use of AI in public sectors such as healthcare has experienced rapid growth, the literature on the application of AI in companies through KMS is still scarce. Companies are unable to exploit the potential of AI through knowledge sharing systems, which instead help AI to penetrate the corporate culture, orienting the business (Tambe et al., 2019 ). Indeed, even if AI will eliminate some jobs in the next decade, it can open up vast new opportunities for collaboration between man and machine. Then, the ability to adapt to change will be determined by the ability to harness new knowledge through the combination of KMS and AI (Stone, Neely, & Lengnick-Hall, 2018 ). Some scholars have also examined the ethical and social aspects related to the use of AI, noting that the evolution of company automation could accentuate the disparities between people in less and more developed countries (Wright & Schultz, 2018 ). If political institutions do not intervene to reduce the distance between rich, technologically advanced countries and weaker, less developed economies, technology is likely to contribute to growing inequality (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019 ). 6.1 A holistic comparison of our findings with other studies Although sustainable business model research is a relatively new field in management studies (Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011 ), the main findings show that numerous studies had focused on business model innovation. Still, there is a lack of debate on the role of AI in the development of SBMs from the perspective of SDGs. For example, there has been broad scholarship on business model innovation in the last decade (e.g., Demil & Lecocq, 2010; Johnson, 2010; Teece, 2010; Zott et al., 2011; Žigienė, Rybakovas, & Alzbutas, 2019; Nosratabadi et al., 2019 ). It can be argued that past studies focused only on business model innovation. Nevertheless, organisations are not fully implementing new business models with advanced technologies, i.e., AI, and this research area is still unexplored (Nosratabadi et al., 2019; Foss & Saebi, 2017 ), although some concepts and new definitions of AI and SBMs are required for successful market introduction (Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2013; Žigienė et al., 2019; Nosratabadi et al., 2019 ). In the literature, there is even less research conducted on sustainable business model innovation and other advanced technologies, and the concept of AI remains underexplored (Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2013; Schaltegger, Hansen, & Lüdeke-Freund, 2016; Žigienė et al., 2019; Nosratabadi et al., 2019 ). After reviewing these recent studies, it may also be noted that the role of AI in the development of SBMs from the perspective of SDGs is currently not available in academic literature and not well explored. Thus, these studies allowed authors to recognise the importance and simultaneous exploration of AI in the development of SBMs. As the number of studies increases every year, scholars and companies could expect some convergences between AI and SBMs through KMS. The spread and effectiveness of AI in the SBM domain have not been well investigated, and our findings shed light on the role of AI in SBMs with the perspective of SDGs. In-depth investigations of future AI trends in SBMs have not yet been discussed in the literature.  6.2 Theoretical and practical implications of the study AI has been applied in numerous domains, and several terms are used for AI-based systems, i.e., intelligent software agent systems, expert systems, intelligent executive systems, knowledge-based systems, etc. Due to Big Data and Advanced Algorithms, AI has become more popular today as an embedded element of digital systems. In summary, AI has an impact on human decision making, and this has gotten considerable attention from researchers who have investigated the implications of AI for decision making. This SLR offered several useful insights into the existing status of research into AI and SBMs. This paper contributes to practice and academia in two ways. First, this paper examines the role of AI in the development of SBMs from the perspective of the SDGs, in particular the SDGs#12, through KMS. Second, this study sheds light on how AI for SBM generates a cultural drift (CD) which, through KMS, involves the company’s operational and decision-making processes to create value. Theoretically, this is one of the first studies to discuss the role of AI in the development of SBMs from the perspective of SDGs by employing bibliometric analysis and contributing to the body of knowledge. This paper also opens a new discussion for researchers in the field of the fourth industrial revolution. This paper extends the research stream on AI and SBMs by demonstrating and analysing the key trends related to the challenges of SDGs. From a practical perspective, the current paper is most significant for organisations handling the role of AI technology-related issues of SBMs through KMS under the umbrella of SDGs. This paper is valuable for practitioners who deal with the role of AI for sustainable development in a company. Notably, this paper helps organisations to understand the impact of AI on SBMs, and companies may solve various issues. This paper offers to the practice community, insights into the plethora of AI and SBMs and into their application under SDGs. Thus, the SLR insight presented will offer an opportunity for practitioners and applied researchers to understand the role of AI for sustainable development among companies. In the end, this study provides a general framework for businesses in capturing the AI benefits and its implications in SBMs through KMS. 6.2.1 Guidelines for practitioners under UN 2030 agenda via AI The blow are some guidelines for practitioners for the achievement of the UN 2030 agenda via AI;i. The precise definition of AI is needed and related terms of AI development and its applications in the era of SBMs through KMS to achieve SDGs.  ii. There is a need to develop and test theoretically, the use of AI and its impact on decision making its benefits. This study outlined an integrated conceptual framework for a systematic understanding of AI for decision making through KMS and SBMs.  iii. AI can have several roles in decision making, but AI should be accepted through cultural drift by human decision-makers as a decision support tool.  iv. The ergonomic design of AI systems is essential for their success to achieve SDGs.  v. AI systems performance for decision making can be improved by machine learning.  vi. The success of AI is based on AI users’ personal traits and knowledge and understanding of AI.  vii. There is a dire need to fully understand the synergy of AI and SBMs and its implications for AI research and practice.  viii. Different cultures and personal values may affect the acceptance of AI for decision making.  ix. AI application for decision making may change the culture of organisations and individual behaviour.  x. AI and its impact on society can be controlled by the Government.      6.3 Policy recommendation AI has rapid and effective, integration in various domains, which is based on the policy design, implementation and monitoring of AI strategies. This study emphasises on the AI and SBMs through KMS and liveability and sustainability of AI among organisations. This study proposes that policymaker’s dwell into one key dimension, which is Cultural Drift first and foremost before the integration of technology. The outcome of this study a new framework, which looks at how to effectively integrate technology AI in SBMs while aligning AI help to improve efficiency and productivity (Vinuesa et al., 2019 ) through technological improvements. Governments and organisations need to develop pragmatic strategies to educate AI within the workplace, and the implementation of AI may provide the benefit to the UN SDGs directly and indirectly over time as AI technologies changes (Hughes et al., 2019 ). Besides, the integration of AI within organisations and the ethical considerations of the technology is important for the success of SDGs (Sun & Medaglia, 2019 ). The latest technology has always been challenging for organisations having minimal resources. This paper recommends that AI become a result as well as the tool to achieve SBMs in organisations. For better implementation of these technologies (AI through KMS), a company has to develop a proper infrastructure and a formal culture to support the new technology.  6.4 Limitations of the study This paper provides valuable insights for practitioners and academicians; however, this paper also has certain limitations because it is limited to an exploratory investigation of the use of AI for SBMs through KMS. Moreover, this paper is based on a systematic literature review using 73 articles, which is one of the limitations, and there is a possibility that the authors might have missed some items during article screening. Another limitation is that this paper considers the SDG perspective with regard to AI and SBMs. Lastly, no primary data was employed to support the development of the research propositions.  6.5 Avenues for future research and recommendations This paper employed a bibliometric analysis for systematic literature review. Therefore, it could be interesting to undertake quantitative studies aimed at investigating the KMS practices adopted by organisations to understand how they can encourage the insertion of AI and whether this produces new knowledge and generates value. Future research should employ a mixed-method approach because interviews with companies’ managers may lead to better results and understanding. Additionally, the outcomes of this paper should be applied to small-scale companies. Future research should deliberate other elements of Industry 4.0, i.e., the cyber-physical system.   7 Concluding remarks This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI in forming SBMs. AI and SBMs is a relatively nascent field of research. The results indicate that the literature focused on only some aspects involved in sustainable development through AI. Yet, there are still several gaps about the underpinnings linking these concepts. Less attention has been paid to the guidelines established for companies by the UN 2030 Agenda, which represents an imperative for all countries called to face the challenge of the link between human health and the health of natural systems. To achieve high sustainability standards, it is necessary to improve the technical-scientific quality of the production systems. In the last hundred years, technology and innovation have brought huge improvements to our living conditions. And technological development and innovation will be at the centre of the transition to a sustainable future. Digital technologies can help create SBMs, increasing productivity, reducing production costs and emissions, decreasing the intensity of production process resources, improving correspondence in the markets, and allowing the use of big data to make public services more readily available (Sachs et al., 2019 ). This can be done by integrating AI into the company’s decision-making processes, aligning the human dimension with the artificial one through the diffusion of KMS. The innovation theory suggests to practitioners that the adaptation of companies to technological change passes through the implementation of KMS, which can encourage the sharing of internal and external knowledge for the creation of value. The promotion of SBMs is not the only area to be addressed because the evolution of disruptive technology such as AI has to be governed by embracing an organic vision of cultural drift, on the process of organisational strategy and BM to avoid potentially harmful uses for man and society as a whole. AI is enveloping our world and changing our society. The way we manage the evolution of AI will impact our way of life, giving us opportunities and benefits. But there is also a danger that more technological companies will be less democratic. Therefore, the EU must work in order to AI is applied with respect to the fundamental values of civil society, as well as promote within the fundamental rights of the Union as ethical principles such as responsibility and transparency. At the global level, politicians, researchers and companies are coming together to develop common principles that should ensure that all AI technologies are applied responsibly. Governments need a strategy to design and implement key interventions through regulatory standards, physical infrastructures and digital systems capable of capturing the benefits of the digital revolution for SDGs, while avoiding the numerous potential pitfalls (Sachs et al., 2019 ). But above all, they have to encourage knowledge management and sharing tools capable of promoting dialogue between man and machine, involving decision-making processes directly. In this way, AI becomes the tool to achieve an SBM by enhancing the potential of man. This comprehensive review provides a holistic view of that has been done in AI and SBMs area, as well as a general framework, integrating current research findings and offering several future directions. This study outcome will encourage business academics to understand the importance of AI rich data that lie in the dusty volumes of existing and motivate them to investigate further and to be advanced knowledge in this research domain. Thus, this study helps to develop a higher level of awareness about company’s strategies to adopt AI through KMS to achieve the SDGs and to respond to the challenges of the market. Therefore, scholars, professionals and institutions must join in this effort towards sustainability by continuing to investigate the phenomenon and implementing a public–private partnership network to anticipate and manage the profound social changes connected to the digital revolution. Furthermore, it could be interesting to analyse the results achieved in terms of sustainability in business models, taking into account the critical and success factors in the various economic sectors and national infrastructures. Nevertheless, and above all, public awareness campaigns and activism should be mobilised to explain the ethics of sustainable development and promote community participation because the success of any transformation never comes only from above.
