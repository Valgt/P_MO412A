                  The installed wind power capacity is rapidly growing worldwide, and large volumes of waste materials would need to be treated due to the decommissioning of wind turbine systems in the next years. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the sustainability performance of decommissioning options for wind turbines and suggest policies to improve the sustainability of the wind turbine end-of-life phase by jointly applying Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodologies. Unlike most of the relevant literature, which focuses mainly on technical aspects of wind turbine decommissioning, the proposed approach considers all three dimensions of sustainability using Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guide to identify economic, environmental, and social indicators. The methodology is applied to a representative case study of a wind turbine operating in the Greek territory using real data. Repurposing was found to be the most sustainable end-of-life alternative for composite waste. In contrast, the waste treatment option of the foundation concrete contributes substantially to the sustainability performance of the examined scenario. The sustainability performance of these technologies could be enhanced by the operation of dedicated concrete and composite materials recycling facilities close to wind parks, following cross-sectoral approaches. The results also indicate that the social aspects of the sustainability framework are equally important and should be considered when strategies towards more sustainable waste management of wind turbine systems are designed.

Department of Industrial Management & Technology, University of Piraeus 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St Piraeus 18534 Greece       The installed wind power capacity is rapidly growing worldwide, and large volumes of waste materials would need to be treated due to the decommissioning of wind turbine systems in the next years. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the sustainability performance of decommissioning options for wind turbines and suggest policies to improve the sustainability of the wind turbine end-of-life phase by jointly applying Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodologies. Unlike most of the relevant literature, which focuses mainly on technical aspects of wind turbine decommissioning, the proposed approach considers all three dimensions of sustainability using Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guide to identify economic, environmental, and social indicators. The methodology is applied to a representative case study of a wind turbine operating in the Greek territory using real data. Repurposing was found to be the most sustainable end-of-life alternative for composite waste. In contrast, the waste treatment option of the foundation concrete contributes substantially to the sustainability performance of the examined scenario. The sustainability performance of these technologies could be enhanced by the operation of dedicated concrete and composite materials recycling facilities close to wind parks, following cross-sectoral approaches. The results also indicate that the social aspects of the sustainability framework are equally important and should be considered when strategies towards more sustainable waste management of wind turbine systems are designed.

The increase in electricity generated by wind turbines amounted to almost 265 TWh in 2022 (14%), having the second highest growth rate among all electricity generation technologies from renewable energy [1] . Similarly, the global capacity of installed wind turbines increased by 75 GW (＋9%) and reached 899GW at the end of 2022, achieving a growth rate equivalent to the one of overall renewable capacity (＋9.6%) [2] . The acceleration of renewable energy sources installation, with wind energy having an important share, is constitutive element of the policy packages which have been launched by European Union to achieve the long-term strategy of carbon neutrality by 2050 [3–7] . According to the European Association of the Wind Power Industry, in 2020, 34,000 wind turbines had been already operating in the European territory for at least 15 years, with an estimated capacity of 36 GW. From those, about 9 GW and 1 GW had been operating for 20–24 years and for more than 25 years, respectively [8] . The most widely accepted operation lifespan of a modern wind turbine system is 20–25 years [9,10] . Furthermore, the rapid advancement of wind turbine design and the relevant technology have made available new wind turbine models presenting significant performance improvements. Thus, wind park operators could replace the pre-existing wind turbines with advanced, more efficient models to increase wind utilization, therefore, the electricity generation and the economic output of their wind farms [11] . It is evident that the number of wind turbines reaching their EOL will increase substantially in the near future. Even though wind is a renewable and without-cost primary energy source and as a consequence, the wind power industry is considered sustainable a priori, the sustainability of wind turbine decommissioning should be robustly evaluated following a life cycle approach. Nowadays, the three-bladed, horizontal axis model is the most common commercial wind turbine [12] . During the decommissioning of such a wind turbine, the main waste materials generated include metals, namely, aluminium, copper, steel and iron, composites, and the concrete used for the wind turbine foundation [13] . Regarding metallic materials, they are easy to recover, retaining most of their initial mechanical and chemical properties, whilst they are characterized by a high average recyclability rate, i.e., around 90%–95% [14,15] . When it comes to the EOL treatment of the concrete of the wind turbine foundation, the main options are mechanical recycling, landfill disposal and burial at the installation site. The concrete is usually recovered as a substitute for natural aggregates diminishing the amount of waste concrete disposed to landfills and raw materials extracted from nature [16,17] . Although concrete recovery is considered environmentally beneficial, recycling is not dominant among the waste management alternatives for concrete. This can be attributed to the negative consequences on the environment mainly due to the transportation of waste concrete from the wind farm to the recycling site and the relatively lower production cost for new concrete compared to the mechanical recycling process cost [18] . The recyclability of a representative wind turbine, excluding the foundation concrete, is currently estimated between 80% and 90% [10,19] . Although the recycling alternatives for the majority of the materials of a typical wind turbine are technologically mature, several challenges arise due to the complexity of the waste treatment of the composites mainly found in the wind turbine blades. The blades of the currently installed wind turbines consist of glass fibre-reinforced thermoset polymer composites [20] . In the literature, it has been estimated that the annual amount of decommissioned wind turbines in Europe would reach 325–495 ktons in 2050, while currently landfill disposal makes the dominant EOL alternative for the composite materials found mainly in wind turbine blades [21] . However, incineration might not be an efficient alternative for composites as they do not represent an appropriate combustible material due to their special properties, while the method itself is associated with the production of large amounts of ash requiring additional processing [22] . Considering the disposal of composite waste materials, the EU waste management strategy strives for drastic reduction of the materials buried in landfills, especially if they have not already been treated before [4,6,7] . In this context, landfill of composite materials either has already been outlawed or noticeably restricted in numerous EU member states towards achieving circularity principals. At the same time, the European Association of Wind Power Industry speaks out against landfill disposal of wind turbine blades urging its forbiddance on until 2025 [10,23] . Several recycling options for wind turbine blades have been developed, being assorted into three main categories: mechanical, thermal, and chemical. Mechanical recycling employs cutting, crushing, milling, and shredding techniques to reduce the size of the composite waste materials. The outcome of the process is fibrous or powdered materials which can be used as a filler, reinforcement, or raw material for the production of new composite materials, cement, asphalt, or other building materials [24–29] . Regarding thermal recycling techniques, these include conventional pyrolysis, fluidized bed process, and microwave-assisted pyrolysis [30] . During thermal recycling techniques, thermal expansion is employed to separate composite materials into their matrix and reinforcing components, while pyrolytic gas and oil are produced [31] . Sub and supercritical fluids solvolysis are the most advanced and promising chemical recycling methods [32] . However, the most sustainable alternatives are reuse, where blades are renovated and then reused in another location and repurposing, where the whole blades or part of them are used for different applications [33] . Repurposing wind turbine blades is an interesting alternative because it benefits from the composite blade material structural and mechanical properties, without requiring extensive treatment. The existing applications of blade repurposing include the construction of bridges, playgrounds, outdoor urban equipment, indoor furniture and housing [22,34–36] . In the literature, various studies address different aspects of the sustainability of the wind energy industry [37–46] , while few others investigate the sustainability of the wind turbine decommissioning phase [47–49] . However, the EOL phase of wind turbines, especially its sustainability performance, is under-researched. As far as the impact assessment of wind energy is concerned, the decommissioning phase of wind turbines is often ignored in various studies. Even though Life Cycle Assessment is a widely applied methodology to measure the impacts of the wind energy industry and wind turbines’ life cycle, a comprehensive review of LCA studies of wind energy highlighted that the decommissioning phase is partially explored or neglected [50] . In line with the latter, only a few previous works assess the possible impacts of available decommissioning alternatives for wind turbines. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the research papers of Nagle et al. [33]  and Deeney et al. [51]  are the only ones assessing the impacts of different waste management alternatives for decommissioned wind turbines; however, they investigate only the EOL options for the materials found in the wind turbine blades. Specifically, Nagle et al. [33]  focused exclusively on the environmental aspect of sustainability for three realistic decommissioning alternatives for wind turbine blades, namely, landfill disposal in Ireland, co-processing in Ireland, and co-processing in cement kilns in Germany. Their findings indicate that that theoretical co-processing in cement kilns in Ireland is the best alternative for treating Irish GFRP waste, attributing this to the relatively shorter transportation distances and the estimated material substitution. Deeney et al. [51]  compared the relative sustainability of five waste management alternatives for wind turbine blades: landfill disposal, co-processing in cement kilns, incineration with heat recovery, bridge fabrication and furniture making. Interestingly, UN Sustainable Development Goals are used to decide the sustainability indicators. It is indicated that the evaluated alternatives in decreasing order of sustainability are bridge fabrication, furniture making, co-processing, heat recovery and landfill disposal with the scores of the first two being quite close. The proposed approach addresses the EOL of wind turbines in terms of sustainability, using SDGs as a guide to define the sustainability metrics/criteria. In the present work, the sustainability of different waste management options/scenarios is comprehensively evaluated. Social, economic, and environmental aspects are considered. In particular the impacts triggered on human health, the associated salaries paid (as a metric of social contribution), the total cost associated with processing and transportation of waste turbine material scenarios/alternatives and the nuclear and fossil fuel impact on ecosystems and climate change are addressed.  As it has been already implied, SDGs are used to determine the criteria/metrics to assess the sustainability performance of various EOL alternatives for the main wind turbine waste materials. SDGs are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was declared by the United Nations in 2015 as the consensus of the member countries to successful sustainable development based on principals such as poverty alleviation, mitigation of global inequalities, social progress and well-being, environmental prevention and economic growth [53] . Life cycle assessment is employed to evaluate the environmental impacts of each waste management alternative/scenario addressing the environmental aspect of sustainability. LCA is a widely used methodology to estimate the emissions, the energy and other key resources consumption and the environmental impacts of products, processes, and/or services considering the whole life cycle of the examined system [54,55] . Data Envelopment Analysis is jointly applied with LCA to evaluate the sustainability performance/efficiency of the waste management alternatives/scenarios, reckoning with the LCA results, the overall cost of each alternative/scenario, the impacts on human health and the associated salaries paid. DEA is a robust multi-criteria decision-making technique that uses mathematical programming methods to estimate the relative efficiency of various homogenous entities, known as decision-making units, based on various inputs and outputs. Efficiency can be defined as the weighted sum of the outputs divided by the weighted sum of the inputs [56] . The combined application of LCA and DEA exploits the advantages of each technique and overcomes their intrinsic limitations [52] . The present approach employs the three-step LCA +   DEA method, which is graphically displayed in Fig. 1 , for the sustainability assessment of a representative wind turbine currently installed in Greece. LCA +   DEA methodology has been proposed as a promising approach for sustainability assessment as it allows the simultaneous evaluation of environmental, economic and social aspects in an integrated manner [57,58] . In the literature there are several research papers employing the joint LCA and DEA methodology to address the problem of sustainability performance evaluation in various fields, in particular, in construction [59,60] , cities [61] , transport [62] , biofuels [63] , management and services [64,65] , energy systems [66,67] , agriculture [68–72] , supply chains [73–76]  and public policy [77,78] . The adoption of SDGs framework as a roadmap to define appropriate input and output parameters for the application of the proposed LCA +   DEA approach does not only overcome the intrinsic limitations of the methodologies themselves, but it also addresses the limitations of existing methods such as integrated life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). Having presented the research background indicating the urgency of evaluating the sustainability of wind turbine decommissioning phase and after reviewing the relevant literature, it can be claimed that although wind turbine EOL gains more interest, research addressing the sustainability of the available methods is rather limited. Thus, the main gaps identified in the literature are briefly presented below: • The sustainability of wind turbine decommissioning phase is unexplored or undervalued. Therefore, suitable sustainability assessment frameworks have to be introduced and applied, while methodologies to select sustainability indicators are also required. In this context, the present paper is the first application of the combined LCA and DEA approach to the best of the authors’ knowledge. The proposed method is a systematic procedure for the evaluation of the sustainability performance of the EOL phase of wind turbines, using SDGs as a guide to define appropriate sustainability criteria/metrics.  • The relevant literature focuses solely on aspects related to the treatment of wind turbine blades. The present work addresses the problem of sustainability performance assessment taking into account simultaneously all the parts/materials of a representative wind turbine. The latter include the metallic materials, the composite blades, and the foundation concrete.    Based on the above discussed gaps, the present work seeks to answer the following research questions: RQ1. Can the joint Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology be proposed as a methodological framework to assess the sustainability performance of wind turbine EOL? RQ2. Can the SDGs framework be utilized as a guide to define sustainability criteria/metrics for the wind turbine decommissioning phase? RQ3. What public policies and strategies can be proposed to prioritize the advancement of specific end-of-life treatment options in industrial scale towards the sustainable waste management of wind turbines?  2 Methods The present research work uses SDGs as a guide to select sustainability metrics to assess numerous EOL scenarios for wind turbines. The synergetic application of LCA and DEA methodologies is proposed as an appropriate framework to evaluate the sustainability performance of the wind turbine decommissioning phase. The methodologies, the parameters and the data used in the context of the present application are comprehensively presented in this section. 2.1 Materials of wind turbine systems Different waste treatment options for the case of a Vestas V52 onshore wind turbine system that operates in Northern Greece are evaluated applying the proposed approach in order to identify the most sustainable of them. Vestas is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines currently operating in Greece, with their market share being 46.6% [79] . According to the same report, wind turbine models with a rotor diameter of 52 m are representative of the ones installed within the period 1998–2004 in Greece, which is expected to reach the end of their operational life in the following years. Based on this assumption, the Vestas V52 wind turbine was particularly selected as a typical case study. Vestas wind turbine models mainly comprises iron, steel, aluminium, copper, and glass-reinforced composite materials, with the share of these materials of the wind turbine’s total mass ranging between 97.8% and 99.4% [80] , while the foundation consists principally of concrete, as well as of steel and iron [81] . Specifically, Table 1  presents the material composition of a characteristic Vestas wind turbine system as a percentage of total wind turbine mass.  Regarding the present case study, the actual material composition of Vestas V52 wind turbine are according to the estimations found in the literature [82] , while the relevant estimations for the wind turbine’s foundation are based on the data reported in [83] . The relevant material weight estimations are presented in Table 2  and refer to a rotor diameter of 52 m, considering all the main components of a wind turbine, i.e., the tower, the nacelle, the rotor and its hub.    2.2 End-of-life scenarios and transportation distances The present work aims to identify the most sustainable end-of-life options for the main materials comprising a representative wind turbine system and its foundation (given in Table 1 ), employing the LCA +   DEA methodology to evaluate different EOL scenarios. The investigated scenarios (given in Table 3 ) have been defined considering the existing options to treat these materials, which are briefly described in the Introduction section. The examined scenarios have been structured in order to enable the evaluation of the consequences and/or benefits of promising waste treatment options for composite materials, such as mechanical recycling, thermal recycling and repurposing.  The selection of the investigated scenarios (presented in Table 3 ) is mainly based on the waste hierarchy proposed by the EU in the Waste Framework Directive [85]  and the technological maturity of the available EOL alternatives. Considering the aforementioned criteria, mechanical recycling assuming a recycling rate of about 95% and landfill disposal are evaluated for the main metallic materials of a characteristic wind turbine system. Regarding foundation concrete, landfill disposal and mechanical recycling assuming the exploitation of the recovered material as concrete aggregates are considered. The evaluated methods for the composite materials include: (i) landfill disposal, (ii) mechanical grinding, (iii) conventional pyrolysis, (iv) microwave-assisted pyrolysis and (v) furniture making (repurposing). Even though mechanical grinding is currently the dominant waste treatment method applied in Greece and pyrolysis technologies have not been extensively implemented yet in Europe, conventional and microwave-assisted pyrolysis are evaluated in the present approach in order to identify specific public policies to achieve more sustainable decommissioning of onshore wind turbines. The aforementioned decommissioning scenarios are associated with transportation demands. The estimation of the relevant distances and the required transportation is based on specific assumptions regarding the locations of the wind park, the recycling facilities and the landfill site. Specifically, Xirolivado located in Northern Greece, on latitude 40.99°N and 24.37°E was considered as the location of the wind park where the decommissioned wind turbine has been installed. It was assumed that the materials found in the wind turbine are disposed to Mavroraxi sanitary landfill, located in the suburbs of Thessaloniki, in Northern Greece. Regarding the mechanical recycling plant in Greece, it was considered to be located near the city of Kavala, in Northern Greece. Moreover, the advanced thermal recycling facility, where microwave-assisted pyrolysis and conventional pyrolysis can be applied, is located in Northern Italy (46.01°N and 9.57°E). In this regard, the required transportation distances associated with the different alternatives to treat the wind turbine waste materials have been calculated based on the data given in Table 4 .    2.3 Sustainability metrics according to SDGs SDGs constitute a holistic universal set of objectives for governments, multilateral agencies, international organizations and corporations to foster sustainable development including, among others, the eradication of poverty and social inequalities, the promotion of smart cities and innovation and the protection of forests, oceans and ecosystems [86] . The SDGs’ framework is highly linked to the concept of sustainability and, therefore, is related to the capacity of humanity to meet its own needs without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to cater for their own needs [87] . From a long-term perspective, this requires not only the prudent utilization, i.e. environmentally friendly, cost effective and socially considerate, but also the conservation of existing global resources. In other words, SDGs have a global perspective and represent the global community’s attempt to avoid exceeding the planetary boundaries [88,89] . Thus, SDGs have been proposed to evaluate the progress of a country or a region towards achieving global sustainability. In the present work, SDGs are utilized to select sustainability metrics for the evaluation of decommissioning scenarios for wind turbines. Specifically, the results from the employed methodologies, the data and the associated metrics for each waste management alternative are considered to identify the sustainability criteria that can be directly linked to the SDGs. The criteria/metrics used to assess the sustainability performance of the scenarios addressed (refer to Table 3 ) and their corresponding relation to SDGs are presented in Table 5 . The sustainability metrics employed have been judiciously associated to relevant SDGs taking also into consideration the corresponding literature [86,90] .    2.4 Life Cycle Assessment - LCA In the present approach, the environmental impacts of the examined decommissioning scenarios for the EOL phase of a representative wind turbine in Greece are assessed carrying out Life Cycle Assessment. Specifically, LCA is used to estimate the values of the environmental sustainability metrics, i.e., the fossil and nuclear energy use and the impacts on the ecosystem quality and climate change, as well as the human health indicator that is considered a metric of the social sustainability pillar. LCA is a widely applied methodology for the assessment of the environmental impacts and energy consumption associated with a particular process, product, or system throughout its life cycle. This renders LCA a useful technique for the evaluation of sustainability performance. The specifications described in ISO International Standards 14040 and 14044 [91]  are followed to employ the LCA technique. According to the relevant guidelines, the definition of the functional unit is crucial for LCA employment as it is the reference base for the quantification of the life cycle impacts of the evaluated product, process, or system, while it enables the direct comparison among the results of similar LCA studies. For the purpose of the present investigation, a Vestas 52 model wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 52 m and a hub height of 50 m is considered as the functional unit [92] . As explained in Section 2.1 , this specific wind turbine model is representative of the wind turbines that are expected to be decommissioned in the next few years. Regarding the system boundaries of the present LCA application, the wind turbine decommissioning phase is exclusively considered to evaluate the impacts of various EOL scenarios. In other words, the analysis does not consider the construction, installation, maintenance, and operation phases of the wind turbine life cycle, while the impacts of transformers, substations and auxiliary equipment of the wind park are not included. This is assumed based on two different reasons: (i) the transformers, substations and auxiliary equipment of the wind park can remain functional after the typical lifespan of 20–25 years reported for typical wind turbines, therefore, they can be utilized in a repowering scenario or other energy-related applications, and (ii) the present approach is focused on the impact assessment of different waste treatment alternatives for the main materials found in a representative wind turbine. In this regard, the system boundaries of the employed LCA begin after the wind turbine components are dismantled to their main subcomponents and the relevant materials, including the evaluated waste treatment options for the main materials found in a typical wind turbine and the required transportation of wind turbine assemblies and/or materials from the wind park site to recycling facilities and/or landfill disposal site. As it has been pointed out, LCA is used to estimate the environmental metrics, i.e., fossil and nuclear energy use, climate change and the impacts on the ecosystem quality, as well as the social sustainability indicator of human health. The LCA results reported in a previous study that proposed an integrated LCA +   DEA approach to evaluate the circular economy-driven performance of different wind turbine decommissioning alternatives considering their economic effectiveness and environmental impacts [84]  are here further processed. In this study, LCA software SimaPro PhD 9.4 [93]  with the relevant data coming from the Ecoinvent 3.9 database was used. IMPACT World+ life cycle impact method, which estimates environmental impacts as mid-point and/or damage categories was employed [94] . The relevant values of the LCA outcomes for the different examined scenarios (refer to Table 3 ) are briefly presented in Table 6 .     2.5 Data sources and sustainability metrics estimation In the present approach, the evaluation of different waste management scenarios of the materials comprise a wind turbine is performed, taking into account major SDGs pillars, related to environmental, social and economic aspects, i.e., the impacts on human health, the salaries paid, the total costs associated with the processing and the transportation of each scenario, the fossil and nuclear energy use, the climate change indicator and the impacts on the ecosystem quality. Considering that the sustainability metrics given in Table 6 , i.e., fossil and nuclear energy use, climate change and impacts on the ecosystem quality and human health follow a previous study, the estimation of the indicators associated with the salaries paid and the cost of each scenario is described in the following paragraphs. 2.5.1 Cost input metric The total cost indicator is comprised of (i) the processing cost for each waste treatment option for the materials found in a decommissioned wind turbine and (ii) the fuel consumption cost associated with the transportation demands for each evaluated end-of-life scenario. The relevant input data and parameters used for the cost estimation are presented in Table 7 . Regarding the fuel price, a six-week average value according to the statistics of the Ministry of Development and Investments of Greece has been used [101] . It is assumed that the landfill disposal cost of the metallic materials corresponds to the one considered for concrete.  2.5.2 Total salaries paid metric The estimation of the salaries paid sustainability indicator is based on the hourly labour wage for each process and the assumed required work hours associated with the examined waste management options. The salaries associated with transportation needs are also included in the estimation of this indicator. In this regard, it is assumed that the average speed of the trucks used for the transportation of waste materials is 60 km/h. At the same time, the distances summarized in Table 4  are considered for the calculation of the salaries related to the transportation phase. The required work hours per ton of waste for the different waste treatment processes are calculated according to the work of Deeney et al. [51] , assuming that the required working hours for thermal recycling (microwave-assisted pyrolysis and conventional pyrolysis) of composite waste materials are similar to the ones associated with co-processing, while it is considered that mechanical recycling requires half of these time. The hourly labour wage for each process is based on the statistics reported by the ELSTAT [102] . The correspondence between the evaluated processes and the branch of economic activity reported by the ELSTAT, the hourly labour wage for each process and the required working hours per ton of material are presented in Table 8 .     2.6 Data Envelopment Analysis – DEA DEA is a mathematical programming decision-making tool that is widely used for performance evaluation and/or benchmarking of several homogeneous units, referred to as DMUs based on multiple inputs and outputs. Within the framework of the present work, DEA uses a linear programming model to rank DMUs based on their efficiency score considering economic, environmental, and societal metrics/criteria to (i) identify the most SDGs-related efficient waste management alternatives, (ii) identify input/output target-values for the inefficient ones in order to make them efficient/sustainable according to SDGs criteria and (iii) propose specific strategies to decision- and/or policy-makers towards sustainable management of decommissioned wind turbines. 2.6.1 The DEA model For the purpose of the present work, the model proposed by Seiford and Zhu [103]  to treat undesirable outputs in the VRS envelopment models is employed. Considering n  DMUs with m  inputs and s  outputs, the solution of the following mathematical programming problem provides the DEA efficiency scores [104] : max max  φ      Subject to (1) ∑  j = 1  n   λ  j   y  r  j    g   ≥ φ y  r  0    g      (2) ∑  j = 1  n   λ  j   y  ¯   r  j    b   ≥ φ y  ¯   r  0    b      (3) ∑  J = 1  h   λ  j   x  i j   ≤ x  i o      (4) ∑  j = 1  n   λ  j   = 1    (5) λ  j   ≥ 0 ,  j = 1 , … , n       The objective function maximizes the efficiency score of each DMU under evaluation. The value of the objective function ranges between 0.0 and 1.0; where the efficiency score of 1 denotes that the corresponding DMU is efficient. Constraints (1)  and (2)  are associated with the desirable and undesirable outputs of each DMUs under consideration, respectively. Similarly, constraint (3)  is associated with the inputs of each DMUs under evaluation. The DMUs under consideration correspond to the different EOL scenarios for wind turbine decommissioning. In the context of this work, a VRS, output-oriented DEA model is used. Employing the DEA methodology to evaluate wind turbine decommissioning alternatives allows (i) the calculation of the efficiency of each DMU regardless of the measurement units of the different sustainability metrics, (ii) the focus on the maximization of the social contributions expressed by the salaries paid and the minimization of the environmental impacts and the relevant consequences on human health associated with each of the EOL alternatives under consideration and (iii) the definition of targets, therefore the identification of policy suggestions towards sustainable waste management of wind turbines through mitigated environmental impacts and enhanced social contribution.  2.6.2 Input & Output variables In the present work, LCA +   DEA methodology is employed to assess the sustainability performance of various decommissioning scenarios for a Vestas V52 wind turbine installed in the Greek territory based on SDGs criteria. Considering the identified sustainability metrics and the applied DEA model (refer to Table 5  and 2.6.1 , respectively), the following input and output parameters have been defined for the DEA model application: Input variables:  Total cost , expressed in €; represents the overall cost of processing the wind turbine waste material, including the transportation cost associated with each scenario. The relevant input data for the waste treatment cost of each method and the associated transportation phase of the various scenarios under consideration are summarized in Table 7 . Output parameters:  Human health , expressed in DALY; refers to the human health damage as a consequence of the environmental pollution associated with each waste treatment scenario in terms of lost years due to premature death and reduced quality of life due to illness. Ecosystem quality , expressed in PDF of species over 1 m2  over 1 year (PDF•m2 •year); refers to the impacts on the ecosystem of each one of the EOL scenarios/alternatives investigated. Climate change , expressed in tonCO2 eq; is the total amount of CO2  emissions related to the different waste management alternatives under consideration. In the present approach, the shorter-term impacts of climate change have been considered in order to evaluate the different waste treatment methods. The shorter-term impacts refer to the rapid increase in ambient temperature in which human and non-human beings need to adapt to very quickly. Fossil and nuclear energy use , expressed in GJ; it represents the primary energy consumption related to each one of the evaluated waste management scenarios. Assuming that fossil fuels, i.e., coal, crude oil, natural gas, etc. are utilized for energy-related purposes, this indicator refers to the amount of primary energy that has to be converted and transported to become useful energy to be consumed. Salaries paid,  expressed in €; refers to the salaries that have to be paid for the working hours required for each of the waste treatment options for the materials found in a typical wind turbine, including the associated transportation distances of each scenario. The relevant input data for the EOL alternatives and the transportation phase of the different scenarios considered are collectively presented in Table 8 .  2.6.3 DEA matrix Defining the input and output parameters, as described in Section 2.6.2 , the DEA matrix is presented in Table 9 .  The employed DEA model includes undesirable output parameters, therefore, the inputs and the undesirable outputs should both be minimized, while the desired output parameters are to be maximized. Also, the classical DEA models assume non-negative input and output parameters. In the present approach, the DMUs under evaluation consume inputs that represent the total cost of each one of the evaluated scenarios to produce outputs, which refer to social contributions and/or impacts and environmental impacts, with the latter presenting both positive and negative values. In order to apply the DEA technique using the data presented in Table 9 , the original DEA matrix is accordingly modified to transform all negative values into positive by adding a large enough scalar to all DMUs with negative input/output variable values in the original DEA matrix [105] . Excel Solver-based DEA software – DEA Frontier [106]  is used to employ the DEA methodology for the transformed data shown in Table 10 .      3 Results As has been already noted, LCA and DEA methodologies are jointly applied in order to assess the sustainability performance based on established SDGs, of various EOL alternatives for the materials comprise a representative wind turbine. The combined application of these techniques determines the efficient/sustainable waste management scenarios while it provides specific target values to improve the inefficient ones. The DEA technique is applied following an output-oriented model with undesirable outputs, focusing on the minimization of the impacts on the environment and the human health of each one of the different waste treatment scenarios and the maximization of the relevant salaries (outputs), taking into account the total cost of the waste management alternatives (input). The efficiency scores φ   obtained by the DEA application for the evaluated DMUs corresponding to the EOL scenarios under consideration are presented in Fig. 2 . When applying output-oriented DEA models, investigated scenarios having DEA efficiency scores φ = 1    are characterized as efficient/sustainable, while DMUs with φ  >   1 are considered inefficient. Thus, scenarios 1,3,5,10 and 11 correspond to technically efficient EOL alternatives. On the other hand, scenarios 2,4,6,7,8 and 9 are characterized as technically inefficient as their DEA efficiency scores range between 1.026 and 1.101 (refer to the relevant scores in Fig. 2 ).  Regarding the environmental indicators considered corresponding to SDGs environmental pillar, the actual values of each of the different EOL scenarios under investigation, the estimated target values of the virtual DMUs and the relevant reduction targets for the impacts on climate change, fossil and nuclear energy utilization and ecosystem quality are illustrated in Figs. 3–5  respectively. It should be noted that the reduction targets stand for the desired improvement on the environmental impacts of each waste management scenario/DMU to operate under efficient conditions according to DEA calculations. Regarding the impacts on climate change, a reduction between 10.95% and 150.5% for the inefficient DMUs would make them efficient/sustainable. Similarly, reduction targets ranging from almost 3.7% to 90% and 8.7% to 99.3% are estimated for the impact on ecosystem quality and fossil and nuclear energy use, respectively. It is noteworthy that high reduction targets are obtained for the most inefficient DMUs, i.e., Scenarios 2, 6, 9, 8, 4 and 7.    As the social indicators lie in the epicentre of the SDGs social pillar, the original/actual output values of each waste management scenario/DMU under evaluation, the obtained target values of the virtual DMUs and the corresponding reduction targets for the impacts on human health and the relevant salaries paid are presented in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. It is pointed out that a reduction ranging between 7.16% and 68.53% in the impact on human health of the inefficient EOL scenarios under investigation would make them efficient/sustainable. Furthermore, the estimated increase target for the salaries paid ranges from almost 2.7% to 8.3%. Similarly, the high percentage targets for the inefficient DMUs correspond to the most inefficient scenarios under investigation.     4 Discussion The concept of sustainability is often identified focusing on its environmental and/or economic aspect, therefore, it is limited to the environmental impacts and/or the economic dimensions associated with the life cycle of the evaluated system. The proposed approach is based on the UN SDGs in order to define appropriate criteria/indicators to assess all the three sustainability pillars. Even though SDGs represent a set of goals with a global perspective that has been initially proposed to evaluate sustainability progress at the country and/or region level, they can be used as a guide to select sustainability metrics for organizations, services, processes or products. The results obtained by the synergetic application of LCA and DEA methodologies for the decommissioning of a representative wind turbine highlight that EOL alternatives/scenarios causing adverse environmental impacts might be efficient/sustainable when indicators assessing the economic cost and social impacts and/or contributions are considered. The obtained results show that Scenarios 1, 3, 5, 10 and 11 are efficient/sustainable waste management alternatives with respect to economic, environmental, and social aspects of the investigated scenarios. It is evident that the environmental indicators considered, i.e., climate change, ecosystem quality and fossil and nuclear energy use have a significant impact on the overall sustainability of the evaluated scenarios. The recycling of the composite waste materials found mainly in the blades employing the energy-intensive thermal recycling/pyrolysis is associated with substantial environmental impacts. Conventional pyrolysis consumes high amounts of energy provided by non-renewable energy sources, leading to considerable impacts on climate change and ecosystem quality, as well as on human health. However, the application of thermal recycling/microwave pyrolysis process instead of conventional pyrolysis for the recycling of composite materials makes a technically efficient/sustainable waste treatment alternative for wind turbine blades reaching the end of their operational life. This is obvious, if one compares the scores of Scenarios 10 and 9 in Fig. 2  since thermal recycling/microwave pyrolysis requires relatively lower energy generated by fossil fuels. According to DEA results, a reduction in fossil and nuclear energy use consumed by advanced thermal recycling/conventional pyrolysis by almost 82.5% could enhance the overall sustainability of the relevant scenarios; refer to the reduction targets of Scenarios 6 and 9 in Fig. 4 . It is expected that such a reduction in non-renewable energy utilization would have a positive effect on climate change, ecosystem quality and human health and, therefore, it could contribute to the achievement the corresponding required reductions (refer to Figs. 3, 5 and 6 , respectively) suggested by DEA results for those indicators. Similarly, a potential increase in the salaries paid for the scenarios related to thermal recycling/conventional pyrolysis by almost 6.4% to 8.3% could make the relevant scenarios more sustainable; refer to the increase targets of Scenarios 6 and 9 in Fig. 7 . It is interesting to note that the waste treatment scenarios where the wind turbine foundation concrete is disposed to the landfill site instead of be recycled employing mechanical grinding are characterized as technically efficient/sustainable; this can be observed if one compares the efficiency scores of Scenarios 10 and 11 with those of Scenarios 7 and 8 in Fig. 2 . The recycling of the concrete found in wind turbine foundations employing mechanical grinding instead of landfill disposal results to higher impacts on environmental indicators and human health. This can be attributed to the increased transportation requirements, which are met by diesel-powered trucks. Thus, decommissioning scenarios evaluating landfill disposal of concrete material instead of mechanical recycling exhibit higher technical efficiency. Comparing the relevant scores of Scenarios 9 and 6 in Fig. 2 , it is indicated that reducing fossil and nuclear energy use by almost 3.6% to 7.8% for the alternatives involving mechanical recycling of concrete can enhance the overall sustainability score of the particular scenarios. Consequently, the use of transportation means with improved environmental performance constitutes an applicable long-term strategy to promote alternatives for waste concrete material, ranking higher in the waste hierarchy and promoting the adoption of SDG good practices. However, the utilization of fossil and nuclear energy could be more efficiently diminished by promoting policies towards the reduction in transportation use required for the mechanical recycling of concrete. Therefore, the sustainability of waste concrete materials could be promoted by the development of specialized mechanical recycling plants close to operating wind farms. Similarly, DEA results indicate that Scenario 1 that corresponds to the alternative where all waste materials of the decommissioned wind turbine are disposed of in landfill, is technically efficient/sustainable, as can be observed in Fig. 2 . Even though Scenario 1 has substantial impacts on the environment and relatively low social contribution through salaries, it is also related to lower waste treatment costs, about 40%, compared to the remaining EOL scenarios under evaluation. Interestingly, the alternative of landfill disposal has been found as the least sustainable, when only the wind turbine blades are considered [51] . As it has been pointed out in the Introduction, the burial of composite materials is not an acceptable option in several EU member states, i.e., Germany, Austria, Finland, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, while the European wind power industry promotes the ban of landfill disposal of composite wind turbine blades in Europe until 2025 [20,23] . On the other hand, repurposing/furniture-making of wind turbine blades is obviously the most sustainable alternative, as implied by the efficiencies of Scenarios 3 and 5 in Fig. 2 . This alignes with the findings of a previous study, where bridge fabrication and furniture-making alternatives were highlighted as the most sustainable waste treatment alternatives for composite wind turbine blades [51] . It is interesting to compare the results of the present study with those of a recent study considering only the economic and environmental aspects of wind turbine decommissioning [84] . In this latter study, repurposing is an efficient alternative for composite materials, only when this is combined with landfill disposal as an EOL option for waste concrete material. When it comes to the present study, repurposing/furniture-making is the most sustainable option for wind turbine blades, regardless of the EOL treatment method of foundation concrete. It is noteworthy that the waste treatment option of composite materials is even more substantial when a sustainability-oriented approach is followed. It is also observed that combining recycling/mechanical grinding as an EOL alternative for composite waste materials with landfill disposal for foundation concrete constitutes an efficient/sustainable waste treatment option as it is highlighted by the score of Scenario 11 in Fig. 2 . Even though Scenario 8, which is also associated with recycling/mechanical grinding of composite waste materials, is technically inefficient, an increase in the salaries paid for this scenario by almost 6% could improve its sustainability performance (refer to Fig. 7 ). Liu et al. [97]  evaluated the economic feasibility of various waste management options for composite materials and concluded that mechanical recycling is a financially optimal alternative for decommissioned wind turbine blades. Thus, mechanical recycling is a ready-to-go technical process that can be a promising alternative for the waste treatment of composite materials in the future. The aforementioned study highlights that the low cost of virgin glass fibre material prevents the use of advanced recycling options for the composite waste materials of turbine blades [97] . It is expected that reducing the process cost of the advanced thermal recycling methods, i.e., microwave-assisted pyrolysis and conventional pyrolysis, would make the cost of recycled composite materials more competitive. Should decision-makers encourage investment in research and development to enhance the efficiency of the processes associated with advanced thermal recycling methods, therefore, the energy requirements and the relevant recycling cost could be effectively reduced. DEA results suggest that a reduction of non-renewable energy use by almost 7.8% to 82.5% could improve the sustainability performance of the EOL scenarios employing the advanced thermal recycling methods; refer to Scenarios 6, 7 and 9 in Fig. 4 . Even though the lower energy consumption of these options due to improved process efficiency will promote such a target, reducing the actual transportation distances required to process composite materials with advanced thermal methods might be more effective. In the present study, it is assumed that the advanced thermal recycling methods are carried out in dedicated facilities located in Italy; as a consequence the relevant scenarios are associated with longer distances transportation. The operation of facilities dedicated to advanced thermal recycling in Greece has been already proposed as a policy measure to increase the feasibility of these methods and promote the dominance of advanced recycling methods towards the sustainability of the wind power industry [84] . Furthermore, such a policy would encourage collaboration between the industry sectors using composite materials, i.e., aerospace, manufacturing, defense, automotive and renewable energy, in order to achieve the sustainable EOL treatment of composite waste materials.  5 Conclusions The present research work proposes the combined application of LCA and DEA methodologies as a framework for the evaluation of the sustainability performance of different EOL options of all the main waste materials used in a wind turbine system. Unlike the relevant literature, the proposed approach considers all three underlying pillars of SDGs, i.e., environment, society and economy. In this context, the total cost referring to the cost of the relevant processes, the salaries associated with each one of the evaluated scenarios, the fossil and nuclear energy use and the impacts on human health, ecosystem quality and climate change are considered as sustainability indicators. The LCA and DEA methodologies are applied in a case study of a representative wind turbine, i.e., the Vestas V52 model installed in the Greek territory. Landfill disposal and mechanical recycling are considered for the EOL treatment of the metallic materials found in the wind turbine and the foundation concrete. Moreover, the alternatives under investigation for the composite waste materials used mainly in the wind turbine blades include: (i) landfill disposal, (ii) mechanical grinding, (iii) conventional pyrolysis, (iv) microwave-assisted pyrolysis and (v) furniture-making (repurposing). The LCA +   DEA methodology is indicated as an appropriate approach for the sustainability assessment of the wind turbine EOL phase as it enables the simultaneous and comprehensive evaluation of environmental, economic, and social aspects. LCA estimates the environmental impacts of the waste treatment options, while DEA addresses the economic and social facets in order to evaluate their relative efficiency and calculate benchmarks and targets for the inefficient ones. Therefore, the joint application of LCA +   DEA methodology is indicated as a suitable framework for sustainability assessments of broader scope focusing on distinct phases of the life cycle of products or services. Based on the identified target values and benchmarks for the inefficient waste management alternatives, the results could be further exploited to propose specific strategies to decision- and/or policymakers towards sustainable management of decommissioned wind turbines. At the same time, these values can indicate the specific waste management options that should be prioritized and advanced on an industrial scale. Furthermore, the obtained results can be used as a reference for benchmarking of different EOL alternatives for wind turbines in Greece as well as Europe-wide. The authors have identified two main limitations of the proposed approach. The three-step LCA +   DEA method employed does not consider uncertainty due to data accuracy. Therefore, future research should focus on the implementation of LCA +   DEA methods to take this aspect into account. Additionally, a common issue of DEA models is related to the number of variables that can be analysed, especially when the number of DMUs under evaluation is relatively low, as this is the case in the present work. This limitation has been overcome using SDGs as a guide to select representative variables for the three pillars of sustainability. The adoption of SDGs framework is not only proven an appropriate framework to define input and output parameters for the application of the joint LCA +   DEA approach, but it also addresses the limitations of existing sustainability assessment methodologies. However, it would be interesting to develop or propose techniques to select representative DEA variables, i.e., sustainability indicators and then compare the resulting findings. The results obtained by the joint application of the methodologies suggest that repurposing (furniture-making) represents the most efficient/sustainable end-of-life option for composite waste materials found in wind turbine blades. The waste treatment alternative of the composite materials is crucial for the overall sustainability performance of the scenarios considered. It is interesting to note that the EOL treatment method of the foundation concrete, which requires high transportation distances to be travelled with diesel-powered trucks, has a substantial effect on the efficiency of the evaluated scenarios. In this context, mechanical recycling/grinding and microwave-assisted pyrolysis of composite materials can be also favourable, when combined with the landfill disposal of waste concrete materials. The development of dedicated facilities for concrete mechanical recycling close to operating wind parks should be considered by policymakers in order to encourage the replacement of landfill disposal of waste concrete with mechanical recycling and promote the principles of circularity and sustainability in the concrete industry. On the other hand, EOL scenarios applying conventional pyrolysis as a recycling alternative for composite materials exhibit poor sustainability performance. This can be attributed to the relatively high non-renewable energy requirements of the relevant scenarios due to the insufficient process efficiency and the requires distances to transport the composite materials from the recycling plant in Greece to the dedicated facility in Italy. Future policies should foster investments in research to enhance the process efficiency of the advanced thermal recycling methods aiming at making them competitive and applicable at the industrial level. Furthermore, the development of dedicated plants for advanced thermal recycling of composite materials in Greece following a cross-sectoral approach is proposed. The financial feasibility of such a policy and the relevant value chains and material flows could be investigated in the context of future research. Regarding the social aspects related to SDGs’ good practices, the results of the present work show that these are equally important and have to be considered when strategies aiming at improving the sustainability performance of waste management of wind turbine systems are designed. In the present approach, the salaries associated with each one of the various evaluated EOL scenarios are proposed as an indicator of social contribution. In other words, the increase in the paid salaries could improve the sustainability performance of the inefficient scenarios. Regarding the wind power industry, social acceptance represents an important issue that should be considered crucial for the social aspect of sustainability. Thus, relevant indicators assessing social acceptance of EOL treatment options for wind turbines should be included in future research when evaluating the sustainability performance of the wind power industry towards the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
