This is especially true of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are part of the UN’s 2030 Agenda.2   Although Target 11.4 of Goal 11—“Sustainable Cities and Communities”—explicitly calls for “strengthening efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage,” along with several other direct and indirect references to culture and/or protected areas throughout the text, the 2030 Agenda fails to acknowledge fully or to affirm the importance of UDSs as essential drivers and enablers of sustainable development.3   Hence, the full potential of the contribution that UDSs can make to the SDGs deserves to be explored and highlighted. On the basis of a review and summary of scientific studies and official reports that have been published in the past five decades since the launch of the Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB) in 1971 and the subsequent launch of the World Heritage Convention (WHC) and Global Geoparks Network (GGN) in 1972 and 2004, as well as policy guidance and specific actions from the same period, we propose a holistic concept consisting of 3Hs (cultural heritage (CH), natural heritage (NH), and geoheritage (GH), 3Ds (cultural diversity, biodiversity, and geodiversity), 3Cs (coordination, conservation, and combination), and 3Ss (survival, service, and sustainability) that can be used to understand the contributions of UDSs to the SDGs (Figure 1  ). The international community recognizes UDSs for their importance to and significance for promoting the conservation of the Earth’s cultural, biological, and geological diversity through close integration between the UDSs and local communities. As of 2021, there are more than 2,000 UDSs worldwide: 727 BRs, 1,154 WHSs, and 169 GGPs, covering about 1,000 million hectares of surface area, which is greater than the area of China. They also touch the lives of more than 300 million people, a number approximately equal to the total population of the United States. A system of such scale and impact deserves our attention and proper consideration, without which the 2030 Agenda and the realization of SDGs are going to face substantial impediments. The UDSs provide local communities with basic materials for survival (Goals 1, 2, and 3). These materials include food and clean water (Goal 6) and air. This is particularly true in the case of low-income indigenous inhabitants whose food and water security are inadequate. The UDSs also offer great potential for the alleviation of poverty and the improvement of sustainable livelihoods for local communities (Goal 1). They support livelihoods and incomes through the selling and trading, by individuals or communities, of specialized goods and products from the locality and by providing good jobs (Goal 8) associated with heritage-related cultural and creative industries (Goal 9). As such, the growth of a green economy through sustainable tourism is also foreseeable for cities that host UDSs (Goal 11). Moreover, UDSs bring a strong emphasis to safeguarding and empowering the rights and interests of women through on-site education and training programs or the launch of multiple-level initiatives for women (Goals 4 and 5) and provide various opportunities for improving social sustainability through education and scientific research (Goals 4 and 5), including capacity building, collaborative research, on-the-spot teaching, and training of women and young people. The coordinated management and conservation of UDSs can, therefore, contribute to the promotion of sustainable forms of inclusive and equitable economic development (Goal 10), productive and decent employment, and income-generating activities for all, while still fully respecting the unique values of the site (Goals 2 and 8). Taking the WHSs as an example, they promote the conservation of unique cultural and natural properties through geographically and historically identifiable places that have outstanding universal values (OUVs). UDSs and their associated conservation practices can contribute to the distinct character and uniqueness of host cities and communities (Goal 11) by helping to preserve and enhance local identities and shared values, as well as pride and a sense of belonging. UDSs can offer networks for shared identities, experiences, and exchanges, which can help alleviate social inequalities and support the social cohesion and dignity of communities (Goal 10). UDSs are some of the most biodiverse habitats on Earth and play a crucial role in climate regulation by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2 ) from the atmosphere. Forests in UNESCO WHSs cover 69 million hectares and are some of the most effective net carbon sinks responsible for absorbing approximately 190 million tonnes of CO2  each year, equivalent to roughly half of the UK’s annual CO2  emissions from fossil fuels.4   UDSs also play a key role in addressing risks related to natural hazards and disasters triggered by climate changes (Goal 13), especially in the field of disaster prevention, the control and reduction of risk during disasters, and spiritual and physical support (Goal 3) following disasters. The cultural WHSs, most of which consist of traditional land-use or sea-use settlements, are remarkable representations of human interactions with the environment. These sites provide both cultural and historical references for the realization of the goal of harmonious development between man and nature (Goals 1, 2, 3, 11, 14, and 15). Meanwhile, the significance of the GGPs and natural WHSs resides in preserving the major stages of earth’s history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, significant geomorphic or physiographic features, and significant on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. These sites contain direct evidence for scientific understanding of Earth’s evolution and the origin of life, and, collectively with cultural WHSs, they are of great significance for understanding and coping with global changes such as climate change (Goal 13), biodiversity loss (Goals 14 and 15), and pandemic prevention (Goals 3, 16, and 17). The maintenance of intact and functioning terrestrial, marine, and coastal ecosystems in natural UDSs allows these ecosystems to deliver improved ecological quality and ecosystem health as well as to enhance the biodiversity in the protected areas (Goals 14 and 15).5   By valuing and conserving places of outstanding heritage value that contain exceptional biodiversity, geodiversity, or other distinct natural characteristics that are essential for human well-being (Goals 3, 14, and 15), UDSs can effectively promote environmental sustainability and resilience. Taking the natural and mixed WHSs as examples, their most fundamental contribution lies in the preservation of natural resources, including sites that host some of the richest combinations of terrestrial and marine biodiversity hot spots. By 2021, there were 218 natural and 39 mixed WHSs, including more than 200 terrestrial sites, covering about 230 million hectares of land. More than 70% of these sites are inscribed precisely for their outstanding biodiversity values (inscription under Criteria ix and/or x) and can be recognized as direct contributions to Goals 14 and 15. At the same time, the UDSs can contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage, like faiths, ethics, and traditions (Goal 3), as well as helping to establish universal respect for different cultures by enhancing cultural identity, mutual understanding, and a sense of cultural appreciation through physical and digital preservation, demonstration, and reproduction that the UDSs promote. With the successful preservation of cultural and natural significance, the UDSs will also see recognition in its recreational values that could benefit people’s well-being (Goal 3) through, for example, tourism and travel. In addition, UDSs are often labeled as being “natural,” “ecological,” or “green.” Their preserved landscapes and water resources deliver affordable and clean solar, hydroelectric, biomass, or geothermal energy (Goals 7 and 12) as well as aesthetic services (Goal 3). Owing to their irreplaceable value in science and humanities, these UDSs almost always draw universal attention, and the loss of or damage to such a site will result in unanimous criticism from the world. In other words, these iconic sites have huge potential as platforms for reaching a shared consensus on pressing global topics such as peace and inclusiveness (Goal 16). In this regard, UDSs have always focused on partnership and collaboration, not only between local and national stakeholders but also on a global level through regional and international networks (Goal 17) where experience, knowledge, policies, and best conservation practices are shared. The UDSs are an embodiment of humanity’s heritage while lighting up our future by conserving the cultural, biological and geological diversity of the planet and promoting sustainable development. The conservation and coordinated management of UDSs and their tangible and/or intangible heritage can be an effective way of improving the socio-economic and environmental well-being of communities on local, national, and global scales, which is a crucial step for achieving sustainable development. Through the variety of basic materials needed for survival, other goods and services, and the rich sources of information about the evolutionary history of human beings on Earth that they provide, well-conserved UDSs make direct and indirect contributions toward the realization of environmental, economic, and social goals that promote harmony between man and nature.
