                  Egypt's Golden Triangle megaproject within Egypt's vision 2030, involving land reclamation in Qena Bend's densely populated governorate, develops sustainable land management strategies. Advanced technologies and low-cost remote sensing multi-data fusion are utilized to understand subsidence dynamics influenced by geologic structure, groundwater, climate change, and human activities in Egypt's Nile Valley. This approach identifies environmental hazards and provides a detailed explanation for groundwater-induced bedrock subsidence, aiding in informed decision-making and risk avoidance. Landsat images reveal 13% increased cultivation, 28.28% urban-growth, and decreased water by 8.46%, impacting groundwater resources and controlling the situation. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment(GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) satellite observations reveal changes in water storage, impacting climate change, groundwater storage dynamics, and aquifer behavior. Historical data indicates a significant southwest-northeast gradient in precipitation from 5 to 60 mm. GLDAS shows soil moisture decline from 0.25 to 0.23 mm. GRACE (total water storage) depleting, then slightly increasing from 2020 to 2023 with an average value (−5 cm/yr). Groundwater storage increases in wet seasons, in 2015 showing (+3–4 mm), less than (+1 mm) in (2018), and (+6–8 mm) in (2020–2023). The NE-SW and NW-SE faults increase hydraulic connection and recharge from aquifers, causing groundwater circulation and karstification in Eocene limestone aquifers, posing risks to urban development and human safety. The InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) measures ground subsidence over time, revealing a range of (−0.04 to −0.07m) in the northwest to (+0.03m) in the southeast, with average subsidence (-4 cm), primarily associated with increased groundwater storage motivate the interaction between the carbonate and groundwater. The ArcGIS overlay model divides the region into three zones: northern, middle, and southern, each with varying degrees of displacement and groundwater storage. The findings emphasize the significance of remote sensing in hazard evaluation for development planning due to its cost-effectiveness and accuracy, applicable globally in hydrogeologically similar areas.

Advanced technologies and low-cost remote sensing multi-data fusion are utilized to understand subsidence dynamics influenced by geologic structure, groundwater, climate change, and human activities in Egypt's Nile Valley. This approach identifies environmental hazards and provides a detailed explanation for groundwater-induced bedrock subsidence, aiding in informed decision-making and risk avoidance. Landsat images reveal 13% increased cultivation, 28.28% urban-growth, and decreased water by 8.46%, impacting groundwater resources and controlling the situation. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment(GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) satellite observations reveal changes in water storage, impacting climate change, groundwater storage dynamics, and aquifer behavior. Historical data indicates a significant southwest-northeast gradient in precipitation from 5 to 60 mm. GLDAS shows soil moisture decline from 0.25 to 0.23 mm. GRACE (total water storage) depleting, then slightly increasing from 2020 to 2023 with an average value (−5 cm/yr). Groundwater storage increases in wet seasons, in 2015 showing (+3–4 mm), less than (+1 mm) in (2018), and (+6–8 mm) in (2020–2023). The NE-SW and NW-SE faults increase hydraulic connection and recharge from aquifers, causing groundwater circulation and karstification in Eocene limestone aquifers, posing risks to urban development and human safety. The InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) measures ground subsidence over time, revealing a range of (−0.04 to −0.07m) in the northwest to (+0.03m) in the southeast, with average subsidence (-4 cm), primarily associated with increased groundwater storage motivate the interaction between the carbonate and groundwater. The ArcGIS overlay model divides the region into three zones: northern, middle, and southern, each with varying degrees of displacement and groundwater storage. The findings emphasize the significance of remote sensing in hazard evaluation for development planning due to its cost-effectiveness and accuracy, applicable globally in hydrogeologically similar areas.

This can lead to infrastructure damage, increased flood risk, and reduced water storage capacity. Countries like Mexico, China, and Iran face similar challenges. Groundwater modeling and remote sensing can help predict and mitigate subsidence by detecting ground deformation with high precision and simulating extraction scenarios. Techniques like InSAR can detect ground deformation and simulate the impacts of different extraction scenarios (Li, P., Wu et al., 2023 ). Remote sensing techniques, such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Sentinel-1 satellites, are utilized for geohazard monitoring and management, including estimating groundwater levels, monitoring floods, and monitoring ground subsidence geohazards respectively. Land subsidence is an endogenous phenomenon resulting from differential vertical displacements of the Earth's surface due to natural or anthropogenic factors (Tzampoglou et al., 2023 ). It is influenced by hydrological, geological, and tectonic conditions, as well as subsurface formations. It can be triggered by overexploitation of aquifers, natural gas, oil, sinkhole collapse, soil oxidation, or underground mining collapse, (Papadopoulou-Vrynioti et al., 2013 ). The management of this phenomenon is complex due to its delayed detection, difficulty in determining the affected area's extent due to no subsidence on the ground surface, and the failure mechanism being complicated by multiple factors, making it difficult to determine its impact's extent (Tzampoglou et al., 2023 ). Remote sensing data in sensitive regions regularly monitors geohazards and risk management with low cost and high accuracy. The space-borne radar interferometry is a crucial tool for detecting and measuring ground surface deformations. Comparing satellite images over different periods allows for time series analysis, climate change detection, disaster monitoring, risk assessment, and ecological surveillance (Dinh Duong 2018 ; Elsadek et al., 2019 ; Taha et al., 2017 ). Interferometry monitors land surface movement and evaluates vast amounts of data collected by satellite missions using multi-temporal InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) C-band data collected since 2014 by the Sentinel-1 (S1) mission and properly designed interferometric approaches can be used to detect and measure a variety of ground surface deformations (Du et al., 2018 ; Mantovani et al., 2019 ). Subsidence a slow, difficult-to-detect process, could lead to a gradual decline in land surface level, potentially causing significant economic disruption (Hu et al., 2009 ). Numerous studies have investigated the rate and patterns of deformations in the Nile regions using geodetic techniques like GPS and InSAR. In Greater Cairo (Aly et al., 2009 ), estimated a deformation attributed to factors such as sediment compaction, groundwater withdrawal, and tectonic activity. Damietta (Becker and Sultan 2009 ), obtained deformation due to recent sediment compaction. In Mansoura and Mahla cities (Aly et al., 2012 ) demonstrated deformation due to groundwater abstractions (Wöppelmann et al., 2013 ). calculated subsidence using 49 ENVISAT images between 2003 and 2010 (Gaber et al., 2020 ; Lemenkova and Debeir 2023 ; Gebremichael et al., 2018 ). found steady and slight subsidence in the southern part of the delta (Saleh and Becker 2019 ). obtained varied rates in major cities, attributed to excessive groundwater withdrawal (Elsaka et al., 2020 ). reported localized uplifting in the central Nile Delta based on GPS information obtained between 2013 and 2017. Most of the previously mentioned research reported that groundwater, climatic change, structure and tectonic activities, and human activities are the main factors in ground subsidence and deformation. So, the present study integrated all the mentioned factors to study the main reason for the geo-environmental hazards in the west Qena bend which is considered a part of the Golden Triangle mega project for reclamation in Egypt. There are no previous studies that analyzed and monitored all the factors affecting the geo-environmental hazards in the study area to highlight the main causal factors driving this process and consider the first contribution to study this approach in the study area. The outcomes of these processes are of utmost importance in the strategic planning for sustainable development. Groundwater-related subsidence is becoming a significant problem in developing countries. This is due to unsustainable extraction, which increases flood risk, reduces underground water storage, and damages infrastructure. Excessive extraction causes depression of the groundwater surface, making it difficult and expensive to pump water from deeper levels. (Tzampoglou et al., 2023 ). This leads to soil compaction, subsidence, land sinking, and sinkholes, posing risks to infrastructure and human lives (Rateb A. and Abotalib Z. 2020 ). Climate change and population growth also strain groundwater aquifers, especially in populated areas, (Famiglietti, J.S. 2014 ) . GRACE, a NASA experiment, is the first to directly observe groundwater changes from space. The GRACE mission was discontinued in 2017, and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) measurements launched in May 2018 and continue today. The laser ranging interferometer (LRI), a novel inter-satellite ranging sensor, is tested alongside the previously utilized microwave K-band ranging system (KBR) aboard GRACE satellites. GRACE satellites monitor water mass fluctuations worldwide, variations in water mass or storage are often described as Equivalent Water Height (EWH) (Landerer, F.W et al., 2020 ). GRACE satellites monitor Earth's gravity field variations, estimate changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS), and provide a global view with low spatial resolution for monitoring groundwater depletion and sustainability (Wahr 2009 ). GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) is a land surface modeling system that uses meteorological data and land surface models to estimate land surface variables including soil moisture for understanding land-atmosphere interactions and hydrological modeling to estimate water storage changes. GRACE and GLDAS integration improve water storage understanding by separating surface water from deeper groundwater (Wu et al., 2019 ). Applications include identifying declining groundwater levels and assessing anthropogenic impacts on resources. GRACE offers global TWS estimates, while GLDAS refines spatial details, enhancing the effectiveness of monitoring groundwater changes by integrating both datasets. Hydrological models are critical for accurate nowcasting and forecasting of terrestrial water resources, requiring a thorough calibration procedure and a suitable collection of hydrological measurements either in situ or by remote sensing, (Santhi, C. et al., 2009 ). Research on the world's largest aquifers reveals that monthly variations in gravity are caused by mass fluctuations related to changes in water storage (Rodell et al., 2004 ; Rodell et al., 2005 ). Because of expensive drilling costs and study time, traditional methods for investigating groundwater (GW) using hydrogeological, geophysical, and geologic methodologies proved unprofitable (Singh and Prakash, 2003 ). GRACE and GLDAS play crucial roles in understanding water dynamics, from groundwater storage to soil moisture variations. These tools enhance our ability to monitor and manage water resources effectively. Many researchers have estimated groundwater recharge (GR) using GRACE and GLDAS data  (Landerer et al., 2020 ; Landerer and Swenson 2012 ; Moudgil and Rao 2023 ; Rodell et al., 2006 ; Rodell et al., 2005 ; Rodell et al., 2004, 2004b ; Rzepecka and Birylo 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2019 ; Yin et al., 2020 ) investigated the consistency between changes in groundwater levels (measured directly in wells) and groundwater storage (GWS) anomalies calculated using GRACE observations. The present study uses Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Terrestrial Water Storage, Land Surface State Variable (GLDAS), and Soil Moisture data to estimate groundwater information from 2015 to 2023. Researchers are increasingly employing remote sensing and GIS to assess land use and land cover, groundwater quantities and quality and study aquifer behaviors in the vicinity of Qena-Luxor (Abdel Moneim et al., 2015 ; Attia et al., 2021 ; Barsom, 2016 ; El Sabri et al., 2022 ; Elbeih and El-Zeiny 2018 ; El_Hamdani et al., 2021 ; Elsadek et al., 2019 ; Lemenkova and Debeir 2023 ; Mosleh and Hazaymeh 2021 ; Mostafa 2013 ; Mohamed et al., 2024 ; Reda et al., 2022 ). The study highlights the importance of remote sensing technology in environmental planning and hazard evaluation. Satellite images used to monitor groundwater-induced bedrock subsidence in Egypt's Nile Valley. The research aims to develop sustainable land management strategies and understand subsidence dynamics potentially applicable globally. The study is the first contribution to combine novel technologies and low-cost remote sensing data, providing a more accurate picture of vulnerable locations of hazard and surface ground subsidence that may be caused by key factors such as groundwater and aquifer properties, climate change, structure and tectonic activities and anthropogenic activities caused by agricultural activities and land reclamation. This research contributes to understanding the hydrogeological and geological systems of the study area. The main objectives of the present research are to study the interaction of climate, geology, hydrology, land use, structure, and topography to monitor land subsidence, geohazards, and risk management are regularly monitored based on satellite observations and integration and fusion of multi-data of remote sensing data. 1) InSAR was used to estimate the amount of subsidence that occurred between 2015 and 2023, based on an examination of two Sentinel-1 descending InSAR images, 2) GRACE satellite and Gldas data equivalent water height (EWH), and groundwater storage(GWS) monitoring and evaluation, 3) investigate the impact of changing water levels on environmental hazards, groundwater level and soil moisture maps were created and their association with land subsidence was examined 4) climatic parameters simulation 4) the anthropogenic influences and agriculture change by Landsat satellite image classification, 5) Structure lineament mapping. To achieve sustainable development in arid lands, scientific studies are needed to assess groundwater storage and availability and its impact on the geoenvironmental hazard, predict long-term impacts of abstraction, and determine appropriate developmental plans. The study could potentially serve as a framework for the development plans in West Qena and other similar regions elsewhere.  2 Study area 2.1 Physical setting Egypt is one of the countries facing water constraints due to fast population growth and the probable loss of the Nile River share due to the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Qena Bend is a densely populated governorate in the upper part of Egypt with a limited desert, considered one of the promising desert areas for future land reclamation included as a part of the Egyptian government's proposed "1.5 million Acres" land reclamation megaproject to create new urban-agricultural communities. It is close to the key infrastructures, which include land for agriculture, floodplains, reclaimed lands, urban settlements, and surface water resources (the Nile River and the irrigation network). The study area is situated in an arid province of Egypt, specifically at Qena Bend south of the western side of the Nile Valley. Flanked by the old alluvial floodplain of the Nile Valley with agricultural fields and a limestone plateau to the west and center as part of Egypt's semi-arid zone due to its location inside the dry and dull region of North Africa (Mohamed et al., 2024 ), latitudes of 25° 30′ and 26° 15′ N and longitudes of 32° and 32° 50′ E, (Fig. 1  ). The area is accessible via the Cairo-Aswan Desert Road and is characterized by desert conditions. The Nile River runs from east to west, and the ground surface elevation gradually decreases. The area is characterized by intense faulting and tectonic activity, leading to the formation of the Qena bend.  2.2 Geological and hydrogeological aspects Hydrogeologic aspects: The groundwater is derived from two major aquifers: the Quaternary Aquifer (QA) and the alluvial Eocene Aquifer (EA) (Aggour 1997 ; Said 2012 ). The studied region consists of two aquifers of groundwater that run virtually parallel to the Nile River: a highly productive sand and gravel aquifer intercalated by clay lenses and a moderately active sand and gravel aquifer locally intercalated by clay lenses. The major aquifer's groundwater flow is located downstream, where it flows eastwards towards the Nile River, which acts as a drain, with iso piezometric contours ranging from 56 to 62 masl (RIGW 1999 ). The Qena Formation is the primary water-bearing unit in the Nile Valley, because its porous wadi deposits covering the groundwater occurs under an unconfining condition. The Eocene carbonate aquifer (semi-confined lower aquifer) has yet to be identified and is composed of early Eocene limestone from the Thebes Formation, (Fig. 1 b). This aquifer is found in the Western Limestone Plateau and the subsoil around the Nile Valley. It is replenished by upward leakage from the deeper Nubian Sandstone aquifer via faults, as well as rainfall on the plateau on occasion (RIGW, 1999 ; Gaber et al., 2020 ; Lemenkova and Debeir, 2023 ), using an integrated approach of remote sensing imagery and hydro-geophysical field surveys to map the hydrogeological framework of the desert alluvial floodplain of the Nile Valley west of Qena Egypt. Lithology significantly impacts groundwater storage, with sandy formations having higher infiltration rates and better storage capacity than clayey ones. Soil texture also influences infiltration, with fine-grained soil allowing less runoff and coarse-grained soils allowing higher infiltration. The study area's diverse textures, including gravel, gritty, sandy, and debris, promote high infiltration capacity to underground aquifers (Barsom, N.2016). Lithostratigraphically, the area under investigation comprises surface stratigraphic rock units ranging in age from the Lower Eocene to the Recent (Fig. 1 b). The Nile Formation is a type of Holocene rock, mainly composed of silt, silty clay, sand, and gravel. The Flanglomerate and Qena Formation represent the Pleistocene age, while the Thebes Formation represents the Paleocene. The Esna Formation represents the early Eocene and Paleocene, while the Tarawan Formation represents the Paleocene. The Dakhla Formation is Paleocene and late Cretaceous. The carbonate succession is divided into the Thebes Drunka formations, (El-Azabi and El-Araby 2000 ; EGSMA, 1983 ). The surface of this plateau is rough and is underlined by weathered resistant limestone. Climatic conditions, Egypt has a mainly dry environment and suffers from aridity and water shortage, which causes drought (a climate of low rainfall). Meteorological conditions are one of the primary landslip-triggering components that may be monitored directly or indirectly. The average air temperature ranges from 18 to 32 °C, with maximums in January and minimums in July. Evaporation rates vary from 17.63 mm in June to 4.54 mm in December, and rainfall is rare, ranging from 0.0 to 0.3 mm monthly (Egyptian Meteorological Department, 1935–2000). The region's climate is hot and dry, with an average annual rainfall of less than 50 mm and a potential evaporation of more than 200 mm. The mean annual rainfall in the study area (1998–2009) ranges from 0 to 159.65 mm/year, with high rainfall in the far west and low in the remaining areas. Recharge increases with rainfall, but recent rainfall is assumed to be low. Most stored water in subsurface aquifers is attributed to past pluvial periods and sporadic flashfloods. The area experienced strong torrential rainfall during the Pleistocene, leading to the deposition of freshwater-travertine rocks and fanglomerates (Awad, M.A. et al., 1997 ). Geomorphologically, Remote sensing and GIS are utilized for geomorphological features and structure mapping, with advanced techniques developed for advanced geological techniques (Abdeen et al., 2009 ). The region has a diverse geomorphology, with features including alluvial fans, sand-dunes, stony hills, plateaus, and valleys (Said, 2012 ). The region has a rich cultural and historical legacy, with various ancient monuments and archaeological sites, including the Dandara temple complex. Structurally, the Qena Bend is a sharp bend in the Nile Valley that is believed to be the result of the rejuvenation of the NE fault system superimposed on NW and N-S trends. The study also identified the main structural characteristics of the area, including the presence of a series of faults and folds that control the geometry of the basin and the distribution of the sedimentary rocks. The western plateau terminates with fault-controlled escarpments, which rise abruptly from the alluvial plains (Hamza et al., 1999 ).   3 Methodology and dataset processing Remote sensing data, including optical, radar and thermal images can give insights into land use/land cover, surface temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, water balance, and precipitation. Remote sensing data, such as radar and microwave data reveal topography, surface roughness, and soil moisture to monitor land subsidence and environmental geohazard in the Qena plain, and Grace and Gldas data are used to monitor the aquifer properties as total water storage (TWS) and groundwater storage (GWS). The steps and stages followed in the present research are summarized in (Fig. 1  in supplementary data). 3.1 Optical remote sensing Landsat OLI/TIRS images  identify the land surface structures and various land cover types. This investigation utilized OLI 2015; 2023 multispectral Landsat images with WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_36N projection for spectral data, NDVI, and LULC with preprocessing to minimize spectral and radiometric issues downloaded from (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ ). Landsat-8 OLI collects image data in nine bands encompassing the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectrums with a spatial resolution of 30 m, except panchromatic band 8 (15 m, USGS). 3.1.1 Structure lineament mapping The linear features were drawn or digitized from the shaded relief maps, with the Sobel filter guiding the process directionally, (El-Hadidy 2021 ). Lineaments were detected in this study using visual interpretation of remote sensing data from several optical and radar satellite sensors, including the SRTM (DEM) area from USGS with a spatial resolution of 30 m, Landsat-8, and Sentinal-1 InSAR image. Lineament extraction begins with image processing or filtering to highlight or emphasize the linear properties of interest, hence assisting in their identification and tracking. The hillshade method, together with ArcMap software, was used to interpret the lineaments from the DEM at azimuth angles of 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315° respectively. The concluded lineament map of the research region was created using Laplacian and directional filtered images to eliminate or minimize tracking any of the non-geological or man-made features, a Google Earth image was utilized (El-Hadidy et al., 2022 ).  3.1.2 Land use/landcover mapping The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) may be used to identify agricultural-dependent ecosystems in the landscape (El-Hadidy, 2020 ). The index values range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating severely bare soil and indicating extremely vegetated soil, the NDVI threshold for detecting vegetation cover.N D V I = ( N I R − R E D  )   / ( N I R + R E D  )   ( El − Hadidy , 2020  )       The knowledge-based maximum likelihood supervised classification  in ENVI 5.3 software prepares a land use/land cover map, and the land change algorithm is used to monitor land use, cover dynamics, and anticipate agriculture and urban expansion. Land use/landcover mapping.  Image classification is a user-controlled technique that automatically categorizes pixels into land use/cover classes (Hashim et al., 2020 ). In this study, the Maximum Likelihood Classifier was used to assign pixels to classes based on pre-determined training sites from ground data, maps, and aerial photographs. Accuracy assessment was calculated for the two classified images to evaluate the classification results.   3.2 Climatic parameters datasets Satellites have enabled high-resolution climatic data to monitor the environment, allowing for the analysis of climate variability in GIS environments. Meteorological data from 2015 to 2023 analyze climate variability in unconfined or shallow aquifers sensitive to climate change. The study used historical climate grids for parameters like precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and water deficit. Meteorological time series data used from 2015 to 2023 to analyze climate variability in the GIS environment obtained from the Terraclimate dataset of climate, climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces, with high-spatial resolution 4 km, Downloaded from WorldClim and climate engine website, utilizing Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) for high-resolution gridded precipitation climatologies.  3.3 GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) The GLDAS system simulates land water cycles, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture, estimating Total Wetlands (TWS) and comparing it with GRACE data for validation. The study uses GRACE data to analyze inter-annual trends in terrestrial water storage from 2015 to 2023, tracking Earth's K-Ka band gravity anomalies with global coverage of 30 days and 110 Km spatial resolution from 2015 to 2023, JPL RL06, JPL RL04 (TWS) (Ince et al., 2019 ), and GRACE/GRACE-FO Mascon data are available at http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov . GRACE detects changes in the Earth's gravitational field, which are directly related to surface mass fluctuations. The surface mass signal represents total water storage (TWS) on land, which includes groundwater, soil moisture, surface water, snow, and ice. The GRACE (TWS) map displays anomalies relative to long-term averages by subtracting average TWS from actual TWS. Anomalies are color-coded: red indicates positive anomalies (excess water), while blue indicates negative anomalies (deficit). These data allow for water tracing across aquifer systems and assessment of water-resource management strategies. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) is a unique uncoupled land surface modeling system that uses satellite and ground-based observational data to generate optimal land surface states and fluxes. It runs globally at high resolution (0.25°) and produces results in near-real time. GLDAS uses a vegetation-based "tiling" approach to simulate sub-grid scale variability and uses high-resolution global datasets for soil and elevation parameters. The high-quality global land surface fields provided by GLDAS will be used to initialize weather and climate prediction models and promote hydrometeorological studies and applications. The 2001-forward archive of modeled and observed global surface meteorological data is publicly available (Rodell, M. et al., 2004 ), https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas . 3.3.1 Data processing This study uses the GRACE Tellus (GRCTellus) Monthly Mass Grids dataset created by three GRACE Ground System centers: CSR, GFZ, and JPL. Each center generates Level-2 data, including spherical harmonic coefficients of the gravity field and dealiasing fields. The results may differ slightly due to independent production, so it's recommended to use the means of all three datasets. The monthly land mass grids show water mass anomalies based on GRACE & GRACE-FO gravity observations. These anomalies represent total terrestrial water storage from soil moisture, snow, surface water, groundwater, and aquifers. A glacial isostatic adjustment correction and standard corrections for geocenter, C20, and C30 are applied. Post-processing filters reduce errors. Version 04 uses updated corrections and an ellipsoidal correction to account for Earth's non-spherical shape when mapping gravity anomalies to surface mass change Earth Engine Data Catalog  Data grids are provided in ASCII/netCDF/GeoTIFF formats. For the RL06 version, all GRACE products in the ASCII format have adopted the YAML encoding header, which is in full compliance with the PODAAC metadata best practices. The spherical harmonic coefficients were transformed into TWSGRACE grids of equivalent water thickness, then rescaled to minimize attenuation in the TWSGRACE time series through GRACE post-processing steps. Further information on GRACE data processing may be found in (Tapley et al., 2004 ). The approach described in (Landerer and Swenson, 2012 ; Landerer Felix, 2021 ; Wahr, 2009 ; Swenson and Wahr, 2006 ). The JPL mascon data (Release 05; version 2; 0.5° × 0.5° grid; available at: ftp://podaa  c.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/tellus/L3/mascon/RL05/JPL/). Python-based pyGRACE preprocesses CSR GRACE and GRACE-FO for Google Earth Engine ingestion, with an application module for groundwater change monitoring on GEE platform.

Soil moisture is challenging to measure due to its spatial and temporal variability. Remote sensing technology can help measure water content changes over time and space. There are three groups: Active, Passive, and Combined Active-Passive methods. Active methods are preferred for soil moisture retrieval, with thermal infrared data being the first developed method. Soil moisture data can be collected by satellites measuring microwaves reflected or emitted by Earth's surface. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is a remote sensing observatory NASA satellite mission with two instruments via the radiometer data at a spatial resolution of 36 km every 2–3 days that map soil moisture and determine freeze/thaw state. It provides high soil moisture accuracy (4%) by measuring the microwave 'temperature' of the land surface. Since the 1970s, microwave remote sensing techniques have been used to collect surface soil moisture, also known as the water content of the topmost soil layer, at various temporal and geographical scales (J. Bolten et al., 2003 ). Targets key applications requiring knowledge of root zone soil moisture in the top 1 m of soil column. SMAP measures soil moisture content, impacting TWS total water storage anomaly and validating GRACE's groundwater storage estimates, offering fine-scale information at the land surface. Grace uses total water storage anomaly (TWS) to calculate groundwater storage anomaly (GWS), analyze and plot the geographical and temporal fluctuations variations in groundwater levels and aquifer behaviors, and export results by Google Earth using deep machine learning algorithms by applying the following equation. After (Cammalleri et al., 2019 ) the Base concept of,(1) T W S  a n o m a l y = W  s o i l   + W  s n o w   + W  s u r f a c e   + G W      Maps of shallow groundwater, surface, and root zone soil moisture combine data from several ground and space-based observation systems. The data are included in a sophisticated numerical model of land surface hydrologic and energy processes using a long-term weather dataset. Recent attempts to estimate regional-scale groundwater storage rates using GRACE data have been made by subtracting the unsaturated zone soil water storage anomaly from the total water storage anomaly. After (Rodell et al., 2004 ),(2) G W S A = T W S A − S W S A  ( W s o i l   + W  s n o w   +  W  s u r f a c e    )      Where TWSA is total water storage anomaly, and SWSA is Soil Water Storage Anomaly. Extract the groundwater storage (GWS) value from the resulting grace, Gldas integration data by using Google Earth engine coding, then choose pixel samples, scattered ground control point and extract the corresponding calculated GWS value for mapping the spatial distribution of groundwater thickness and storage contour map by using GIS (IDW) interpolation approach.   3.4 The Interferometric Wide Swath mode of Sentinel-1 (S1) gives a possible way to accurately monitor land subsidence, and surface ground displacement and also map the digital elevation model using ESA SNAP software and two Sentinel-1 C-band, Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) composed of 3 swaths made of bursts, level 1 SLC mode, SAR images (5.6 cm wavelength) obtained on August 7, 2015(master image) and August 13, 2023(slave image) with horizontal-vertical, Vertical-Vertical (HV) (VV) polarization, global coverage (6–12 days), 20m spatial resolution. S1 datasets are available for free, full, and open access via Copernicus services (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/sentinel-data-access ), 3 arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM (30m) to remove the topography phase, and 90 m resolution for geocoding. InSAR coherence image was constructed by two radar images over the same area with the same geometry are used to observe interferogram, and interference patterns deformation between two Sar images to calculate the phase difference. Coherence cross correlation between master and slave Sar images ranges from 1 (low coherence) to 1 (high coherence). The steps used in the Sentinel 1 processing to export the displacement map and topographic map of the study area are illustrated in (Fig. 1  in supplementary data).  3.5 Groundwater storage (GWS) linear regression and correlation coefficient matrix with climatic parameters Linear regression models can assess relationships between grace, and Gldas parameters (GWS, surface soil moisture, root zoon soil moisture) and climatic parameters (PPT, Temp, and Evaporation) for investigating the relationship between two quantitative variables, regression explains how an independent variable is graphically and numerically associated with the dependent variable. The pearson correlation coefficient, r, ranges from −1 to 1, indicating the strength of a linear relationship between two variables (bivariant data). A positive r indicates an increase in one variable, while a negative r indicates a decrease. A perfect linear relationship (r = −1 or r = 1) implies that one variable can be perfectly explained by the other (Lu et al., 2012 ). Correlation analysis helps quantify associations (positive or negative) between GWS and climate variables. determines the interconnection or co-relationship between the variables.  3.6 Arc GIS modelling Integration of thematic layers of the most effective parameters derived and resulted from active and optical satellite data as GWS, geomorphology, geology, hydrogeology, landuse/landcover, slope, soil, and rainfall and temperature that converted into raster format and assigned weights and ranks using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) statistical method (Saaty 2003 ) by geographic information system database (Arc GIS Model) using weighted overlay analysis. Each layer is classified into a common reference scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most favorable. The final hazard zonal map is created by adding criterion scores for each piece of data and multiplying them by their weight.   4 Results 4.1 Lineament surface structure-mapping and analysis The lineaments vector map was analyzed using ArcMap 10.8, ENVI 5.3, and SNAP. Validation was done using Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence images and a topographic map resulting from Sentinel-1 image processing. The map showed high coherence in areas with white color, while dark gray indicated non-coherence. The trend was subtle and insignificant, primarily parallel to tectonic rift and uplift. The InSAR coherence resulting image exhibits large NW-SE oriented linear patterns and differential moderate coherence in the middle plateau related to dune movements. The dune's extended extension, negative relief, and significant parallelism with the valley suggest the presence of large structures that limit its orientation. The resulting structure lineament feature is presented in the form of a rose diagram and a lineament map (Fig. 2  ). The valley-bound plateaus are characterized by NW-SE the Suez-Red Sea tectonics were dominant, and NE-SW structural trends related to the Aqaba-Dead Sea Transform Qena-Safaga Shear Zone reactivated during the post-Eocene period. These structures govern valley cliffs, drainage, and dunes orientation. GIS overlay analyzes lineament map, revealing NW-SE fractures as probable groundwater flow path from the Eocene limestone aquifer to the Quaternary aquifer in the desert floodplain, validated against the existing geological map. The results derived from satellite data are consistent with the structural characteristics of the Qena Bend derived from geophysical data discussed in the (Ahmed et al., 2021 ) research.  4.2 Land use/landcover mapping and analysis Land use and cover maps were created using Landsat OLI images from 2015 to 2023, with 89.9% and 98.8% accuracy. The study area has diverse land-use classes, influenced by the Nile River proximity and industrial, agricultural, and urban activities. The classification of land into cultivated, built-up, water bodies, and barren land is based on land use and cover, with areas dominated by agricultural and industrial activities being considered anthropogenic sources for water and environmental hazard change, (Fig. 3  ). Changing maps between 2015 and 2023, cultivated land dominated the study area, except for western desert fringes, which increased by 13.74% with an area of about 334.87 Km2 . This increase is primarily due to reclamation projects in the area, which contribute to surface and groundwater potentiality due to irrigation.  The study reveals a decrease in barren lands by 37.32% with an area of about 5962.3 Km2 , largely due to urban development and reclamation projects, which increased water pollution and change from wastewater discharge into surface and groundwater resources (Elbeih and El-Zeiny 2018 ). The Nile River and other water bodies in land use/cover maps have decreased by 8.46% with an area of about 12.66 Km2 %, and other increased with urban in land use/cover maps by 28.28% with an area of about 173.85 Km2 % due to land reclamation processes. The large area of urban and cultivated lands with time increases environmental risks (Fig. 3 ), and (Table .1  ). The vegetation index may be used to identify agriculturally dependent ecosystems in the terrain. The index values vary from 0 to 1, with 0 representing very barren soil appearing with a violet color and 1 indicating heavily vegetated soil appearing green (Fig. 2  in supplementary data). shows the max NDVI value decreases with time from 0.5944 to 0.56112 these decreases are due to irrigation, drainage, and canals due to reclamation projects (Fig. 2  in supplementary data).  4.3 Climatic conditions analysis Global climatic changes are predicted to increase average global temperature by 1.4–5.8 °C by 2100, according to (E. DeNicola et al., 2015 ). The max annual temp of the study area ranges from 26 °C in the north and increases toward the south, especially in the southeast up to 36 °C which led to an increase in evapotranspiration (ET) and shortage in water recharge (Fig. 4  b and c). The mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration varies from 35 mm in the north up to 98 mm in the south. ET (evapotranspiration, the amount of both evaporation and transpiration) rises as atmospheric water demand rises. Rising temperatures cause slightly higher ET, which increases upward capillary flows from water to overlying soil moisture to fulfill the increasing atmospheric moisture demand. Long-term historical climatic data from meteorological stations show that the average annual rainfall ranges from 5 to 60 mm from 2015 to 2023 with an average value of about 10 mm/yr. Rainfall from satellite data has a significant from southwest to northeast gradient (Fig. 4  a), with the maximum rainfall towards the north–northeast direction. The mean annual water deficit is calculated by subtracting APET from rainfall. Almost all the study areas have a negative water deficit with time, and significant water deficit in the southeast, (Fig. 4  d). The direct relationship between climate change and the hydrological cycle, temperature changes, precipitation intensity, changes in precipitation quantity and seasonal distribution, increased evapotranspiration, and decreased soil moisture are all indicators of a sharp decline in the water table and a dramatic decrease in recharge. The amount of water resources diminishes in future warming conditions. The drop in soil moisture content derived from terraclimatic datasets of climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces and surface water from 2015 to 2023 is mostly due to the cumulative effects of over-pumping and climatic changes nevertheless, pumping's contribution might easily surpass natural resupply (Morsy 2023 ) reported that by used of the MODFLOW model to assess the impact of operating scenarios on groundwater Eocene aquifer. The optimal scenario considers water meter consumption in reclaimed areas, resulting in lower groundwater levels after 9700 days (El-Hadidy and Morsy, 2022 ). reported that groundwater in the Quaternary aquifer in reclamation areas near the Nile Valley is being over-pumped to meet future freshwater demand, and predicts the impact of long-term pumping capacity, reclamation, urbanization, and groundwater potential in the Quaternary aquifer northwest of the Nile Valley.  4.4 GRACE and GLDAS results and analysis Grace and Gldas' time series of high-repeatability data allows water tracing across an aquifer system and the assessment of water-resource management strategies. Gldas estimates soil moisture content and soil temperature at 25 km resolution, with accuracy varying based on sensor calibration, vegetation cover, and soil type. It typically provides 4–5% volumetric water content and a few degrees Celsius for land surface temperature. Soil moisture data is collected using satellites measuring microwaves reflected or emitted by Earth's surface determining the water content of the topmost soil layer. GLDAS provides hydrological modeling, estimating evapotranspiration and runoff. Fig. 5  a, shows a significant decline in soil moisture derived from the terraclimate dataset with the time of mean value from 0.2475 in 2014 to 0.2225 mm in 2023 (Fig. 5  c, and d). show surface soil moisture and variable in root zone soil moisture derived from GLDAS with a slightly increased value toward 2023. The soil moisture (SM) scale runs from 0 to 1, three types have been identified: 0.020439 to 0.0948 dry; 0.09485 to 0.169 moderate moisture; 0.1692 to 0.24456 high moisture, (Fig. 5 b). Soil moisture level is inversely related to soil temperature since the quantity of evaporation rises with higher temperatures (Fig. 5 b). shows the mapped soil moisture increased around the Nile valley related to increased irrigation, especially in the north leading to an increase in water infiltration and an increase in the GWS in the aquifer. Warming temperatures increase evaporation and decrease precipitation causing significant surface and groundwater level fluctuations. GRACE measures changes in Earth's gravity field, which are directly related to changes in surface mass. The surface mass signal largely reflects total water storage (TWS) on land is the sum of groundwater, soil moisture, surface water, snow, and ice. The GRACE Total Water Storage (TWS) map shows anomalies in TWS relative to long-term averages, calculated by subtracting average TWS from actual TWS for all the aquifers (shallow and deep). Anomalies are represented by color scales, with red indicating positive and blue indicating negative anomalies (Chanu et al., 2020 ), enabling water tracing across aquifer systems and assessing water-resource management strategies. Positive trends (excess water) suggest an increase in Grace TWS over time, while negative trends (water deficit) suggest a decline, during the period from 2002- to 2012 shows depletion of GRACE TWS (−2.8 ± 1.8 cm/yr) then from 2016 to 2020 shows a near steady state (−3 to - 5 cm/yr) then TWS slightly increased from 2020-to 2023 (Fig. 6  ). shows the significant decline in TWS recorded at different locations across the area with time with an annual mean (−4 to -5cm) as the average decline value. Overland, red colors represent above-average terrestrial water quantities in the northeast due to recharge from the Nile and episodically occurring floods from eastern desert highs but in the southwest due to recharge from the Nubian aquifer, whereas most of the study area with blue colors represent below-average terrestrial water amounts (including ice, snow, soil moisture, and groundwater). Minimum water levels and heights were achieved in 2017, but owing to intense groundwater management measures, the basin began to rebound in late 2019, during the worsening drought. Water levels had returned to pre-drought levels by 2020 (Fig. 7  ), and spatial distribution of TWS secular trends shows an increase around the Nile River and toward the northern parts. The study examines GRACE-derived storage changes during the studied period, considering seasonal climate variations and hydrologic extremes like drought and flood. The results show that groundwater storage value increases in wet seasons, with 2015 showing a +3 or 4 increase, 2018 showing a less than 1-mm increase, and 2020–2023 showing a +6- to 8 mm increase than in dry seasons. (Fig. 7 c) the selected scattered location derived from the groundwater aquifer storage map derived from grace-gldas data integration shows that groundwater storage increased in the north and decreased toward the south, especially in the southeast direction, general groundwater flow direction toward the northeast to the Nile and northwest to the low land topographic area (Fig. 7 c). The results derived from satellite data are consistent with the field results discussed the groundwater potentiality and aquifer properties in the previous work (Abu El-Magd and Eldosouky, 2021; Ahmed et al., 2017 ; Gaber A. et al., 2020 ) reported that the aquifer thickness and groundwater level increased in the northern zone of the study area. Hydrological models with TWS, and GWS derived from Grace and Gladas data are increasingly used for forecasting natural disasters as well as planning measures against climate change impacts. However, the lack of ground observations hinders their simulation. Remote sensing data can improve these models, provided it align with the required spatial and temporal scales. This work evaluates GRACE TWSA at an enhanced spatial representation, developing a simple yet reliable approach and a suitable output for statistical hydrological models.  4.5 InSar sentinel 1 results Sentinel-1's C-band synthetic aperture radar provides accurate centimeter-precision radar images for tracking land subsidence and structural damage across large areas (Fig. 3  in supplementary data). shows that the resulting coherence map has a 0 to 1 intensity scale. A high coherence (around 1) indicates a good match between two image sequences recorded at different times, with little to no variation in the land surface. A low coherence (around zero) indicates a significant difference between the two image scenes. The InSAR coherence image recognizes extremely subtle small changes on the ground surface in arid deserts, where changes are frequently generated by mobile sand movement or surface degradation caused by aeolian and river activity. Because of the fast fluctuations in plant cover and soil moisture in the reclaimed areas, the coherence is very low (near zero) along the farmed floodplain. On the image of InSAR coherence, large dark patches of moderate coherence may be seen along the plateau cliffs on the western side of the desert floodplain (middle zone), suggesting the significant surface changes caused by windblown sand movement and surface erosion caused by ephemeral fluvial activity. As a result, land reclamation in the east is more vulnerable to desertification due to mobile sand encroachment on plant cover and soil erosion than in the west. The phase change (interferometry) between two acquisitions creates color fringes, representing one cycle of spectrum colors from purple to red. The sense of motion is determined by the color sequence, with purple to red indicating deflation and red to purple uplifting (Fig. 3  d in supplementary data). Wrapped interferograms display deformation in multiple color sequences, indicating ground movement toward the satellite in the southeast and away from the satellite in the north zone especially northeastIn contrast, unwrapped interferograms show total deformation displacement, with total deflation around 4 cm, (Fig. 3  d and e in supplementary data). (Fig. 3  f in supplementary data), shows high displacement in the northwest part by an average of about negative 0.041 to – 0.030 m (Fig. 8  ). shows many cross-sections across the studied area clearing the range of displacement and subsidence across the area. From 2015 to 2023, the total amount of deformation in the research area ranged from negative 0.0363–0.072 m in the north (subsidence area) to positive 0.03265 m in the southeast (uplift area), (section C–D) with differential displacement in the middle zone(section A–B) This suggests that windblown sand movement, structure lineaments(section A–B) show uplift area between two normal faults, and ephemeral fluvial activities have caused major surface alterations, (section R–E) may show structure fault or Plateau cliffs cause differential subsidence. The data analysis findings revealed considerable subsidence in the northern parts of the research region respectively, which was associated with increased groundwater recharge and possibly due to erosion caused by paleo-runoff.  4.6 Groundwater storage (GWS) linear regression and correlation coefficient matrix with climatic parameters and subsidence rate analysis A strong positive relationship between the precipitation variable and the response GWS variable leads to a good model, and a good R2 is 0.636 close to one indicates a model with more explanatory power with significance f = 0.017. A strong negative linear relationship between the GWS and the temperature and soil moisture derived from the SMAP variable an R2 equal 1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data (Fig. 9b–  d and e). A weak positive linear relationship between the GWS and the root zone soil moisture and surface soil moisture derived from the Gldas variable an R2 equal 0.027583 and 0.077866 respectively with significance f = 0.9 (Fig. 9  c). A strong negative relationship between the subsidence rate as a variable and the response GWS variable leads to a good model, and a good R2 is 0.95 close to one indicates a model with more explanatory power with significance f = 0.9 perfectly fits the data (Fig. 9  f). Correlation is a measure of the relationship between two quantitative variables, with a correlation coefficient value ranging from −1 to +1, indicating a perfect positive, perfect negative, or no relationship between the variables (Fig. 9  f and j). shows the study found a strong positive correlation between surface soil moisture from SMAP and temperature, indicating that soil moisture is influenced by climatic parameters, such as increased water evaporation and capillary water between pores. The GWS shows a strong positive correlation between and perfect strength with 0.79 near to one with PPT values and landuse variables (Fig. 9  f and j) but shows a weak correlation with surface and rootzone soil moisture derived from Gldas. GRACE-based storage changes align well with GLDAS modeling results.   5 Discussion Land subsidence is challenging to manage due to its late detection and difficulty in determining the extent of affected areas, as no subsidence is visible on the ground surface. The management of this phenomenon is a complex and uncertain process due to its inherent disadvantages in a future safe development plan. Despite its challenges, modern remote sensing techniques offer valuable insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of the subsidence phenomenon. For this reason, monitoring land subsidence areas before socioeconomic development is crucial to detect vertical displacements caused by overexploitation and groundwater fluctuation of aquifers. This approach allows government and regional agencies to take necessary mitigation measures for safe and sustainable development. Urban development and agricultural activity in cities worldwide cause land subsidence, leading to significant water level drops and consolidation of compressible subsurface deformations (Kaitantzian A. et al., 2015 ). Recent research using InSAR techniques identified 21 regions experiencing land subsidence, especially Mexico City experiencing the most intense vertical displacements (Hamdani R.S. et al., 2021 ). Land subsidence due to aquifer level drops was observed in 90 cities by 2005, 80% along coastal zones (He Q. et al., 2005 ; Hakim W.L et al., 2020 ). Groundwater has been estimated using various techniques, but aggregation to regional scales remains difficult. To address these efforts have been made to estimate groundwater at large scales, such as modeling and baseflow separation methods. However, these estimates are often based on assumptions and rely on parameterization, leading to unsatisfactory flux estimates. Therefore, an alternative method that accurately estimates groundwater at large spatial scales, but short time scales is needed. GRACE has the potential to meet these demands. Previous studies have successfully used GRACE data to evaluate groundwater depletion rates, with studies in the USA, Jordan, India, and China (Bhanja, S.N. et al., 2016 ; Feng, W. et al., 2013 ; Wu et al., 2019 ), corroborating the agreement between GRACE-derived seasonal groundwater storage anomalies and groundwater level measurements, indicating GRACE data's potential in assessing groundwater depletion rates. Recent studies have attempted to estimate regional-scale groundwater re-use rates using GRACE data. These methods subtract the unsaturated zone soil water storage anomaly from the total water storage anomaly and then relate the change in GWSA to groundwater using two regional-scale water budget approaches. The water storage fluctuation method estimates recharge by analyzing groundwater storage changes, like water table fluctuations, and calculating net recharge over a specific time interval (Henry C.M. et al., 2011 ). The present study analyzes land subsidence phenomena and examines the interplay between groundwater fluctuations, displacement rates, and geo-environmental settings in Qena Bend, west Nile River. Numerous studies have explored the rate and patterns of deformations in the Nile regions using geodetic techniques like GPS and InSAR. Factors such as sediment compaction (Becker and Sultan, 2009 ), groundwater withdrawal (Aly et al., 2012 ; Sultan et al., 2017), tectonic activity (Aly et al., 2009 ), and human activities (Saleh and Becker 2019 ) have been identified as the main factors in ground subsidence and deformation. Variations in rates have been reported in major cities. Unsustainable extraction, increased flood risk, reduced underground water storage, chemical reactions with groundwater, and damaging infrastructure are contributing to the growth of groundwater-related subsidence in developing countries. Excessive groundwater extraction leads to depression of the groundwater surface, making it difficult and expensive to pump deeper water. This makes groundwater extraction a tragedy of the commons, resulting in economic externalities (Tzampoglou et al., 2023 ). This can result in land sinking and the formation of sinkholes, posing risks to infrastructure and human lives, (A.Rateb and Abotalib Z. 2020 ). However, climate change and increasing population increase strain groundwater aquifers, particularly in highly populated places in arid and semiarid environments, (Famiglietti, J.S. 2014 ) . The West Qena bend in Upper Egypt, a 1200 km2  region on the Nile River's west bank, is influenced by various factors such as geomorphological processes, tectonic structures, hydrological conditions, anthropogenic activities, and climate changes. The study region has a diverse geomorphology, with features including alluvial fans, dunes, stony hills, plateaus, and valleys. The Nile River provides the majority of the region's surface and agricultural irrigation water (El-Shirbeny M. A. et al., 2020 ). The Quaternary alluvial aquifer provides most of the region's drinking and residential water, as well as certain agricultural activities, (Ramzy et al., 2024). Shallow aquifers have a greater influence on the surface runoff and surface storage, interactions between streams and the aquifers (Barsom, N. 2016 ). Several development initiatives have taken place in this area, where the Quaternary aquifer is the primary supply of water. The Nile's water level was managed once the (GERD) was built, and irrigation systems were switched from basin to perennial. As a result, groundwater has begun to increase (Fig. 7 ) and the groundwater level has surpassed that of the Nile, resulting in seepage from the aquifer to the river (return flow) in most portions of the Nile Valley, (El Tahlawi et al., 2008 ). Water consumption has increased globally because of climate change and overpopulation. The agricultural plain underwent widespread land subsidence, which is thought to be caused by overexploitation of groundwater. Landsat OLI images from 2015 to 2023 examine the impact of land use and land cover changes on terrestrial water storage. Key findings include cultivation land expansion, urban development, and decreased water bodies quantity by - 8.455% with an area of about (12.5 km2). Cultivated land increased by 13.74%, while urbanization led to a 37.324% decrease in barren lands but increased water pollution and altered wastewater discharge. Urban and cultivated land cover increases environmental risks, including water scarcity, pollution, and altered hydrological processes (Mohamed et al., 2024 ). Understanding land use changes and their impact on water resources is crucial for sustainable management. Landuse/landcover map monitoring shows an increase in cultivated and urban areas and therefore increased irrigation and random, unplanned pumping affected the fluctuation in TWS, and EWH which show a decline with time affected by climatic change and global warming conditions decrease in soil moisture with time, and GWS which show a slightly increased level with time due to infiltration irrigated water with time (Fig. 7 ). The efficiency and drawdown of the Eocene aquifer is influenced over pumping and geological factors in a reciprocal relationship, the optimal scenario considers water meter consumption in reclaimed areas, resulting in lower groundwater levels according to (Morsy S.M. 2023 ). The efficiency of the Quaternary aquifer is influenced by both human activity and geological factors in a reciprocal relationship according to (El-Hadidy and Morsy, S.M., 2022 ). The study area has a hot and dry climate with an average annual rainfall of less than 50 mm and a potential evaporation of from 50 to 200 mm as an average value. Rainfall water infiltrating beyond rooting depth is considered groundwater (Wu et al., 2019 ). Recharge increases with rainfall, but recent rainfall is assumed to be low. Most stored water in subsurface aquifers is attributed to past pluvial periods and sporadic flash floods. The area experienced strong torrential rainfall during the Pleistocene, leading to the deposition of freshwater-travertine rocks and fanglomerates (Awad M.A. et al., 1997 ). Four GLDAS models satisfy this requirement. estimate soil water storage anomalies in the root zone, combining observational data with land surface models, despite varying root depths. GLDAS outcomes show temporal variations in soil moisture content, with stable or decreasing dry periods and an increase during the wet periods especially in low-land areas where levels of groundwater are shallow. The mean SWSA of the four models is considered root zone SWSA, obtained by subtracting the average SWSA from GRACE TWSA anomalies. recharge to precipitation ratios in the dry season are smaller than in the wet season, as recharges in semiarid and arid regions occur during heavy rainfall. This conservative estimate for groundwater recharge is likely. The geological and climatic factors Influence the groundwater recharge and runoff harvesting patterns, perennial surface water flow areas frequently feature continuous infiltration and resultant groundwater flow. Groundwater recharge is estimated using the water balance approach as grid-cell precipitation minus real evapotranspiration (Dubois et al., 2021 ), runoff and recharge increased toward the north with the same direction of earth slope direction (Fig. 4 ). GLDAS provides hydrological modeling, estimating evapotranspiration and runoff. Soil moisture levels are inversely related to soil temperature, as evaporation increases with higher temperatures (Fig. 9 ). Increased irrigation in the Nile valley leads to increased water infiltration and GWS in the aquifer, while warming temperatures increase evaporation and decrease precipitation, causing significant surface and groundwater level fluctuations. Climatic change impact, rising temperatures, and evapotranspiration (ET) rates are causing reduced soil moisture and groundwater recharge due to higher atmospheric water demand. The study area experiences a significant rainfall gradient from southwest to northeast, leading to a negative water deficit, especially in the southeast agrees with temperature increased trend (Figs. 4 and 9 ). Soil moisture data from microwave satellites shows a decrease in the topmost soil layer's water content from 2014 to 2023, inversely related to soil temperature, indicating increased evaporation. GRACE and GLDAS Data provide critical insights into TWS anomalies. The observed negative anomalies indicate a significant reduction in total water storage, reflecting the combined effects of climatic and anthropogenic factors. GRACE measures Earth's gravity field changes, which are related to surface mass changes. The GRACE Total Water Storage map shows anomalies in TWS relative to long-term averages, represented by color scales, with red indicating positive and blue indicating negative anomalies. The GRACE TWS map shows anomalies in Total Water Storage (TWS) on land, categorized as positive (excess water) and negative (deficit). From 2002 to 2012, GRACE TWS depleted (−2.8 ± 1.8 cm/yr), then remained steady (−3 to −5 cm/yr) until 2016 to 2020 then slightly increasing from 2020-to-2023. The average decline value is −4 to −5 cm/yr (Fig. 6 ). The findings reveal that the northeast and southwest regions have above-average terrestrial water quantities due to recharging from the Nile and Nubian aquifers, while most areas have below-average water levels. The basin rebounded in late 2019 due to groundwater management measures, returning to pre-drought levels by 2020, with an increase in TWS secular trends around the Nile River and northern parts. Groundwater storage value increases in wet seasons, with 2015 showing a (+3 to 4) increase, 2018 showing a -1-mm increase, and 2020–2023 showing a (+6 to 8) mm increase (Fig. 7 b). groundwater storage increased in the north and decreased in the south, particularly in the southeast direction. The general groundwater flow direction was northeast to the Nile and northwest to the lowland topographic area (Fig. 7 c). The results align with previous field results discussing groundwater potentiality and aquifer properties (Abu El-Magd and Eldosouky, 2021 ; Gaber, A. et al., 2020 ). Linear regression models and correlation analysis evaluate GWS-climatic relationships while understanding complex responses due to local hydrogeology and land use is crucial. Climate change alters precipitation patterns, leading to rapid runoff and lag time groundwater recharge and infiltration, while prolonged droughts decrease overall recharge. Fig. 9  shows the linear relation between precipitation as a variable that directly contributes to groundwater recharge with R2  of 0.63, which indicates that precipitation regulates groundwater recharge. When rain falls a portion infiltrates into the ground, replenishing aquifers. Warmer temperatures increase soil and vegetation evaporation rates, leading to higher evapotranspiration and reduced water availability for groundwater recharge, with Negative relationships between temp and GWS (Fig. 9 ). Statistical correlation data from 2015 to 2023 reveals a significant positive correlation between groundwater levels with annual precipitation levels, the root zone soil moisture and surface soil moisture derived from GLDAS and different variables of landuse parameters. Groundwater storage has a negative correlation relationship with annual temperature value, evaporation value, and soil moisture value from SMAP data and subsidence rate. In the research, the GWS results were validated by correlating and comparing the different other results from various data as soil moisture temporal and spatial distribution also the climatic data distribution as precipitation, temp and evaporation, and the water deficit map resulting from the climatic data which indicate the water deficit area in the southeast and more water availability in the north especially in the northwest part of the area. Lineament mapping is a method used to identify potential groundwater flow pathways on Earth's surface, such as faults or fractures. It involves analyzing the distribution and orientation of these linear features, with high lineament density areas often indicating zones of enhanced groundwater movement. Puli decomposition, MChi_r, MChi_g, MChi_b in RGB, Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence images, intensity, and a topographic map resulting from sentinel 1 image processing (Fig. 3  a, b, and c in supplementary data), GIS analysis reveals NW-SE and NE-SW fractures as probable groundwater flow paths from Eocene limestone aquifer to Quaternary aquifer in desert floodplain, influencing rock water interaction and ground surface subsidence. Ground subsidence is the gradual sinking of the Earth's surface due to subsurface earth materials, such as groundwater withdrawals, natural compaction, and organic soil drainage. Land subsidence (LS) is caused by chemical reactions and natural processes, building activities, mining, and groundwater extraction have a quicker impact on LS resulting in land sinking and the formation of sinkholes, posing risks to infrastructure and human lives. Groundwater flow in fractured aquifers can attain velocities several orders of magnitude higher than natural groundwater flow through porous media. This is achieved through rapid turbulent non-Darcian flow within high transmissivity zones within fractured systems and karstic textures. High hydraulic conductivities have been reported for densely fractured bedrocks, (Banks et al., 1995 ). High flow velocities in fractures are maximized within areas characterized by high hydraulic gradients, to be true, extensive networks of interconnected structures and/or karstic topography are expected to be observed. Limestone outcrops, primarily Eocene, are found along fractures and joints west of Nile Valley, with high inferred groundwater flow velocities common in fractured and karstic aquifers, reported by (El Gammal E. 2010 ; Mostafa, A., 2013 ; Mohamed A. et al., 2017 ; Abotalib et al., 2019 ). The study area's extensive fault and karstic networks offer rapid pathways for groundwater flow across the study area (Fig. 10   b). The causes and implications of alluvial karstification development on the Eocene Limestone Plateau in the eastern central Western Desert west of the Nile River formed in a braided fluvial system dominated by gravel, with plenty of water and sediment. Lower Eocene carbonates in the Eastern Desert between Sohag and Qena show silicification, dolomitization, solution, cementation, syntaxial rim cement, compaction, recrystallization, and authigenic gypsum, anhydrite, and halite production (Keheila and El-Ayyat, 1992 ; Ahmed K. et al., 2020 ). Dolomitization is a late diagenetic stage, with authigenic evaporates in dolomitic lime mudstones suggesting hypersaline brines with magnesium content may be adjacent to the carbonate of the Eocene aquifer. (Keheila and El-Ayyat, 1992 ; El-Hadidy, 2021 ). The karst phenomenon where soluble carbonates and evaporites are present at the surface and/or in the subsurface can pose significant risks to both urban development and human safety. Reasons that lead to ground subsidence are discussed, but the results of the study show the subsidence area is incredibly slow, and records a high level of groundwater, and this reveals ground subsidence due to interaction between the carbonate layer and groundwater, increased agricultural land, and urban expansion, resulting in irrigation water erosion and subsurface gaps. The analysis of aquifer behavior, groundwater flow, and environmental risks is significantly enhanced using weighted overlay analysis, lineament mapping, and various parameters. This study uses GIS-based analysis methods to understand groundwater flow paths and aquifer behaviors. Weighted overlay analysis is a powerful technique that combines multiple thematic layers, assigning weights to each layer based on its importance. This results in a composite map highlighting areas with specific characteristics or hazards, allowing decision-makers to prioritize and identify regions with high or low suitability for specific purposes like groundwater recharge or land subsidence risk. Land subsidence derived from Sentinel-1 imagery resulted in good agreement with GRACE (TWS) decline result and geospatial distribution GWS increase in the northern zone. Careful monitoring of the environmental geohazards in the study area by fusion of the results from several studied factors and parameters controlling the area can divide the area into three risk zones with different characters and degrees. The hazard map resulting from the overlay weighting criteria shows that the northern zone with high displacement and subsidence with high GWS level especially the northwestern part affected by major structure control leads to an increase in the rock water interaction and connects the lower Eocene aquifer with mainly carbonate composition with surface and climatic agents (Fig. 10 ). This explains that the resulting subsidence in this part is due to rock-water interaction and increased solubility and dissolution of carbonate rock under structure control. The middle zone shows differential hazards and displacement related to NW-SE-oriented linear patterns and differential moderate coherence in the middle plateau related to dune movements. As a result, land reclamation in the east is more vulnerable to desertification due to mobile sand encroachment on plant cover and soil erosion with NW-SE structure trends. The southern zone shows less hazard and less displacement, and the southeast shows an uplift area (Fig. 10 ), the GWS level shows low storage and a high drop in water level which applies its results to the results of climatic change where the temperature is highest in the southern part led to more evapotranspiration and decrease toward the north with high GWS. Satellite remote sensing can measure land subsidence, which can be used to monitor groundwater storage change, despite various anthropogenic and natural factors. Finally, in the future, drilling log data and geotechnical study will be necessary to obtain a more precise dissolution rate. Also Integrating hydrogeological modeling into groundwater dynamics could provide more robust insights into groundwater availability and sustainability, Further construction on the karstified areas requires the detection of the subsurface sinkhole voids using ground penetrating radar ‘GPR’ and electrical resistivity tomography ‘ERT’. To continue building in karstified areas, underlying sinkhole voids must be detected using ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography.  6 Conclusion The study uses satellite imagery to monitor groundwater-induced bedrock subsidence in Egypt's West Qena bend, aiming to develop sustainable land management strategies and understand subsidence dynamics. Land use changes, such as increased cultivation, urbanization, irrigation, and unplanned pumping, significantly impact water resources. Four GLDAS models estimate soil water storage anomalies in the root zone, showing temporal variations in soil moisture content. Climate change, global warming, and soil moisture reduction are causing declines in Total Water Storage, equivalent water height, and groundwater storage, leading to negative water deficits due to climatic changes and evapotranspiration. Microwave satellite data shows a decrease in topmost soil layer water content from 2014 to 2023, inversely related to soil temperature. GRACE and GLDAS data reveal negative anomalies, indicating a significant reduction in total water storage. The GRACE TWS map shows anomalies in TWS on land, with positive trends in the northeast and negative trends elsewhere. From 2002 to 2012, GRACE TWS depleted, remained steady until 2016–2020, and slightly increased from 2020 to 2023. The northeast and southwest regions have above-average terrestrial water quantities due to recharge from the Nile and Nubian aquifers, while most areas have below-average water levels. Groundwater storage increased in wet seasons, with a positive increase in the north and a decrease in the south, particularly in the southeast. Groundwater recharge increases towards the north with the earth's slope direction. The study reveals that precipitation regulates recharge in groundwater systems, while warmer temperatures increase evapotranspiration and decrease water availability. Statistical correlation data from 2015 to 2023 shows a positive correlation between groundwater levels and annual precipitation, root zone soil moisture, and surface soil moisture. Lineament mapping identifies probable groundwater flow pathways from the Eocene limestone aquifer to the Quaternary aquifer in the desert floodplain. InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) measures ground subsidence over time, revealing a range of −0.04m in the northwest to +0.03m in the southeast. Weighted overlay analysis divides the area into three risk zones, allowing decision-makers to prioritize groundwater recharge or land subsidence risk. The northern zone, with high groundwater storage, faces increased rock-water interaction, affecting the lower Eocene aquifer and carbonate composition, leading to sinkhole formation and risks to infrastructure and human lives. The area's fractures and karstic textures facilitate rapid groundwater flow, causing land subsidence through chemical reactions and natural processes. The study provides a framework for development plans in West Qena and similar regions globally. The study emphasizes the need for policy changes in West Qena to address groundwater fluctuation and land subsidence risks. It suggests recharge programs, water use regulations, efficient irrigation practices, green infrastructure, smart growth principles, groundwater monitoring networks, satellite-based observations and community awareness.
