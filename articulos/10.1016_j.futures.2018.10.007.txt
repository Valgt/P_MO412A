                  How achievable are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across different policy pathways? In this paper we model three alternative policy pathways for achieving SDG targets: technology, lifestyle change, and decentralized governance. We use countries that historically have developed rapidly to scale alternative pathways in an integrated assessment platform and explore the achievability of nine human development related SDGs to 2050. We find that combining all interventions leads to 63 percent of SDG target values achieved by 2030 and 89 percent by 2050, falling short of full achievement. The global technology pathway is the most successful at improving human development while the reduced consumption pathway is least successful. Achievement in lower secondary education, sanitation, and electricity lag behind other indicators across each of these scenarios. We also show that the geographic level of analysis matters significantly in assessing SDG achievement: assessed via global population, many SDGs appear achievable, but assessed at the country level, many small poor countries do not achieve targets in any scenario. This suggests that these most vulnerable countries (MVCs) should be the focus of a global effort to sustainably improve human development.

Fig. 1   Fig. 2 Projections for scenarios across broad out-come indicators.  Fig. 2   Table 1 Rio + Pathways narrative and IFs pathways narrative.  Table 1    Pathway Rio+20 broad assumptions IFs broad assumptions   Global Technology (GT) Achieves the 2050 targets, with a focus on large-scale technologically optimal solutions, such as intensive agriculture and a high level of international coordination; for instance, though trade liberalization. In addition to the improvements in productivity, investments in technical solutions, and international coordination, this scenario assumes more rapid adoption of fixed and mobile broadband, a greater demand for science and engineering graduates, greater international engagement in terms of aid, migration, investment, and the introduction of a progressive carbon tax.  Decentralized Solutions (DS) Achieves the 2050 targets, with a focus on decentralized solutions, such as local energy production, agriculture that is interwoven with natural corridors and national policies that regulate equitable access to food. Building on the Rio+20, the IFs scenario assumes that these advances benefit from the support of strengthened local governance, and serve to improve energy and agricultural efficiency, reduce loss, and to provide additional sources of income to traditionally peripheral communities. In addition, a higher premium on technical skills in more rural areas drives greater demand for vocational education.  Consumption Change (CC) Achieves the 2050 targets, with a focus on changes in human consumption patterns, most notably by limiting meat intake per capita, by ambitious efforts to reduce waste in the agricultural production chain and through the choice of a less energy-intensive lifestyle. Beyond the assumptions elaborated in the Rio+20 scenario, the IFs scenario also assumes a preference for smaller families.

Josef Korbel School of International Studies University of Denver United States       How achievable are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across different policy pathways? In this paper we model three alternative policy pathways for achieving SDG targets: technology, lifestyle change, and decentralized governance. We use countries that historically have developed rapidly to scale alternative pathways in an integrated assessment platform and explore the achievability of nine human development related SDGs to 2050. We find that combining all interventions leads to 63 percent of SDG target values achieved by 2030 and 89 percent by 2050, falling short of full achievement. The global technology pathway is the most successful at improving human development while the reduced consumption pathway is least successful. Achievement in lower secondary education, sanitation, and electricity lag behind other indicators across each of these scenarios. We also show that the geographic level of analysis matters significantly in assessing SDG achievement: assessed via global population, many SDGs appear achievable, but assessed at the country level, many small poor countries do not achieve targets in any scenario. This suggests that these most vulnerable countries (MVCs) should be the focus of a global effort to sustainably improve human development.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Forecasting human development  Alternative development pathways  Sustainable development    1 Introduction The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the current path of human and environmental development is not sustainable across multiple dimensions. Environmental systems (including air, biota, oceans, water, etc.) are under pressure at both micro and macro levels (DeLonge, Miles, & Carlisle, 2016 ; Inniss et al., 2016 ; IPCC, Climate Change, 2013 ; Lemke et al., 2007 ; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2018 ) while billions of people suffer from lack of access to basic resources such as clean water, energy and food (Hughes et al., 2009a ). In response to these challenges, governments worldwide have formulated a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), supported by 169 targets and 232 indicators, together describing a vision for integrated development sensitive to both human and natural system needs. The SDGs apply to all countries irrespective of level of development and are an explicitly integrated framework designed to enhance human and natural systems. In light of these developments, many have explored the achievability of SDG targets across distinct pathways. One area of research has been in the shared socio-economic pathways (SSP) literature (O’Neill et al., 2014 ), which introduces five scenarios related to dimensions of uncertainty associated with climate mitigation and adaptation. This work is focused on framing uncertainty and has led to various studies in areas like climate change (Clarke et al., 2014 ) and sustainable energy (Riahi et al., 2017 ), but also in human development systems like conflict (Hegre et al., 2016 ). An alternative scenario development approach was used in “Roads to Rio+20″, which focused on three alternative policy pathways for achieving SDG targets (van Vuuren et al., 2015 ). This research analyzed the level of intervention required to achieve SDGs across scenario paths representing: Global Technology (GT), Decentralized Solutions (DS) and Consumption Change (CC). This study fills a gap in the literature by exploring the country-level achievability of nine human development indicators measuring SDG achievement across the pathways presented in the Roads to Rio+20 analysis.1  1 The Rio+ pathways work was “target driven” and normative in the sense that scenarios were created to achieve targets across distinct pathways. This work is “storyline driven” and exploratory in the sense that we draw upon the narratives for pathways described in Rio+ to explore target value achievement across pathways.   Instead of identifying the magnitude of intervention required to achieve different SDGs (the Rio + example) or creating scenarios that map uncertainty across dimensions (the SSP approach), we create exploratory scenarios using high performing historical development patterns as interventions. Across pathways similar to the Rio + work, how likely are we to achieve human development related SDGs? If these alternative scenarios do not achieve these targets, where are the gaps? How does pursuing one target affect the ability to achieve other targets (assessing synergies and trade-offs)? Does the geographical level-of-analysis matter significantly in the assessment of these targets? As previous modeling work in this area focuses on environmental goals, are there trade-offs across human and natural systems? We begin by constructing a Current Path (CP) scenario within the International Futures (IFs) model. This scenario represents a dynamic continuation of policy choices across systems which represents a middle-of-the-road global development path. After building this baseline scenario we construct three alternative scenarios following the Rio + pathways framework that represent GT, DS, and CC. We add a fifth Combined scenario that brings together the interventions across GT, DS, and CC. We explored these five scenarios using the IFs model for 186 countries for 2030 and 2050. IFs is a dynamically recursive integrated assessment model, with a particularly strong representation of human-development related aspects compared to other IAM models.  2 Methods This paper describes the analysis in the IFs model with respect to human development goals based on the SDGs of a scenario based on current trends (Current Path scenario) and several policy scenarios (DS, GT, and CC scenarios). We specifically look into a set of key indicators. Below, we briefly describe the methods used. 2.1 International Futures (IFs) IFs is a long-term integrated assessment model with endogenized sub-models representing agriculture, demographics, economics, energy, environment, governance, infrastructure, international politics, health, and technology (see Fig. 1  ) (Hughes & Hillebrand, 2006 ; Hughes, Joshi, Moyer, Sisk, & Solórzano, 2014 ; Hughes, 2001 ). It is a dynamically recursive model with annual time steps to 2100. The IFs system is available for use by others both on-line and in a downloadable version, and it is open source. The demographic model uses a standard cohort-component representation (Hughes et al., 2009b ). Fertility and mortality are endogenous in response to other drivers, including adult educational attainment; a health model (Hughes, Dickson, Solorzano, Kuhn, & Peterson, 2011 ) computes 15 categories of mortality and morbidity. In the health model, mortality and morbidity are age and sex specific. The education model represents student movement through primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, and tertiary levels, in part constrained and driven by government finance (Hughes, Dickson, & Irfan, 2010 ). The economic model represents capital (across six sectors), labor (by skill), and productivity (with multiple endogenous drivers). As with many models, it calculates equilibrium across supply and demand, though it does not achieve equilibrium at any point in time. Instead, the model uses sectoral inventory and associated price changes to chase equilibrium across time. The economic model includes a social accounting matrix representing flows across economic sectors (input-output table), and among actors (households, firms, and government) connected domestically and via international trade, aid, and FDI flows (Hughes, 2007 ). The partial equilibrium2  2 It is partial in the sense that it represents equilibration processes only in the physical agricultural system. In the same way the energy sub-module is partial in the sense that it represents equilibration only in the physical energy system. The partial equilibrium physical system modules then connect to the economic module, described previously.   agriculture model differentiates crop, meat and fish, and generates calorie and protein availability (Rothman, Hughes, & Narayan, 2017 ). The partial equilibrium energy model differentiates coal, oil, natural gas, hydroelectric power, nuclear power, and renewable energy, tracking resource bases and production (Hughes, Solórzano, & Rothman, 2014 ). Key variables from the agriculture and energy models, converted to monetary terms, override those of the same sectors in the economic model, while the integration across sectors in the economic model of variables including household, government and firm demand and savings/investment availability provide information to and constraints upon the physical models. The water model links supply from renewable and nonrenewable sources to demand from agricultural, municipal and industrial sectors. Agricultural water demand is linked to irrigation in the agriculture model and can constrain yields. The infrastructure model represents the extent of and access to paved roads, safe water and sanitation, electricity, and information and communication technologies (Moyer & Hughes, 2012 ; Rothman, Irfan, Margolese-Malin, Hughes, & Moyer, 2014 ). It requires investment from public and private sectors that compete with demand from the education and health models, as well as other uses (Hughes, Joshi et al., 2014 ). The physical agriculture and energy models determine land use and generate carbon emissions. A representation based on the MAGICC model (Hughes & Hedden, 2016 ; Hughes, Ifran, Moyer, Rothman, & Solorzano, 2011 ), used widely in other IAMs, connects carbon emissions to atmospheric CO2  levels, resultant global warming, and country-level changes in temperature and precipitation. Those feed forward to the agriculture model with a mixture of positive and negative consequences. Across the broader IFs system, two points of interconnection are especially important. The first is finance, including governmental revenues and expenditures, but also those of households and firms. The economic system is embedded within a social accounting matrix that represents all financial flows within and across these agent categories and assures that representation of those flows is appropriately balanced and constrained—there are no unfunded expenditures (Hughes & Hossain, 2003 ). The second area where systems are highly interactive is via the endogenous representation of productivity in the economic model. Multifactor productivity is responsive to changes in human capital (education and health), social capital (including governance security and capacity), physical capital (including infrastructure development and energy prices), and knowledge capital (including research and development spending but also the knowledge transfers through trade). A broader model of governance represents the state of domestic security or instability, corruption, and inclusion (democracy) and connects to government finance (Joshi, Hughes, & Sisk, 2015 ). Socio-political variables also trace changes in basic value/cultural structures, and portray various elements of formal and informal socio-economic structures and processes, including income distribution. The IFs system also represents changes in country material power positions globally, a foundation of international politics (Moyer, 2012 ). Technological change is important across most of the models in IFs. While exogenously represented in many instances, the production functions in the economic, agriculture, and energy models have elements of learning by doing. Model validation is addressed in two ways. First, the projections developed in IFs are compared with other issue area projections produced by researchers and other models.3  3 See, for example, Hughes [28] for a comparison of the behavior of the IFs Current Path scenario with other published research across issue areas. Across issue areas covered here, the IFs tool produces similar results with the exception of the energy module which includes more optimistic assumptions about the future production capacity of renewable energy compared with other well known global energy modeling efforts.   Second, the tool is assessed via historical forecasting (starting historical projections in 1990 and comparing them with data). Because the system is large, identifying causal pathways can be challenging. To overcome this, the model is documented through a help system, wiki, along with working papers for each sub-module.4  4 IFs help system: https://www.du.edu/ifs/help/ ; IFs wiki: http://pardee.du.edu/wiki/Main _Page; Working Papers: http://pardee.du.edu/research-and-projects .   The scenarios in this paper do not explicitly or implicitly represent large-scale wild-card events like pandemics, rapid advances in artificial intelligence, or dramatic shifts in climate change.5  5 Human experience has always included unforeseen change—referred to as “black swans” or “wild-cards” (though these are conceptually distinct). Model projections are occasionally dismissed by critics because future disruptions are not fully considered. This is a mistake. Ignoring projections because they do not fully capture the future misses what they can do: help us think more comprehensively about how our world is unfolding by systematically representing the world to inform how the actions we take today can improve the human condition tomorrow.    2.2 Scenarios Scenario analysis often begins with the establishment of a baseline. Baselines are scenarios derived from models that can range from the quite simple to the increasingly complex (Allen, Metternicht, & Wiedmann, 2017 ; Vergragt & Quist, 2011 ). Many baseline scenarios are extrapolations that explicitly assume no new policy. Other baseline scenarios more realistically capture how development is unfolding across time by modeling structural transitions (e.g., changing economic production by sector, or government spending patterns). A more dynamic approach to developing a baseline scenario introduces an increasing number of interacting variables and endogenized relationships. Models with more interacting variables may better illustrate interacting complex systems (and be more realistic) but make it more difficult to interpret results and communicate causality. 2.2.1 The current Path Here we use a baseline scenario from the IFs modeling platform called the Current Path (CP). The CP models the dynamic unfolding within and across sectors and countries and has been used in both academic and policy-oriented publications as a scenario that articulates a “most likely” development path (Bohl et al., 2017 ; Dickson, Hughes, & Irfan, 2010 ; Hughes et al., 2009b ; Hughes, Kuhn, Peterson, Rothman, & Solórzano, 2011 ; Moyer, Porter, Johnson, Moyer, & Bohl, 2015 ).  2.2.2 Modeling alternative pathways To create scenarios that built upon the narratives used in “Roads from Rio+20″ pathways we began by evaluating and extending their conceptual logic. For example, DS is a scenario that identifies the impact of focusing on local solutions to global problems. But previous modeling work for this scenario did not fully explain the role that national governments can play in facilitating local solutions. Government is crucial for the achievement of the SDGs in any scenario, but DS requires enhanced governance capacity to achieve the narrative’s objectives. See Table 1   for a comparison of Rio + and IFs scenarios narratives. Next, we identified parameters already in IFs that could be altered to create these alternative scenarios. The IFs model is structured with parameters that are used as scenario “levers”. These parameters can be additive or multiplicative and allow modelers to exogenously impact the behavior of endogenized variables to simulate a policy choice or uncertainty and create an alternative scenario to the CP. We modified parameters within the agriculture (land under cultivation, crop yields, and food loss), energy (production, capital to output ratios, intensity), infrastructure (water and sanitation access), and governance (effectiveness, transfers, spending patterns) modules of IFs (see Appendix A for a complete list of parameters and assumptions for each scenario and how they differ from the CP). We created exploratory scenarios and not normative scenarios as were created for the Rio + work. We chose to do this for two reasons. First, we were interested in whether it was possible to achieve human development related SDGs across alternative pathways using high performing historical examples as a benchmark. If historically high performing growth in indicators did not achieve the SDGs (a hypothetical “best case” scenario), then we could argue that transformative policy was required. Second, an intervention that achieves human development related SDGs in Chad, for example, requires broadly unrealistic interventions when applied on a global basis. Identifying plausible, high-performing countries was done by looking at: 1) historically high rates of change across each variable; and 2) the relative position of countries with high rates of change, with respect to broad measures of development (for example, to GDP per capita) across time. We created scenarios that reflected development patterns that were possible (i.e. consistent with what has been observed historically), while remaining ambitious. The magnitude to which we either increased or decreased parameters was in line with historically high performing countries (see the “justification” column in Appendix A).  2.2.3 Evaluation indicators The nine SDG indicators explored in this paper are listed in Table 2  . These indicators were selected for consistency with earlier work assessing the world’s progression towards the SDGs (Moyer, Hedden under review) and represent a cross-section of the SDGs related to human development. They cover broad aspects of human development (health, education, income). Some are measures of success in top-down policies (government spending on schools, infrastructure) and others are more general outcome indicators of human well-being (poverty, nutrition). These indicators also impact all genders, ages, and ethnicities. The “Variable” column represents the related projected indicator in IFs. The “Target Value” column shows the threshold for identifying successful achievement of an indicator.6  6 Some SDG indicators map to more than one IFs variable (for example, SDG indicator 4.1.1). Not all Agenda 2030 goals are represented in this analysis.      3 Results This section presents evidence that 1) even the most ambitious scenario does not achieve the nine indicator target values for all countries by 2050; 2) the GT and DS scenarios are individually the most effective at achieving human development related SDGs; 3) the CC scenario does little to improve development relative to the CP; 4) the Combined Intervention improves outcomes broadly, suggesting that these development pathways should be pursued simultaneously; 5) some regions lag behind even in the most ambitious scenarios (sub-Saharan Africa, for example); 6) some indicators are more easily achieved (poverty, for example) than others (lower secondary education completion, for example); 7) some indicators are poorly responsive to different pathways; and 8) a long time-horizon is useful in analyzing the impact of changing pathways on human development. Fig. 2   presents the results for each scenario for selected global indicators. GDP output is highest in the Combined scenario, followed closely by GT and DS while CC and CP track closely. Global hunger is reduced most rapidly in Combined and DS, followed by GT and CC. The share of global population living in poverty declines most rapidly in Combined and DS in the short run, with GT showing strong improvements in the long run and CC improving poverty relative to CP. Carbon emissions are lower in Combined, and are followed by CC, DS, and GT relative to the CP to 2030. By 2050, however, DS and GT show greater reductions relative to CC or CP. Global results for target value achievement for SDGs are summarized in Table 3  . Across the nine human development indicators modeled here for 186 countries, 45 percent of target values were achieved by 2015 (many high-income countries have already achieved many SDGs). Along the CP the number of country-SDGs achieved grows to 53 percent by 2030 and 68 percent by 2050. We find that all three alternative pathways improve the ability for countries to achieve individual SDGs relative to the CP. However, none of the three scenarios provides a sufficient level of change to meet all nine human development related SDG targets in each country by either 2030 or 2050. By 2050 each alternative scenarios achieves more country-SDGs when compared with the CP. GT leads the way with 84 percent of target values achieved by 2050 followed closely by DS, with 78 percent of target values achieved. These results demonstrate that pathways characterized by more rapid technology diffusion as well as effective governance solving local problems are two development trajectories that improve both environmental outcomes and human development related to our current development trajectory. The CC scenario reduces individual consumption patterns and is a good pathway for sustainable environmental development (as clearly represented in the Rio + research) but it significantly underperforms both the DS and GT scenarios on achieving human development. The CC scenario shows only modest improvement relative to the CP by 2050, increasing the number of target values achieved from 68 percent in the CP to 69 percent in the CC. Reducing consumption leads to limited growth in productivity and technological advancement which is responsible for limited progress towards achieving human development related SDGs. This suggests that reduced individual human consumption will have little impact on achieving human development related SDGs beyond a baseline scenario in the medium term. Though none of these interventions in isolation achieve all of the SDG target values explored in this paper for all countries, combining the interventions across the three scenarios leads to higher levels of country-level SDG target value achievement than any of the three scenarios individually. This suggests that the different pathways proposed in previous research can be pursued simultaneously to improve human development outcomes. Combining interventions leads to 63 percent of target values achieved by 2030 and 89 percent achieved by 2050, a significant improvement over the CP of development and a broad-based step towards sustainable human development. While global target value achievement stands at 89 percent in a combined intervention by 2050, in some regions and for some issue areas, development lags significantly behind full target value achievement. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, undernutrition is projected to persist even in this most ambitious scenario. The lower secondary education attainment indicator target is not achieved in East, Central, North, and Western Africa, Central America, and West Asia, reflecting the long time lags associated with required prior development of primary education. Access to improved sanitation lags behind access to safe water in some areas as well, reflecting a set of historical development preferences whereby access to safe water has been prioritized ahead of sanitation. Finally, access to electricity lags in East and Central Africa, reflecting the challenges of sustainably developing infrastructure systems and the persistent problem of poverty, which is also expected to contain gaps in achievement by 2050. While overall performance across scenarios differs, so does achievement across individual indicators. Some indicators show great potential for improved development. In the Combined scenario, four indicator target values are achieved in over 70 percent of countries by 2030: poverty, child mortality, primary school completion and safe water access. Other indicators lag behind. For example, nearly half of countries do not achieve the hunger, lower secondary completion, access to sanitation, and underweight children targets even in the most ambitious scenario by 2030. Poor achievement of lower secondary completion targets reflects the structural character of education systems: solving secondary education requires completely filling the primary education pipeline first. Poor performance in sanitation reflects human preference seen in data: humans tend to prefer improving water access before sanitation. Some indicators show limited growth in target value achievement across scenarios to 2030. The best and worst performing scenarios for child mortality and lower secondary enrollment only differ in the countries achieving the target value by 6 percentage points (a difference of 11 countries). Greater outcome differentiation occurs across other indicators; poverty shows the largest range in the percent of countries achieving the target value with the Combined scenario improving results by 22 percentage points (41 out of 186 countries) in 2030 relative to the worst performer, CC. This suggests that some human development related SDGs are simply harder to achieve than others with the intervention pathways we have explored here. There is greater variation in our ability to “move the needle” on extreme poverty than there is on other indicators like lower secondary enrollment or child undernutrition. However, turning to 2050, some of the indicators where progress is limited through 2030 suggest more significant progress. By 2050, the Combined scenario shows 76 percent of countries complete lower secondary education as opposed to 54 percent in the CC scenario in the same year (up from 46 percent and 40 percent respectively in 2030). This strong divergence in scenario outcomes from 2030 to 2050 suggests that long time horizons are important for understanding how different policy choices may play out in human development systems, even those that appear to be indifferent to interventions over a shorter (15-year) period (Table 4  ). 3.1 Exploring results using global population in place of country achievement The analysis to this point has been done at the country level. But how successful are these scenarios at achieving SDG targets globally? Does the geographic level of analysis matter significantly in the assessment of SDG achievement? We argue that it certainly does. Table 5   shows the gap in SDG achievement across development indicator explored here in millions of people and not share of countries who achieve specific target indicator values. For example, on a global basis by 2030 the Combined scenario projects a world in which 219 million people live in extreme poverty. That represents 2.6 percent of the projected population of 8.4 billion people at that time, crossing the target value threshold (see Table 2 ) for poverty elimination. One could take this result and conclude that there is  a plausible pathway to achieving this SDGs that does not require transformational policy change. However, when analyzed on a country basis, 20 percent (37 out of 186) of countries do not achieve the poverty threshold target in this same scenario. If we analyzed results at the global level we would come to very different conclusions about achievability compared with assessing results at a country level. A handful of countries are particularly vulnerable to developmental challenges and these individual differences can be smoothed over when using a regional or global level of analysis.7  7 For example, while southern Africa as a whole achieves a 98 percent access to safe water by 2050, 9 of the 19 countries in the region to not achieve this target in the most optimistic scenario.    3.2 Trade-offs and synergies Pursuing one SDG target can help or hurt the pursuit of others. For example, achieving hunger alleviation by increasing land under cultivation creates trade-offs that can reduce biodiversity, improving progress toward one SDG target and creating difficulties for it toward another. Alternatively, the pursuit of water and sanitation access is synergistic because it increases the ability to achieve SDG targets related to communicable disease (driving down diarrheal disease). Because of the interconnected nature of SDGs and the desire to pursue them simultaneously, the study of synergies and trade-offs has become an increasingly important research topic (Nilsson, Griggs, & Visbeck, 2016 ). While increasingly relevant, research quantifying trade-offs and synergies across SDGs has been limited. Some studies have modeled trade-offs in one SDG area (Blanchard et al., 2017 ; Obersteiner et al., 2016 ). Other studies rely on qualitative assessments of trade-offs that are then quantitatively evaluated (ICSU, 2017 ; Pradhan, Costa, Rybski, Lucht, & Kropp, 2017 ; Weitz, Carlsen, Nilsson, & Skånberg, 2017 ). Both trade-offs and synergies can result from scarcity of resources8  8 Resources are defined here in standard monetary and material terms. But resources can also be thought of more broadly to include institutional and ideational factors.   . Food and biofuel crops may compete for land and/or water, resulting in a trade-off between targets in SDG 2 (zero hunger) and 7 (affordable and clean energy) (Weitz, Nilsson, & Davis, 2014 ). Financial resources are limited, and spending more money on education reduces the availability of funding for health, for example. This can also happen within goals, as Schmidt, Gostin, and Emanuel (Schmidt, Gostin, & Emanuel, 2015 ) argue that pursuing target 3.8 (universal health coverage) could undermine targets focused on public health outcomes in part because of limited resources. Synergies can occur because the pursuit of one policy target unlock resources that were previously unavailable, creating additional space to pursue other goals. Some trade-offs and synergies result from direct and positive causal linkages across the goals (the “structure” of the system) instead of resource constraints. For instance, improving access to clean water and sanitation can simultaneously reduce child mortality. We define trade-offs in two ways. Interventions aimed at achieving one SDG target that undermine the ability to pursue a different SDG target have high pursuit trade-offs . Second, an SDG target can be harder to achieve when other goals are pursued. These SDG targets are trade-off vulnerable . The opposite of a trade-off is a synergy, and the pursuit of some SDG targets can create additional resources that facilitate the pursuit of other SDG targets. When attempting to achieve one SDG target improves other SDG targets, that SDG target has high pursuit synergies . If achievement of one SDG goal become easier as other goals are approached or achieved, that goal is synergy receptive . We created nine additional scenarios that each pursued a specific SDG target indicator in this paper (Appendix B). Table 6   summarizes the results from this exercise and compares results against CP. This table explores the impact of sectoral investment (columns) on the number of countries that make progress towards achieving the nine SDGs explored in this paper (cells) across development indicator (rows) relative to the CP in 2030. The values in cells represent the number of countries (out of 186) that see improvement (green), no significant change (yellow), or a decline (red) in the value of the projected row indicator. For example, the Cash Transfers column represents an increase in cash transfers to the poorest in society. The impact of this intervention is that 142 countries are projected to significantly reduce their extreme poverty levels, 44 countries are forecast to see no significant change, and 0 countries are forecast to increase extreme poverty. While this single intervention is positive for the alleviation of extreme poverty, it produces mixed results across the other indicator categories. This is because cash transfers draw upon other resources and make it more difficult to invest in reducing child mortality, enrolling students in education, and improving infrastructure. Of the target indicators explored here, the variables with the greatest pursuit synergies  are spending on access to water and sanitation. Investments here produces near-term virtuous cycles that directly improve economic productivity by making workers more productive but also improve longer-term productivity by reducing stunting and other health issues. They enhance government revenue by increasing economic growth and make people healthier. The interventions with the highest pursuit tradeoffs  in this modeling exercise are increasing cash transfers, subsidizing caloric demand, and reducing childhood undernutrition. These interventions reallocate resources from other sectors and have a more limited impact on improving development indicators across sectors as compared with increasing access to water and sanitation.9  9 It is important to note that it is possible to pursue achieving SDGs using alternative policies to those modeled here. That would create different trade-offs and synergies than those represented here.   Education completion (both primary and secondary) along with access to water, sanitation, and electricity are the most trade-off vulnerable . These indicators require government investment and targeted investments to improve achievement in other variables draws down resources without increasing economic growth enough to off-set these reductions. The SDG targets that are most synergy receptive  are poverty, hunger, child undernutrition, and child mortality. Each of these SDG targets represent a lack of access to basic human inputs for the most vulnerable populations. In contrast to indicators that are more driven by government intervention, these indicators may be more responsive to spill-overs from other sectors through marginal improvement driven by investment elsewhere.   4 Conclusions The SDGs are a global agreement to put the course of human development on a sustainable path. In this paper we have implemented the three “Roads from Rio+20″ pathways within the IFs model to evaluate their impact on achieving target values for human development related SDGs. We found that each of these pathways can improve the course of human development relative to the baseline trajectory. In both the DS and GT scenarios, sustainable human development pushes forward much faster than the CP. Pursuing development strategies that attempt to harness technology and effective local governance for development should be priorities for any SDG achievement agenda. The CC scenario did not significantly improve these human development SDG indicators relative to the CP by 2030, and only modestly improves outcomes by 2050. While this scenario does improve environmental outcomes, it simply does not produce the economic growth needed to draw hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. While the CC scenario in isolation does not produce enough to solve global extreme poverty, the Combined Scenario shows that individual consumption reduction in conjunction with other policies that promote technology and good governance can produce synergies that broadly enhance development while also being sensitive to environmental systems. When assessing the achievement of SDGs on a global level, it appears that we are not very far from achieving many SDG targets, especially if we properly prioritize development strategies. The combined intervention scenario, for example, achieves an extreme poverty target value threshold (as a share of the projected global population) of less than 3 percent by 2030. However, when measuring the same target (less than 3 percent in extreme poverty) at the country level, only 80 percent of countries achieve the SDG target and 37 fall short. The unit of analysis matters significantly in the assessment of development target achievement and these 37 most vulnerable countries (MVCs) should be the target of transformative policy intervention. Modeling development at the country unit of analysis also highlights synergies and trade-offs that require further investigation and understanding. Some development objectives are difficult to achieve in the near or medium term because they require prior achievement in other targets. For example, lower secondary education completion requires a country to have a primary education pipeline filled with students ready to graduate. Targets on other development indicators are more challenging to achieve because they are driven by persistent problems driven by conflict and poor governance that are not fully addressed in these pathways and remain challenges globally. This modelling effort demonstrates that if interventions are constrained using historically high performing countries as benchmarks (see Appendix A), then none of these pathways can achieve the human development related SDGs in all countries by 2030 or 2050. If the international community remains committed to achieving these goals, transformational policymaking is required. When assessed on a country basis, some can achieve the SDGs using historically high performing countries as benchmark examples in scaling policy interventions. But the country level analysis also highlights a problem with achieving SDGs in some of the most vulnerable countries. This group of states should be the focus of development assistance and must be the focal point of transformational policies meant to improve the human condition. The character of this transformation is yet to be determined, but this research shows the importance of using integrated assessment tools with more attention to human development, and model disaggregation to the national level to better understand how different systems interact and unfold. Integrated assessment models allow for better informed decisions that empower countries, civil society, and international organizations to coordinate strategies to more effectively set and pursue development goals. Future research should extend these tools and further integrate them across human, natural, and social systems, enhancing their ability to evaluate the impact of tradeoffs and synergies across all SDG indicators.

The Lancet  386  August (9996) 2015  928 930       Jonathan D. Moyer  is Assistant Professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies and Director of the Frederick S. Pardee Center for International Futures, home of the International Futures (IFs) integrated assessment platform. His work is focused on three core areas related to long-term policy analysis and forecasting: strategic planning, data and tool creation, and the study of state fragility. As Director, Jonathan leads the Pardee Center’s research team, which uses long-term, integrated policy analysis and forecasting methods to inform the strategic planning efforts of governments, international organizations, and corporations around the world. Recent projects include trends reports, scenario analyses, trainings and IFs development for sponsors such as USAID, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the UN Development Program, the Atlantic Council, Zurich Insurance, the Western Cape provincial government of South Africa, and Arrow Electronics. As part of the Pardee Center’s Diplometrics project, he also oversees the creation of new data and tools that allow for better long-term analysis in international relations. These data and tools, such as Diplodash or the DataGator, have been used to produce publications such as the US National Intelligence Council Global Trends 2030 report. As an extension to his work with IFs, Jonathan also researches the impact of developmental imbalances on state failure and fragility, and acts as Lead Co-PI on a five-year Minerva-funded research grant on this topic that began in the fall of 2014. Jonathan has been working with IFs since he started his MA program at the University of Denver in the fall of 2005. In addition to organizations listed above, he has consulted for the European Commission, Government of Kosovo, Government of Slovenia, Institute for Security Studies, and United States Institute of Peace.  David K. Bohl  began working with the Pardee Center in the summer of 2012, when he was a graduate student at Korbel. Since then, he has consulted with several organizations, including the Peruvian Strategic Planning Center (CEPLAN), the Atlantic Council’s Strategic Foresight Initiative, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), USAID, the Western Cape Provincial Government of South Africa, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). He has been fundamental to the development a variety of newer sub-models in IFs, including those that forecast the informal economy, bilateral trade, and ICT, and has pioneered the use of network analysis at the center. He also oversees the ongoing development of our crowd-sourced data analytics platform called Data Gator.
