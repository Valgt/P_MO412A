                  Due to lack of understanding about the different conditions of sanitation systems and complexity, mostly in Asia and Africa, the occurrence of unsafely managed sanitation still exists, leading to severe environmental and health impacts. Because of the complexity of this problem, machine learning tools were applied to develop an effective model for health protection and safe sanitation management as a promising way to approach sustainable development goals. This study aimed to examine the incidences of ineffective sanitation management on the prevalence of diarrhea infections using machine learning tools. The prevailing conditions for safely sanitation management were identified, and the effective model to protect the impacts of ineffective sanitation management on the prevalence of diarrhea infections was proposed. Based on information collected from about 1000 households with relatively high diarrhea infections during the period of 2017–2021, factors relating to sanitation facilities for health protection and safe sanitation management were examined. Diarrhea infections and no diarrhea infection were recognized based on actual conditions of the surveyed households and incidences from ground-based observation. Classification tree model as J48 in WEKA was applied for analytic predictive tool using 70:30 ratio of training and validating dataset. The findings showed that the tree model obtained from the training data was with 73% accuracy prediction, while that from the validation data was with 70% accuracy. The correlation of personal hygiene (such as washing hand before meal and drinking water from natural water sources) and sanitation facilities (such as open defecation and distance from on-site sanitation facilities to open drains or storm sewer) was significant with inverse relationship for safely sanitation management and public health protection.

Several studies nowadays recognize the applications of machine learning tools to increase the power of near-term prediction and to generate optimal conditions for sanitation management development (Al-Refaie et al., 2020 ; Ayeleru et al., 2012 ; Cubillos, 2020 ; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2020 ). Abbasi and ElHanandeh (2016)  applied artificial intelligence for municipal solid waste generation forecasting, and Kannangara et al. (2018)  developed machine learning to predict the incidences of municipal solid waste generation in Canada. Li et al. (2020)  utilized 57 studies published during the period of 2000–2019 relating to information technologies for waste management application. A similar study was mentioned by Ye et al. (2020) , which stated the several artificial intelligence models for waste management. Being a crucial aspect in achieving the SDG6 targets, sanitation management has garnered heightened attention. In this context, predictive models can play a pivotal role in examining the incidences of ineffective sanitation management and its impact on the prevalence of fecal pathogen infections. Ineffectiveness in sanitation management encompasses various aspects of sanitation, including the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste, as well as the provision of hygiene practices. Ineffective sanitation management may arise from issues such as poor infrastructure, insufficient resources, lack of proper planning, or failure to enforce regulations. Several published studies have documented shortages of decentralized management practices which mainly focused on household-level inventories of latrine services (Jayathilake et al., 2019 ; Mills et al., 2018 ; Weststrate et al., 2019 ), but ignoring the access to ensure safe sanitation management and prevent fecal pathogen infections. In urban Thailand, for example, 100% of people in urban areas have access to basic sanitation facilities such as latrine facilities, but only 20% of the faecal sludge (FS) generated from decentralized systems are safely managed (Koottatep et al., 2021a,b ; WHO/UNICEF, 2021 ). These challenges persist, posing a significant hurdle to the attainment of SDG6 targets in various countries. These problems are still a challenge towards achieving the SDG6 targets in various countries (such as Ethiopia, Cambodia, India, Nepal, and Vietnam), resulting in outbreaks of diseases such as diarrhea infections and contamination of the water resources (Dearden et al., 2017 ; National Planning Comission, 2015 ; United Nations MDG Monitor, 2017 ). At present, there are lack of applications of machine learning tools to assess the factors affecting the prevalence of faecal pathogen infections, such as distance from on-site sanitation facilities to open drains or storm sewer for faecal pathogen protection and safe sanitation management. Although there are several factors affecting sanitation management practices, modeled relationships between each factor on the prevalence of faecal pathogen infections are not available yet. In this aspect, with the demand for health risk protection and safe sanitation management, machine learning tools were developed to examine the incidences of ineffective sanitation management on the prevalence of diarrhea infections.  2 Research methodology Although there is a large number of studies on factors affecting prevalence of faecal pathogen infections in different cities worldwide (Freeman et al., 2017 ; Penakalapati et al., 2017 ; Taweesan et al., 2015a ; 2015b ; Wolf et al., 2019 ; Yoshida et al., 2019 ), there are no predictive models addressing the relationships between each factor on the prevalence of these faecal pathogen infections. Reliable model prediction of sanitation management to improve sanitation facilities is very important towards achieving the SDG6 goals. In this study, a machine learning tool which is a classification tree model was applied to find an appropriate model to protect the environmental and health risk impacts of ineffective sanitation management. 2.1 Study area (Thamlot city, Pangmapha District, Mae Hong Son province) The study area for this study encompasses Thamlot City in Pangmapha District, Mae Hong Son Province, situated in the northern regions of Thailand, as illustrated in Fig. 1  . Thamlot City was chosen as the focal point due to its significance in reflecting the sanitation management practices and associated health risks prevalent in this specific geographic location. The region has experienced a notable surge in diarrhea infections, particularly between 2017 and 2021, with a heightened occurrence during the rainy season (Department of Disease Control, 2020 ). General information about Thamlot city, Pangmapha District in Mae Hong Son province is given in Table 1  . The decision to select approximately 1000 households for data collection was determined as detailed below (Mensah, 2014 ).n = Z 2    *   p  ( 1   *     − p  )  E 2       Where: n is the required sample size. Z is the Z-value corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence). p is the estimated proportion of the population with the characteristic of interest (0.5 for maximum variability). E is the margin of error (precision) desired for the estimate (0.3).  2.2 Data collection Data related to sanitation management areas, crucial for health risk protection and the promotion of safe sanitation practices spanning from containment to treatment, were sourced from published literature (Arphacharus, 2016 ; Baraki et al., 2019 ; Department of Disease Control, 2020 ) and key informant interviews. These informants included central government authorities, local government authorities, and private FSM companies. The gathered information covered various aspects: (i) containment, such as the proximity of on-site sanitation facilities to open drains or storm sewers, the types of sanitation facilities, and instances of open defecation; (ii) emptying and transport, including the frequency of FS collection services, number of vacuum trucks, and the number of households connected to sewerage systems or local sewers per city; (iii) treatment facilities, encompassing the type and capacity of sanitation treatment facilities; and (iv) personal hygiene practices, such as handwashing before meals, consumption of treated water, and the sourcing of drinking water from natural water sources. The instances of diarrhea in this study were obtained from the Sub-district Health Promotion Hospital in Tham Lot City and were compared with the recent nationwide survey conducted by the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand spanning from 2017 to 2021. The majority of the data were derived from field investigations, consultations with key informants, and the questionnaire survey conducted in the study area from January to June 2021. A total of 1000 questionnaires were specifically distributed to community leaders; then, filled-in questionnaires were collected two months after the distribution date. In addition to the questionnaire survey, data were gathered through field investigations and key informant interviews. The key informants contributing to this study included administrators (27 or 19%), utilities providers (8 or 5%), local leaders (14 or 10%), concerned households (55 or 39%), and others (38 or 27%). Administrators, such as central government authorities and local government authorities (e.g., municipality), are actively engaged in FSM services, with the municipality playing a pivotal role in providing FSM facilities as part of sanitation management areas. Utilities providers typically participate through contractual arrangements. Local leaders, concerned households, and others (e.g. village health volunteers, and NGOs) have played essential roles in participating and supporting FSM services. The analysis of the relationship between FSM and the occurrence of diarrhea involves investigating the presence of Salmonella  spp. in various containment systems (such as septic tanks and cesspools), vacuum trucks, sanitation treatment facilities, and natural water sources. Salmonella  spp. serves as a pertinent indicator in the analysis of the connection between waste management practices and the incidence of diarrhea due to its pathogenic nature, fecal-oral transmission, and its ability to reflect contamination in diverse environmental settings (Fuhrimann et al., 2015 ; Fukushi et al., 2003 ; Manga et al., 2021 ). The detection of Salmonella  spp. in containment systems, vacuum trucks, sanitation treatment facilities, and natural water sources offers insights into the effectiveness of waste management strategies and potential public health risks associated with inadequate sanitation. For Salmonella  spp. analysis, monthly water sampling was conducted for containment systems (such as septic tanks and cesspools), vacuum trucks, and natural water sources, spanning from February to June 2021. In household containment systems, 20 samples were directly collected from the effluent in containment systems, ensuring representation from different households. Additionally, 10 samples were collected directly from the tanks of FS vacuum trucks operating in Thamlot City, capturing variations in content during routine operations. Thirty samples were collected from natural water sources at upstream, midstream and downstream at a depth of 30 cm. All samples were collected using sterilized 500 mL bottles. The collected bottle samples were promptly transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 °C. Subsequent microbiological analysis was conducted within 8 h of sample collection, employing a modified APHA standard method for Salmonella  spp. recovery from both water and FS samples (APHA, 2017 ). The comprehensive approach aimed to provide a detailed understanding of Salmonella  spp. prevalence dynamics and its correlation with sanitation practices in Thamlot City, as depicted in Fig. 2   of the research conceptual framework.  2.3 Data analysis Descriptive statistics were applied and generated for preliminary evaluation of current sanitation practices along with the sanitation service chain from containment to treatment. Machine learning technique which is the classification tree model (J48) in WEKA was applied using 70:30 ratio of training and validating data. This split strikes a balance between providing enough data for the model to learn patterns effectively and reserving a subset for independent validation. This approach prevents potential overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. The choice of a common split ratio like 70:30 is practical, efficient, and aligns with standard practices, making it a straightforward yet effective method for evaluating the performance of the classification model on both training and validation datasets. In this study, supervised data (or labeled data), encompassing instances of both diarrhea infections (categorized as “Yes”) and the absence of diarrhea infection (categorized as “No”), along with influencing factors like personal hygiene and sanitation facilities, were utilized as inputs for constructing an effective model. The aim was to employ a supervised learning approach in machine learning, specifically a classification tree model (J48) in WEKA, to correlate instances of ineffective sanitation management with the prevalence of diarrhea infections. By leveraging this labeled dataset, the model is trained to discern patterns and associations between influencing factors and the occurrence of diarrhea infections, ultimately providing insights into the impact of sanitation practices on public health in Thamlot City.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Current status of sanitation facilities in Thamlot city, Pangmapha District, Mae Hong Son province The status of sanitation practices from containment to treatment of about 1000 households in Thamlot city, Pangmapha District, Mae Hong Son Province is illustrated in Fig. 3  . About 1% of the surveyed households still practiced open defecation, while 99% employed on-site sanitation systems to treat toilet wastewaters. Only 1% of the FS generated from on-site sanitation systems was emptied by unlicensed informal operators who subsequently dumped the collected FS to the nearby environment. More than 90% of the FS (69% from supernatant and 29% from solids) were not emptied, but were connected or overflowed to nearby open drains or local sewers. This result implied that safely managed sanitation was still a challenge to achieve the SDG6 targets and affecting the prevalence of diarrhea infections. Similar results by Koottatep et al., 2021a,b  reported that unsafely managed FS, unsafe drinking water, and poor personal hygiene had direct impacts on the prevalence of faecal pathogen infections such as diarrhea and liver fluke infections.  3.2 Impact of unsafe management of fecal sludge on the prevalence of diarrheal infections in Thamlot city, Mae Hong Son province The prevalence of Salmonella  spp. across various sources, including containment systems (such as septic tanks and cesspools), vacuum trucks, and natural water sources, is summarized in Table 2  . The results reveal that all 20 samples collected from households exhibited a Salmonella  spp. prevalence of approximately 60% in the collected samples before direct discharge into nearby storm drains or watercourses. This indicates a considerable presence of Salmonella  spp. in the collected samples from household effluent. From the survey results, the majority utilized one cesspool and soakage pits (70%) and pit latrines (29%). Additionally, it was observed that wastewater discharge from cesspools in all households followed a direct infiltration into the soil, potentially leading to direct environmental contamination with pollutants. The findings underscore the potential risk of contamination when such effluent is discharged directly into the surrounding environment, emphasizing the importance of effective FSM practices to mitigate public health risks associated with waterborne pathogens like Salmonella  spp. These results were confirmed by Adhikari et al. (2017)  and Taweesan et al. (2015a,b) , who emphasized the necessity of safe sanitation management from containment to adequate treatment facilities for achieving sustainable development targets. The prevalence of Salmonella  spp. in the vacuum truck samples is approximately 40% based on 10 samples. This finding implies that there might be a potential source or pathway for Salmonella  spp. contamination associated with the use of these trucks in collecting FS. This could be due to various factors such as inadequate cleaning and sanitation of the trucks, cross-contamination during the collection process, or other operational practices that contribute to the persistence and spread of Salmonella  spp. Additionally, addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring the safety of both the workers involved in FSM and the broader community, as Salmonella  spp. poses a potential health risk when present in the environment (Lindberg and Rost, 2018 ; Sabogal et al., 2014 ). Samples of natural water source were collected from three distinct locations along the Mae Lang River in the administrative region of Thamlot City, encompassing upstream, midstream, and downstream areas. The Mae Lang River, being a crucial water source for community consumption, was chosen for this sampling. The analysis for Salmonella  spp. indicated infection rates of 30%, 20%, and 50% at the upstream, midstream, and downstream locations, respectively. Notably, the highest prevalence of Salmonella  spp. was observed at the downstream site, suggesting a potential link to the accumulation and contamination of waterborne pathogens as the water progresses downstream. Additional insights from the survey indicate a correlation between the detection of Salmonella  spp. at the downstream area of the Mae Lang River and the prevailing water flow direction in the administrative region of Thamlot City. This correlation underscores the importance of understanding water dynamics in relation to pathogen distribution, providing valuable insights for targeted water quality management strategies in the area (Weldeyohannes et al., 2016 ).  3.3 Effective sanitation management model An effective sanitation management model was developed in this study and tested with actual data of about 1000 households having different sanitation practices in Thamlot city, Mae Hong Son Province. The incidences of ineffective sanitation management on the prevalence of diarrhea infections were utilized in developing the effectiveness model by using machine learning technique as shown in Fig. 4  . It can be seen that the correlation of personal hygiene (such as washing hand before meal and drinking water from natural water sources) and sanitation facilities (such as open defecation and distance from on-site sanitation facilities to open drains or storm sewer) was significant with inverse relationship. Among the 765 cases of contact with FS (personal hygiene), 218 cases were the wrong prediction while the rest (547) were the right prediction of having diarrhea infections (“Yes”). If personal hygiene has no contact with FS, the prediction could be made into two categories which are: (1) if water consumption is unsafe (consume drinking water and use water supply from natural water sources without any treatment), it will be predicted as diarrhea infections (48 wrong cases of total 163 cases) and (2) if water consumption is safe, the prediction will consider the status of open defecation. If open defecation is no, the prediction will be made into two categories which are: (1) if distance from on-site sanitation facilities to open drains or storm sewer is less than or equal to 200 m, it will be predicted as diarrhea infections (12 wrong cases of total 28 cases) and (2) if distance of on-site sanitation facilities into open drains or storm sewer is more than 200 m, it will be predicted as no diarrhea infections (“No”) (11 wrong cases of total 21 cases). Lastly, if open defecation is yes, it will be predicted as diarrhea infections (14 wrong cases of total 23 cases). From the model performance, the accuracy of model prediction was 73% while precision and recall were 76% and 70%, respectively. Precision is the percentage of correct prediction (predicted and actual diarrhea infections) to the total predicted diarrhea infections while recall is the percentage of correct prediction (predicted and actual diarrhea infections) to the total actual diarrhea infections. The model was tested with the validation data and resulting in the accuracy of 70%. With these accuracies, this tree model could be used to identify conditions to achieve effective sanitation management practices in the study area which should be applicable to other areas having similar sanitation facilities conditions. From the survey results, the most prevalent on-site sanitation systems in the study areas (more than 90%) were cesspools, a large of number of these systems are located closely to water courses (less than 200 m). Most of untreated FS is directly discharged into watercourses or open drains. Households who consumed drinking water and used water supply from natural water sources without any treatment had high potentials for the prevalence of diarrhea infections. From the classification tree model prediction (Fig. 4 ), it is clear that improved personal hygiene and designing appropriate on-site sanitation systems are strongly recommended to reduce the prevalence of diarrhea infections. To address these problems, distance from on-site sanitation facilities into open drains or storm sewer should be more than 200 m to prevent infections of water-borne diseases and natural water sources contamination (UN-HABITAT, 2018 ). These findings were confirmed by UNICEF (2021)  who documented that, to achieve the SDG6 targets, personal hygiene and safely managed sanitation facilities from containment to treatment should be considered. Similar results by Bindra et al. (2021)  and Koottatep et al. (2021a,b)  confirmed that the prevalence of diarrhea infections was correlated with a lack of personal hygiene and safely managed sanitation.   4 Conclusions Based on data collected from approximately 1000 households, key performance interviews, and field investigations, we identified ineffective sanitation management in the selected city, posing a challenge to achieving sustainable development goals. Results of disease transmission pathways in household FS containment, treatment facilities, and natural water sources reveal interconnections among these environmental settings. The prevalence of Salmonella  spp. in collected samples was 60%, 40%, and 50% for households, vacuum trucks, and downstream natural water sources, respectively. This finding underscores the association between waterborne pathogen prevalence and natural water sources, emphasizing targeted water quality management for consumption. To mitigate the impacts of ineffective sanitation management, a machine learning model was employed. Using the WEKA data mining tool and a training dataset, a classification tree model was developed, achieving a 73% accuracy rate in predicting diarrhea infection, with precision and recall rates of 76% and 70%, respectively. This model underscores the significance of personal hygiene and appropriate on-site sanitation systems in mitigating the prevalence of diarrhea infections. It identifies key factors such as safe water consumption, distance from on-site sanitation facilities to open drains, and the practice of open defecation. The prevalence of cesspools in close proximity to watercourses highlights the urgency of addressing these issues to prevent untreated FS discharge into natural water sources. These findings align with global initiatives, emphasizing the importance of personal hygiene and safely managed sanitation facilities to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 targets. Recommended measures include improved personal hygiene practices, strategic design of on-site sanitation systems, and ensuring a distance of more than 200 m from such facilities to open drains or storm sewers to prevent water contamination. However, additional research is required to investigate the factors influencing the model accuracy. The acquired model should be employed across various domains to explore and expand the potential applications of the proposed analysis.
