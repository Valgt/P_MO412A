                  The growth of global population continuously increases the demands for agroforestry-derived products, underpinning a sustainable growth of energy matrix in the sectors of food security, transportation, and industrial is momentous. The high demand for the sustainable energy sources has led to an increase in the application of pesticides associated with growing crops for the production of biofuel. In 2019, the global consumption of pesticides was 4.2 million tonnes. Case studies on life cycle assessment (LCA) of pesticides showed that toxicity is the major severe impact of pesticide usage, contributing to human toxicity (∼70%) and freshwater eco-toxicity (>50%). This alarming situation needs a solution as conventional pesticides pose various negative impacts to human and the environment, rendering the biofuel production process unsustainable. In this review, we focus on the interaction between pesticide use, biofuel production, food security for a sustainable balancing in between government benefits, environmental, and human health, aiming to track the implications and impact to the global efforts towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Even though, there are strict government regulations and legislations pertaining to pesticide use, and policies devised as guidelines for agroforestry sectors to implement and monitor these measures, the discrepancies still exist in between national and supranational entities. To cater the above issue, many efforts have been made to upscale the biofuel production, for example, the United States, Brazil, China and Indonesia have ventured into biofuels production from non-food-crops based feedstock while other developing nations are rapidly catching up. In this perspective, a sustainable nexus between Biofuels-Pesticides-Agroforestry (BPA) is essential to create a sustainable roadmap toward the UN SDGs, to fulfilling the energy, food, and land security. The contribution of technologies in BPA includes genetic modified crops, integrated pest and weed management with controlled release pesticides, use of nano-biopesticides is being reviewed. As a whole, the concept of biofuel processing complex (BPC) and farmers upskilling, together with the effective implementation of efficient policies and Internet of Things (IoT) would be the key to drive the BPA nexus towards fulfilment of SDGs.

The growth of global population continuously increases the demands for agroforestry-derived products, underpinning a sustainable growth of energy matrix in the sectors of food security, transportation, and industrial is momentous. The high demand for the sustainable energy sources has led to an increase in the application of pesticides associated with growing crops for the production of biofuel. In 2019, the global consumption of pesticides was 4.2 million tonnes. Case studies on life cycle assessment (LCA) of pesticides showed that toxicity is the major severe impact of pesticide usage, contributing to human toxicity (∼70%) and freshwater eco-toxicity (>50%). This alarming situation needs a solution as conventional pesticides pose various negative impacts to human and the environment, rendering the biofuel production process unsustainable. In this review, we focus on the interaction between pesticide use, biofuel production, food security for a sustainable balancing in between government benefits, environmental, and human health, aiming to track the implications and impact to the global efforts towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Even though, there are strict government regulations and legislations pertaining to pesticide use, and policies devised as guidelines for agroforestry sectors to implement and monitor these measures, the discrepancies still exist in between national and supranational entities. To cater the above issue, many efforts have been made to upscale the biofuel production, for example, the United States, Brazil, China and Indonesia have ventured into biofuels production from non-food-crops based feedstock while other developing nations are rapidly catching up. In this perspective, a sustainable nexus between Biofuels-Pesticides-Agroforestry (BPA) is essential to create a sustainable roadmap toward the UN SDGs, to fulfilling the energy, food, and land security. The contribution of technologies in BPA includes genetic modified crops, integrated pest and weed management with controlled release pesticides, use of nano-biopesticides is being reviewed. As a whole, the concept of biofuel processing complex (BPC) and farmers upskilling, together with the effective implementation of efficient policies and Internet of Things (IoT) would be the key to drive the BPA nexus towards fulfilment of SDGs.

Current global crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict also serve as a reminder of the risks if we continue to rely on depletable energy sources (Hosseini, 2022 ). An equally important aspect accompanying the energy transition is the storage of renewable energy in various forms (Kalair et al., 2021 ). In this regard, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is an important aspiration and commitment set forth to achieve the said objectives. In realizing SDGs, biofuel or bioenergy is seen as a promising pathway to reduce the heavy dependence on fossil fuels, while promoting efficient valorization of resources/waste and circular economy (Brandão et al., 2021 ). For this purpose, agroforestry has been perceived as a feasible win-win solution for sustainable food and energy security (Sharma et al., 2016 ). Studies of agroforest residues conversion to biofuels and value-added products have been reported using a variety of technologies such as gasification (Ferreira et al., 2021c ), hydrothermal carbonization (Mendoza Martinez et al., 2021 ; Murillo et al., 2021a , 2021b ) and extraction (Jablonský et al., 2018 ). However, in the process of agroforestry cultivation and plantation, large quantities of pesticides will be used which causes serious environmental and human threats (Zhu et al., 2020 ). Compared to 1990, the global consumption of pesticides had elevated by >50% in 2010, and registered 4.2 million tonnes in 2019, which composed of 53% herbicides, 22% fungicides and bactericides, 17% insecticides and 8% remaining pesticides (Rasool et al., 2022 ). Hence, the use of conventional pesticides is not sustainable in the context of biofuel production from agroforestry wastes. This has led to a complication in which trade-offs and sustainable balance (nexus) need to be accomplished between the unsustainable use of conventional pesticides in agroforestry plantation and the production of biofuel from these wastes (Fig. 1  ). Besides, other environmental aspects associated with biofuel production, such as land use change (Austin et al., 2022 ), freshwater quality and soil organic carbon (Zhao et al., 2020 ) and mineral resources depletion (Lecksiwilai and Gheewala, 2020 ), have been investigated by scientists and policy makers. As such, the biofuels-pesticides-agroforestry (BPA) nexus creates a critical influence in the attainment of relevant UN SDGs, outlined as Good health and well-being (3rd SDG), Clean water and sanitation (6th SDG), Affordable and clean energy (7th SDG), Climate action (13th SDG), and Life on land (15th SDG) (United Nations, 2015 ). Several prior articles in the literature have addressed the complications and relationship between food security, agriculture and land use. Bahar et al. (2020)  examined the future food demand in 2050 and the associated impacts of extensive land use/deforestation for agricultural crop production on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global temperature. Subsequently, a decarbonization framework to lower the GHG emissions in the development of agriculture, forestry and land use was proposed by Svensson et al. (2021) . While these articles addressed the issues associated with the agriculture, land use and climate change trilemma, another significant inter-relationship between biofuels, pesticides and agroforestry is seemingly in need of scrutinization, as such subject matter is still lacking amidst the global energy transition. Furthermore, aside from the resulting impacts of agroforestry-induced deforestation and land use on GHG emissions, pesticide use also poses other impacts on human and environment. This review article aims to highlight and address several critical aspects of BPA nexus in the pursuit of UN SDGs, which cater to a wide spectrum of readers including researchers, academicians, engineers, environmentalists, industrialists, agriculturalists, as well as policy and decision makers. The main objectives of this article are (i) to present an overview of the current trends and inter-relationship with respect to the BPA nexus including the use of various conventional pesticides in agroforestry linked to the production of biofuels, (ii) to review on relevant global policies and their roles in regulating pesticides usage and biofuels production and (iii) to discuss and propose the roles of pesticide technology innovation and relevant management practices to balance the BPA nexus as a pathway towards SDGs fulfilment. The overview of types of pesticide commonly used in agroforestry cultivation globally are firstly presented (Section 2 ), followed by a discussion on the global policies and legislations/regulations associated with pesticide use (Section 3 ), pesticides in life cycle assessments (LCAs) perspective (Section 4 ), biofuel production and policies introduced in the US, Brazil, China and Indonesia (Section 5 ), then the recent advancements and frontier of green nano pesticides use in agroforestry (Section 6 ). Lastly, the sustainable nexus between BPA, its alignment with the UN SDGs and future considerations/outlooks are put forward (Section 7 ).  2 Types of pesticides The application of pesticides is dated back to around Second World War, where it was used to treat farm fields for various agricultural pests including insects and plants (Weddle et al., 2009 ). Its utilization has increased by 170% in the period 1960–1980 and peaked in 1980s (Ritter, 2009 ). From 1998, pesticide use continued to increase until 2007, and declined until 2015, after which the trend oscillated (Zhang, 2018 ). China is the largest pesticides producer, and China has banned some highly toxic and residual pesticides since 2007, thus leading to a decrease in pesticides use. In 2015, China promoted reduction and efficiency enhancement of pesticides use and launched zero growth action, consequently increasing the pesticides usage after 2015. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), pesticides are harmful to non-target living organisms, including insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, and fungicides (USEPA, 2013 ). The main compounds of insecticides and herbicides, including aldicarb, carbofuran, chlordane, alachlor and atrazine, are well-known to be harmful to human health (USEPA, 2019 ). For example, aldicarb causes hormonal disorders and skin diseases; carbofuran is associated with various reproductive disorders and endocrine diseases; chlordane has shown adverse effects on human liver, alachlor is linked to the formation of lung and liver tumours; while atrazine negatively affect human reproductive organs, liver and kidney (Sánchez et al., 2020 ). Pesticides are classified into homogeneous and heterogeneous types. Heterogeneous pesticides include suspension concentrate (SC), emulsifiable concentrate (EC), oil dispersion (OD), microemulsion (ME), suspoemulsion (SE), and capsule suspension (CS) while homogeneous pesticides include granules (GR), wettable powder (WP), water dispersible granule (WDG). Table 1   shows the benefits and drawbacks of several pesticides. GR, WP, SC, EC, OD are traditional methods used to prepare pesticides, while ME, SE, CS and WDG have been modified in terms on the solubility, stability, combination of different active ingredients, and release rate of the active ingredient. The preparation of pesticides via  traditional methods poses disadvantages such as a) difficulty in handling (transportation and mixing), b) toxicity that poses health risk to workers, and c) being non-environmentally friendly. For example, preparation of pesticides in the form of WP causes inhalation risk to the operator, while EC is easily absorbed through the skin. Modification on the traditional method such as CS can control and delay the release of active ingredients in the pesticides, while WDG is a dust-free formulation which reduces the inhalation hazard, thus safeguarding the operator's good health, aligning with the 3rd SDG goal (Good health and well-being).  3 Legislation of pesticides The development of pesticide technology has rapidly enhanced the agricultural activities in European countries. An analysis conducted by Kristoffersen et al. (2008)  on the use of herbicide for weed control in European countries (e.g., Latvia, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, United Kingdom, Finland and Netherlands) revealed that different countries have different political interests and regulations on pesticide usage (Table 2  ). In Denmark, for example, leaching of pesticides into groundwater has become a major issue since most of the drinking water in the country is sourced from groundwater (Rasmussen and Højbjerg, 2002 ). Since 1996, this issue had been a hot debate among Danish political parties. Subsequently, in year 2000, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency finally enforced that no pesticides of any kind is allowed to be used on any impermeable man-made hard surfaces (Kristoffersen et al., 2008 ). Thus, herbicides are no longer allowed while alternative methods such as the use of ultraviolet to control weed, and the use of new thermal treatment equipment have been adopted instead (Andreasen et al., 1999 ). This in turn reduces the possible leaking of pesticide into groundwater and ensures a safe and clean drinking water in Denmark (6th SDG). In Sweden, one of the heavily debated issues since the 1970s was regarding the use of Agent Orange in forestry. Initially, Agent Orange was mostly applied to kill unwanted shrubs and bushes after deforestation and to control weed along railways. However, a study on Swedish water quality in the 1980s raised the alarm following the detection of pesticides in aquatic environments (ULE et al., 2002 ). Eventually, the discovery led to a ban on pesticide usage on hard surfaces or any impermeable surfaces that is not intended to bear vegetation (ULE et al., 2002 ). The increased use of insecticides and herbicides in the Netherlands back dates to the period right after Second World War. During the 1970s, the local governments were highly concerned about the side effects of pesticides. In the 1990s, the drinking water company in Werkendam was shut down for 7 weeks due to high concentrations of diuron at their intake point (Aarnink et al., 1996 ; Sluijsmans et al., 1997 ). Upon recognition of the problem, a voluntary covenant in support of the 6th SDG (Clean water and sanitation) was signed between the local government, national government and water boards in Amsterdam, Zeeland, Limburg and Friesland to reduce the use of pesticides by 45% in year 2000 and pesticide leak to the environment by 90%. Following the covenant, in 1999, the use of diuron was officially banned and the use of swath spraying for weed control was forbidden in Netherlands and other weed control technologies using sensors and selective applications were adopted instead (Kempenaar and Spijker, 2004 ). Active pesticides from the agricultural sector are frequently found in surface and groundwaters of the UK (Agency, 2006a , 2006b ). The use of pesticides in UK is regulated by several bodies such as the National Proficiency Test Council (NTPC) and British Agrochemical Standards Inspection Scheme (BASIS). The BASIS and NTPC mandate qualifications for pesticide sales, storage, and application in urban areas (Kristoffersen et al., 2008 ). In addition, the application guidelines and regulations set by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) requires approval from the Environmental Agency (EA) before application. Meanwhile, the Pesticide Safety Directorate is responsible for the registration of all pesticide use (Kristoffersen et al., 2008 ). Although there has been increasing awareness of the potential harmful effects attributed to pesticides use, herbicides are still permitted in the UK. Herbicides are allowed by the local authorities to be used for weeds removal to keep streets clean in the UK. On the other hand, non-chemical methods are rarely applied in public places due to strict requirements by the Health and Safety Executive (Kristoffersen et al., 2004 ). Germany has a set of strict provisions for pesticide use as governed by the German Plant Protection Act. The German Plant Protection Act establishes a list of active substances authorized for use on hard surfaces which include diuron, glyphosphate, flumioxazin, quinoclamin, glufosinate, acetic acid and pelargonic acid (BLV, 2006 ). Apart from the strict regulations established by the German Plant Protection Act, the Good Professional Practice requires additional personal qualification and recording when using herbicides for weed control to avoid environmental risk (BMELV, 2006 ). As a result, manual weed control techniques such as thermal weed control methods and sweeping and brushing of hard surfaces are preferred (Kristoffersen et al., 2008 ). According to Sharma et al. (2019) , there are no specific regulations responsible for the use of pesticides in Finland. However, pesticide usage in Finland is lower when compared to other European countries (Table 2 ).  4 Pesticides in life cycle assessment (LCA) perspective Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a fundamental and standard tool to systematically quantify the emission footprints and evaluate the environmental impacts of a process or product (ISO 14040, 1997 ). Herein, relevant literature on LCA of pesticide production and utilization and their overall influence in agroforestry are critically reviewed and discussed. Global warming potential (GWP) or climate change (CC) is caused by the emissions of GHGs, such as CO2 , CO, CH4  and N2 O. One of the main contributors of GHG emissions is energy/electricity generation and consumption during conventional pesticide production process, which requires intensive energy of 240 MJ to manufacture 1 kg of pesticide product (Guo et al., 2021 ), while Li et al. (2021)  reported a relatively lower energy consumption for pesticide production (i.e., 100.42 MJ/kg). However, several studies have reported that GWP/CC attributed to the production and utilization of pesticides in agroforestry are negligible, contrary to that of fertilizers (which have significant GHG footprints due to the production and application of nitrogenous fertilizers) (Guo et al., 2021 ; Schmidt Rivera et al., 2017 ). Li et al. (2021)  estimated that the GHG emissions associated with pesticide production and transportation was 18.09 kg CO2 /kg pesticide, whereas pesticide application would result in GHG emissions of 4.93 kg CO2 /kg pesticide. As compared to GWP, pesticide-induced toxicity gains research attention and is being investigated more extensively in LCA studies due to their potent impacts. Pesticides applied on crops and plantation would be emitted to air, water, soil (field emissions) and/or remained on the crops, imposing various toxicological impacts (Margni et al., 2002 ; Utomo et al., 2016 ). These toxicological impacts include human toxicity, freshwater/marine aquatic eco-toxicity and soil/terrestrial eco-toxicity (Van Zelm et al., 2014 ). Human toxicity potential (HTP) is mainly associated with the pesticide's volatilization into air and ingestion of pesticide residues. In a study performed by Guo et al. (2021) , they showed how pesticide application in cherry tomato plantation contributed to >58% of the overall human toxicity potential due to iprodione and chlorothalonil, which are the active ingredients in fungicide. Similar findings were reported by Gentil et al. (2020)  for a case study on tomato plantation, in which pesticide residues ingestion was the main contributor to HTP (68.7%), while other minor contributors included field emissions, pesticide manufacturing and pesticide spray equipment (<3% each). Ryberg et al. (2018)  enhanced the LCA computation framework further with regards to toxicity potential estimation by incorporating and considering the exposure of bystanders and community living in proximity to pesticides via  inhalation. The study found that ingestion of pesticide residues would cause a more severe HTP impact as compared to bystanders' exposure to pesticides (carbofuran and chlorothalonil intakes of ∼600–900 μg/kg pesticide applied vs. <0.1 μg/kg pesticide applied). However, upon normalization to population size, the bystanders' exposure to pesticides was higher than that of community living far from the vicinity of agriculture fields, by a few orders of magnitude (carbofuran and chlorothalonil intakes of ∼1 μg/capita.kg pesticide applied as compared to <1 × 10−8  μg/capita.kg pesticide applied). Freshwater eco-toxicity potential (FETP) is attributed to the leaching of pesticides to groundwater or surface water. As pesticides constitute both organic and metal-based substances, freshwater eco-toxicity potential is usually quantified and expressed separately with respect to organic and metal-based components. The LCA study of a cherry tomato farm revealed that chlorothalonil contributed to ∼90% of the total FETP, due to its highly toxic nature despite low emissions into the water (3%), as compared to the negligible impacts associated with metal-based substances (e.g., Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb) originated from the fertilizers used (Guo et al., 2021 ). On the contrary, Gentil et al. (2020)  reported that metal-based substances from pesticides (copper sulfate) posed higher FETP by 2 orders of magnitude, compared to organic substances such as azoxystrobin, mancozeb and lambda-cyhalothrin. In terms of contribution towards various environmental impacts, it is estimated that emissions from pesticides being the dominant factor in the context of FETP, (i.e., 45%) (Schmidt Rivera et al., 2017 ), comparable with that reported by Gentil et al. (2020)  (i.e., >50% for organic substances from pesticides). Lastly, when pesticide residues such as chlorothalonil and phoxim leach into the soil, it would cause soil toxification (Guo et al., 2021 ). As a whole, compared to other environmental impacts, pesticide use induced more severe contributions to the toxicity impacts, mainly due to the presence of toxic compounds in conventional pesticides (Fig. 2  ). Overall, it is important to note that the variability of toxicity-related environmental impacts is largely dependent on the active pesticide ingredients (Gentil et al., 2020 ), availability of site-specific data including weather and soil properties and field emissions (Schmidt Rivera et al., 2017 ), as well as the assumptions and computation algorithms used in various LCA models (Peña et al., 2019 ; Tang et al., 2020 ). Proper planning, optimization and agroforestry management involving agrochemicals selection and reduction, as well as crop selection and rotation, would reduce the negative environmental impacts of agroforestry systems (Ilari et al., 2019 ), and help to balance the BPA nexus.  5 Biofuels Biofuel, the fuel extracted from biological lignocellulosic feedstocks, gains momentum in the quest to replace global depleting fossil fuel reserves with alternative energy source that is sustainable in terms of GHG emissions while being economically feasible (Hindarso et al., 2015 ; Yusuf et al., 2011 ). The global production of biofuel has grown continuously over the years, and in 2019 the global production was 162.8 billion liters (Fig. 3  ) (IEA, 2020a ; IEA, 2020b ). The production rate dropped significantly in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic where all nations reduced the production as the demand for fuels dropped and delays in biofuel friendly policies were expected (Fig. 3 ) (IEA, 2021 ; RFA, 2021 ). Biofuels are categorized into 4 different generations based on the fuel feedstock source being edible crops (1st), non-edible crops (2nd), microalgae (3rd) and genetically modified microalgae (4th) (Mat Aron et al., 2020 ). Most biofuel productions are still dependent on the 1st and 2nd generation even though multitude of research advocate for the implementation of 3rd and 4th generation biofuels (Baudry et al., 2018 ), due to the low technology readiness level in both 3rd and 4th generation biofuels. Here, we mainly focus on the 1st generation biofuels being used on a global scale and which are derived from agro-based food crops (Alhazmi and Loy, 2021 ; Itskos et al., 2016 ). Examples of common biofuels include: a) Biodiesel, which is derived from edible oils such as rapeseed, palm, canola, soybean, and jatropha oil (Hoang and Van Le, 2017 ; Loy et al., 2019 ); b) Bioethanol, which is produced by fermenting maize grain, sugar cane, and sugar beets (Brigham and Bader, 2018 ; Mumm et al., 2014 ); and c) Biogas (mixture of CH4  and CO2 ), which is mainly produced through high temperature thermal degradation above 600 °C (Gupta et al., 2021 ; Loy et al., 2018 ). Over the years, biofuel production has increased rapidly as a sustainable and low carbon emissions alternative to dwindling petroleum fuel. As more nations pledge to reduce their GHG emissions by signing into Paris Agreement, biofuel appears to be among the attractive alternatives to achieve the required emissions reduction target. Aided by favourable policies such as financial incentives and blending mandates, biofuel production has increased rapidly in countries such as United States, Brazil, India, European nation, Malaysia, China and Indonesia (Sorda et al., 2010 ), ensuring stable energy security, safe environmental biodiversity protection and a continuous growth of socioeconomic development without jeopardizing the food security. 5.1 Biofuel production in United States The United States is a major producer of both biodiesel and bioethanol, in which the global production of bioethanol and biodiesel increases 4-folds from 35 to 135 billion liters from 2005 to 2016 (Rouhany and Montgomery, 2019 ). The production of biofuel in the U.S is saturated in the middle region with a significant increase of production (Fig. 4  ). In 2019, the biofuel consumption in the United States represented 7.3% of total transportation fuel consumption and is expected to increase over the coming years with the aid of government policies (US Energy Information Administration, 2020 ). The increase in production and demand of these biofuels was driven by Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program which was a federal policy implemented by US congress under the supervision of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as shown in Table 3   (Irwin et al., 2020 ). In 2020, Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP) with $100 million grant was made available to increase biofuel sales by aiding infrastructural expansion. With such initiative, an additional one billion gallon of ethanol will be generated in the coming five years (Pamuk and Renshaw, 2019 ). Based on a research report written for US Congress, the RFS Program's biofuel demand will mainly be fulfilled by conventional biofuel (corn-based ethanol) making up of 15 billion gallons of the proposed 20.09 billion gallons in 2020 alongside with other advanced biofuels which are derived from sugarcane, biobutanol, bionaphta, and biomass-based (e.g., soybean oil, canola oil, waste oil, animal fats) (USEPA, 2020 ). The mandated volume target was consistently not being met as the difference can be observed between the target volume established in the RFS statute based on Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) against EPA's annual target for advanced biofuels (Bracmort, 2020 ; USEPA, 2020 ). These differences lead to a shortfall in advanced biofuel production due to factors such as lack of private investment, inconsistent support from federal government, logistical challenges and setbacks in technological advancement (Bracmort, 2020 ). In 2017, the US has stepped up and secured a greener policy in order to meet the most detailed climate plan in US political history just launched by the House Democrats, and ceasing from the participation in Paris Agreement (Hersher, 2019 ; Roberts, 2020 ). Alternatively, one may increase the production of biofuel using lignocellulose-based agriculture waste rather than grain that otherwise has significant side effects on biodiversity, landscapes and human health (Chundawat et al., 2020 ; Gelfand et al., 2013 ; Searchinger et al., 2009 ). However, only 590 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel volume standard were finalized for blending in 2020 under RFS program because the cellulosic biofuel industry is incapable of meeting high fuel demand. This is because the industry is plagued with impediments such as feedstock availability, conversion efficiency, production cost, future oil price, environmental impacts and government policy (Tyner, 2010 , 2015 ). US cellulosic biofuel production was only 10 million gallons in 2017, which is far from the mandated RFS volume (Moriarty et al., 2017 ). Only one out of seven listed cellulosic ethanol plants in the US is operational at commercial scale [i.e., POET-DSM Advanced Biofuels LLC (Moriarty et al., 2017 )] and another nine plants are planned for construction to increase the production capacity (Moriarty et al., 2017 ). In addition, the potential avenue for biofuel production being explored in the United States is microalgae biofuel production which has the potential to generate biofuel equivalent to 48% of US petroleum imports based on a study conducted in 2011 (Wigmosta et al., 2011 ). However, such a large endeavor to generate algal biofuel would be non-preferable and nonrealistic given the enormous water, nutrient resources, and land-usage requirements (Handler et al., 2017 ; Lam et al., 2019 ). The targeted transport biofuel consumption under Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) in 2030 for the US is 95 Mtoe but the production in 2019 was only 35 Mtoe (IEA, 2020b ). Furthermore, International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted that the annual growth of US biofuel production from 2019 to 2025 will be only 1.9% and it will not be on track to meet SDS demands in 2030 (IEA, 2020b ). All these facts reveal the existence of miss-matched expectations between policy targets and practical implementations. A bottom-up analysis is recommended to identify the key bottlenecks and thus, the potential enablers can be determined in a more effective manner.  5.2 Biofuel production in Brazil Brazil is one of the largest producers of agricultural products owing to its rich tropical heritage. Crops such as bean, rice, sugarcane, wheat, corn and soybean are mainly cultivated and harvested in Brazil. These crops are raw material for first- and second-generation bioethanol production (Antunes et al., 2019 ). As the largest sugarcane producer, Brazil produces more than 665 million metric tons of sugarcane in 2020 (Statista, 2020 ), representing an important feedstock for Brazil's economy. Sugarcane is milled to obtain cane juice which is then processed into sugar and alcohol (including ethanol used in Brazil's flexible-fuel vehicles (e.g., hydrous ethanol) and ethanol-only vehicles) or blended with gasoline (e.g., anhydrous ethanol) to operate in gasoline engines. Introducing bioethanol in transportation provides several environmental advantages including reductions in GHG emissions and air pollution including sulfur, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions significantly (Turner et al., 2011 ). Yang et al. (2012)  reported that blending 3% ethanol in gasoline decreased the average emission factor of carbon monoxides and total hydrocarbons by 20% and 5%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline combustion. Currently, Brazil's standard required a 27% blend of ethanol in gasoline under ProAlcool . Considering Brazil is a signatory country for Kyoto Protocol, the MST has established a “Probiodiesel ” program with the aim to reduce imports of biodiesel, decrease GHG emissions, and expand the market for vegetable oil. In 2004, The National Biodiesel Production Program (PNPB) was launched to minimize the reliance on imported Petro diesel in Brazil and to explore alternative renewable energy. PNPB encourages farmers to produce feedstock for biodiesel production and get involved in the biodiesel production chain (Mattei, 2010 ). In 2010, family farming provided 20% of biodiesel output through PNPB, and the number of farming families increased slightly a year later (Bergmann et al., 2013 ). Brazil has become the second largest producer of biodiesel in 2010 (2.4 million m3 ), mainly as part of governmental programs and investment in biodiesel research (Bergmann et al., 2013 ). In short, Brazil may be an early adopter of greener technology at an industrial scale due to the vast biomass volumes and technologies accessible in biofuel production.  5.3 Biofuel production in China China has now become one of the world's emerging economies and the largest automobile industry, exceeding the vehicle sales of the United States (10.4 million units) (Statista, 2021 , 2022 ). The increase in production and demand for new vehicles raises the demand for fossil fuel which increases GHG emissions. Therefore, finding alternative fuel sources such as biofuel to meet carbon neutrality is important. As China is the world's largest agricultural country and has abundant agricultural biomass resources, conversion technology such as pyrolysis is deemed important to alleviate the fuel supply shortage issues in China (Ji et al., 2017 ). Owing to China's energy security and extra grain supply, the Chinese government aggressively pushed for a national biofuel programme. China has surpassed the United States and Brazil as the world's 3rd largest bioethanol producer since 2001, with production increasing 218% from 2001 to 2018 at the country's five production plants (OECD/FAO, 2021 ). The raw material includes mainly wheat and corn (USDA-FAS, 2011 ). During the 10th Five-year (2001–2005) plan, 10% ethanol was required to be blended with gasoline (E10) and was mandated in two cities in Heilongjiang and three cities in Henan in 2003 to trigger commercial distribution of bioethanol (Chavez et al., 2010 ). China's Renewable Energy Law (REL) was implemented in 2005 to encourage the growth of renewable energy, including biofuels (Liu, 2019 ). In order to provide additional guidance to REL, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy in China to improve the annual production of bioethanol and biodiesel up to 10 and 2 million tons, respectively, by 2020. Due to the increased awareness of the trade-off between energy and food security, the Chinese government implemented a set of supporting measures in 2007, restricting the use of cereal in bioethanol production. To mitigate this, Ministry of Agriculture released 2007–2015 Agricultural Bio-fuel Industry Plan by designing sugarcane, sweet sorghum, rape and cassava as primarily target crops for biofuel production. However, obstacles such as policy barrier, lack of authorized non-grain ethanol producing plants, and higher production cost of ethanol from non-grain sources limit the upscaling. In 2011, the production of biodiesel has significantly decreased due to the lack of vegetable oil, which is the main feedstock for biodiesel production in China (Saravanan et al., 2020a ). Meanwhile, China's MST issued a 5-year biotechnology development plan in 2012 to promote the industrialization of biodiesel, encourage the production of biodiesel from used catering, waste animal and vegetable fats as raw material, carrying out pilot research and development of 1000-ton biodiesel (Chung et al., 2020 ). Despite the Chinese government making effort to encourage consumers to replace fossil fuel with biodiesel for vehicles and introduce standards on biodiesel and biodiesel-blend fuel production, the commercialization of biodiesel was still halting. This could be due to a lack of policies and regulations in China's national biodiesel market that encourage the use of biodiesel, such as the Brazilian biofuel policy (RenovaBio), that also focuses on different critical area, including LCA, commercialization, and predictability of the fuel market, thereby supporting national energy security and lowering GHG emissions (Grangeia et al., 2022 ).  5.4 Biofuel production in Indonesia Indonesia is one of the countries with huge population and rich in agriculture, forest and crop. Owing to the hargely available land and tropical climate, it has become an ideal location for the plantation of palm and coconut agriculture. On this basis, Indonesia has become the world largest producer for palm oil, which can be harnessed for biodiesel production. Prior to palm oil, several crops (e.g., Jatropha, coconut, and soybean) have been introduced as potential feedstocks for biofuel production. In 2005, the Indonesian government introduced the plantation of Jatropha carcass to cater for biofuel production as it is a non-edible potential source for biodiesel production (Jayed et al., 2011 ). In 2006, the Indonesian government introduced a National Energy Policy (Regulation No. 5/2006), while at the same time launched “Mix Energy Policy” to urge the use of mixture of energy resources produced from local resources (e.g., solar energy, geothermal, hydrothermal) instead of relying on fossil fuel energy (Jupesta, 2010 ). The policy also proposed a reduction of fossil fuel energy by 5% in 2025 by replacing with biofuel energy. In 2008, Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) introduced a regulation No.32/2008, concerning on the provision, utilization and procedures of commerce of biofuel as an alternative fuel. This regulation was then amended on 2013, MEMR No. 25/2013, aiming to diversify domestic biodiesel consumption beyond the transportation sector (Putrasari et al., 2016 ). Besides, Indonesia also aims to replace the usage of gasoline and diesel with 15% bioethanol and 20% biodiesel by 2025. However, after one decade since the launch of “Mix Energy Policy” and some regulation/policy implementation by the Indonesian government, the utilization of biofuel in Indonesia still appears to be under-developed, and the highest portion of energy mix is still fossil fuel. A discussion was made by a group of researchers and several causes of this situation were reported (Putrasari et al., 2016 ). Firstly, it was caused by the unclear and overlapping of policies among central government, local government and ministries. For instance, regulation introduced by MEMR encourages the use of biofuel for vehicle, while policy introduced by Ministry of Trade encourages the usage of low-cost vehicle to grow the domestic automotive industry and ignoring the use of biofuel. Besides, biofuel has higher price compared to fossil fuel, and the Indonesian government has not allocated budget for biofuel subsidy, thus the utilization of biofuel in Indonesia is not encouraging at the current state.   6 Sustainable nexus between biofuels-pesticides-agroforestry (BPA) Even though biofuel production only composes around 20% of the total energy market, it is still significant in relation to the current levels of agroforestry. The global production of biofuel has been associated with land-use change practice, management and the usage of pesticides (Elobeid et al., 2013 ), and by 2050 biofuel production requires about 36% of all the energy contained in the global production of the world's crops (Hill et al., 2006 ). This will result in increased deforestation, reduced water quality and increase in carbon emissions, being an offset for the pursued environmental benefits of biofuels (Jeswani et al., 2020 ). In addition, the agro-industry contaminates soil and water through the extensive use of agrochemicals, including pesticides, and soil fertilizers (Mahapatra et al., 2021 ). On such basis, awareness of environmental pollution and potential hazards from various entities (including agroforestry, pesticide production and biofuels production) need further investigations in order to establish a sustainable biofuel-pesticides-agroforestry (BPA) nexus. In the nexus, agroforestry serves as the “harvesting hub” which supplies essential feedstock for the biofuel production plant; the pesticide production plant supplies pesticides to sustain the growth of the crops in agroforestry, while the biofuel production plant aims to generate biofuel, which can be sold to the market and consumed to self-sustain the nexus. With such integrated linkages between the entities, the sustainability performances of one will inevitably affect the credibility of others. 6.1 The fulfilment of BPA nexus The international green agenda to achieve net-zero carbon emissions increases the interests and attentions to biofuel production (Khan et al., 2021 ). Over the decades, world leaders have attempted to brand biofuel production as a “green pathway” to decarbonize power generation as opposed to the conventional fossil fuel which leads to significant environmental burdens. Nevertheless, it is rather skeptical to claim carbon neutrality without considering the environmental performances of the entire BPA nexus. In fact, the upstream agroforestry activities (e.g., use of fertilizer and pesticides) inevitably contribute to the environmental impacts (Hill et al., 2006 ; Saranya and Ramachandra, 2020 ). Therefore, to pave way towards the actual “carbon neutrality”, strategies are implemented to produce pesticides that increase crop yield and protect it from pests (Popp et al., 2013 ), while at the same time ensuring substantial environmental sustainability by reducing pollution and unintended negative biological effects in the environment (Correa et al., 2017 , 2019 ). For instance, the sugarcane plantation area (larger land footprint) has increased together with the demand for biofuels as well as the use of pesticides (contribute to higher emissions) in Brazil, indicating that there is a direct proportional relationship between agro-forestry, biofuels and pesticides (Moutinho et al., 2020 ; Schiesari and Grillitsch, 2011 ). To-date, in the United States, approximately 203 million pounds of pesticides are applied to corn farmland, which is nearly 40% of the total use of pesticides in the country (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014 ). From 1960 to 2008, the application of pesticides had increased significantly in US with 95% of pesticides being consumed in corn farmland (dominated by herbicide glyphosate), and the leftover “corn stover”” were utilized as the biodiesel feedstock (Battaglia et al., 2021 ; Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 2014 ; Sulaiman et al., 2020 ). Meanwhile, in Europe, rapeseed oil is the dominant feedstock for biodiesel production where it comprises 49% of total feedstock with a production of around 480,000 tons, which consumes more than 60% of the pesticides in the continent (Fridrihsone et al., 2018 ; Queirós et al., 2015 ). This, again, reconfirmed the essentiality to consider the BPA nexus during the planning phase to ensure the overall sustainability is not compromised. In the following subsections, various alternative advancements in this field which are helpful in creating a sustainable roadmap toward the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) are introduced. 6.1.1 The use of genetic modified crops Genetically modified (GM) crops play a crucial role in fulfilling the increased demand of agricultural products used for biofuel production. GM crops enabled the production of additional 138 million tons of soybeans, 274 million tons of corn and 8 million tons of canola between 1996 and 2013 (Zhang et al., 2016 ). However, the introduction of GM crops to increase the yield of soybean and corn, partially to fulfil biofuel demands, has far reaching consequences for the pesticide use in the United States (US) and other countries (Coupe and Capel, 2016 ). For example, GM crops designed to be resistant to herbicides (one or more type) such as glyphosate-resistant trait (GRT) soybean and corn, indicating a stronger immunity which able to enhance soybean than corn production (Coupe and Capel, 2016 ). However, the heavy dependence on glyphosate in weed control leads to glyphosate resistance, which results in increased use of pesticides and also diversification of herbicide types (Brookes and Barfoot, 2018 ). Brazil is the second largest bioethanol producer in the world after the US with 28% of production share in 2015 (Bordonal et al., 2018 ). Sugarcane-based ethanol production is spearheaded by the government as Brazil is the world's largest sugarcane producer and GM sugarcane plantation was being explored to meet the bioethanol demand (Cheavegatti-Gianotto et al., 2011 ). Such large-scale cultivation is supported by the use of a wide array of pesticides including herbicides, insecticides and pheromones (Bordonal et al., 2018 ; Cheavegatti-Gianotto et al., 2011 ). The increased use of pesticide leads to pollution of freshwater as the residual molecules of these pesticides enter the water system and cause potential risk to pollute the drinking water supply (Bordonal et al., 2018 ; Velasco et al., 2012 ). Notably, the adoption of GM crops which is tolerant towards insecticides and herbicides could aid in reduction of the use of conventional pesticide and thus indirectly, reduces the greenhouse gases emissions from the environment as compared to conventional non-GM crop. Most of the reduction in active ingredient application in pesticides was experienced in United States, where they are the early adopter of GM crop technology (Brookes and Barfoot, 2018 ). An interesting study reported by Klümper and Qaim (2014) , stated that GM crops have reduced the pesticide usage by 37%, while increasing crop yield by 22%, thereby being a promising yet debated way of crop production. Apart from that, genetic engineering is being applied to increase the yield of biodiesel feedstock such as canola oil, sunflower oil and corn oil, which in turn, resulted in a lesser plantation area associated with less application of pesticides (Hegde et al., 2015 ). Alternatively, some of the plant oil including jatropha, soybean and lemongrass that contain natural compounds can be used as a source of biopesticides (Cheavegatti-Gianotto et al., 2011 ; Coupe and Capel, 2016 ; Hoang and Van Le, 2017 ; Hossain et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). This opens up new opportunities to shift the business model into circular economy including the output wastes or by-products obtained from downstream entities are re-valorised and used as the input resources in the upstream entities (Iqbal et al., 2022 ). Along with biofuel production, agriculture residues from the plantation sites and processing plants can be converted into energy via  biomass combustion and other value-added products such as bio-oil via  pyrolysis or liquefaction processes (Feng et al., 2018 ). It is worth mentioning that bio-oils may contain important active ingredients for biopesticides formulation (e.g., azadirachtin, phenolic acid, furans, carbamate acids, etc.) (Calliera et al., 2021 ; Feng et al., 2020 ; Sacchettini and Calliera, 2017 ). These include bio-oil derived from tomato residue biomass (Cáceres et al., 2015 ), palm-based biomass (Zulkefli et al., 2021 ), and coconut shells (Mashuni et al., 2021 ). With this, the waste residues generated from the biofuel production value chain can, therefore, be converted into biopesticide which can be used to satisfy the pesticide requirement in the upstream plantation stage (i.e., align to the circular economy model). With a proper process design, integration and optimization, a biofuel processing complex (BPC) integrating multiple functional facilities into a single network can then be developed (Fig. 5  ) (Acheampong et al., 2017 ; Bonin and Lal, 2012 ). Such integrated design enhances circularity of the business model which further lead to better economic and environmental performances. Nonetheless, detailed techno-environmental-economic evaluation which considered the supply chain uncertainties (Lo et al., 2021 ) and game theoretic planning (Tan et al., 2020 ) on BPC are essential to ensure the biofuel production chain is practical and sustainable.  6.1.2 The use of integrated pest and weed management (IPWM) Integrated pest and weed management (IPWM) having a controlled use of pesticides is some of the studied and implemented approaches to reduce pesticide usage for bioenergy from agroforestry (Lucchi and Benelli, 2018 ; Moss, 2019 ; Singh et al., 2020 ). This method utilizes biological, mechanical, genetic and cultural approach for pest and weed management along with chemical components in order to diversify management approach (Moss, 2019 ). This approach reduces the need for pesticides in 3 ways; (i) reduce pesticide usage, (ii) prevent emergence of pesticide resistant pest that requires extensive application of pesticide and (iii) induce a more systematic management for sustainable algal biofuel production (Efroymson et al., 2021 ; Smith and Crews, 2014 ). Prevention of algal grazers and weeds can be achieved through ecological approach such as mixed-species algal assemblages for biofuel production and introduction of grazer predators. As these alternative crop management practices become more mainstream, the requirement of pesticides will reduce in agroforestry (Owen et al., 2015 ). Besides, Gagic et al. (2021)  found that the structure of the agriculture landscape plays an important role in pesticides reduction. Smaller fields with more seminatural areas significantly mitigate the speed and magnitude of the pest immigration, which gradually reduce the need of pesticides. Moreover, the application of precision agriculture has been found as an effective way to reduce the amount of pesticides required. In short, precision agriculture that coupled with Internet of Things (IoT) optimize the agroforestry decisions depending on the spatial and temporal conditions (Zamora-Izquierdo et al., 2019 ). For example, nano-sensors can be applied to assist farmer in crops monitoring and report timely need of fertilizer, water and pesticides based on soil conditions (Kaushal and Wani, 2017 ). Besides, the implementation of IoT technologies enables the development of blockchain-based LCA (Zhang et al., 2020 ) in agroforestry industry. The blockchain-based LCA is vital for ensuring trustworthy information, i.e., without any pro- or anti-agricultural agenda (Loy et al., 2022 ). Such trustable data management system is not only important to show that the green image of biofuel production is legitimately defined and justified, but it also helps to build a safe and secured platform for the future carbon trading market across the globe.  6.1.3 The use of environmentally friendly biopesticides The earliest discovery of the biopesticides can be backdated to the early 20th century. Biopesticides are generally less toxic, exert effect on a narrower list of targeted pests instead of causing harm to non-target species and easier to control and can decompose in a shorter time as compared to the conventional synthetic pesticides (Ivase et al., 2017 ; Sporleder and Lacey, 2013 ). Biopesticide could be derived from various classes of natural resources, i.e., plants (e.g., Cannabis oil extracted from Cannabis sativa  is effective against insect pests on corns and wheat (Mantzoukas et al., 2020 ); Jatropha seed oil contains numerous fatty acids which are known for their antifungal activity (Sama et al., 2021 )) and microbes (e.g., Trichogramma  spp. is effective against European corn borer caused by O. nubilalis  (Bzowska-Bakalarz et al., 2020 ); phenazine and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid derived from rhizophere from oil palm trait inhibits the spread of Ganoderma  diseases (Lee et al., 2018 )). Biopesticides are applied to a broad number of crops including corn, wheat, oil palm, sugarcane, soybean and Canola (Briar et al., 2018 ; Brookes and Barfoot, 2018 ; Castaldi et al., 2021 ; Djaenuddin et al., 2021 ; Ferreira et al., 2021a ; Kamal et al., 2017 ; Mantzoukas et al., 2020 ; Sharma et al., 2016 ; Singh et al., 2020 ) and consensus on the environmental benefits of using biopesticides has been achieved among the scholars. The use of biopesticides is agreed to be aligned with the green chemistry principles including safer and renewable feedstock, lower waste generation and biodegradable (Fenibo et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the use of biopesticide for the plantation of biofuel crops helps to justify the green image of biofuel. In addition to the environmental benefit, the effectiveness of biopesticides in pests and disease control is compatible with the synthetic pesticides. For example, a study in Indonesia has shown that the use of biological control agents can reduce the disease severity of the corn by more than 60%, which is similar to that of other synthetic pesticides (Djaenuddin et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, the microalgae-treated seeds of wheat and soybean are generally having a higher (around 10–20%) gemination index (Ferreira et al., 2021b ) and possess greater inhibition against F. oxysporum  (Vehapi et al., 2018 ). These ensure that the oil crop yield of the biofuel crop will not be compromised, and therefore, securing a more stable supply of bio-oil for the later biofuel production. Moving on, nanotechnology including nanoencapsulation is a potential tool to enhance the environmental performance of biopesticides. Nanoencapsulation which entrapped the pesticides components in an encapsulating agent forming nano-pesticides or nano-biopesticides, effectively enhance its stability and viability against adverse environmental conditions, which further lead to lower risk of leaching (Koul, 2019 ; Nuruzzaman et al., 2016 ). Aside from that, such nanoencapsulation strategy has shown substantial potential in reducing the risk of causing adverse effects on the non-targeted species (Monteiro et al., 2021 ), at the same time, pertaining stable pest-control efficiency for a prolonged duration (Kumar et al., 2019 ). Nano emulsion technology, on the other hand, enhance the antimicrobial and insecticidal properties of oil-based pesticides (Pant et al., 2014 ). To-date, its effectiveness on various oil-based biopesticides, such as essential oils of castor (Zhang et al., 2018 ), Ocimum basilicum  (Al-Assiuty et al., 2019 ), basil (Hossain et al., 2019 ), and neem (Iqbal et al., 2022 ) has been tested. In other words, this nanotechnology can effectively reduce the required usage level (Feng et al., 2018 , 2020 ). Nevertheless, further feasibility study for the mass production and application of bio nano-pesticides is still in need to visualize its actual economic performances of the biofuel production. Life cycle assessment that captures the emissions of the entire BPA nexus should be performed to validate the environmental benefits attributed to this intervention.   6.2 Pathways towards the sustainable development goals Sustainable pesticide use in the agricultural sector represents one of the most urgent environmental goals worldwide. The implementation of innovation and prevention initiatives is regarded as a promising tool to achieve the SDGs. However, this cannot be simply formulated through single linear models involving scientific development of techniques or information. Instead, it is a complicated systemic relation between the various subjects concerned in different ways. The use of pesticides is tightly bound to water contamination and is caused by direct or accidental diffusion from the point source. The farmers control the use of pesticides; hence, it is obvious from the above relationship that one of the important factors that facilitates sustainable pesticide use falls on the consensus and awareness towards the use of pesticides and its implications on water quality (6th SDG – Clean water and sanitation). To support 3rd SDG (Good health and well-being) and the 7th SDG (Affordable and clean energy), enormous collaborative efforts from private, public and political leadership are essential to create a sustainable nexus of BPA, including pesticide education adoption in the agriculture sectors and unification of the mindset of traditional farmer with technology (Fig. 6  ). This is in line with a recent study conducted by Calliera et al. (2021)  where most of the farmers claimed that they had regularly attended training courses of mitigation of water contamination, and have poor knowledge on the control of pesticides in water. Hence, comprehensive events with incentive rewarding schemes would improve the awareness of the farmers while encouraging them to implement the strategies taught in their farming activity as an effort to reduce water contamination. When structuring such events, the educational background of the participants should be taken into consideration to avoid the contents being too technical. Combined with an innovative engagement that contains hands-on activity, interesting demonstration, and most importantly the involvement of the participants with group discussions, the farmers are expected to gain higher awareness through this learning package compared to conventional training courses (Sacchettini and Calliera, 2017 ). The rewarding scheme should be offered as an incentive to farmers who have supported the SDGs directly or indirectly with the changes made on their farms after the event. Biofuels are indeed promising renewable energy sources to substitute fossil fuels in tackling the world energy crisis and vital in attaining the 7th SDG and 13th SDG (Acheampong et al., 2017 ). Several developed nations are pursuing achievable targets for biofuel production. For example, the Energy Independence and Protection (EIP) Act enforced in the United States in 2007 encourages more than 36 billion gallons of biofuel to be generated in the nation by 2022 (Bonin and Lal, 2012 ). In China, enormous efforts have been invested in producing biofuel to accommodate the electricity usage for 20% of the total urban residents (AlQattan et al., 2018 ). Indisputably, biofuel has tremendous potential to complement energy production around the world and its continued progress ensures a sustainable future supply. However, it must be acknowledged that the commercialization of biofuels has faced difficulties, particularly with regard to large-scale adoption in their present state. In this respect, attention should be devoted to following suggestions for achieving the SDGs. Thus, it is important not to infringe on constitutional rights where biofuel production should not affect and interfere with food crops and food security. Ideally, the production of first generation biofuels in developing nations should be limited, as the food crisis in Covid-19 appears to be a harbinger of how their growing demand for such feedstock eventually influence the world food industry (Loy et al., 2022 ). The prospect of obtaining several benefits from the combined farming of energy and food crops could be explored in the local policies (Tilman et al., 2009 ). The energy crops can conveniently be harvested for feeding the local biofuel demand without competing with food crop production. Farmers that grow both energy farming and food crops on the same plot of land will gain more profits as a result of this. On top of that, agroforest could be a natural habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna that maintain the biodiversity on land (15th SDG – Life on land). Thus, combined farming of both energy and food crops would promote sustainable production on the same piece of land with improved socio-economic quality of the human population.   7 Conclusions Application of pesticides has undergone major changes since their introduction during the Second World War. Research towards the understanding and the implication of pesticide use towards environment and humans and the results of these research aided policymakers in devising policies to safeguard the health of people and the environment. Despite established studies on the side effects of pesticide application, the use of pesticides is still widespread owing to their contribution to maintaining food security. As such, sustainable pesticide use and management is a topic of interest in the agricultural sector. Furthermore, pesticide use is influenced by increased demand for food along with biofuel production, which depends on oil crops leading to increased farming area. The biofuel development policies are implemented to encourage the production and use of biofuel in an effort to rapidly replenish the diminishing fossil fuel reserves. Therefore, careful consideration is needed to balance the pesticide use, biofuel production and food security issues to achieve the UN SDGs. The development and innovation in pesticide technology, such as bio-nano-pesticides, GM crops, effective implementation of integrated pest and weed management and monitoring, coupled with IoT (including data science and artificial intelligence) and farmers upskilling (knowledge enhancement on pesticide use) would be a value-added way forward to realize a sustainable BPA nexus.
