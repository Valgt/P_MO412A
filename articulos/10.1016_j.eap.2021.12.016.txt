                  The study aims to investigate the research field of informality from a dual perspective—unilateral versus multilateral—in relation to Sustainable Development Goals. It highlights the dynamics of the literature and potential future research directions through mapping that enables the investigation of scientific knowledge. To elaborate the temporal development of the informality research field in terms of publications, we extract articles from Web of Science published between 1978–2021. We investigate more than 5000 documents, focusing on author, keyword, paper, journal, and topic analysis. The empirical findings emphasise the conceptual structure from the unilateral perspective, with clusters focusing on informality, urban informality, and sustainable development. Moreover, the informal economy, informality and entrepreneurship, tax evasion, tax morale and tax compliance, the shadow economy, the informal sector, and corruption are clusters from the multilateral perspective. According to the intellectual structure of the field, A. Roy is the most representative author for the subarea of informality and Sustainable Development Goals, with articles mostly related to urban informality and cities. F. Schneider, K. Gerxhani, R. LaPorta, B. Torgler, J. Alm, A. Sandmo, C. Williams, H. De Soto, and R. Dell’Anno are the most representative reference authors for the entire spectrum of informality. Finally, World Development, Geoforum, Environment and Urbanisation , Urban Studies, Habitat International, American Economic Review, Journal of Economic Literature, and Journal of Public Economy are the most prolific journals in the field of informality.

Bucharest University of Economic Studies, Department of Statistics and Econometrics, Romana Square 6 Bucharest 010374 Romania       The study aims to investigate the research field of informality from a dual perspective—unilateral versus multilateral—in relation to Sustainable Development Goals. It highlights the dynamics of the literature and potential future research directions through mapping that enables the investigation of scientific knowledge. To elaborate the temporal development of the informality research field in terms of publications, we extract articles from Web of Science published between 1978–2021. We investigate more than 5000 documents, focusing on author, keyword, paper, journal, and topic analysis. The empirical findings emphasise the conceptual structure from the unilateral perspective, with clusters focusing on informality, urban informality, and sustainable development. Moreover, the informal economy, informality and entrepreneurship, tax evasion, tax morale and tax compliance, the shadow economy, the informal sector, and corruption are clusters from the multilateral perspective. According to the intellectual structure of the field, A. Roy is the most representative author for the subarea of informality and Sustainable Development Goals, with articles mostly related to urban informality and cities. F. Schneider, K. Gerxhani, R. LaPorta, B. Torgler, J. Alm, A. Sandmo, C. Williams, H. De Soto, and R. Dell’Anno are the most representative reference authors for the entire spectrum of informality. Finally, World Development , Geoforum , Environment and Urbanisation  , Urban Studies , Habitat International , American Economic Review , Journal of Economic Literature , and Journal of Public Economy  are the most prolific journals in the field of informality.

In this paradigm, the assumption made by all member states of the United Nations has materialised in the adoption of the Development Agenda 2030. It is based on a broad consensus on the responsibility to create a more inclusive, equitable, prosperous, and sustainable future. It includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets, integrated and indivisible, aimed towards a holistic approach to social, economic, and environmental challenges. Numerous studies have elaborated on the SDGs, the capitalisation of which ensures an increase in the degree and efficiency of their implementation. These studies foreground the fact that, considering the diversity of national systems and universality of the SDGs’ provisions, an informal space is created, whose actions and consequences become of general interest. Pointing out the formal/informal dichotomy, it has been noted that the relationship between them presents additional challenges, as each amplifies the other’s trends through the paradoxical nature of this complex long-term process (Misztal, 2002). The notion of informality is a topic of debate in the literature that considers both conceptualisation and contextualisation. From the perspective of conceptualisation, informality highlights what is outside or at the limit of the formal, which is perceived as norms, conventions, policies, rules. From the perspective of contextualisation,informality refers to ‘territorial formations (slum), categories of particular groups (informal labour), or forms of organisation (structured versus unstructured; rule-based versus unruly; predictable versus unpredictable)’ (McFarlane, 2012 : 90). Informality, as a result of individuals’ maximising their payoffs, is a micro phenomenon, but the magnitude and the scale of policies used to address it can make it seem as a macro phenomenon, with significant implications for the economy as a whole (Ulyssea, 2020). Three categories of informality are distinguished: that which evades regulation, that which avoids regulation, and that to which regulation does not apply (Kanbur, 2017). Informality can develop creative valences that enable resolving divergent issues, provided they are maintained within the limits of ethics and equity. From the perspective of a rational response to the challenges of a hostile and over-regulated environment made by those without financial means, informality represents a creative survival method. Interpretations of these aspects are complex and divergent. As society cannot ensure a decent living for all its members, they are forced to seek informal means. Nevertheless, there have always been niche areas—advantageous, less explored, and bounded spaces in which the creativity of informality can bring prosperity and progress. The dynamics of the informal are superior to those of the formal, and the informal usually precedes the formal in any economy. However, significant informal expansion leads to imbalances, poverty, and instability, disturbing the good of society by creating certain individual advantages. The interest of the academic community and specialists towards the issue of sustainable development and informality has materialised in papers, reports, and various other publications. The quantitative examination of scientific terminology, production, development, collaboration, and usage of scientific publications is known as bibliometric analysis. In recent years, it has become a popular approach for measuring and analysing intellectual, conceptual, or the social structure of a research field. According to Ellegaard and Wallin (2015) , bibliometric analysis is an important component of research assessment techniques, especially in scientific and practical domains. Bibliometric mapping is a three-dimensional depiction of the relationships between disciplines, fields, areas, and individual publications or authors (Cobo et al., 2011 ). In this context, the present study aims to analyse the research field of informality from a dual perspective (i.e. unilateral versus multilateral) of the phenomenon of informality associated with the SDGs, emphasising the dynamics of the literature and potential future research directions from a statistical viewpoint. Therefore, the analysis aims to reveal: (1) the conceptual structure and highlighting the main themes and trends, (2) the intellectual structure and highlighting the way in which the work of an author influences the entire scientific community, and (3) the social structure or how authors, institutions, and countries interact. This study aims to determine: the number of publications per year, the annual scientific publication growth and average article citation per year regarding both the perspective on informality and the SDGs from various standpoints, the most productive authors in terms of both unilateral and multilateral perspectives on informality and SDGs and the most cited scientists, the most relevant journals that publish articles at the border of both approaches, which countries collaborate on subjects such as informality and SDGs and all terms of informality and SDGs, the top-cited papers, the thematic patterns of informality, and the conceptual, intellectual, and social structures of the unilateral and multilateral phenomena of informality and SDGs. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first study to explore the research in the field of informality, comparatively analysing informality from a unilateral versus a multilateral perspective to capture the phenomenon from different angles. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2  is focused on the issues of informality and SDGs independently, while Section 3  analyses the relationship between informality and SDGs in terms of the main implications, as has been highlighted in the literature. Section 4  offers valuable information regarding the study design, data collection, and main methods applied in the analysis, while Sections 5 –9  comprising the analysis and results present the most relevant findings in the field. Finally, the paper ends with significant points of discussion and conclusions.  2 Literature review The systematisation of the scientific literature regarding transdisciplinary topics related to the SDGs reveals the existence of bibliometric analyses on areas of interest such as: SDG 3—good health and well-being (Da Costa et al., 2020 ), tourism (Jiménez-García et al., 2020; Moyle et al., 2021 ), health (Sweileh et al., 2018 ), health and human rights (Sweileh et al., 2018 ), food–energy–water (Zhu et al., 2020; Opejin et al., 2020 ), urban (Havinga et al., 2020 ), and public–private partnerships (Chen et al., 2019 ). The most studied is SDG 3 (Meschede, 2020 ). Herein, targets 7 (ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information, and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes), and 8 (achieving universal healthcare coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services, and access to safe, effective, good quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all) are prioritised. Conversely, the least researched are targets 5 (strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol), and 9 (substantially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination) (Sweileh, 2020 ). To assess the degree of assumption of the SDGs at the educational level, with focus on sustainable education and responsible management education, bibliometric analyses have been aimed towards the intellectual structure or knowledge for supporting SGD implementation (Avelar et al., 2019 ). ‘Whereas the SDGs have a global dimension, their action implementation depends on the level of priority different countries give to them, and on how sustainability issues compete with a country’s main problems’ (Salvia et al., 2019 : 841). In this context, bibliometric analyses highlight the aspect of identifying the priority of certain SDGs according to the regional specificities. Thus, in the European region, most research targets SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asian regions, SDG 3 has garnered the most research interests. Meanwhile, in the region of the Americas and the Western Pacific region, SDG 13 is the most studied. At the opposite end on the scale of research interest are SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) in the African region, the Americas, the European region, and the South-East Asian region; SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), the Eastern Mediterranean region; and SDG 5 (gender equality), the Western Pacific region (Sweileh, 2020 ). Informality is a less-approached topic in bibliometric analyses. The analysis of this phenomenon is complicated by conceptual ambiguity, measurement difficulties, and differences in manifestations and perceptions influenced by regional peculiarities, the multitude of factors in holistic interdependencies, and the dynamics with different amplitudes. The review of the literature in the field of informalit y is also referred to as the ‘shadow economy’, ‘informal economy’, ‘informal sector’, ‘informal employment’, ‘unofficial economy’, ‘parallel economy’, ‘invisible economy’, ‘ghost economy’, ‘illegal economy’, ‘grey economy’, ‘cash economy’, ‘unobserved economy’, ‘underground economy’, ‘unregistered economy’, or ‘unreported economy’. It ensures a taxonomic understanding of informality which enables cross-disciplinary linkages: economic, legal, technical, organisational, political, social, cultural, configuration, and connections (Boanada-Fuchs and Fuchs Boanada, 2018 ). There are three institutional criteria used in characterising the informal sector First, the political criteria which includes government regulation, illegal activities, and national statistics. Second, the economic criteria which includes the labour market or status of labour, with reference to undeclared labour, lack of social benefits, sub-minimum wages, social benefits, sub-minimum wages, and poor working conditions. Tax evasion, size of activity, professional status, registration of an activity, and national statistics also comprise the economic criteria. Finally, the social criteria which comprises social networks and its ease of entry, autonomy and flexibility, survival (Gerxhani, 2004 ). The main causes of informality, which results from the deliberate choices made by individuals and firms that decide to remain outside the formal economy, are tax and social security burdens, the intensity of regulations, and the existence of excessive administrative procedures. The higher the tax rate, lower the tax morale, or people’s attitudes towards paying taxes, thereby encouraging people to work in the informal economy to evade taxes (Schneider, 1994a,b, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2007, 2015; Buehn and Schneider, 2008, 2012; Dell’Anno, 2007; Feld and Frey, 2007; Berdiev and Saunoris, 2019; Williams and Schneider, 2016 ). In addition, the informal economy grows as a result of the social welfare system in the context of a high marginal tax rate, specific provisions on certain labour markets regarding forced reductions in working hours, and the quality and quantity of public sector services as a result of declining budget revenues (Schneider and Enste, 2000 ). Furthermore, Medina and Schneider (2021)  consider informality to be driven by factors such as tax and social security contribution burdens, quality of institutions or corruption, regulations, public sector services, tax morale, deterrence, development of the official economy, self-employment, size of the agricultural sector, use of cash, share of the labour force, and economic growth. The size and development of informality are measured using direct approaches (micro level: surveys, tax auditing), indirect approaches (macroeconomic estimations: the discrepancy between National Expenditure and Income Statistics, between the Official and Actual Labour Force, the Transactions Approach, and the Currency Demand Approach), and statistical models (Schneider, 2014 ). The sphere of the informal economy also includes the vulnerability of the employment of informal workers, whose incomes are at the subsistence level. Specialists define ‘employment vulnerability for subsistence workers in the informal sector, the condition of those who must work by day to eat at night, who have little or no ownership of assets, and who have a minimum structure of opportunities to prevent, face, and resist the critical situations that occur daily, putting at risk their subsistence and that of the persons who are their responsibility, thus making the connection between social and employment vulnerability’ (Garzón-Duque et al., 2017 : 51). The dynamics and significant incidences of this phenomenon require the identification of the causes that allow its proliferation. In this sense, bibliometric analyses on the relationship between inequality and growth highlights the fact that ‘countries with low levels of inequality exert a positive relationship with economic growth and countries with high inequality have a negative one. Additionally, there is a certain level of inequality where the relationship becomes non-significant and growth is maximised’ (Charles-Coll, 2010 :40). The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has addressed the causes and effects of informality within the labour market. It defines informal economy as ‘all economic activities by workers and economic units that are—in law or in practice—not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements’ (ILO, 2002 ). Contextualised to the labour market, the informal economy implies specific perceptions of the relevant terms. Work is characterised by small or undefined workplaces, unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, low skill and productivity levels, low or irregular incomes, long working hours, and a lack of access to information, markets, finance, training and technology. Workers are not recognised, registered, regulated, or protected under labour legislation and social protections. Analyses conducted by the ILO show that more than half of the world’s workforce, and more than 90% of micro and small enterprises, belong to the informal economy. Studies highlight that the root causes of this phenomenon are both global (the economic context, the legal, regulatory and policy frameworks) and individual (low level of education, discrimination, poverty, lack of access to economic resources, property, financial and other business services, and markets). Informal employment diminishes budget revenues, incapacitating governments when trying to provide social services and contributing to distortions of the tax system, while also weakening government authority. Moreover, workers’ rights to decent working conditions and fair competition are all affected. Addressing the topic of the shadow economy through bibliometric analysis, Terziev (2020)  identifies seven clusters of keywords, namely informal sector, informal economy, unemployment, gender, urban economy, labour market, and corruption. Timofte and Coca (2020)  review the scientific terminology used in connection with the shadow economy. Santos and Ferreira (2017)  analyse the publications on informal entrepreneurship, revealing that informal entrepreneurship is related to the quality of governance and economic liberalisation.  3 Causalities and determinism in informality: SDG relationships The interferences between the formal and informal, the dichotomy of informal mechanisms in the correlative dynamics of phenomena are highlighted by several studies on SDG implementation. In the approach for the relationship poverty (SDG 1)—informality, the debate has focused on causality and detecting the determining mechanisms. Lewis (1954) , Harris and Michael (1970)  consider informality to be a by-product of poverty. Informal employment is viewed as an involuntary solution to unemployment, requiring low investment and a lack of highly skilled workers that ensures subsistence-level incomes to protect low-skilled workers from extreme poverty in the short-run (Docquier et al., 2017 ). According to Canelas (2019) , poverty increases the probability of informality in the context in which low-income households accept informal low-income employment related to the low-skilled technology specific to informal sectors. In the neoliberal view, informal employment is approached as a voluntary alternative in response to government-induced distortions in the labour market by regulating the minimum wage and through the burden of taxation (Chaudhuri and Mukhopadhyay, 2010; Cunningham and Maloney, 2001; Günther and Launov, 2012 ). In other studies, poverty has been considered a consequence of informality, where informal workers are not protected by social security, do not receive employment benefits (Ohnsorge and Yu, 2021 ), and do not contribute to retirement pension schemes (Loayza et al., 2010 ). This results in exposure to the risk of chronic poverty. In meeting food needs (SDG 2), the informal economy is the predominant source for the poor population, especially by selling local, unprocessed products, corresponding to the traditional diet, and ensuring access to healthy food (Parra et al., 2015 ). Informality in heterogeneous sectors (living and working conditions) impacts health and well-being (SDG 3). Poor living conditions and informality in urban developments, with unhealthy residences and without running water, sanitation, or electricity, generate risks for health, privacy, and personal safety, thereby affecting well-being (Turok, 2020 ). Work and well-being are related to insecurity, poverty, risk and vulnerability to coercion (Harriss-White, 2010 ). In the absence of social and health insurance and labour protection caused by informality, any work accidents or illnesses require workers to bear out-of-pocket health expenditures (Ulrichs, 2016 ), which also has consequences for well-being. Additionally, as part of a vicious cycle, both unemployment (Di Tella et al., 2001 ) and work informality (Temkin, 2016 ) have a negative impact on life satisfaction and happiness of individuals. Previous empirical studies reveal a direct link between informality and education (SDG 4), highlighting the fact that ‘workers with primary education or less are much more likely to be informal than workers with basic or secondary education without diploma’ (Fernández and Villar, 2017 : 14). It further proves that a high proportion of workers with a tertiary education are associated with a lower level of informality (Docquier et al., 2017 ). Compared to the formal sectors, the informal ones involve lower returns, which vary throughout salary distribution with different patterns of variance. These are correlated with a deficit year of schooling associated with educational mismatches that puts them at a greater disadvantage. Discrepancies between education level and wages are even more pronounced for informal workers (Herrera-Idárraga et al., 2015 ). Fernández and Villar (2016)  classify informal workers as: subsistence informality group (informal workers with a primary education or lower), induced informality group, (informal workers with a secondary education), and voluntary informality group (informal workers with a tertiary education or higher). Gender equality (SDG 5) is an acute societal problem, with specificities and high levels in the informal sectors. Women often rely heavily on the informal economy for jobs and income. Consequently, every policy debate on informality must include the perspective of gender. There is a gender earning gap within the informal sector, with women at a disadvantage through involvement in unpaid family work, work at home, and casual work (Azunre et al., 2021 ). Complementarily, the informal sectors support social equity and gender equality by absorbing a large number of female workers (Azunre et al., 2021 ). Thus, replacing male workers in the formal sector with women in the informal sector contributes to the deterioration of income distribution (Standing, 2006 ). According to Richmond et al. (2015) , there are six primary drivers of vulnerability: food, water, energy, environment, livelihood, and health. In ensuring clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) formal and informal networks can operate simultaneously. For example, elements of informal practices can intervene in the entire water system and sometimes dominate the entire value chain, from water extraction to distribution. The debates in this area also focus on the contradictory incidents of the informal, revealing that the informality of water and sanitation services (by non-regulated providers) may increase ‘social and environmental risk factors for poor health and well-being’ (Arias Granada et al., 2018 : 2). This would further expose the vulnerable consumer to price and quality risk, while accepting that the informal economy ensures urban access to safe, affordable drinking water (O’Donnell and Garrick, 2019 ). Complementarily, regarding the issue of affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), the informal practice of using fuels such as charcoal and paraffin is specific to poor patterns of energy consumption in slums (Kovacic et al., 2021 ), which amplifies ecological problems. Considering the quality of working conditions, few targets related to promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all (SDG 8) refer to specific aspects of decent work, such as informal employment (8.3.1), earnings (8.5), and occupational injuries and compliance with labour rights (8.8) (Piasna et al., 2020 ). Globally, the labour market is characterised by the prevalence of informality and working poverty (ILO, 2020 ). In underdeveloped countries, the deficit of decent work is associated with structural problems such as informality (Ostermeier, 2020 ). Informal work is not covered by labour legislation (Akinsanya et al., 2021 ). Evidently, extreme deviations from established employment norms imply extremely poor employment conditions, including very low rewards for labour, vulnerability, job and income insecurity, absence of social protection, and even exploitation in the form of bonded labour specific to informality. From the perspective of industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9), the informal sector, on average, is characterised by lower productivity than the formal sector because it employs workers with low levels of human capital and limited managerial capabilities. Moreover, it uses less capital due to restricted access to finance, and have no economies of scale (Galiani and Weinschelbaum, 2007; Loayza, 2018 ). The relationship between informality and income inequality (SDG 10) is a topic of interest that registers a strong positive correlation between the size of the informal sector and income inequality (Elgin and Elveren, 2021 ), as well as the contradictory impact of the informal sector on income inequality (Dell’Anno, 2021 ). The informal sector absorbs low-skilled employees, therefore lowering income inequality by providing opportunities to people who are poor and excluded. At the same time, a growing informal sector affects income distribution by reducing taxes, gradually leading to higher levels of informal activity as tax morale declines. Higher inequality decreases the accumulation of human and physical capital, thereby amplifying informality. Informal employment is increased by seasonal and circular labour migrants, who offer solutions to a labour market affected by fragmentation and discrimination according to caste, gender, ethnicity, language, and religion (Srivastava, 2019 ), noting that barriers to access in formal sectors create informal workers (Fernández and Villar, 2016 ). Informality is a complex and heterogeneous intrinsic urban phenomenon that must be considered by local authorities and incorporated within sustainable urban development programs and strategies in the context of rapid urbanisation manifested in poverty, vulnerability, and marginalisation, creating conditions for informal manifestations (SDG 11). The literature debates the dichotomous character of informality and signal both the contribution to the sustainable development of cities from the three perspectives—economic, social, and environmental (Azunre et al., 2021 ). It also highlights the phenomenology of informal urbanism (informal employment, the illegal condition of land occupation by poor and marginalised people, inadequate access to basic services and amenities, and social insecurity) with effects on amplifying vulnerabilities (Richmond et al., 2018 ). Informal activities related to factors such as forest exploitation, use of water sources, and land waste management contribute significantly to environmental degradation, with an impact on climate (SDG 13). Higher levels of informality are related to lower environmental quality (Biswas et al., 2012 ). Thus, reaching the potential for sustainable development is hampered by climate change, with effects on food security, water, and sanitation infrastructure. Finally, sustainable development involves peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG16). Reducing the informal sphere by ensuring sustainable peace requires the economies of peace, aimed at diminishing structural economic inequalities (Distler et al., 2018 ). Reducing corruption, increasing trust in public institutions and satisfaction with public services are required to ensure sustainable development (Popescu et al., 2018 ).  4 Data and methodology To explore the informality phenomenon from a multilateral perspective, the present research includes two bibliometric analyses. First, we explore the intersections between informality and the SDGs using ‘informality’ and ‘SDGs’ as keywords. Second, we investigate the phenomenon of informality from different angles, using a comprehensive range of terms devoted to the informal economy in the literature, these terms include ‘shadow economy’, ‘informal economy’, ‘informal sector’, ‘informal employment’, ‘informality’, ‘unofficial economy’, ‘parallel economy’, ‘invisible economy’, ‘ghost economy’, ‘illegal economy’, ‘grey economy’, ‘cash economy’, ’unobserved economy’, ‘underground economy’, ‘unregistered economy’, ‘unreported economy’, ‘undeclared work’, ‘envelope wages’/, ‘bogus-self-employment’, and ‘employees without formal contract’ along with ‘SDGs’ or ‘sustainable development goals’. All the records for each publication retrieved during the search are converted and concatenated as plain text files and imported into Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny. Only the use of the term ‘informality’ and SDGs are studied between 2004 and 2021, while all other terms related to the informality spectrum and SDGs are studied between 1978 and 2021. Searches are conducted using the Web of Science (WoS) database, and the search language is English. Based on the total amount of documents selected, we apply the Bradford Law, and identify the documents from the first zone, which was the nucleus of journals particularly devoted to informality in its aspects. Therefore, 128 documents address the relationship between informality and SDGs, while 5040 documents cover the entire literature on the topic of informal terms and the SDGs (Fig. 1 ).  The first set of documents is found across seven different publication categories and grouped as follows: articles (96), book chapters (8), early access articles (2), proceeding papers (10), reviews (10), and editorial materials (2). The second set of documents is grouped as follows: articles (3659), book chapters (132), early access articles (144), proceeding papers (846), reviews (90), editorial materials (42), and other (127). The R language environment is used to run the open-source packages Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny. Bibliometrix enabled the completion of the entire scientific literature analysis and data processing, while Biblioshiny captured the core Bibliometrix code and to create an online data analysis framework (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017 ). Biblioshiny enables users to perform pertinent bibliometric and visual analyses based on an interactive web interface. The research methodology comprises three main steps (Fig. 2 ): study design and data collection, data analysis and visualisation, and interpretation. The Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny packages are used to display bibliometric indicators regarding the topic of informality from a dual perspective—a unilateral one based only on the use of term ‘informality’ and a multilateral approach supporting varying terminology and considering the phenomenon from different angles. The methodology focuses on a descriptive bibliometric analysis exploring the growth of publications in the field, most productive sources, most cited documents, most productive countries, author impact, keyword-author-journal relationships, and topic trends. Subsequently, using network and cluster analysis, the study explores the conceptual, intellectual, and social structure of the informality research field from a dual perspective. The conceptual structure includes network analysis that relies on keyword co-occurrence and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) that illustrates the major research themes. The intellectual structure includes the co-citation network (authors, papers, and journals), while the social structure explores the collaboration network among authors, institutions, and countries. Cluster analysis comprises word clouds for abstracts, authors, and papers grouped by coupling. By extracting descriptive and network data, citation analysis can be performed. The conventional methods used in citation analysis are bibliographic coupling, co-citation, and co-word. Bibliographic coupling (Kessler, 1963 ) can be said to exist between two documents if two records cite the same paper, whereas co-citation (Small, 1973 ) measures the most-cited reports. Co-word (Callon et al., 1983 ) analysis maps the cognitive structure of the network during a period based on co-occurrence of the words in the abstract, title, or keywords in the papers. Co-word citation induces the temporal development in a scientific field in which conceptual structures are formed using textual discourse. The present study uses bibliometric coupling analysis to determine the journal’s topic structure in addition to descriptive analysis. According to Kessler (1963) , texts that cite the same third document form a bibliographic couple that explores related intellectual issues (Martyn, 1964 ).    5 Descriptive analysis and results As shown in Table 1 , the present research uses two samples of documents. One comprises a total of 128 documents exploring the relationship between ‘informality’ and ‘SDGs’, while the second comprises a total of 5040 documents exploring the entire spectrum of informality terminology and SDGs. If, in the unilateral perspective of informality, the average citation per document is 6.68 with a total of 335 authors contributing to this domain, in the multilateral perspective, the average citation per document is almost double (11.31), with a total of 9068 authors contributing to the domain. Table 1  illustrates that both perspectives of informality showed a strong collaboration between authors, 319 and 7596 authors for the unilateral and multilateral perspectives respectively, shared by the documents published in this domain. 5.1 Growth of publications Analysing the dynamics of both document sets in terms of publication growth, even during different time periods, shows that the number of publications related to informality and SDGs increased from two publications in 2015 to 28 in 2020. Analysing the entire spectrum of informality and SDGs publications shows that the phenomenon is first studied much earlier; however, the number of publications has been increasing since 2006 (75 publications), reaching 543 publications in 2020 (Fig. 3 ). The annual growth rate is 20.47% for only the use of the term ‘informality’ in association with SDGs, and 12.69% for the entire spectrum of terms related to informality. Therefore, we can conclude that the phenomenon has continuously attracted the attention of specialists over the last decade. Another potential explanation is the importance of both concepts in the context of the 2030 Agenda and the European Platform tackling Undeclared Work, assuming that the informality phenomenon in its various forms exists in varying degrees in each country. The enlarged pool of researchers at the international level and the extension of the WoS database in 2015 have led to an increasing number of publications (Merigó et al., 2015 ).  5.2 Most productive sources The most relevant journals that publish articles at the border between both topics are analysed. Fig. 4  shows the ranking of the 20 most productive sources about informality indexed in the core collection of the WoS database, highlighting that Sustainability Journal  is in first place. From this perspective, some differences can be observed between the results in terms of the most productive journals. Thus, studies related to informality or the informal economy and SDGs have mostly been published in International Journal of Urban Sustainable Development , Cities , Sustainable Urban Development , and Globalisation  . At the same time, when all terms were used, the main sources of publications were found to be World Development , International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy , Applied Economics , and Urban Studies . Regarding the analysis of the development of journals as sources of research on the informality phenomenon, we find a significant increase for Sustainability  and International Journal of Urban Sustainable Development  as well as for World Development  and Sustainability . Therefore, we can conclude that, even for authors who tackled different perspectives on capturing informality, Sustainability  is most preferred for publishing the results of their research (Fig. 5 ). Table 1  shows the most important sources arranged in decreasing order according to the h-index, and in particular, having an h-index value > 2 for the informality term and > 12 for the comprehensive spectrum of terms. In the field of informality, Environmental Science & Policy  and Sustainability  are identified as the journals with the highest h-index (3). On the multilateral perspective on informality, World Development , International Journal of Urban and Regional Research , and Journal of Development Economics  showed the highest h-indices, with values of 22 and respectively 15. Egghe (2006)  indicates the relevance of the g-index as an extension of the h-index that represents an important tool for assessing global citation performance. Costas and Bordons (2008)  specify that the g-index offers better positioning in rankings than in the h-index. According to the total number of citations, Sustainability  provides much more visibility (33); on the multilateral side, World Development  ranks first (1363).       5.3 Most cited documents Fig. 6  shows the most relevant documents for both analyses, based on the total number of citations. In the field of informality and SDGs, the most cited papers are Blanco et al. (2009), Follman (2015), Jelsma et al. (2017), and Brown et al. (2016). The individual citations of these documents amount to more than 40 for each article. For the comprehensive spectrum of terms related to informality, the most cited article is by Schneider and Enste (2000) , with almost 1000 citations, followed by Roy (2005)  and Roy (2009) with 748 and 541 citations respectively, and then Friedman (2000) with 511 citations. Tahamtan et al. (2016)  argue that the quality of a paper, the journal’s impact factor, the number of co-authors, the visibility of paper, and international cooperation among authors/institutions are the most important predictors for citations for any paper. Leonidou et al. (2010)  mention that a limit of at least 25 citations per article is necessary to be representative for a domain. Vilaró et al. (2019)  reveal that increases in the number of citations could also be explained by adherence to the editorial and peer-review process.    5.4 Most productive countries Table 2  shows the countries that contributed the most to the domain of informality from the unilateral and multilateral perspectives. In the field of informality and SDGs, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and the United States are the most productive countries, while for the wider spectrum of informality-related terms and SDGs, the top countries are the United States, China, and the United Kingdom.    5.5 Author impact The authors with the most citations in the field of informality are S. Parnell and E. Pieterse. Meanwhile, F. Schneider, C. Williams, B. Torgler, and A. Roy are the most representative names across all domains of informality, comprising various forms and definitions of the phenomenon (Fig. 7 ). J. J. Boss, Z. Kovacic, and J. K. Musango, together with B. C. Rogers and S. Smit, are the authors with the largest number of publications in the field of informality, while F. Schneider, C. Williams, I. Hodornic, and R. Dell’Anno are the authors who have written the most on various aspects of informality. From the point of view of the authors’ affiliations, Cape Town University and Monash University have the highest number of publications on the relationship between informality and SDGs. Sheffield University, Oxford University, and Johannes Kepler University have the highest number of publications that analysed the complete spectrum of informality. Regarding production over time, J. R. N. Collado, M. Hirons, and R. Maconachie are shown to be reference authors for informality and SDGs. Meanwhile, C. Williams, F. Schneider, R. Dell’Anno, I. Horodnic, and A. Davidescu are the most stable authors in the field of informality as a whole in relation to sustainable development (Fig. 8 ).       5.6 Three-plot field and topic trends The Sankey diagram shown in Fig. 9  presents valuable information regarding the analysis of the relationship between sources, keywords, and authors, with the height of the rectangles providing information about the relationships between elements. The analysis addresses the research topics (authors’ keywords) of the informality that the authors explored and the sources in which they have most often been published. Thus, three authors (J. J. Bos, J. R. N. Collado, and B. C. Rogers) and three sources (World Development , Local Environment , and Risk Habitat Megacity ) are linked to the main research topics of informality and slums. Moreover, five authors (C. Williams, I. Horodnic, F. Schneider, S. Nadin, and R. Dell’Anno) and two sources (Applied Economics  and Journal of Developmental Entrepreneurship ) are closely related to the topics of ‘shadow economy’, ‘informal economy’, and ‘informal sector’. In Fig. 10 , a topic trends diagram provides an image related to the dynamics of the main topics and some insights into recent topics. The emergence of topics was also adjusted to the frequency of the number of words appearing in the research on informality. Thus, the more a word is used and the higher its location in the right part of the graphic, the more recent its usage. Therefore, ‘informality’, ‘urban informality’, and ‘sustainable development’ have been in use since 2016, while terms like ‘sustainability’ or ‘sustainable development’ and ‘goals’ emerged in 2019. From the multilateral viewpoint, ‘informal economy’, ‘shadow economy’, ‘informality’, ‘informal sector’, ‘tax morale’ and ‘tax evasion’ have gained popularity in the literature. In the last 2 years, terms such as ‘COVID-19’ and ‘sustainable development’ or ‘SDGs’ have been added.   6 Cluster analysis 6.1 Abstract word cloud analysis Abstract word cloud analysis explores valuable information from the abstracts of publications, providing insight into the main topics and research trends. Fig. 11  displays the top 50 most frequent bi-grams, revealing that in the case of the unilateral perspective, the most frequently combined words were ‘sustainable development’, ‘informal settlements’, ‘urban development’, ‘global south’, ‘developing countries’, and ‘urban informality’. For the multilateral perspective on informality, the most frequently combined words are ‘shadow economy’, ‘informal economy’, ‘informal sector’, ‘tax morale’, ‘tax evasion’, ‘tax compliance’, and ‘sustainable development’ (Fig. 11 ).  6.2 Author and document clustering by coupling The results of bibliographic coupling indicate current research perspectives from both the unilateral and multilateral viewpoints of the informality phenomenon and SDGs (Fig. 12 ). To grasp the datasets in their entirety, we apply no restrictions to the number of citations. The resultant information enables an analysis of the authors who published relevant literature on the terms ‘informality’ and ‘SDGs’. Five author coupling clusters are identified. The blue cluster includes J. Bos, F. Gimelli, and B. C. Rogers, and is led by terms such as ‘informality’, ‘framework’, and ‘governance’. The green cluster consists of M. Hirons, R. Maconachie, and N. Bernards, and is labelled as ‘formalisation’, ‘Africa’, and ‘politics. In the purple cluster, papers are identified with terms such as ‘Africa’ and ‘cities’, with respect to authors such as M. Oteng-Ababio, A. Soliman, and K. Petersen. The red cluster, consisting of authors such as Z. Kovacic, J. Musango, and S. Smit, includes words such as ‘social’, ‘city’, and ‘gender’. The orange cluster consists of authors like H. Nuissl, M. Lukas, and C. Seeger, with terms such as ‘cities’ and ‘climate-change’. From a multilateral perspective, two main clusters of authors can be highlighted. The first is the blue cluster, defined in terms of size, determinants, and estimation of the informal economy, with F. Schneider, C. Elgin, J. W. Saunoris, K. Gerxhani, and P. Bejakovic as the most relevant authors. The second is the red cluster, defined in terms of tax compliance and informality behaviours, comprising C. Williams, P. Rodgers, I. Horodnic, J. Franic, and J. Windebank as the most prominent authors.    The coupling map clustered by papers reveals three clusters from the unilateral perspective. The red cluster has cities and agriculture as the main topics, the green cluster focuses on papers addressing informality and cities, and the blue cluster focuses mainly on informality and Africa (Fig. 13 ). From a wider perspective, we can identify three clusters of papers. The red cluster is oriented towards size, corruption, and determinants of the shadow economy; the blue cluster focuses on tax morale and tax evasion; and the green cluster addresses informality behaviour.   7 Conceptual structures The conceptual structure includes network analysis, relying on keyword co-occurrence and MCA to illustrate the major research themes. 7.1 The conceptual structure map of the major themes using MCA A conceptual structure map of informality’s major themes can also provide valuable information by dividing the most frequent words using area mapping for the relationship between one word and another. Each word is placed according to the values of Dim 1 and Dim 2, resulting in a map between words with little difference in values. In MCA, the variable categories with related profiles are grouped together, whereas negatively correlated variable categories are located in the opposite quadrants of the plot origin. On the factor map, the distance between category points and the origin determines the variable quality. There are some notable differences between the two bodies of literature: one focusing solely on informality and SDGs and the other providing a wider perspective on the informality phenomenon in relation to SDGs. In the first case, we can distinguish between two main clusters: the bigger blue cluster comprising various elements of informality and SDGs, including informality, sustainable, development, and social, and the second red cluster, which is more related to urban research and cities. However, the wider perspective emphasises the existence of three clusters: the red cluster, related to the labour sector, comprising employment, gender, poverty, and migration; the blue cluster, related to the estimation of the shadow economy and comprises determinants, effect of corruption, and unemployment; and the green cluster, dedicated to literature investigating the behaviour perception of informality, including tax morale, taxation, evasion, morale, and behaviour (Fig. 14 ).    7.2 Analysis of keyword co-occurrence The evolution of the main term occurrences revealed that the terms with the highest increase in occurrences are ‘informal economy’, ‘shadow economy’, ‘informality’, and ‘informal sector’ (Fig. 15 ). The keyword co-occurrence network displayed in Fig. 16  highlights the number of occurrences of the keywords through the dimension of the box, while topic similarity is represented by the distance between the elements of individual pairs. In the analysis of informality and SDGs, six different box colours are highlighted signalling six individual clusters, with the focal points of the network being informality, urban informality, and sustainable development. Analysing the informality phenomenon from different angles and considering all the related terms used in the literature, three individual subfields of informality research are highlighted: the green subfield with the focal points of ‘informal economy’, ‘informality’, and ‘entrepreneurship’; the blue subfield, ‘tax evasion’, ‘tax morale’, and ‘tax compliance’; and the red subfield, ‘shadow economy’, ‘informal sector’, and ‘corruption’.        8 Intellectual structure based on co-citation analysis Figs. 17–19  show the results of the co-citation analysis, with each box representing an author, article, or journal in the field of informality, as viewed from different perspectives. The size of the box represents the volume of citations (the larger the box, more the author’s publications are cited), while the proximity of the boxes indicates the closeness of the relationship between the co-cited documents. 8.1 Co-citation analysis on authors The co-citation analysis among authors for the body of literature investigating the combination of the terms ‘informality’ and ‘SDGs’ reveals three main clusters with three predominant authors, A. Roy, UN-Habitat, and World Bank, and their linkages with the group of authors from their subnetwork. A. Roy, UN-Habitat, and World Bank are the nodes with the highest betweenness, showing how important these authors are in term of the average pathway between other author pairs. They also share the highest values in terms of closeness, centrality measure, and eigenvector centrality. Similarly, exploring the extended phenomenon of informality as viewed from different perspectives in relation to SDGs, F. Schneider, B. Torgler, J. Alm, and C. Williams are the most prolific authors in terms of the average pathway between other author pairs. Regarding closeness, B. Torgler, J. Alm, A. Sandmo, and B. Frey are the central nodes and have the least distance between them and all other authors. By cluster, the most relevant authors are F. Schneider, K. Gerxhani, and R. LaPorta in the blue cluster; B. Torgler, J. Alm, and A. Sandmo in the red cluster; and C. Williams, World Bank, and H. De Soto in the green cluster.  8.2 Co-citation on papers The co-citation analysis among papers for research focuses on the terms ‘informality’ and ‘SDGs’ identifies six main clusters with three primary papers—Roy (2005) , Hart (1973) , and De Soto (1989) —and their linkages with a relatively small set of papers from their subnetwork. The nodes with the highest betweenness are Roy (2005) , Hart (1973)  and De Soto (1989), indicating how important these papers are in terms of the average pathway between other pairs of papers. The same three papers have the highest values for proximity, centrality measure, and eigenvector centrality. Schneider and Enste (2000) , Allingham and Sandmo (1972) , and Maloney (2004)  are the nodes with the highest betweenness in terms of the average pathway between other pairs of papers. Schneider (2000) , Allingham and Sandmo (1972) , and Maloney (2004)  are the centre nodes in terms of proximity, with the shortest distance to all other papers. By cluster, the most relevant papers are Maloney (2004) , Williams (2006) , and Gerxhani (2004)  in the blue cluster; Schneider (2000) , Friedman et al. (2000), Buehn (2012)  in the red cluster; and Allingham and Sandmo (1972) , Alm et al. (1992) , and Torgler and Schneider (2009)  in the green cluster.  8.3 Co-citation in journals The co-citation analysis of journals in the literature on the terms ‘informality’ and ‘SDGs’ identifies two main clusters with seven primary journals. World Development  and Geoforum  are in the blue cluster, while the red cluster includes Cities , Urban Studies , Habitat International , International Journal of Urban and Regional Research , and Environment and Urbanisation  . These journals indicate the importance in terms of the average pathway between other pairs of journals and show the greatest proximity values. American Economic Review , World Development , Journal of Economic Literature , and Journal of Public Economy  are the nodes with the highest betweenness in terms of the average pathway between other pairs of journals, indicating the importance of these journals are in terms of the average pathway between other pairs of journals. The most relevant journals are American Economic Review , Journal of Economic Literature , Journal of Political Economy , and The Quarterly Journal of Economics  in the red cluster; World Development  and American Journal of Sociology  in the green cluster; Journal of Public Economy  and Public Choice  in the blue cluster; and Ecological Economics  in the purple cluster.     9 Social structure through collaboration network analysis of authors, institutions, and countries Fig. 20  shows the country collaboration map, highlighting relationships between the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and New Zealand in reference to papers on informality and SDGs. For the comprehensive spectrum of terminology, collaborative partnerships are also observed. Therefore, apart from the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, we can mention the relationships with the Western European countries, along with China and Australia. Two countries show a connection line indicating the status of collaboration between them. The scale of cooperation is represented through the thickness of the line (Mougenot and Doussoulin, 2021 ). Analysing the collaboration network for authors and institutions produced some notable results (Fig. 21 ). Thus, for research using the term ‘informality’, the collaboration network analysis reveals five main clusters, with the central cluster concentrated on Z. Kovacic, J. K. Musango, and S. Smit as the main authors, and Stellenbosch University, Nairobi University, Makerere University, and Victoria University of Wellington as the primary institutions. For the comprehensive spectrum of informality-related terms, five clusters are highlighted, among which the two most important centred around C. Williams and F. Schneider.     10 Discussion Considering the requirements of SDG implementation and the complexity of the informality issue, as well as the intensifying science-society-policy nexus, research related to informality and SDGs has become a topic of interest. The growth of various scientific studies on multiple approaches of the informal sphere reveals the awareness of the importance of this issue. Bibliometric analysis enables priorities of interest to be identified, circumscribed by the specific synergies. The main topics and research trends highlighted by the abstract word cloud analysis are ‘sustainable development’, ‘informal settlements’, ‘urban development’, ‘global south’, ‘developing countries’, and ‘urban informality’ from the unilateral perspective on informality. From the multilateral perspective, ‘shadow economy’, ‘informal economy’, ‘informal sector’, ‘tax morale’, ‘tax evasion’, ‘tax compliance’, and ‘sustainable development’ are highlighted. Regardless of how informality is included in the study, sustainable development is a priority in research. SDG implementation presupposes a coherent and adequate response from the appropriate authorities and coordinated public–private involvement, with particularisation of the directions of action and priorities according to differing national realities. Achieving goals involves creative and innovative processes that ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of global action in the context of multiple social, economic, and financial constraints, relying on an approach that transcends diversity towards an integrative purpose. The results of the unilateral analysis of informality are concretised with a priority on complex urban issues as an effect of informality. In contrast, the findings revealed by the multilateral analysis of informality address the issue of taxes, especially targeting the perceptions and behaviours of individuals by avoiding or complying with legal provisions, as the cause of informality in its various forms. The bibliographic coupling highlighted that, from a unilateral perspective, J. Bos, F. Gimelli, and B. C. Rogers with the issues of informality, framework, and governance; M. Hirons, R. Maconachie, and N. Bernards with formalisation, Africa, and politics; M. Oteng-Ababio, A. Soliman, and L. and Petersen with Africa and city-related issues; Z. Kovacic, J. Musango, and S. Smit with social issues, cities, gender; and H. Nuissl, M. Lukas, and C. Seeger with cities and climate change. From a multilateral perspective, it is found that F. Schneider, C. Elgin, J. W. Saunoris, K. Gerxhani, and P. Bejakovic focus on terms such as size, determinants, and estimation of the informal economy, and C. Williams, P. Rodgers, I. Horodnic, J. Franic, and J. Windebank on those relating to tax compliance and informality behaviours. Unlike the unilateral approach, which aims at phenomenology and implementation through policies and governance, the multilateral approach focuses on the analysis of informality from the conceptual and behavioural perspectives. Similar results are found by constructing coupling map from articles within the extant literature on informality. Analysing the relationships among sources, keywords, and authors using a Sankey diagram shows that the topics of informality and slums are addressed by J. J. Bos, J. R. N. Collado, and B. C. Rogers in World Development , Local Environment , and Risk Habitat Megacity . Meanwhile, shadow economy, informal economy, and informal sector are topics of interest for C. Williams, I. Horodnic, F. Schneider, S. Nadin, and R. Dell’Anno, with related research published in Applied Economics  and Journal of Developmental Entrepreneurship . The dynamics of the main issues revealed by the topic trends diagram constructed from the unilateral approach indicates that terms such as ‘informality’, ‘urban informality’, and ‘sustainable development’ have been used since 2016. In 2019, words like ‘sustainability’ and ‘sustainable development goals’ are added. In the multilateral approach, ’informal economy’, ‘shadow economy’, ‘informality’, ‘informal sector’, ‘tax morale’, and ‘tax evasion’ have shown increased prominence in the literature. In addition, terms such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘sustainable development’, and ‘SDGs’ have emerged as topics of interest in the last 2 years.  11 Conclusions The proliferation of the informality phenomenon with holistic interdependencies and particular manifestations, requires identification of the primary areas in which it manifests, to create a suitable framework for its transformation from a phenomenon perceived as a deviation from the norm to an innovator, catalyst of development, and creator of prosperity in compliance with ethical principles. The study makes several significant contributions in the field. It is the first bibliometric analysis in which a comparative analysis of the relationship between informality and SDGs is conducted from the multilateral perspectives of terminology. The descriptive bibliometric analysis highlights yearly trends in publications, with an increase from 2 (2014) to 28 (2020) in relation to informality and SDGs, and from 75 (2006) to 543 (2020) using a comprehensive spectrum of specific terms. Sustainability Journal  is identified as the most productive journal. Papers addressing informality are mainly published in International Journal of Urban Sustainable Development , Cities , Sustainable Urban Development , and Globalisation  , while the issue of informality across the entire spectrum is disseminated by World Development , International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy , Applied Economics , and Urban Studies . The most cited articles in the field of informality and SDGs are Blanco et al. (2009), Follman (2015), Jelsma et al. (2017), and Brown et al. (2016). For the multilateral approach to informality, Schneider and Enste (2000) , Roy (2005) , and Roy (2009) are cited most frequently. The United Kingdom, South Africa, and the United States are found to be the most productive countries in the field of informality and SDGs, while the United States, China, and the United Kingdom address the issue of informality by considering all the associated terms. The authors with a significant impact in the field of informality and SDG are found to be S. Parnell and E. Pieterse. Meanwhile, F. Schneider, C. Williams, B. Torgler, and A. Roy are influential with regard to the broad spectrum of informality. The network and cluster analyses reveal the conceptual, intellectual, and social structure of the field of informality research from a dual perspective. Regarding the conceptual structure, the keywords co-occurrence network highlight individual clusters focused on informality, urban informality, and sustainable development in the analysis of informality and SDGs. From the perspective of all related terms, the analysis foregrounds the clusters of informal economy, informality, and entrepreneurship; tax evasion, tax morale, and tax compliance; and shadow economy, informal sector, and corruption. The intellectual structure reveals the most enlightening researchers in the field. A. Roy is the reference author for discussions of informality and SDGs. Meanwhile F. Schneider, K. Gerxhani, R. LaPorta, B. Torgler, J. Alm, A. Sandmo, C. Williams, and H. DeSoto are the most visible authors with the literature on the extended spectrum of informality. In terms of the most relevant papers in the field, Roy (2005)  is the reference paper tackling informality, while Maloney (2004) , Williams (2006) , Gerxhani (2004) , Schneider (2000), Friedman et al. (2000), Buehn (2012), Allingham and Sandmo (1972), Alm et al. (1992)  and Torgler and Schneider (2009)  are the reference articles for examining informality from a wider perspective. Several prestigious journals disseminate the most relevant research in the field of informality, such as World Development , Geoforum , Environment and Urbanisation  , Urban Studies , and Habitat International . The American Economic Review , World Development , Journal of Economic Literature , and Journal of Public Economy  are among the journals with the highest number of publications on informality across a more comprehensive spectrum. Regarding social structure, the results reveal the collaboration network among countries: between the United States, the United Kingdom, South, Africa, and New Zealand in the case of informality and SDGs, and between the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, and Western Europe, China, and Australia when considering the wider range of terms used to approach informality. The collaboration network analysis highlights the existence of clusters concentrated on Z. Kovacic, J. C. Musango, and S. Smit as the main authors in the first approach, and on C. Williams and F. Schneider in the second. In conclusion, informality represents a complex phenomenon that can be addressed from different approaches and perspectives, while comprising various terminologies. It manifests itself in every country to varying extents and has gained the attention of both independent researchers and public institutions in the last periods. Due to its specificities, informality remains an open question, and future studies are needed to analyse its implications for SDG achievement. Although interest in this research field has increased, certain limitations of the extant research should be noted, including a lack of theoretical and methodological foundations regarding informality, lack of concerns in detecting causality in the research area of informality and SDGs, lack of cognitive diversity and deprivation of creative problem-solving and innovation, and low levels of academic collaboration. This enables us to identify future research directions like conceptual studies; contextualisation of analyses by SDGs, countries, regions, depending on demographic specificities; and cross-country studies for identifying and implementing good practices related to managing informality to increase efficiency in SDGs implementation.
