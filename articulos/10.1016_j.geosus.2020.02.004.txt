                  After the United Nations Agenda 2030 was officially launched in September 2015, governments around the world have taken actions to implement the ambitious plan. This paper summarizes the actions and policies taken in China for promoting the implementation of the UN’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with emphasis on promoting the development of demonstration zones for delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Chinese government has taken two types of measures. One is to formulate a series of national plans and strategies and the other is to construct pilot and demonstration zones. Two approaches were presented to optimize the selection criteria for demonstration zones: a problem-based approach; and a major function-based approach. Both provided priority regions and major themes for selection and construction of demonstration zones. Suggestions for promoting the development of demonstration zones include: (1) building a monitoring system for the implementation of SDGs in each demonstration zone and establishing an open online platform to track the progress; (2) forming an effective stakeholder participation mechanism. The experiences in constructing innovation-driven demonstration zones are insightful for other countries to take practical actions in the delivery of SDGs.

The overall goal of this initiative is for sustainable development to become the core concept guiding future economic and social development (ICSU and ISSC, 2015 ). Nearly five years after the SDGs were proposed, governments around the world are taking bold actions to implement this ambitious plan. In “measuring the gap with SDGs – assessing the level of OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries”, OECD put forward the outline of a major action plan for OECD countries to achieve this plan (OECD, 2017 ). In the report Next steps for a sustainable European future: European action for sustainability , the EU identified key actions and governance elements for the implementation of the SDGs (European Commission, 2016 ). In March 2018, the European Commission released the Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Development , which is a substantial step for the EU to promote sustainable financial development. The main purpose of the action plan is to clearly define sustainable investment. The action plan includes ten strategies under three goals and 22 specific actions, each with a timetable. The action plan recognizes the importance of risk management and incorporates sustainability into routine risk management. The African Union has identified five principles for the sustainable development of African countries: light up and empower Africa, feed Africa, industrialize Africa, integrate Africa, and improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. In addition to the 17 SDGs, Africa established its own system of SDGs called Agenda 2063, which contains 20 Goals. It is the African union's vision for a more developed, richer and more independent Africa (SDGCA and SDSN, 2018 ). Since 2016, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Bertelsmann Foundation have published four editions of the Global SDG Index and Dashboards Report (2016-2019) . The SDGs Index and SDG Dashboards shows the overall implementation of 17 SDGs through color coding for most UN countries. In 2019, the SDSN evaluated 42 countries including G20 member states, most OECD member states, the European Union and countries with more than 100 million people on several key SDG coordination and implementation indicators. According to the results of the 2019 SDSN survey, 39 of 43 countries/organizations have identified a central government lead agency or established an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate the implementation of SDGs. Government needs timely, disaggregated data on the SDGs. Given the breadth of the goals, this requires all countries to increase investment in statistical capacity and to develop national monitoring indicators to assess progress in SDG implementation. To date, only 28 of the 43 countries/organizations have developed national monitoring systems (Sachs et al.,2019 ). The UN Summit on SDGs was held in New York on September 2019. The purpose of the summit was to review and discuss how to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 ASD. One of the conclusions of the summit was that due to conflicts/wars, the climate crisis and unbalanced economic growth, human beings have deviated from the established track in promoting the realization of Sustainable Development Goals. In this regard, the General Assembly adopted a political declaration, in which the members of the UN promised to raise funds over the next ten years in order to achieve the 17 SDGs by 2030. Even though the world has deviated from the established track on the road to achieving SDGs, China has made remarkable progress in poverty alleviation, health care, education and other areas, and is expected to achieve a number of SDGs in advance (Sachs et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; Lu et al., 2019 ). Researchers found that the state of sustainable development in China is characterized by its pronounced geographic regions. Eastern provinces performed significantly better than western provinces in general. Some provinces performed badly in economy-related SDGs while other regions performed badly in environment-related SDGs (Wang et al., 2019 ). To address different challenges in different regions, a national plan to construct demonstration zones or pilot areas was proposed in China. In this paper, the policies and actions taken in China for promoting the implementation of the UN’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development were reviewed, with emphasis on promoting the development of demonstration zones for delivery of the SDGs. It is insightful for other countries to follow up with the construction of demonstration zones.  2 China's initiatives to implement the 2030 ASD The Chinese government takes sustainable development as a basic national policy and is working to comprehensively implement the 2030 ASD. At present, China has made remarkable progress in poverty alleviation, health care, education and other aspects, and is expected to achieve a number of SDGs in advance of the 2030 target date (Lu, et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Over the past few years, the Chinese government has focused on two types of measures; one is to formulate national plans and strategies; and the second is to construct pilot demonstration areas. 2.1 National strategies and plans for the implementation of SDGs The Chinese government has responded positively to the UN's 2030 ASD. At the fourth session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) in March 2016, the 13th Five-year Plan was adopted, integrating the sustainable development agenda with China's Long and Medium-term Social and Economic Development Plan. In September 2016, the Chinese government released China's National Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 ASD. By combining sustainable development with domestic medium- and long-term development plans, China is working to promote the implementation of SDGs. China has incorporated 17 SDGs and 169 targets into the National Development Master Plan, and linked them into the detailed plans of various governmental departments (Table S1). Poverty alleviation is a good example of China's progress on the SDGs. Since the 1980s, the Chinese government has been carrying out large-scale, planned and well organized rural-centered poverty alleviation and development and has made significant progress. Even with significant reductions, the incidence of poverty and the remaining poor population are characterized by relatively dispersed distribution. The central government has issued the decision to win the fight against poverty, the 13th Five-year Plan for Poverty Alleviation and Guidelines for the three-year campaign to win the fight against poverty. The central ministries issued nearly 200 policy documents and implementation plans focused on reducing poverty through industrial restructuring; population relocation; labor export, transportation upgrades; water conservancy; improved education, health care, financial assistance home renovation, and asset enhancements. From 2013 to 2018 funds allocated by the central government for poverty alleviation increased from 39.4 to 106.1 billion yuan. Government funding at the provincial (or lower) levels for poverty alleviation also increased substantially (MFA of the PRC, 2019 ).  2.2 Construction of innovation-driven demonstration zones Since the 1978 Reform and Opening-up policy, China has actively carried out experiments related to sustainable development including: eco-cities, low-carbon cities, eco-industrial parks and eco-agriculture demonstration counties, and has achieved positive results. The establishment of the China National Sustainable Communities led by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) is an important practice of sustainable development in China. The Comprehensive Experimental Area for Social Development was established in 1986. It was a local pilot project initiated to solve the problems of rapid economic growth, but relatively slow social progress and ecological deterioration. It aimed to strengthen the coordination between economic development, social progress, and environmental protection by relying on institutional innovation and the promotion and application of science and technology. In 1997 the China National Sustainable Communities were established on the basis of the Comprehensive Experimental Area for Social Development launched in 1986. By the end of 2016, 189 China National Sustainable Communities had been established. In recent years, the promotion and implementation of the SDGs have given rise to technological innovation supporting sustainable development. The State Council promulgated the China's plan to establish innovation-driven demonstration zones for implementing the UN's 2030 ASD on December 3, 2016 (Fig. 1  ). China plans to establish innovation-driven demonstration zones for implementing the SDGs. The demonstration zone selection process is shown in Fig. 2  . As of January 2020, China has identified six pilot zones. Each innovation-driven demonstration zone has its own specific critical problems for achieving sustainable development. To address these problems, the demonstration zones are required to make a long-term strategic plan for the delivery of SDGs by 2030 and to develop a detailed three-year action plan to achieve the region-specific targets, including major themes for the demonstration zone, critical problem identification, construction objectives, systems solutions to the bottle-neck problems, targets and indicator measurement, funding and coordination mechanism and institutional support (Fig. 3  ). For example, in April 2012, Lincang City was approved as a China National Sustainable Community (CNSC). In recent years, economic growth and resident income in Lincang have grown rapidly. However, Lincang is still an underdeveloped area with significantly lower per capita GDP and household income than the national average as shown in Figs. 4  and 5   . The State Council, in 2019, approved Lincang to establish the national innovation-driven demonstration zones for implementing the 2030 ASD. The major theme of Lincang's Demonstration Zone is the innovation-driven development with less developed ethnic groups. Lincang faces the challenge of the weak transformation of region specific resources to economic growth. In the future, Lincang plans to integrate applications of green energy, green and efficient agricultural production, efficient utilization of forestry resources and modern information technology. Lincang will speed up infrastructure development in line with national strategies, promote green industries that place equal emphasis on development and protection, open the transboundary economy, fight against poverty, promote rural revitalization and enhance the inheritance and development of ethnic cultures.   3 Optimizing the selection criteria for demonstration zones The State Council of China promulgated “China's plan to establish innovation-driven demonstration zones for implementing the UN's 2030 ASD” in December 2016. However, only three requirements were put forward in this plan (Fig. 2 ). In this section, two approaches are provided for optimizing the selection criteria for demonstration zones. 3.1 Problem-based approach After the 2030 ASD was proposed, some studies have attempted to assess the progress of sustainable development at China's provincial level (Xu et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). These studies found that the state of sustainable development in China varies by geographic region. In general, Eastern provinces performed significantly better than western provinces. However, the results of SDGs vary greatly. Some provinces performed badly in economic-related SDGs, while other regions performed badly in environmentally-related SDGs. Thus we propose an approach to select pilot areas for national innovation-driven demonstration zones for implementing the “2030 ASD”. Based on Xu et al. (2020)  and Wang et al. (2019) , we suggest the bottom 10% provinces for each SDG are taken as reference areas (Table 1   and Figure 6  ). As pilot areas are usually at city-level, pilot cities could be chosen in each of these bottom provinces.  3.2 Major function-based approach In 2010, the State Council of China issued the National Plan for Functional Zones. The plan is a strategic, fundamental and binding plan for the use of China's territorial space. The purpose of the plan is to provide a coordinated national spatial pattern for population, economy, resources and the environment (Fan et al., 2009 ; Fan et al., 2012 ). According to intensity of use, the plan divides China into four types of exploitation areas: optimizing; key; restricted; and prohibited. Furthermore, China's territorial space is divided into three major functional areas: urbanization; agricultural production; and ecological security. In Fig. 7  , we show specific themes for the different functional areas. According to the National Plan for Functional Zones, we made a map (Fig. 8  ) to show the urbanization area, the agricultural production area and the ecological security area. Using this map we can roughly determine what kind of functional area a city is located in. Both of these approaches could be used to identify priority regions (Figs. 6  and 8 ) and suggest targets/themes (Table 1  and Fig. 7 ) for the selection and construction of demonstration zones. The major difference between them is that the selection criteria of the problem-based approach focuses on the challenges the demonstration zones face, while the major function-based approach focuses on demonstration zones’ strengths.   4 Ensuring success in developing demonstration zones 4.1 Demonstration zone monitoring systems Monitoring and evaluating progress are critical for the implementation of SDGs at different levels (Lu et al., 2015 ). In September 2016, the Chinese government released China's National Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 ASD, which contains the measures China will take and the goals it plans to achieve for each SDG between 2015-2030. However, the plan does not provide a complete set of indicators for monitoring each SDG. It is critically important to establish a monitoring system at the national level. Therefore, it is suggested that the Chinese government should establish a monitoring system for the delivery of SDGs adapted to China's conditions as soon as possible. The data for the system would come from official statistics, big data, remote sensing and satellite images among others. It should be noted that the interrelationship between different SDGs indicators may be negative and conflicting, such as inter-index conflict, semantic ambiguity, lack of time constraint and quantitative requirements. Therefore, developing a science-based indicator system for monitoring SDG progress is research that needs to be done urgently (Lu et al., 2018 ). Setting up an online platform for monitoring SDG indicators is commonly used by many countries. An online platform is not only efficient for releasing indicators and data, but it can also allow stakeholders and citizens to participate in and track SDG implementation. Online platforms have been set up in the United States and United Kingdom (https://sdg.data.gov/ ; https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io ). These online platforms not only provide the statistical results of the indicators, but also shows basic data related to the target. In Ireland, another country with an online platform, access to geospatial data and statistics, data visualization tools and related web applications are provided through their SDGs data center (http://irelandsdg.geohive.ie ).  4.2 Developing effective stakeholder participation mechanism The implementation of the SDGs cannot be designed and implemented by government alone. Every socio-economic transition requires broad public recognition and support. Stakeholder cooperation and consultation is needed to involve citizen groups, focus groups, expert groups and various other interest groups (consumer associations, trade unions, business associations, among others). China needs to develop mechanisms for stakeholder involvement and is cooperatively undertaken by government, business, and academia. Finland's citizen group mechanism is a good example. The Finnish citizens’ group uses an online tool to evaluate the current state of sustainable development trends in Finland. Expert analysis and citizen opinions were used to evaluate 40 sustainable development indicators for Finland. Following this example, we can carry out a citizen group evaluation for our indicator system. The evaluation includes determining the current situation and recent development trends for each indicator. The current situation options include: good, medium and poor, while the options for evaluating trends are: progressive, stable, and regressive. In addition, each citizen group member is required to comment on the status of the indicator, including opinions and suggestions (Table 2  ). In general, China's growth is reflected in positive outcomes for the UN SDGs, such as reducing poverty (SDG 1 and 2) and increasing employment opportunities by promoting population migration and urbanization (SDG 8 and 11) and economic growth (SDG 8 and 9). Further progress has been made in improving health and welfare (SDG 3), reduced gender equality (SDG 5), and eliminating gender disparity in education (SDG 4) which is a key indicator of sustainable prosperity (Lu, et al., 2019 ). For a specific region like a province, city or county, SDGs and the extent to which SDGs have been achieved may differ. Therefore, different kinds of innovation-driven demonstration zones are required to set up reasonable goals and targets, monitor and evaluate progress, and ensure the successful delivery of SDGs, and further generate large outreach impacts.   5 Conclusions While many countries have not made significant progress on achieving SDGs, China is expected to set an example by achieving a number of SDGs, having made excellent progress in poverty alleviation, health care and education. China has taken sustainable development as a national strategy, taking a portfolio of policies and actions for promoting the implementation of the UN 2030 ASD, with emphasis on promoting the construction of innovation-driven demonstration zones for the delivery of the SDGs. To better manage the demonstration zones, both problem-based and major function-based approaches will be used to optimize the selection criteria for demonstration zones and to identify key provinces and suggested targets for the construction of demonstration zones. The key to ensuring the success in the construction of demonstration zones lies in: (1) building a monitoring system for SDGs at the demonstration zone level and establishing an open online platform to track SDG progress; and (2) developing an effective stakeholder participation mechanism. This experience will help guide other countries to get on the path to achieving their SDGs.   Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.
