               This chapter describes the actions through which the Alpine Convention—an international treaty between the eight Alpine countries as well as the European Union—is addressing climate change and the related issues of soil protection and natural hazards. The described actions, combined with the specific governance of the Alpine Convention, provide a concrete contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The challenges that the Alps are facing are similar to the ones that other mountain areas of the world are facing; therefore, the solutions developed by the Alpine region can be of inspiration for mountain ranges globally.

The challenges that the Alps are facing are similar to the ones that other mountain areas of the world are facing; therefore, the solutions developed by the Alpine region can be of inspiration for mountain ranges globally.   Keywords Alps  Alpine Convention  sustainable development goals  mountain governance  climate change  soil consumption  risk governance  natural hazards   The Alpine Convention: addressing transnational challenges and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals  The Alps, a mountain range at the core of Europe, house unique biodiversity and ecosystems in their roughly 190,700 km² span. The Alps also host human settlements and diverse economic activities spread across eight countries (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland). Due to the specific Alpine topography, however, these settlements and activities are not distributed homogeneously across the territory (Permanent Secretariat of the Alpine Convention, 2015 ). More densely populated areas, rich in settlements, infrastructure, and economic activities, contrast with more scarcely populated areas experiencing population loss and the abandonment of important sectors. The sensitive Alpine environment is under pressure from several drivers, one of the main being climate change. Like most mountain ranges in the world, the Alps are particularly affected by climate change and will, under intermediate scenarios, experience a further temperature increase of up to 2°C over the next 30 years (Fig. 26.1  ) in addition to the already experienced temperature rise of around 2°C since the beginning of industrialization. The specific topography of the Alpine area aggravates the impacts of climate change, combining it with land-use changes and a high exposure of populations and infrastructure to natural hazards. Considering that the environmental challenges facing the Alps do not stop at national borders, effective responses require transnational coordination to set a clearer and more coherent field of action for stakeholders and to facilitate the exchange of good practices. This is the aim of the Alpine Convention, an international treaty for the protection and sustainable development of the Alps, signed in 1991 by the Alpine countries and the European Union (EU). The Convention is a legal instrument that, through its Protocols, specifically addresses several major sectors and activities that have significant repercussions on the Alpine environment and population.1  1 Spatial planning and sustainable development, Mountain farming, Nature protection and landscape conservation, Mountain forests, Tourism, Energy, Soil conservation, Transport.   The Alpine countries and the EU continuously implement the Alpine Convention through the work of its bodies, such as the Thematic Working Bodies,2  2 The Thematic Working Bodies are constituted by experts nominated by the Contracting Parties and the Observers (associations and organizations who participate in the work of the Convention). The Alpine Conference sets their mandates to work on topics of interest to the Convention. There are currently nine active Thematic Working Bodies.   as well as through concrete projects and initiatives (Alpine, 2021a ). The results of this transnational work are approved at the Alpine Conference, which meets at the ministerial level and sets the guidelines for future action.  Although the Convention entered into force earlier than the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are substantial commonalities between the SDGs and the Convention regarding the key actions for sustainable development. The Convention is therefore a living example of the concrete implementation of the SDGs on a transnational scale in a mountain area. The link is especially strong between the Convention activities and the SDGs focusing on climate change, soil protection, and natural hazards; the following paragraphs explore these interlinkages.  Climate change mitigation and adaptation in the Alps and SDG 13 “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts” While being extremely vulnerable to climate change, the Alps serve as an inspiration for tailored solutions, drawing on their natural resources and lessons learned from their human settlement history. The Alpine Convention concentrates its work on mainstreaming climate issues in all policies and activities, developing joint climate strategies and activities in the Alpine countries. The Alpine Climate Board (ACB), established in 2016, brings these efforts under one roof. Composed of representatives from all Alpine countries and several Alpine Convention Observer organizations, the ACB bundles the Convention’s climate action knowledge and activities.  Drawing on a range of experiences from different Alpine contexts and sectors, the ACB established the Alpine Climate Target System 20503  3 Adopted by the XV Alpine Conference in 2019.   that sets the objective of climate-neutral and climate-resilient Alps for 2050. It promotes a transition based on the Alpine cultural and natural heritage, on integrated and transnational action as well as on Alpine cobenefits (Permanent Secretariat of the Alpine Convention, 2019a ). While the Target System is embedded in the existing legal framework of the Alpine Convention, the UNFCCC process, and Paris Agreement, as well as national and European legislation, it focuses on the added value of an Alpine-specific approach. The Alpine Climate Target System 2050 contributes to the objectives of the SDGs, especially SDG 13 on taking urgent climate action (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015b ). It does so by going beyond individual national policies to the formulation of joint actions at a transnational level in 10 relevant sectors4  4 Spatial planning, energy, transport, natural hazards, tourism, ecosystems and biodiversity, mountain forests, mountain agriculture, water, and soil.   and 2 cross-cutting areas5  5 Municipal action, research and development.  ; this is complemented by an operational communication pillar. The strength of this approach lies in the qualitative, but verifiable objectives for 2050 which the Target System outlines for each sector; in this way, cooperation between the organs of the Alpine Convention is facilitated and climate action in the Alps is given a clear sense of direction toward climate neutrality and climate resilience. Moreover, to guide the implementation of the Alpine Climate Target System 2050, the ACB, involving the Alpine Convention’s Thematic Working Bodies as well as other experts, subsequently designed a set of 30 implementation pathways , sequences of short- to medium-term measures that advance progress toward achieving the 2050 targets. Among these 30 implementation pathways, the ACB identified 16 priority pathways that are at the heart of the Alpine Convention’s Climate Action Plan 2.06  6 Adopted by the XVI Alpine Conference in 2020.   (Permanent Secretariat of the Alpine Convention, 2021 ). The Climate Action Plan 2.0 formulates the priorities and actions to be promoted by the Contracting Parties of the Alpine Convention over the next 5–10 years (Fig. 26.2  ). The document is centered on the specific challenges and opportunities in the Alpine region, as well as on the need to complement regional, national, and global strategies for climate action. This approach is well suited to a transnational mountain range and showcases the benefits of seeking out holistic yet context-specific solutions. Moreover, the uptake of the Action Plan, while monitored by the ACB, is being pursued by sectoral communities gathering a broader range of stakeholders. Through its approach, the Action Plan has already proven useful in reinforcing synergies among the different Alpine Convention bodies, for example in better coordinating the contributions of the Thematic Working Bodies of the Alpine Convention to climate action (Alpine Climate Board, 2020 ).  Quantitative soil protection in the Alps as a contribution to SDG 15 “Life on Land” The limited availability of settlement space in the Alps, combined with soil consumption by human activities, drives the continuous loss of healthy soils. Increasing land-use demand and land degradation are especially concentrated around suitable areas, mostly located in the Alpine valleys. Soil degradation has much in common with climate change as a cross-sectoral challenge with no simple solutions. Its impacts also cut across generations because degraded soil normally cannot be restored during a human lifetime. Sustainable coordination of the multiple land-use demands, as well as the involvement of all levels—local, regional, national, and international—with a long-term perspective is therefore crucial. Several activities toward better safeguarding soil in the Alps have taken place in recent years in the scope of the Alpine Convention, actively contributing to SDG 15 “Life on land7  7 For readability, the condensed title of SDG 15 has been used. The full title of SDG 15 is “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.”  ”—more specifically to Target 15.3, “Striving to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030” (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015c ). The Alpine Convention Protocols “Soil conservation” and “Spatial planning and sustainable development” provide the main legal framework for these activities, while several Convention bodies oversee the coordination of efforts at the Alpine level (Alpine Convention, 1994; Alpine Convention, 1998 ). An important achievement has been the in-depth review by the Convention’s Compliance Committee8  8 The Compliance Committee of the Alpine Convention monitors the Contracting Parties’ compliance with their commitments under the Alpine Convention and its Protocols.   on the topic of “economical use of soil” as laid down in the relevant Protocols.9  9 Protocol “Soil conservation” of the Alpine Convention Article 7, as well as Protocol “Spatial planning and sustainable development” of the Alpine Convention Article 9 paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.   The review included urgent recommendations to set “binding guidelines   for municipalities to effectively contain soil/land consumption” and to set quantitative targets for this consumption, both at a local as well as at a regional and intermunicipal level (Compliance Committee of the Alpine Convention, 2019 ). The Soil Protection Working Group, established in 2019, plays a central role in furthering this work. The Working Group has emphasized the need to improve the implementation of the Protocols as well as to monitor land degradation in Alpine areas in a comparable way (Soil Protection Working Group of the Alpine Convention, 2020 ). Similarly to the Alpine Climate Board, the Soil Protection Working Group is involving other thematic bodies and networks (such as Action Group 6 of the EU Strategy for the Alpine region—EUSALP—and the Alpine Soil Partnership) in its further activities.  An innovative perspective on natural hazards in the Alps: risk governance and SDG 11 “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” The previously mentioned scarcity of settlement-suitable soil exposes the Alpine population to natural hazards such as river and flash floods, avalanches, rockfalls, debris flows, and landslides. These can potentially jeopardize human lives and activities and are becoming both more frequent and more intense due to climate change (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2019 ). Natural hazards are accorded importance in the foundations of the Alpine Convention (Framework Convention, Art. 2.b) (Alpine Convention, 1991 ), whereas the Protocol “Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development” focuses on the issue in more detail (Alpine Convention, 1994 ). Early on, a Working Group dealing with natural hazards (PLANALP) was established. A recent outcome of its work has been the “7th  Report on the State of the Alps on natural hazard risk governance” (RSA 7),10  10 Adopted by the XV Alpine Conference in 2019.   which provides a status-quo analysis of natural-hazard risk governance across the Alps, compiling best practice examples as well as recommendations for improving risk governance (Permanent Secretariat of the Alpine Convention, 2019b ). The focus on risk governance is well tailored to the complexity and challenging accessibility of the Alpine area and adds value to existing responses to natural-hazard risks (such as spatial planning and structural measures). It also tends to be more effective than predominantly state-led hazard and risk-management systems. This approach is foundational for achieving SGD 11 and enhances resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters, thus contributing to SDG 13 as well (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015a, 2015b ). This approach also recalls the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction, which calls for a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to preventing and reducing hazard exposure and vulnerability to disaster. The examples of best practices in implementing risk governance in the Alps analyzed in the RSA 7 demonstrate that the concept is already applied across the Alps and offers concrete advantages. For instance, results show that including experts from different fields, local authorities, and policymakers as well as the general public in discussions about the governance of natural-hazard risk not only raises awareness about the hazards, but also leads to a better understanding of their underlying mechanisms and, consequently, a higher tolerance for the impacts of different mitigation and prevention measures. Moreover, examples demonstrate the potential in complementing insufficient structural measures with nonstructural ones, such as adequate monitoring and enhancing local knowledge based on past events. Finally, implementing hazard-sensitive, land-use planning drawing on natural-hazard risk maps can allow areas affected by a natural-hazard event to build back better while at the same time addressing the issue of land degradation. This in turn can help alleviate the pressure on Alpine soils by allowing the land time and space to be restored.  Conclusions The overview presented in this chapter provides a brief insight into some of the ways in which the Alpine Convention is actively contributing to the implementation of the SDGs on climate change and the two related issues of soil consumption and natural hazards. Moreover, and in further areas of its work as well, the Alpine Convention is also concretely contributing to the advancement of SDG 17, which focuses on establishing partnerships for the Goals. Each of the activities described in this chapter is the result of extensive transnational cooperation between the different bodies and organs of the Alpine Convention, often involving partners beyond the ones specifically identified in the  treaty as well as diverse stakeholders. The outcomes outlined here—a new Climate Action Plan, spotlighting the crucial role of healthy soils for the Alpine region, an innovative approach to dealing with natural hazards—require dedication to finding joint solutions to the Alpine problems. The Alpine Convention is the framework for all these activities. Although the Convention is first and foremost a legally binding instrument, the activities presented in this chapter show how it can give impulse on several levels of implementation, going well beyond the mere legal aspects, encompassing diverse cooperation processes and bodies and producing a wide range of results applicable at all governance levels, from the international to the local. This holistic approach focused on cooperation across national borders and on thinking across specific sectors is part of what makes the Alpine Convention unique yet successful for environmental protection and the promotion of sustainable development in a transnational mountain area. The challenges addressed in the Alps are comparable to those in mountain ranges worldwide; similarly, their solutions can only be achieved through an intersectoral and, often, a transnational approach. Although the solution of establishing an internationally binding treaty may not be directly replicated nor may be the most suitable governance solution for all mountain areas around the world, the Alpine Convention’s principles, structure, concrete actions, and results can be of inspiration so that the future for mountain regions globally is defined by sustainability.
