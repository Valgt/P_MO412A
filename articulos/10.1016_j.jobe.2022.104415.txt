                  The United Nations (UN) has introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) intending to achieve a conventional trio of social, economic, and environmental prosperity across the world. Pakistan is making a fair contribution to SDG achievement under its ‘Vision 2025’. However, the introduced strategy for SDG implementation is a sectoral based approach which leads to severe resource inefficiency. The objective of this study is the development and implementation of a nexus strategy of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) in Pakistan due to their indepth interlinkage and interdependence, to achieve sustainability in Energy, Water, and Environment. This study comprises an onfield Energy-Water-Sustainability assessment of 24 public sector premises across Punjab to create a pilot model for future implementation. The Pearson correlation analysis of the SDGs substantiates the argument of the nexus approach. The results of this work show the energy conservation potential of approximately 12.8 MW and renewable energy installation potential of 40.4 MW to achieve SDG 7. Moreover, rainwater harvesting is calculated to be 0.035 million cm3 per annum, contributing to approximately 7% reduction in water use to achieve SDG 6 and minimizing the environmental impact on cities by reducing 14.8 million tons of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) per annum to achieve SDG 11 and 13. The results show that due to indepth interlinkage, the nexus implementation approach enhances the execution process while eliminating resource duplication to reduce inefficiency.

Department of Mechanical, Mechatronics and Manufacturing Engineering, New Campus, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan. Department of Mechanical Mechatronics and Manufacturing Engineering New Campus University of Engineering and Technology Lahore Pakistan       The United Nations (UN) has introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) intending to achieve a conventional trio of social, economic, and environmental prosperity across the world. Pakistan is making a fair contribution to SDG achievement under its ‘Vision 2025’. However, the introduced strategy for SDG implementation is a sectoral based approach which leads to severe resource inefficiency. The objective of this study is the development and implementation of a nexus strategy of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) in Pakistan due to their indepth interlinkage and interdependence, to achieve sustainability in Energy, Water, and Environment. This study comprises an onfield Energy-Water-Sustainability assessment of 24 public sector premises across Punjab to create a pilot model for future implementation. The Pearson correlation analysis of the SDGs substantiates the argument of the nexus approach. The results of this work show the energy conservation potential of approximately 12.8 MW and renewable energy installation potential of 40.4 MW to achieve SDG 7. Moreover, rainwater harvesting is calculated to be 0.035 million cm3  per annum, contributing to approximately 7% reduction in water use to achieve SDG 6 and minimizing the environmental impact on cities by reducing 14.8 million tons of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) per annum to achieve SDG 11 and 13. The results show that due to indepth interlinkage, the nexus implementation approach enhances the execution process while eliminating resource duplication to reduce inefficiency.

The 17 SDGs have been put forward to promote sustainability, inclusiveness and economic wellbeing of the society. The SDGs are further shared into 169 specific targets and 232 indicators [3 ]. The developing countries, including the South East Asian countries and sub-Saharan African countries, have adopted sectoral policies that deal independently with every goal, completely ignoring the close interdependency amongst them. The literature indicates that the significant barriers towards the collective remedial approach towards the climatic action, affordable and clean energy, sustainable communities and efficiency in water use faces barriers i.e. collaboration between the individuals of cross-discipline, the complexity of the interconnection of four domains, economic aspects, weak political motivation and primitive institutional structures that are incompetent to deal with an issue this complex [4 ]. The sectoral approach devised for the resource management in SDGs creates inequity and mostly duplication in the resource allocation, which negatively affects the resource use, adversely impacting the cause. The increasing energy demands and scarcity of water in the Asian and African regions are exponentially increasing the energy demand that is attributed to the climatic changes in the world. The MDGs of the past and currently the SDGs in detail tend to address this issue [5 ]. Greater recognition and understanding of the issue alongside the thoughtful approach over the effects of climatic change on this nexus alongside cross-disciplinary collaboration and strong political will can create enough momentum to bypass the existing barriers. The 17 SDGs address basic human rights, human needs and an approach to save nature. The presented nexus approach directly overlaps with the sub-goals of four SDGs, i.e. SDG 6, 7, 11 and 13. The climatic changes and environmental problems are still not under the priority inclusion of political and economic manifestos of developing countries. The evidence indicates that the developing countries are most vulnerable to this issue affecting the living quality and economic growth [6 ]. As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, it is estimated that an increment of 1.0 °C has occurred due to the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions above the pre-industrial level. This trend indicates the rise up to 1.5 °C between the years 2030–2052. SDG 11 and 13 address the climatic change and Life on Earth [7 ]. The SDG 13 intends to incorporate the environmental cause into the mainstream national policies and political manifestos. Over the past few years, some of the countries have started adopting sustainable development measures, including energy security and efficiency, green transport and better land-use policy to cater for these issues, but a lot has to be done. The integration of climate change with the economic and political manifesto of the developing countries is the only evident plan to deal with this emergency. This work develops employs a novel methodology that vests four SDGs together for the first time for the nexus implementation in Pakistan. The methodology targets implementation in public sector facilities for better execution and effective results obtainment for benchmarking. The approach focuses on targeting the low hanging fruits first in these domains by the identification of improvement areas and achieving substantial goals, i.e. energy conservation, energy resource management, renewable energy, water conservation and their impacts on the improvement of sustainability and Green House Gas (GHG) mitigation. This approach can be sought for the development of priority and allocation policy regarding the SDGs to ensure maximum impact. 1.1 Nexus implementation of SDGs Across the globe, several challenges which are deeply interconnected have been individually addressed which tends to cater one issue while enhancing the others. The Nexus approach however tends to address several issues and sectors simultaneously. ‘Water and Energy’ are the most employed combinations forming various nexus approaches. Several types of researches have been conducted to observe the synergy tradeoff from the micro and macro level [8 ,9 ]. Several research studies have been carried out to access the water and energy nexus and their integration with other aspects for future research. Dai et al. [10 ] have conducted a review study of more than 50 tools and methodologies as a macro-assessment for the water-energy nexus. The study suggests developing a consensus to design the governance support for the development and better classification of the strengths to develop policy guidelines. A study conducted by Ding et al. [11 ] assessed the transformation of water and energy nexus in the last decade while bringing into the spotlight the importance of the nexus approach. Lee et al. [12 ], Fen et al. [11 ], and Ahmad et al. [13 ] discussed water-energy nexus in a broader perspective regarding the urban water-energy requirements and global risks linked. Research conducted by Endo et al. [14 ] and Del Borghi et al. [15 ] highlights the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus and how it's highly scalable for a practical approach. Expanding the nexus approach, Li et al. [16 ] have highlighted the benefits of energy-carbon-water nexus on the economy, environment and water quality improvement. The nexus reviews of four components are comparatively rare in the literature. Research conducted by Fader et al. [17 ] suggested that achieving the water targets (SDG-6) can directly contribute considerably to most of the SDGs. Bleischwitz et al. [4 ], in their work, depicted extensive interlinkages across SGDs, i.e. SDG2, SDG6, SDG7, SDG11, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14 and SDG15. The Nexus approach is regarded as important for the efficient implementation of SDGs. Fig. 1   presents the prominent nexus approaches available in the literature. Energy has been a notable issue in the modern world in regard to catering for the needs keeping in view the aspect of a sustainable environment. With the increase in global population and the advent of industrialization, the energy demand is increasing exponentially. By the year 2050, it is forecasted that the world population will grow by 20–25%, with the electricity generation increasing up to 120–150% of that in 2010 to cater for the demands [18 ]. The current scenario of the World Energy Generation Mix has the largest generation composition of thermal generation, forming almost 80% of the mix. Energy generation and transportation collectively make up 39% of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the world [19 ]. China, the United States and India have the largest carbon dioxide emission statistics of the world, cumulatively producing an alarming figure of 16,104 million Metric Tons, i.e. 49% of the overall emissions of the world [20 ]. Since the start of the millennium, Pakistan is also facing serious energy challenges posing threats to living standards. Pakistan tops the oil-based expensive energy production in the South Asian region. Research indicates that energy consumption and economic growth has a direct relation. However, energy efficiency and environmental loading intensity tend to reduce simultaneously with it. Pakistan is a high fossil fuels reliant country that makes about approximately 80% of the energy supply. Domestic oil fulfills almost one-sixth of the demand. The remaining demand is fulfilled by the imported oil [4 ,5 ]. The imported oil increases the expenditure bill and also makes the country highly dependent which if reduced, will pose positive impacts on the country's economy [21 ]. Similar to the trends observed across the world, the economic development of Pakistan is highly dependent on the energy used. The resultant of this use is CO2  emission which has been known as a cause of stress on the environment. The increase in urbanization and rapid population growth have increased environmental degradation, negatively impacting economic development [22 ,23 ]. SDG 7 deals with this issue that aims to provide affordable energy access to all with the integration of renewable energy in the mix. The concept of energy security revolved around four main components i.e. accessibility, availability, acceptability and affordability to energy resources [24 ]. In order to cater for the adverse impacts of the oil imports to meet the energy demands, Pakistan is exploring the indigenous untapped renewable energy resources available in the form of hydroelectric, solar and wind to fulfil its energy and economic needs [25 ]. For this purpose, the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) has been established under the guidelines to promote the inclusion of renewable energy [26 ]. The objectives included enhancement of the renewable energy technologies, initialization of incentives for the private sector to increase the chunk of investment to enable public sector investment in these projects [25 ]. This paper focuses on the achievement of energy conservation and the prospects of sustainability in the energy sector via RE integration. The issue of water scarcity is getting worse day by day. UNESCO states that around 3.6 billion people worldwide are living in water-scarce areas that almost form half of the total world population. It is estimated that by 2050, the figure will increase to 4.8–5.7 billion [27 ]. World Bank states that 68% of the entire population on earth has access to basic sanitation while the rest suffers. However, only 39% of those having access to sanitation comes under the bracket of safe sanitation measures [28 ]. The SDG 6 deals with the aspects of clean water and sanitation that include access to clean drinking water, water quality improvement, and enhancement of water efficiency and safely managed sanitation. This paper focuses on the potential of clean water conservation in hospitals and academic institutes, which are major water stress points. Day by day, increasing urbanization can be regarded key social transformation this human history has faced. The cities play a key role in this due to their economic and biophysical diverse processes spread worldwide. It is estimated that the world's cities only occupy about three per cent of the earth's covered land but still makes up about 75% of the entire world's energy consumption and emissions. Therefore, the behavior of cities is the determinant of how the world moves towards sustainability in all its indicators, i.e. economic, social, and environmental [29 ]. An estimate by the UN states that by the year 2050, almost 66% of the world's entire population will settle in the urban region, creating extensive challenges regarding air pollution in the cities, congestions, municipal waste management and health. It is estimated that in the United States, 65% of the overall energy consumption are accounted by these. In contrast, in the European regions, the consumption is 42%. Subsequently, CO2  emissions from these settlements account for nearly 35–40% of total emissions and EU as well US [30 ]. The high energy resource utilization tends to cause high emissions and generated need to save and conserve energy for sustainable development.  1.2 Pakistan approaching the SDG's After the introduction of Sustainable Development Goals in the year 2015, Pakistan was one of the several countries who stood together and endorsed it globally. Sustainable development goals have been approved for inclusion in the national development agenda of Pakistan. A dedicated secretariat has been formed comprising of Parliamentarians, making Pakistan one the few to make it a part of legislation and mainstreaming it [31 ]. The intra institution framework for the co-ordination and effective management is explained in Fig. 2  . The institutional mechanism developed for the coordination of SDGs in Pakistan focuses on the mainstreaming of the SDGs in development projects. The reporting of data is an important step in this for efficient cross coordination between the various departments of the government and effective monitoring. The finance allocation is an important step and is to be streamlined as per SDGs while promoting innovation in implementation. A report published by International Monetary Fund (IMF) states that in order to achieve SDGs in the critical sector, Government of Pakistan (GoP) is required to spend almost 16.1% of its GDP in the year 2030. In this regard, for the achievement of SDG-6, an amount of US$55billion is required i.e. spending 2% of GDP from 2020 to 2030 while for the SDG-7, Pakistan has to invest $24.5 billion i.e. 0.7% of the GDP from year 2020–2030 [33 ]. Table 1   depicts the current allocation of budget for the SDGs by the GoP under Public Sector Development Projects (PSDP) projects for fiscal year (FY) 2019–2020 and FY 2020–2021. The 17 SDGs are further categorized under Priority I, Priority II, and Priority III. The developed nexus encompasses the goals under all three priorities i.e. Affordable and Clean Energy, Clean Water and Sanitation from Priority I, Sustainable Cities from the Priority II, and Climatic action from priority III.   2 Methodology The nexus implementation of SDGs is evident for optimal resource optimization. However, the key is the development of linkage between the goals, subgoals, indicators and the development of their direct and In-direct linkages. Fig. 3   depicts the nexus linkages developed of the SDGs in the study. In this study, the direct interlinkage exists between all four SDGs with their sub-goals connected, depicting the nature of complex inter-linkages. Table S1  [37 ,38 ] given in supplementary information file  depicts the linkage mechanism of SDGs as given in Fig. 3 , their sub-goals and indicators. The scope of nexus approach and SDGs interlinkage can be attributed to synergies and tradeoffs between goals, sub-goals and the relevant indicators. The interlinkages between the SDGs are either direct or in-direct which connects via another target. Causality is one of the tools which is employed by the researchers to determine the cause and the effect. This research intends to develop a nexus implementation approach in order to enhance the implementation, optimal resource allocation and to conserve the financial pool. In order to map the nexus, a co-relation analysis of the 4 SDGs for Pakistan is conducted. Due to the conceptual complexity of the SDGs Nexus it has been challenging to translate some goals into measurable indicators. In addition to this, the data for Pakistan is not readily available having issues including limited reporting and reliability. To cater these limitations and to consider a data source having international legitimacy, the Sustainable Development Goal Index (SDG-I) [39 ] is mainly relied on alongside a comprehensive literature review to understand the linkages between devised nexus. For the quantification of the causal links between the devised nexus, Pearson correlation coefficients are extracted using the data. The Pearson correlation coefficients range from −1 to 1, indicating the linearity of the relationship amongst the targets. The negative co-efficient portrays the negative linear relationships while the positive depicts the positive linear relationships. Co-efficient having strong co-efficient i.e. large absolute values depicts strong linearity (e.g., 0.9) while smaller absolute values (e.g. - 0.2) indicate weak linear relationship. Table 2   shows the correlation analysis of the devised nexus approach. The co-relation analysis depicted in the table reveals that the positive interactions (synergies) outnumber the negative interactions (tradeoffs). The positive co-relations massively outnumber the negative tradeoff with 43 strongly positive ones and only 13 negative ones. The positive co-relations between SDG 6,7,11, and 13 depict that the implantation of one SDG will positively impact the implementation of the other SDGs in the nexus. For the implementation of the nexus approach, in the planning phase, the first key challenge while devising the methodology is the acquisition of data and determination of sample size. The sample size of the research comprises 24 vicinities that include Academic Institutes and Hospitals across Punjab to achieve diversity in the sample. The primary aim was to target energy-intensive institutes to create a benchmark that can be further modelled as a pilot study. The project was carried out in collaboration with Punjab Energy Efficiency and Conservation Agency (PEECA) and Alternate Energy Research and Innovation Lab, Al-Khwarizmi Institute of Computer Sciences UET Lahore. The time frame for this project was around six months. The sample size of this study consisted of 24 public sector institutes, including hospitals (Nawaz Sharif Teaching Hospital Lahore, Govt. Teaching Hospital Shahdra, Nishtar Hospital and Medical University Multan, Sheikh Zaid Hospital and medical college, General Hospital Lahore, Punjab Institute of Cardiology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Lahore, Lady Wallington Hospital Lahore, Services Institute of Medical Sciences, Jinnah Hospital & AIMC Lahore, Allied Hospital And Medical College Faisalabad, Services Hospital Lahore, District Headquarter Hospital Faisalabad) and academic institutions (Arid Agriculture Rawalpindi, GCU Faisalabad New Campus, BZU Multan, UET Taxila, UET Lahore, KSK Campus, UET Lahore Main Campus, GCU Faisalabad Main Campus, GCWU Faisalabad, Punjab University Lahore, UAF, GCT Sahiwal). For the implementation of SDG's in Pakistan, three basic parameters are targeted i.e. Energy, Water and Climate. The research methodology is divided into three steps, while future implementation is also suggested. Table 3   briefs the stages of research methodology devised. The selected 24 sites were visited by teams from PEECA and AERIL in order to carry out a three-stage nexus methodology to implement SDG 6, 7, 11 and 13. Energy audits have been conducted to acquire the data of the selected sites. The study initiated with a brainstorming meeting with the respective institute's stakeholders to discuss and explain the requirement and the plan. After the discussion, site visits were conducted, and the obtained data were analyzed to prepare a detailed report. The energy audit methodology is depicted in Fig. 4  . After the selection of the sites, a written request to conduct the audit and the questionnaire was sent to the focal person and a meeting was arranged between the energy audit team, the focal person and the Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) team of the institute. The scope of the study was briefed to the focal person, and with mutual understanding, an audit plan was devised. The site visit comprised of a detailed walkthrough audit. The energy audit team tagged every room and collected installed load data and the condition of the installed load. In the detailed energy audit, the backup generators, water storage tanks and Photovoltaic (PV) installation potential is observed, and the obtained data is analyzed, and the energy and water usage patterns are observed for the estimation of the consumption. A report is then compiled based on the observations made alongside the estimates of energy and water consumption and possible conservation potentials alongside recommendations for the client to review.  3 Results and discussion During the walkthrough energy audits, it has been witnessed that most of the lighting and air-cooling fixtures are old, inefficient and inappropriate alongside air cooling fixtures which are primitive and highly energy guzzling. Table 4   depicts the luminaires observed on site. Tables S2, S3 and S4  in supplementary information file  depict the air-cooling, air-conditioning and PC-CRT load observed on sites. The retrofitting solutions are suggested keeping in view the human comfort index and the current availability of retrofits for the year 2018–19. The suggestions provided ensures that the lux levels of the rooms are maintained. The air-cooling load replacement is suggested keeping the air-flow parameters the same, i.e. flow rate and wingspan etc., while reducing the power ratings. The air-conditioning loads are replaced via replicating the installed tonnage with inverter-based technology. During the walkthrough audits, the water storage tanks data is obtained to calculate the storage capacities and estimate the consumptions. The consumption calculation is made with the segregation of Academic Institutes and Hospitals keeping in consideration the average working days for academia and hospitals. The annual occupancy per annum is calculated keeping in view the students living in hostels and day scholars while for the hospitals, the estimate is based on the study conducted by Beenish et al. [40 ] for a thousand bed hospital keeping in view the patients in Outpatient Department, Emergency, Wards, and their attendants alongside the hospital staff. The water requirements for the students living hostels is estimated to be 0.11 cm3  while for the day scholar, 0.05 cm3  based on the data recorded in UET Lahore and UET Taxila and is replicated for the rest of the universities, while for the hospitals, 0.41 cm3  per bed is estimated based on the logged data in Sheikh Zayed hospital Rahimyarkhan. Due to energy shortage in Pakistan, generators are sought as a reliable backup to feed the energy needs. The billing data's of the vicinities are studied for the sanctioned load (kW), nature of the fuel used in generators and the total Genset (kVAs). Table 5   depicts the logged/calculated data regarding the water consumption (SDG-6) and Sustainable Environment (SDG-11 and SDG-13). During the data collection stage of the walkthrough audit, the active and passive GHG emitters were observed. The active GHG emission sources were the connected backup generators majority of which were fed by diesel, as depicted in Table 5 . At the same time, the passive emission sources included the electricity generation for use in these vicinities. The data obtained via the walkthrough audits is processed further to estimate reduction via retrofitting of inefficient appliances. The saving potentials are calculated against each category to depict the reduction potential. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed retrofitting solutions, financial analysis is done to estimate the average net savings and the payback period for the proposed retrofitting. Table 6   depicts the potential of energy conservation and financial analysis i.e. Payback period. The results depict that an approximate saving potential of 5.2 MW via the retrofitting of old luminaires i.e. 64%, 4.2 MW by replacing conventional AC's with inverter based efficient AC's i.e. 24%. 3.2 MW by the replacement of old fans with new NEECA 3-star rated Fans i.e. 40% and 0.35 MW via changing the CRT based monitors with LED i.e. 60% approximately. Fig. 5   depicts the graphical comparison of the lighting load reduction. Figures S1, S2 and S3  in Supplementary Information show the air-cooling, air-conditioning and PC-CRT reduction comparisons, respectively. Fig. 6   depicts the Payback period of the institutes, illustrating the time required to reach the breakeven and then beyond via the savings made possible. In Punjab University (PU) Lahore, the payback period is estimated to be 5.08 years which is the maximum amongst the list. In contrast, the lowest payback period is estimated to be 1.62 years for SIMS. The late payback in PU can be attributed to the greater number of air conditioning units to be replaced. However, the early payback in Lady Wellington Hospital Shahdara can be attributed to the centralized Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units which are not proposed in the retrofitting suggestion. In addition to conservation, the Photovoltaic installation is also calculated by taking into account the rooftop Photovoltaic installation capacity to offset the conventional generation. The installation capacity is calculated via the rooftop surveys of the selected institutes to mark feasible rooftops for the installation. Fig. 7   depicts the estimated peak rooftop installation capacity. The installation capacity is calculated keeping in view the weather data of the sites, time of the day, sun path trajectory, optimal azimuth angle i.e. 180° and tilt angle 32°, inter-row spacing, module spacing to ensure minimal impact of inter-row shading. Water scarcity is a significant problem faced in the country. The water consumption trend in the country has to be altered, and the freshwater should just be used for the purpose of fulfilling the drinking needs. For the rest of the domestic errands, treated water should be utilized to reduce pressure on the water reservoirs. Rainwater harvesting is considered an effective methodology to reduce stress on water resources. Water conservation overlaps the domain of energy conservation, water conservation and reduction in greenhouse gasses emission. On average, it is estimated that about 30% of the water pump is only utilized for the sake of flushing. Buildings with large roofs are more effective and feasible for rooftop rainwater harvesting [41 ]. The rainwater harvesting system mainly relies on the quantity of water which is harvestable. The Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) potential is calculated using the Rooftop Catchment Method by Gould and Nissen. This is deemed as one of the most common and highly utilized methods to estimate RWH potential. The following equation is used for the RWH estimation [42 ].(Eq.1) S = A × R × Cr    A is the area for any catchment surface, R is the mean rain fall, Cr is the run-off co-efficient of the catchment surface. For the area calculation, rooftop areas are manually marked for co-ordinates and google earth engine's area calculation tool. The Catchment area calculated using satellite imagery on google earth engine relies on precise knowledge about the vicinity ground data. In order to ensure accuracy, areas of some rooftops were manually measured in the field survey and also re-verified against the architectural plans of the vicinities. The rainwater harvested can utilized for flushing purposes by laying off a dedicated pipeline. In addition to this, the harvested rainwater can also be used for landscaping and horticulture purposes. The selected vicinities are divided into three regions of Punjab i.e. north, central and south regions. The rainwater harvesting tanks are designed to keep in view the average rainfalls of the region. The figures for the five year annual average rainfall in Punjab used is 0.681 m [43 ]. All of the rooftops surveyed comprised of tiles and brick having Cr 0.8 [44 ]. Table 7   depicts the calculated rainwater harvesting potential. The calculations depict the conservation of 35,204 cm3  of water which will help to reduce the water scarcity of the region while improving the water table, will reduce the aspects of flooding and will improve the living standard in the urban areas. The rainwater storage tanks proposed will not only reduce the freshwater consumption but will also reduce the energy cost invested in pumping. These rainwater harvesting mechanisms will improve the water conservation mechanism and will also contribute to the reduction of urban flooding in the country if implemented on a larger scale. Pakistan highly relies on the thermal model of energy generation, forming the majority chunk of the energy mix of Pakistan. Energy-based emissions are directly related to energy consumptions. The carbon emissions are calculated as per the IGCEP report by NTDC against per kWh energy generation. The energy-saving potential achieved via retrofitting results in the reduction of energy-based GHG emissions. Fig. 8   depicts the GHG emission reduction via energy conservation.  4 Conclusions The sustainable development goals are deeply interconnected and require an effective nexus approach for optimal resource allocation and utilization. The nexus approach if implemented in developing countries like Pakistan, will help effectively address and rectify the issue as compared to the sectoral approach. The SDG 6, 7, 11 and 13 share direct, indirect as well as endogenous and exogenous linkage. Hence, these four goals should be worked on together to achieve effective results. The Pearson co-relation analysis substantiates the argument of nexus approach to eliminate the sectoral allocation which leads to inequity and resource duplication. The study depicts a novel nexus implementation approach in Pakistan and suggests that an energy conservation potential of approximately 12.8 MW and renewable energy installation potential of 40.4 MW exists to achieve SDG 7. In addition to this, rainwater harvesting is calculated to be 0.035 million cm3  per annum, contributing to 7% reduction of water utilization to achieve SDG 6 and the reduction of per capita environmental impact of cities and integration of urbanization ensuring safe and accessible public spaces by reducing 14.8 million tons of GHG per Annum to achieve SDG 11 and 13. The feasibility of the energy conservation measures suggested is calculated to quantify the benefits, their impacts and the payback periods required to offset the initial capital. The expected average payback of these institutes is approximately three years. The analysis presented in the thesis is a result of a rigorous activity performed for the span of approximately six months. The study deals with SDGs as nexus and presents a case study. Few prominent recommendations include the development linkage between SDG units on federal and provincial and experts from academia and other relevant stakeholders as consultants to map the SDG road map in Pakistan. The federal and provincial units of SDG should map the percentage of GDP required to achieve the SDGs for better resource allocation. In addition to this, the resource allocation must be in line with the nexus interlinkage of the SDGs for better and optimal resource allocation. The implementation of SDG 6 and 7 must be promoted via taking industries, commercial sector and private investors sector on board to reduce budget allocation stress on the government. ESCO/Third Party investment models should be encouraged for the SDG implementation.  CRediT author statement Latif and Amjad: Conceptualization, Methodology.
