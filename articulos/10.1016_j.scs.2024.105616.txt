                  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have motivated several projects and policies to improve sustainable development. Assessing the progress made in fulfilling these goals is challenging, particularly in specific cases like urban water systems, because applied methodologies are lacking. This research proposes a methodology for assessing progress using SDGs indicators. The methodology was validated by considering SDG6 and SDG12 in real urban water systems from knowing that progress or the influence of decision making on its improvement exists. Eight indicators were evaluated in 120 case studies worldwide, of which 24 water systems were located in Spain. The global results showed substantial progress and fair progress in four and two indicators, respectively. The results revealed the alignment between both assessments in Spain. This research contributes to benchmark an indicator's progress, which will facilitate the decision-making process as to whether measures should be taken to improve the fulfilment of SDGs.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have motivated several projects and policies to improve sustainable development. Assessing the progress made in fulfilling these goals is challenging, particularly in specific cases like urban water systems, because applied methodologies are lacking. This research proposes a methodology for assessing progress using SDGs indicators. The methodology was validated by considering SDG6 and SDG12 in real urban water systems from knowing that progress or the influence of decision making on its improvement exists. Eight indicators were evaluated in 120 case studies worldwide, of which 24 water systems were located in Spain. The global results showed substantial progress and fair progress in four and two indicators, respectively. The results revealed the alignment between both assessments in Spain. This research contributes to benchmark an indicator's progress, which will facilitate the decision-making process as to whether measures should be taken to improve the fulfilment of SDGs.

They involve using innovative methodologies, practices and technologies, which aim to prevent environmental damage. It enables managers to achieve cleaner production of processes (Giannetti et al., 2020 ), as highlighted by Rodriguez-Lima (2019) . This approach contributes to efficient resource management, which aligns with social demand. It also needs the comprehensive consideration of the three sustainability concepts: environmental, social and economic (Smith et al., 2022 ). Contemplating cleaner production practices becomes imperative for achieving the sustainable development (SD) of systems (Ikram et al., 2021 ). SD has evolved to become a foundational objective to implement policies and programmes. These strategies are more important in the current setting (Pradhan et al., 2023 ). The aim is to meet today's needs without endangering future generations’ resources across economic, environmental and social dimensions (Bruntland, 1987 ). The United Nations (UN) proposed 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Agenda 2030 (Iacobuţă et al., 2022 ). This regulatory framework is key for developing policies and for making decisions to implement sustainable procedures (Hák et al., 2016 ; Sachs, 2012 ). SDGs require special consideration during the development of new technologies and methodologies for society's progress (Wątróbski et al., 2022 ) because SDGs encompass a wide spectrum of interrelated issues. such as poverty, education, politics and natural resources conservation. Addressing sustainable management in urban water systems (UWSs) is a challenge for the promotion of sustainable cities (Huerta-Vergara & Escolero, 2024 ) by considering that population pressure increases water demands, which is the most important natural resource (Lemos et al., 2013 ). A growing population combined with severe droughts could cause inadequate water supply in numerous countries (Doroteo, 2015 ). This scarcity could limit socio-economic development by not guaranteeing a supply service in quality and quantity terms (Garcia et al., 2021 ). It implies UN prioritising water security (United Nations, 2020 ) by recognising the intricate interdependence of social, industrial and technological progress with SDGs (Wei et al., 2023 ). Different actions, such as modernisation of water supplies, implementation of smart water meters, and reduction practices of demand and water losses, have been performed to guarantee sustainable development applied to UWSs (Blackmore & Plant, 2007 ; El-Sayed Mohamed Mahgoub et al., 2010 ). Despite these efforts, measuring and controlling the impact of these actions pose real challenges (Boretti & Rosa, 2019 ). Performing the previous actions applied to supply systems has led to improved efficiency. However, managers must also consider these systems’ sustainability assessment, and not only technical management values. Water managers should be able to align their water systems with SDGs by answering different questions, such as: (i) are the actions taken to achieve SDGs really on track?; (ii) do further measures need to be taken to accelerate the level of SDG compliance in UWSs? The answers to both these questions are the focus of this research. The main objective is to propose a methodology, which supports the assessment of sustainability by measuring indicators' progress towards the SDGs applied to UWSs. The key contributions lie in: (i) a methodological innovation because it provides a structured approach for measuring advancements towards SDGs; (ii) validation through case studies, which adds reliability to the results; (iii) global and local perspectives by conducting a global assessment and a more localised assessment; (iv) the identification of progress trends to gain a deep understanding of the areas that require attention and potential improvement; (v) decision support for policy measures. The proposed methodology contributes to benchmark SDG indicators’ progress. It facilitates the decision-making process by helping stakeholders to determine whether additional measures are necessary to enhance the fulfilment of SDGs. This research is structured as follows: Section 2  delves into the background of the SDGs analysed in this research. Section 3  proposes the methodology, which enables the evolution of the different indicators to be measured to assess the fulfilment of the different targets applied to SDG6 and SDG12. Section 4  presents the results and their discussion using 120 supply systems with a particular in-depth analysis of the 24 case studies located in Spain. Finally, Section 5  concludes with further research avenues.  2 Background 2.1 Interconnection between SDG6 and SDG12 In 2015, the UN General Assembly introduced Agenda 2030, which encompasses 17 SDGs that span economic, social and environmental dimensions using 169 targets to ensure SD (Smith et al., 2022 ). Of these interrelated objectives, SDG6 (clean water and sanitation) plays a pivotal role, with an extensive network of interlinkages with other SDGs. According to Coopman et al. (2016) , these connections can be categorised into three types: supporting, enabling/disenabling and relying on interconnections. Several research approaches have been employed to explore the synergies and trade-offs amongst SDGs (Perez et al., 2020 ), and have revealed both positive and hindering impacts on goal achievement, often with explicit references to water resources (Alcamo, 2018 ). The connection between SDG6 and other SDGs should be interpreted by managers and local governments (Di Vaio et al., 2021 ). The interconnections of these SDGs are significant to assess water systems globally, and not only by focusing on water resources with other targets (Alcamo, 2018 ). SDG6 focuses on ensuring universal access to clean water and sanitation, while SDG12 aims to foster sustainable consumption and production patterns. Both goals underscore the importance of sustainable practices, management and consumption patterns, particularly in the water resources realm (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). Consequently, an integrated approach to clean water management has become prominent in recent years (Hassing et al., 2009 ). The relation between SDG6 and SDG12 is evident, with positive performance in one goal promoting the fulfilment of the other, while negative outcomes on one significantly impede the other's progress (Karnib, 2017b ; International Council for Science, 2016 , 2017a ). For instance, unsustainable production practices aligned with SDG12 can generate waste and pollutants, with adverse impacts on water quality and delays in meeting SDG6 targets (Guppy et al., 2018 ; Tickner et al., 2016 ). SDGs, which serve as an evidence-based framework with targets and indicators, facilitate integrated national planning and assessment until 2030 (Hák et al., 2016 ). Indicators act as key principles for monitoring SD progress (United Nations, 2015 ). Since the initiation of SDGs, several countries have reported national progress, and some companies have begun reporting actions and progress aligned with these goals and indicators (Allen et al., 2020 ).  2.2 Indicators and methodologies to assess SDGs Nowadays, there is a pressing need for updated water supply technologies to enhance efficiency and to promote clean water management worldwide (Li et al., 2020 ). Researchers have endeavoured to explore smart water networks by implementing sensors and data centres to provide cost-effective and sustainable real-time monitoring and control solutions (Sonaje & Joshi, 2015 ). The implementation of SD as a framework has been considerably reinforced in the last decade due to the scarcity of resources (Alberti et al., 2022 ). In line with this, the quantitative assessment of the progress made with SDGs and targets has emerged (Sánchez-Rivero et al., 2023 ), and numerous assessments have been made at different levels (global, national, subnational) by different entities, including governmental and non-governmental organisations (Kissinger & Stossel, 2021 ). Additionally, annual international rankings, such as the SDG Index and Dashboards, are available to compare countries’ performance against SDGs (OECD, 2022 ). Although indicator-based assessments of SDGs progress are increasingly important, the academic literature lacks studies that examine and evaluate the applied methods and approaches (Ricciolini et al., 2022 ). Consequently, considering the methodologies and outcomes of such assessments is crucial for enhancing the best practices and fostering continuous learning. Monitoring SD using indicators offers an effective means to summarise data and complex dynamics as a manageable collection of valuable information (Astleithner et al., 2004 ). Indicator-based assessments of sustainability trends and progress often provide information for policymakers and stakeholders’ decision-making (Allen et al., 2020 ). So although the UN General Assembly adopted 232 nationally applicable indicators, other organisations have developed sustainability indicators based on those developed by the UN in such a way that sustainability measurement moves to other levels, such as companies (Garcia et al., 2023 ). Some of these indicators still lack targets, methodology or time-series data. To bridge this existing gap, stakeholders have integrated a combination of official SDGs along with others for assessment purposes (Allen et al., 2020 ). Allen et al. (2020)  assess Australia's progress with specific SDG targets and, once again, highlight the scarcity of academic literature that examines the approaches used in indicator-based assessments. McArthur and Rasmussen (2019)  apply the ‘leaving no-one behind’ (LNOB) principle to select indicators and to assess national progress. Others aggregate indicators for each goal, but without considering the relative importance of individual SDGs, which is consistent with the fact that each SDG has the same priority for the UN (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ). The calculation of dynamic indices for each indicator and the use of prediction tools have also been explored, including indicators from organisations like EUROSTAT (Ricciolini et al., 2022 ) and those from the UN. Furthermore, two major approaches developed by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (Allen et al., 2020 ; Ricciolini et al., 2022 ) are worth highlighting, along with the previously mentioned methodologies. These methods measure each indicator's distance from the 2030 goal per country, and present it as a value-sharing ratio amongst similar countries (Cohen & Shinwell, 2020 ; Lafortune et al., 2018 ). Therefore, a positive correlation describes that a country/region is progressing in the right direction to meet the target, while a negative correlation means that it needs course correction to meet the 2030 targets (United Nations, 2022 ). These two methodologies rely on linear and non-linear assessment methods, such as compound annual growth rates, to assess each indicator's trends (Cohen & Shinwell, 2020 ; Sachs, 2012 ). The implementation of these methodologies also depends on the availability of target values and data (Allen et al., 2020 ). The selection of indicators and their application at a more particular level are often challenging because the applied indicators should ensure a relation with SDGs (Hák et al., 2016 ). More often than not, the choice ends up being subjective (Allen et al., 2020 ; Guio-Torres, 2006 ). Sometimes such a choice is based on focusing only on one pillar of sustainability, e.g. the environmental area (Bagheri & Hjorth, 2007; Lundin et al., 2000 ). In this case, a life cycle assessment is commonly used (Lundin, 2003; Lundin & Morrison, 2002 ). Indeed when choosing indicators, the most widely chosen aspect is related to the environment (Hellströ et al., 2000 ). However, assessments of indicators should focus on all areas of sustainability, namely social, economic and environmental (Herrera, 2019 ). The review of the existing research into sustainability indicators and methodologies for assessing progress towards SDGs reveals a gap in the literature concerning the specific application of indicators to assess SDG targets, particularly in the UWSs context. Although various methodologies and approaches have been developed to assess progress towards SDGs at different levels, including global, national and subnational, comprehensive studies that focus on the specific challenges and needs of UWSs are lacking. Existing studies do not often include an in-depth examination and evaluation of applied methods and approaches, which highlights the need for a more tailored and systematic approach to assess progress over time and to improve sustainability in UWSs.   3 Methodology for assessing progress with SDGs indicators in UWSs The proposed methodology for assessing SDG progress can be divided into two main branches: trend and level. Based on available data, a trend consists of measuring the pattern from a base year to the most recent year. The objective of this assessment is to answer the question: ‘Is this rate enough or should it be accelerated to meet the target?’ Level seeks to indicate the percentage of an indicator's achievement towards its objective in 1 year. Therefore, it shows the distance to the target. This study focuses on the trend assessment of sustainability indicators. The proposed methodology consists of four steps as represented in Fig. 1  .Step 1.  Selection of the SDG and the indicators to be assessed. The most appropriate indicators should be selected to evaluate the considered SDG. This is a basic step, which is necessary to choose the best indicators according to the target to be evaluated in the water system. The proposal of indicators and their analysis allows water managers to define strategies to obtain data for measuring these indicators through investment in strategic plans for water facilities. A systematic review method was applied to search the different indicators by a literature search (Whittemoreand Knafl, 2005 ). The research used a database with 136 indicators (García et al., 2023 ). Indicators were ordered according to the operation area in water systems (i.e., 110 indicators for supply systems, 87 indicators for wastewater treatment and 100 for sanitation distribution systems). Of all the indicators, 40 % were located in environmental management, 30 % in technical management, 28 % in social management and 12 % in economic management  Step 2.  Data collection. To calculate indicators, at least 75 % of the temporal data should be obtained by Question 1 (Q1) in Fig. 1 , following García et al. (2023) , if unavailable data can be taken from a maximum of 1 year before the assessed year following the same approach developed by Lafortune et al. (2018) , defined by Question 2 (Q2) in Fig. 1 . Data collection was established by analysing the case studies published in scientific journals and/or reports (García et al., 2023 ) by taking the values provided by them and determining the given indicators’ values. If the indicator value did not exist, this index was calculated by the authors using indicator expressions and information available.  Step 3.  Calculation of the thresholds for each selected indicator by defining whether or not the selected indicators have an established threshold. To establish them, some considerations should be taken into account:   ‐ Quantitative thresholds should be used if this value is available. In this case, the threshold values to be considered may be those defined by the UN, as indicated in Question 3 (Q3) of Fig. 1 .  ‐ If threshold values are not defined by the UN report, data can be obtained from other organisations or institutions (S5), such as the OECD, the World Health Organization, amongst other experts with experience in the sector; e.g., senior engineers who work extensively with data in different water supply networks similarly to García et al. (2023) .  ‐ If a quantitative threshold is not available (Question 4, Q4, in Fig. 1 ), principles such as ‘LNOB’ (S1) as described by Weber (2018) , or relying on scientific knowledge to deduce the threshold value can be applied as documented in published research (S2), which was compiled in a database by García et al. (2023) . This applies to the case of the indicators that aim to cover access to public services, or in some environmental ones like zero emissions, where the scientific threshold is somewhat explicit. In these cases, the upper threshold value is deducted.  ‐ If thresholds cannot be inferred and whether there are countries where this indicator is already achieved are noted (Question 5, Q5, in Fig. 1 ). The selection of indicators could be supported by the different indicators defined in the database by García et al. (2023) . If there are, the average of the five best results (S3) is used to set thresholds based on the approach defined by Lafortune et al. (2018) .  ‐ Finally, if there are cases in which the target has not been reached, in line with Lafortune et al. (2018) , the threshold is defined by averaging the three best results of the sample (S4) according to research criteria, which is based on the experts located in the study area; e.g., the significance of the methodology is the evaluation of the water system over time.    The proposed methodology should be considered ideal when evaluating the same system under consistent boundary conditions. However, employing boundaries from different case studies can be used to initiate the system's evaluation, with adjustments made to indices as significant data from the system's own evaluation become available. Addressing comparisons between hydraulic systems can be challenging due to their intrinsic differences, as defined by García et al. (2023) .Step 4.  Selection of the calculation method to assess the distance to the ‘technical optimum’ (set target): once data are available, calculation can be done using either the linear annual growth rate or the compound annual growth rate.  Step 4.1. Linear annual growth rate;  the trend needed to meet the target is firstly calculated. This estimates the trend from the baseline year to 2030.  Step 4.2. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR);  the target thresholds must be known. If there is a target threshold, the current growth rate is calculated and compared to the growth rate needed to meet the target in 2030. This is done by applying the expressions of the actual compound annual growth rate (CAGRa ) (1), the required compound annual growth rate (CAGRr ) (2), and the ratio between them (CR) (3), following this notation according to United Nations (2022) :(1) C A G R a  = ( x t  x t 0    )  1 t − t 0     − 1     (2) C A G R r  = ( x *  x t 0    )   1 2030 − t 0     − 1     (3) C R = C A G R a   C A G R r            where t   is the current year; t 0    is the baseline year; x t    is the indicator's value for year t   (current year); x t 0     is the indicator's value for the baseline year; x *    is the target value to be obtained by 2030, which is calculated in Step 3. If there is no established threshold value, only the indicator's current growth rate is calculated. In this step, the trend is not compared to the expected progress, but only whether or not it is sufficient to meet the target according to researchers’ judgement is estimated.Step 5.  Indicator categorisation. To categorise indicators, the descriptions of the thresholds defined by the UN or OECD are used (Table 1  ). Different categories were defined by the research to classify them (United Nations, 2022 ).     4 Results. application of the assessment of SDGs progress 4.1 Global assessment results This research chose both SDG6 and SDG12. The selected indicators were chosen from previous studies (Garcia et al., 2023 ). The research considered those indicators contained in the database, for which data were available in the Spanish case studies, along with values from other published research studies. However, the proposed methodology can be applied to any indicator capable of assessing any of the SDG targets. The aim was to ensure that these indicators were related to those set by the UN and other global organisations, such as the OECD or the European Commission. It enabled the definition of the specific threshold values and/or trends to track progress with the established indicators. Table 2   collects the data on the target values for 2030 or existing trends. These values were evaluated between 2019 and 2022 according to available data (Table 3  ). It should be noted that as not all the indicators have an established objective for 2030, this study only assesses the progress based on the trend as defined in the methodology. These SDG indicators cover national or even global targets or trends, and are unsuitable when assessing particular cases because their level of compliance may be somewhat far from that national or global level. Thus it would be useful to compare several organisations at the same level to a target or a trend that is at that level. This study aims to assess the trend of sustainability indicators in UWSs given the importance of water resources in society's development. This study should cover the assessment of all 17 SDGs (Garcia et al., 2023 ), although the results for SDG6 and SDG12 were chosen in this research. Table 3  shows the used indicators. The developed methodology was applied to data collection, which employed 120 case studies of different sizes, population coverages, companies and water distribution types. However, most were water supply systems. Only 18 cases were agriculture systems, which represented 15 % of the total. Spain and Italy (24 and 16 cases, respectively) were the countries where most data were collected. Fig. 2   shows the number of case studies by country. Table 3  shows the number of case studies applied per indicator. These indicators, based on the database published by Garcia et al. (2023) , allow to relate to the indicators proposed in the different SDG targets or to include them as such. Having chosen the indicators, the calculations of the distinct thresholds were done. There were different methods to calculate trends, and they considered either the linear annual growth rate or the compound growth rate. Eight indicators were defined. To analyse the trends for each indicator, the first task was to consider whether there were defined targets for indicators or whether they could be deduced. On the contrary, if no data were available, the average of the three best results had to be applied. The trends and target values obtained from reports by the UN and other organisations’ for the SDGs indicators were used for the assessment. These could be applied to evaluate a global level and/or specific locations (i.e., countries, regions, provinces and municipalities). The research applied the methodology globally and specifically in Spain. Table 3  defined a relation between SDGs and the indicators applied based on keywords. The connection between targets and the different indicators was studied by Garcia et al. (2023) . The research is applied to supply systems whose analysis is directly related to the SDG6 assessment. Garcia et al. (2023)  demonstrated the relation of water to all the SDGs (17 different SDGs) and the need to interrelate them. To establish the targets and trends per indicator, the criteria explained in the methodology were used:- Only one indicator had an existing target value and was taken from the UN SDGs report (the indicator defined as ID 49 in Table 3 ).  - The LNOB principle described by Weber (2018)  was not applied because it was not necessary for any of the proposed indicators. The same happened for the principle of setting targets based on experts’ scientific or technical knowledge, who profoundly know UWSs, such as zero emissions, evaluation of leakages, participation in innovation and research projects, amongst others (García et al., 2023 ).  - For seven of the eight indicators, no thresholds could be inferred. Therefore, two methods were used for these cases:○ Objective values, either trends or targets, from other references like OECD were used to be applied to three indicators defined as ID 18 (WR), ID 21 (GHG) and ID 24 (ER).  ○ For the remaining four indicators, defined as ID 27 (WU), ID 35 (WL), ID 40 (TEU) and ID 43 (REG), the average of the three best results was used to set the threshold value. With a system evaluation, the three best values were considered. If there were significant values between different case studies, a statistical distribution of values can be created. However, thresholds should be dynamic because managers incorporate data from their UWS or new data from experts or published articles.       Having defined each indicator's target or trend value, the calculation of the trend was done based on the CAGR to evaluate its behaviour (Yi et al., 2019 ). It should be noted that case studies vastly differ due to size, location, management, amongst other factors. Table 4   shows the results for each studied indicator, and specifies the method applied to calculate the target and its value. This research does not aim to show superiority in the methodological approach. However, after reviewing the state of the art, no methodological proposals were found that address the evaluation of SDGs in sustainability terms, unlike the different methodologies that attempt to evaluate supply systems by employing technical indicators or benchmarking (Ganjidoost et al., 2018 ). Therefore, while awaiting proposals for new methodological approaches, future research lines will aim to compare this solution to other alternatives once they become available. All the indicators and their results proved very particular, which was why it was worth studying the particularities of each one. There were indicators in which the trend was expected to be negative, i.e. decreasing, as in Indicator 21 (GHG). In other cases, such as Indicator 18 (WR), it was expected to be positive, i.e., increasing, as explained below. Indicator 18 (WR) was related to SDG Indicator 12.5, whose objective is to increase recycling rates (Cohen & Shinwell, 2020 ) to 56.2 % in 2023 (Cohen & Shinwell, 2020 ). Its trend was expected to be positive because, by considering new technologies, water reuse has increased, especially in countries where there drought is considerable, and the search for alternative resources, such as reuse, has become a reality. A CR above 0.95 was obtained (considering that the trend was increasing). So based on the data from case studies, this indicator presented ‘substantial progress’. The positive trend could be supported by several factors, such as technological advances. Indeed reverse osmosis treatments are booming in the agricultural sector in some European countries. Likewise, the search for alternative resources to conserve those that are currently scarce, and the increase in water reuse policies, are other factors that can contribute to positive results. In some specific cases like the Spanish one, the government is currently promoting many forms of financial aid in the agricultural to precisely modernise the supply networks of several irrigation communities (González-Pavón et al., 2020 ). As increasingly more regions and companies successfully implement water reuse programmes, examples that inspire others to follow suit are created. The results of Indicator 21 (GHG), which measures the content of hazardous health elements (i.e. lead, mercury, cadmium, suspended solids, etc.), were obtained by averaging the calculation of each CAGRa for very hazardous substances. No target value was defined for this indicator, but an annual growth rate with a tendency to decrease −0.6 % was expected (Statistical Office of the European Communities, 2023 ). A CR of −0.01 was obtained for this indicator, which means a negative trend: ‘fair progress, but acceleration needed’. When analysing the results for each substance, both cadmium and copper showed negative trends, and were classified as ‘substantial progress’. However, the trend for mercury and lead was an increasing one over the 5 years when data were available, and was almost 30 %. The decrease in cadmium and copper can be attributed mainly to the environmental policies and regulations adopted by each country. These hazardous substances have substantially decreased in Europe because it has opted for rather strict environmental policies (European Environment Agency, 2023). In addition, the use of alternative materials and their recycling have been encouraged, which have reduced the need to extract and produce new quantities of these materials. In other highly productive countries, which permit some flexibility to the application of environmental laws, the emission of these substances has increased (Wen et al., 2022 ). It can be concluded that the results for each substance will be strongly influenced by the policies and demands of each country's industrial processes. Fig. 3   presents the results for Indicator 24 (ER). It shows how certain countries like Italy far exceed the CR and, thus, also the trend expected for this indicator. For other countries (i.e., Austria, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland), the trend's progress is limited. In the United Kingdom, the deterioration of this indicator is noticeable, which means that energy recovery tends to decrease rather than increase, as expected. This tool then allows improvement measures to be taken in those areas where the trend is not as expected. The results for Indicator 27 (WU) showed a deterioration state. A 20–30 % increase in freshwater use is expected by 2030 (Boretti & Rosa, 2019 ). According to the analysed trend however, this value has already been exceeded. The CR result was 1.60 above 0.95, which means ‘substantial progress’. As the annual growth rate from 2001 to 2020 was higher than the predicted 20 %, the trend has grown more quickly than expected, which is not a good result. This shows how important it is to evaluate each indicator because a positive trend may not always mean a good thing. Thus it would be advisable if countries would generally set a threshold or a trend to lower this value. Such indicators are very sensitive to many factors, and perhaps their behaviour follows the trend of economic growth or is affected by, for example, events like COVID-19. Moreover, these factors were not clear due to the particularities of the different case studies. For instance, some were agricultural, others urban, amongst others. The CAGRa by countries from 2001 to 2020 of Indicator 27 was also analysed (Fig. 4  ). The global results showed high freshwater demand, and many countries had a negative trend, i.e. decreasing water use trend. Currently, different sources of water resources have been developed to reduce the high demands of freshwater bodies. Knowledge of the state that a country's own resources are in also implies taking measures to reduce demand by improving network management, with subsidies to users to lower demand, amongst others. Similarly for Indicator 35 (WL) (Fig. 5  ), a clear decrease in the results was observed because a negative CAGRa, even below 0.01, was obtained. However, when looking at the particularities of each case study, there was still a certain positive trend in some countries like Mexico, Iran and Turkey, and in some areas of Europe, whose progress could be defined as being very low or limited. Another indicator that refers to resource use is Indicator 40 (TEU). Although increased energy use was expected, it was not expected to be as high. As no trend or defined target was found for Indicator 40 (TEU), only its growth from 2001 to 2020 was compared. A negative CAGRa was obtained, which implies lower total energy use. The development of different energy efficiency-related technologies justifies this result because they aim to reduce demand and ensure that systems are able to recover and reuse energy (Hafez et al., 2023 ). The data for Indicator 43 (REG) came from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Spain with a CR of 2.98. This means that since the base year of 1999, these countries have increased energy generation and met more than one quarter (between 33 % and 38.5 %) of their electricity generation from renewables (Yolcan, 2023 ). In some sustainability reports, there is an increasingly noticeable trend in setting up measures that improve energy efficiency, including the generation of renewable energy that can be employed for a country's use (United Nations, 2022 ). For Indicator 49 (TGHG), which measures the estimation of the CO2  emissions, a negative trend (in both CAGr and CR) was observed, which indicates a decrease in GHGs. This indicator can be classified as ‘substantial progress’. Water supply and wastewater services incur a large amount of energy and GHG emissions (Nair et al., 2014 ). This result is related to the efforts made to improve awareness about the negative effects of climate change, which have led governments and populations to take measures to cut GHG emissions. Indeed agreements and commitments (e.g., the Paris Agreement and SDGs) largely set targets and seek to encourage the implementation of GHG reduction strategies around the world (Yang et al., 2023 ). These agreements have increased the implementation of clean and efficient technologies, which focus on renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind (Özkan et al., 2023 ).  4.2 Particular cases assessment in Spain The Spanish case studies represent one fifth of the case studies collected in this research. For this reason, their specific analysis is herein addressed. The methodology is to be applied to specific cases, and not only for global assessments. In this way, an urban water services company could assess its sustainable management progress and, thus, evaluate whether improvement measures should be taken or accelerated, which all contribute to make SD progress. For Step 1, the same indicators were selected as in the global assessment. For Step 2, data were collected from 24 Spanish case studies that cover 24 UWSs (Fig. 6  ). Networks were urban (50 %), agricultural (46 %) and mixed systems (4 %). In this case, the selection of the 24 cases in Spain was considered because it represented the most cases in the database generated in this research. Fig. 6  shows the different locations of the water systems in different Spanish communities. For some indicators, data were available only from a single case. However for other indicators, as there were more cases, the CAGRa was calculated for each one and the results were averaged. In order to calculate the CAGRa, only the values referring to the studied network were taken. This means that, unlike global data, the data for the current year and the baseline year were specific were specific to each case. In the global case of indicators, there was no discrepancy by case, but the most recent and baseline data were used. The CR was calculated by taking the CAGa of the case study and dividing it by the previously calculated CAGRa. Table 5   presents the results by comparing the CAGR trend to the global and CR. This comparison aimed to assess whether the management policies incorporated by Spanish companies into supply systems management are moving in the right direction to improve sustainability and to assess SDGs. Fig. 7   shows the comparison of the annual trend rates for both the global and specific case studies per indicator. The trends in Spain for most indicators were higher than the global trend, which shows that actions in an appropriate direction are being taken. Although the global trend for Indicator 18 (WR) was higher than that of the Spanish case, a good level was also obtained by classifying the status as ‘substantial progress/on track’. Indicator 27 (WU) showed that the trend in Spain was much higher than the global trend. This means that a given demand is growing more quickly than expected. This result could serve as a starting point to implement improvement actions to reduce water extraction. The Spanish CAGRa for Indicator 35 (WL) was negative, which demonstrates the decrease as a% in water losses from the baseline year to 2020. The rate was much more negative than the global rate, which denotes that the specific cases perform better than at the global level. For Indicator 40 (TEU), the global CAGRa indicated a decreasing energy use trend, whereas the positive result for case studies denoted that use has increased. This impacts the CR of the cases and results in "Deterioration". This can be taken as a warning sign to seek solutions to reduce the amount of used energy. For Indicators 21 (GHG) and 43 (REG), no data were available from the case studies. Finally, although the database was established from different sources, the trends in the global and Spain-specific assessments of the case study showed that systems are becoming aware of the need for sustainability improvement in UWSs This not only validated the methodology's consistency, but also suggested its adaptability to diverse contexts. The ability to generate comparable results on different scales enhances the utility of the proposed methodology.   5 Conclusions Cleaner practices are essential for achieving sustainable development by addressing growing social demand while considering environmental, social and economic aspects. Sustainable development is crucial to meet present needs without compromising future generations' resources. The improvement of sustainability is supported by the evaluation of the 17 sustainable development goals, which are included in the 2030 Agenda by the United Nations. In the quest for sustainability, improving the assessment in all environmental terms of water distribution systems is a challenge that managers currently face. Determining progress towards achieving these goals, especially in the urban water systems case, is crucial. The actions taken to increase sustainability in supply systems raise questions as to whether current actions are sufficient to meet sustainable development goals and how far values are from the 2023 targets, which highlights the need for robust methodologies to assess progress made towards sustainable development goals compliance. Lack of methodologies is addressed in this novel research, which proposes a new procedure based on technical, economic, environmental and social indicators, to assess progress towards achieving various targets of sustainable development goals. The procedure was applied to different targets for ‘Clean water and sanitation’ and ‘Responsible consumption and production’ using data from 120 worldwide cases of supply systems, including the evaluation of Spanish case studies. The global analysis of the indicators discussed in this research, along with their local evaluation in Spain, reveals that the adoption of policy measures to promote the use of sustainable resources and sustainability-based management encourages public administrations, companies and citizens to become aware of the need to evaluate system operation in sustainability terms. The proposed methodology assesses trends to evaluate each indicator and to provide water system managers with decision tools for the improvement of each indicator. As the measures taken in different countries may significantly vary, further research needs to be adapted to local conditions and identified trends, and to also cover other types of systems, and not only urban water systems. Future research lines should prioritise enhancing data collection methods and developing mechanisms to better incorporate information by enabling the evaluation of a system over time or a comparison between similar systems. Furthermore, it would be valuable in the future to compare our proposal to other studies whose aim is the same objective to identify the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. This comparison could provide opportunities for incorporating new improvements into the proposal. To conclude, the methodology will serve as a starting point from which to compare a particular case to other similar case studies in a benchmarking form and to assess progress related to indicators to take further action. The significance of the role that water plays in cities, and citizens' sustainability, requires a comprehensive assessment of all the sustainable development objectives. This evaluation should demonstrate the impact of actions that aim to enhance management systems both in the water cycle and also across various social, environmental, economic and political aspects of cities.
