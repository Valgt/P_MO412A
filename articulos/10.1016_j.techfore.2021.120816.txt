                  Even though the private sector plays a pivotal role in the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the assessment of the firms’ contribution to the Goals has so far been an underexplored and complex issue. This paper proposes an analytical approach to evaluate the contribution of different sustainability and service innovation strategies to the SDGs.
                  The proposed analytical approach uses open secondary data and content analysis to collect and analyse the sustainability and service innovation activities of a sample of firms. It also develops the Sustainability-orientated Service Innovation (SOSI) Matrix, a tool to map the firms’ strategies and their contribution to the SDGs.
                  The results indicate that the various combinations of sustainability and service innovation strategies lead to differences in the firms’ contribution to the SDGs. In particular, service innovation has been shown to be a fundamental mediator to contribute to the SDGs.
                  The main points of this work are i) the importance of combining sustainability and service innovation to contribute to the SDGs; ii) the development of an analytical procedure to analyse the firms’ contribution to the SDGs; iii) the definition of core SDGs, which are relevant in aligning firm's value-creation to SDGs’ contribution. Finally, the study is based on an in-depth analysis of 23 manufacturers from the fast-growing fitness equipment industry, which has so far received only piecemeal attention in the sustainability and management literature.

Even though the private sector plays a pivotal role in the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the assessment of the firms’ contribution to the Goals has so far been an underexplored and complex issue. This paper proposes an analytical approach to evaluate the contribution of different sustainability and service innovation strategies to the SDGs. The proposed analytical approach uses open secondary data and content analysis to collect and analyse the sustainability and service innovation activities of a sample of firms. It also develops the Sustainability-orientated Service Innovation (SOSI) Matrix, a tool to map the firms’ strategies and their contribution to the SDGs. The results indicate that the various combinations of sustainability and service innovation strategies lead to differences in the firms’ contribution to the SDGs. In particular, service innovation has been shown to be a fundamental mediator to contribute to the SDGs. The main points of this work are i) the importance of combining sustainability and service innovation to contribute to the SDGs; ii) the development of an analytical procedure to analyse the firms’ contribution to the SDGs; iii) the definition of core SDGs, which are relevant in aligning firm's value-creation to SDGs’ contribution. Finally, the study is based on an in-depth analysis of 23 manufacturers from the fast-growing fitness equipment industry, which has so far received only piecemeal attention in the sustainability and management literature.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Sustainability-orientated service innovation  Service innovation strategy  Fitness equipment manufacturers    1 Introduction Firms cannot afford to ignore the major environmental and social issues of the economies in which they operate any more. Increasingly, they are called on not only to make profits, but also to contribute to sustainable development as defined by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of goals laid down as the basis of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda. The SDGs are seen as a compass for firms and society to achieve a level of prosperity unharmful to the planet and to its communities. These goals range from poverty reduction (SDG1) to global partnerships for sustainable development (SDG17), and are regarded as significant foci for advancing global welfare (UNDP, 2015 ). The former United Nations’ Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, stated that “Business is a vital partner in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals; companies can contribute through their core activities, and we ask companies everywhere to assess their impact, set ambitious goals and communicate transparently about the results” (UNGC, GRI, and WBCSD 2015 ). Firms are vital players in achieving the SDGs, but setting business goals that are consistent with sustainability requirements and allocating resources for their achievement might seem utopian (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). In this regard, there is a paucity of empirical studies analysing the firms’ contribution to the SDGs (de Oliveira Claro and Esteves, 2021 ; van der Waal et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, assessing how business initiatives affect sustainability goals is a complex task because of the overabundance of SDG targets (169) and indicators (232) that need to be monitored. To this purpose, it is crucial to develop tools and analytical approaches to assess how firms contribute to the SDGs (van der Waal et al., 2021 ; Jiang et al., 2018 ). Besides, it is recommended that these tools allow the evaluation of the environmental and social business footprints in an accessible, verifiable, and independent way (Donovan et al., 2016 ). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of different sustainability and service innovation strategies to the SDGs. To achieve it, this study develops an analytical approach using content analysis and open secondary data (websites), thus contributing to the increasing share of literature analysing “green issues” through the web (Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Guziana, 2011 ; Sones et al., 2009 ; Tagesson et al., 2009 ). As part of the analytical approach, the Sustainability-orientated Service Innovation Matrix (hereafter SOSI Matrix) has been designed to map the strategic positioning of firms according to their “service” and “sustainability” activities and to assess their role in achieving the SDGs (Calabrese et al., 2018a ). This answers the call for more research to be devoted to investigating how sustainability and service innovation are interwoven (Rantala et al., 2018 ; Holmlund et al., 2016 ) and also explores the under-investigated relationship between service innovation and SDGs’ achievement (Calabrese et al., 2018b ; Djellal and Gallouj, 2016 ). It also serves as a guide for those firm willing to integrate sustainability deep into their value creation process. The focus is on sustainability and service innovation strategies because these are amongst the main drivers for value creation for both business and society as a whole (Fiorini and Hoekman, 2018 ; Porter and Kramer, 2006 ). On the one hand, sustainability is nowadays considered an opportunity for firms to turn a profit out of new business developments, rather than a mere constraint to be compliant with at a cost (Nidumolu et al., 2009 ; Porter and Kramer, 2006 ). On the other hand, the service economy has been on the rise since the 70′ (readers will remember Levitt's iconic intuition, “everybody is in service” (1972 , p. 42)). In recent times, it gained further momentum with Vargo and Lusch (2008a -b ; 2004 ), who argued that service logic and service innovation are the engine of value creation for firms in any business sector. As a matter of fact, the two are often paired together as a means to address the social, environmental, and economic issues affecting our global community (Djellal and Gallouj, 2016 , 2012 ). A sample of fitness equipment manufacturers has been used in this study. This sector has been chosen because its service innovations and sustainability initiatives are positively affecting environmental and social changes. Fitness equipment manufacturers are committed to delivering wellness services (Sacavém and Correia, 2009 ), promoting healthy lives and wellbeing (i.e., SDG3), fostering the culture of physical activity and health (Papa et al., 2020 ), and reducing their ecological footprint (Addolorato et al., 2019 ). The remainder of the study is structured as follows. The next sections explain the theoretical background and the analytical procedure. Then, the results of applying the procedure to the fitness equipment manufacturing sector are presented. Finally, the last two sections discuss the main findings of this study together with its generalisability and its future developments.  2 Theoretical framework 2.1 The challenge of assessing firms’ contribution to SDGs “A new paradigm in development thinking is recognizing the centrality of private enterprise in pursuit of the development agenda – and vice versa” (United Nations Global Compact, 2014 , p. 3). Right from their design, the SDGs have highlighted the central role of firms because of their strengths in innovation, efficiency, and their ability to provide specific competencies and assets. However, are profit-orientated firms playing a role in achieving the SDGs, or are they still focusing on business as usual? In the post-SDGs years, firms have been required to show environmental and social commitment to their stakeholders and to contribute to people's lives. However, the win-win statement around the SDGs can be just a naïve declaration hiding the real conflicts that are arising between firms and society. Firms could only be “dressing in sustainability” if they are pushed to do so, but they may not be sensitive to the transformative changes that sustainability requires (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). On the contrary, “…achieving new global goals will require new global rules” (Gore, 2015 , p. 728), and a paradigm shift from pursuing shareholder value to shareholder welfare must occur. The SDGs offer the chance for firms to enlarge the scope of their business to include their shareholders, stakeholders, and the planet at once (Hart and Zingales, 2017 ). The challenges for this paradigm shift are enormous, and it is not possible to postpone the evaluation of the role played by firms in achieving the SDGs anymore. Firms need a comprehensive control and evaluation system to assess the effectiveness of their strategies to fulfil the SDGs requirements (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). It is necessary to start immediately by providing new tools for such a purpose and by monitoring not only the economic dimension but also the social and environmental ones (Donovan et al., 2016 ). Previous studies have adopted a variety of approaches to measure the contribution of private firms to the SDGs. For the most part, they have used publicly available data to perform the evaluation (Donovan et al., 2016 ). Some scholars have used categorical scales. Rosati and Faria (2019a ; b ) have adopted a categorical 0/1 scale to study the effect of variables such as firm's size and sector on the pursuit of SDGs. Similarly, in a qualitative study, Gunawan et al. (2020)  have used a 0/1 scale to derive through content analysis the pursued SDGs from a sample of sustainability reports. PWC (2019)  have adopted a 0/3 scale to elicit the intensity of the contribution of each firm to the 17 SDGs using statements in the sustainability reports. All these studies have focused on analysing the firm's contribution to the SDGs, at times linking it to a mixture of exogenous and endogenous factors such as industrial sector, size, and turnover. Other studies have developed composite indexes using multivariate analysis, such as the Systemic Indicator of Sustainable Development (SISD) (secondary open data from the World Bank) (Eustachio et al., 2019 ) or the Corporate Sustainability Index (CSI) (survey research) (Jiang et al., 2018 ). These studies have used statistical techniques such as factor analysis or principal component analysis to combine various variables such as renewable energy output and GDP growth per capita. Using the same techniques, other studies have investigated the firms’ perceived importance of contributing to the SDGs (de Oliveira Claro and Esteves, 2021 ). Another strain of studies have evaluated the firms’ contribution to SDGs through content analysis using open secondary data from websites (Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Lopez, 2020 ) or keyword search in open documents such as patent texts (van der Waal et al., 2021 ). In some cases, not only the authors have extracted the information, but they have also developed composite indexes making use of the extracted information such as the green practice spread index and the enabling technology spread index (Centobelli et al., 2020 ). Previous studies have analysed the spread of the SDGs, the factors influencing their adoption, and their joint contribution to sustainability. There has been so far little attempt to analyse, using open secondary data, how firms’ practices affect their contribution to the SDGs (de Oliveira Claro and Esteves, 2021 ; van der Waal et al., 2021 ). For this reason, this study proposes an analytical approach to assess the role of different sustainability and service innovation strategies in contributing to the SDGs.  2.2 Sustainability and service innovation strategies contributing to the SDGs Sustainability and service innovation strategies can contribute to the pursuit of the SDGs (Fiorini and Hoekman, 2018 ; UNGC, GRI, and WBCSD 2015 ). According to the evidence collected by Calabrese et al. (2018a)  through a systematic literature review, four research streams are supporting the understanding of how firms can potentially address the SDGs through their sustainability and service innovation strategies. These streams are devoted to the following four strategies: product-service system (PSS), service innovation (SI), sustainability-orientated innovation (SOI), and sustainability-orientated service innovation (SOSI). As explained below, these strategies differ for their level of sustainability and service innovation. For this reason, they can be used to analyse how various combinations of service and sustainability activities affect the firms’ contribution to the SDGs (see also Fig. 1  ). PSS research's primary focus is the development of innovative combinations of products and services enhancing the profitability of firms’ business models (Hannon et al., 2015 ; Tang and Bhamra, 2012 ; Tukker and Tischner, 2006 ). The PSS strategy aims to promoting/selling the product in a traditional manner while including in the original act of sale additional services, such as after-sales service, to guarantee functionality and durability of the products owned by the customer (maintenance, repair, re-use, and recycling, and helping customers to optimize the application of a product through training and consulting) (Baines et al., 2009 ). Firms pursuing this strategy consider service to be a necessary addition to the product that is helpful, amongst other things, to meet a number of sustainability goals (e.g., product durability). Therefore, as a fallout, the design and implementation of such bundles of product-service offerings addresses some social and/or environmental issues linked with the SDGs (Reim et al., 2015 ). In this regard, fitness equipment manufacturers are increasingly developing systems of products and services integrating equipment and performance wearable (e.g., smartwatches) to empower the fitness experience and, as a by-product, encourage physical activity and healthy lifestyles (Papa et al., 2020 ). This integration, as reported by Fiorini and Hoekman (2018) , has also resulted in a growth of productivity and human capital. SI research focuses on how to deploy technology to develop new solutions or experiences to create value for the firm and its clients (Salunke et al., 2013 ). An SI strategy is characterized by innovations related to organizational processes, activities, and routines affecting the design, development, and delivery of new service offerings as solutions for enhancing product usage (Den Hertog et al., 2010 ; Janssen et al., 2015 ). Firms following an SI strategy provide advanced services (i.e., advanced technical assistance, advanced training programs, consulting on products, education and training, financial and leasing services, and interior design) along with basic sustainability activities (e.g., durable products and employee welfare). These firms are focused on “… a new service concept, new customer interaction, new value system/business partners, new revenue model, new organizational or technological service delivery system” (Den Hertog et al., 2010 , p. 19). In pursuing SI strategies, fitness equipment manufacturers are exploiting technological innovations to deliver a number of value-added services having also a positive effect on their customers’ wellness, such as weight control programs, nutritional counselling sessions, time management, and coaching sessions (Sacavém and Correia, 2009 ). SOI strategies focus on the design and development of new organizational processes to deliver sustainable product and service offerings (Lin and Hsieh, 2014 ). The major focus of SOI is to benefit the environment and society at large through the so-called “eco-” or “green-innovations” in products and processes (Geradts and Bocken, 2019 ; Weng et al., 2015 ; Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2010 ). Firms adopting this strategy are mainly involved in the prevention of “environmental degradation” (York and Venkataraman, 2010 ), “carbon footprint innovation” (Theodoulidis et al., 2012 ), “energy-efficient and climate-friendly solutions” (Arnold and Barth, 2012 ), “environmental gains” (Keskin et al., 2013 ). Fitness equipment manufacturers are contributing to these innovations by committing themselves to improving the product life-cycle sustainability of their equipment (Addolorato et al., 2019 ). SOSI strategies exploit the interplay between service innovation and sustainability to address environmental, social, and economic goals and innovate business models. SOSI is defined as “a multi-dimensional concept that captures different elements of new service solutions by addressing environmental, social and economic sustainability issues” (Calabrese et al., 2018a , p. 541). Sustainability is a central issue for SOSI firms and their value proposition is based on sustainability-driven service innovation. Firms adopting a SOSI strategy innovate their service offerings to address environmental/social problems and to exploit the market potential of unmet market needs (Calabrese et al., 2018a -b).  2.3 The SOSI matrix The SOSI Matrix is developed to analyse the business strategies of firms according to their “sustainability” and “service” dimensions and for assessing their role in achieving the SDGs (Fig. 1 ). The Matrix displays the percentage of sustainability activities performed by firms on the ordinate axis and the rate of service activities on the abscissa axis. The sustainability dimension ranges from low (i.e., social and environmental requirements are regarded as a trustee duty) to high (i.e., sustainability activities are an integral part of the firm's core business). Similarly, the service offering of firms goes from low (services are an add-on to products) to high (services are core to the firm's business model). The sustainability-service space spanned by the SOSI Matrix can be divided into four areas through straight lines dissecting each axis. Each resulting quadrant reflects various degrees of service and sustainability activities’ adoption. In case a sample of firms is analysed, each line separating the quadrants can be drawn according to the median percentage of service and sustainability activities adopted by the firms in the sample. In this way, the lines’ shape provides information about sustainability and service adoption at the sample level. For example, in the top part of Fig. 1 , the shape of the quadrants indicates low service and high sustainability adoption at the sample level. On the contrary, at the bottom, service is high and sustainability is low. In addition, each quadrant in the SOSI Matrix can be labelled using one of the four strategies outlined in the previous section. Along the x-axis, the strategies differ for their content of service activities, whereas on the y-axis they differ for their content of sustainability activities. Thus, on the lower quadrants, there will be strategies for which sustainability is low and service is low (on the left) and high (on the right). On the upper quadrants, strategies will follow an analogous pattern. Finally, to include the contribution to the SDGs by each firm, companies are represented on the SOSI Matrix through a point: the larger the radius, the higher the number of SDGs pursued by the firm through its activities.   3 Research methodology 3.1 Outline of the analytical approach Analogously to Centobelli et al. (2020) , Haffar and Searcy (2018) , and Centobelli et al. (2017) , a six-step analytical approach was designed. It includes open secondary data from a sample of firms, analysis of firms’ service and sustainability activities, and evaluation of firms’ role in pursuing the SDGs. In Step 1, the sample of firms was selected. Firms with the highest turnovers and market shares were included. This allows the selection of firms having the most significant aggregate market power and comparable strategies in the industrial sector. Steps 2 to 4 involved the extraction of the service and sustainability activities and the evaluation of their contribution to the SDGs. Open secondary data (firm's websites) were employed because, other than being widespread and available for free for public use, they allow the gathering of information that would otherwise be accessible only through stakeholder interviews (i.e., at higher costs) or through the analysis of sustainability reports (i.e., virtually filtered to accommodate the company's wishes). On the contrary, primary data regarding the firm's strategies and their role in achieving the SDGs can be affected by availability, accessibility, cost, and timeliness considerations (Lee-Post and Pakath, 2019 ). Step 2 involved the extraction of the “service” and “sustainability activities” as reported on each firm's website, a useful source to evaluate the firm's business actions (Lopez, 2020 ). In Step 3, the extracted service and sustainability activities were clustered into “specific types”, according to a theoretical reference. Sustainability activities were classified as either environmental (Montabon et al., 2007 ) or socio-economic (Popovic et al., 2018 ), while services were categorized as “basic” or standard services (e.g., product shipment), and “advanced” or innovative services (e.g., platforms based on artificial intelligence) (Baines et al., 2017 ). In Step 4, each sustainability activity was paired with one or more SDGs. Both environmental and socio-economic sustainability activities were associated with one or more SDGs by definition. The service activities were instead regarded as mediators of the SDGs pursuit. As pointed out by Fiorini and Hoekman (2018) , eradicating poverty (SDG 1) or hunger (SDG 2), improving health (SDG 3) or education (SDG 4), as well as reducing inequality (SDG 10) depends significantly on logistics, medical and ICT services. Thus services do not contribute directly to these goals but play a role in their pursuit (Saviano et al., 2017 ; Gustafsson et al., 2016 ; Enquist et al., 2015 ). In Step 5, the analysis was validated through reliability analysis and triangulation. An external coder was involved at this time (Wildemuth, 2009 ). Such a step is not necessary but is welcomed in any study of this type and is performed to, “…bolster our own confidence in our assertions and findings” (Gioia et al., 2013 ). The verified information was further triangulated with other sources such as corporates’ financial and sustainability reports and other websites not used for the analysis (such as the GRI website). Finally, in Step 6, firms were positioned on the SOSI Matrix. The contribution of the firm's strategic combinations of sustainability and service activities to the SDGs was visualized by plotting each company in the SOSI Matrix as a circle with a radius proportional to the number of service and sustainability activities contributing to specific SDGs (see also Fig. 1 ).  3.2 The analytical approach in practice Fig. 2   provides a comprehensive outline of the analytical approach outlined in the previous section. Its details are reported here. Content analysis was used to analyse the open secondary data, namely the firms’ websites (Krippendorff, 2004 ; Berelson, 1952 ). Content analysis is a replicable and systematic technique for extracting data from textual information and for classifying them into specific categories (Krippendorff, 2004 ; Berelson, 1952 ). In the service field, content analysis has been employed to detect service activities of manufacturers from the firm's textual descriptions collected from databases (Benedettini et al., 2017 ; Story et al., 2017 ), as well as from web-reported service offerings (Gaiardelli et al., 2014 ). In sustainability studies, content analysis has been mainly employed to extract information from sustainability reports (Gerged et al., 2018 ; Landrum and Ohsowski, 2018 ), or firm's websites (Lee, 2017 ; Onn and Woodley, 2014 ). In this research, content analysis was used to extract and classify service and sustainability activities from the firms’ websites and, subsequently, for pairing these activities with specific SDGs. At an operational level, steps 2 to 4 were carried out by two coders working in parallel (Montabon et al., 2007 ) that followed an iterative, emerging pattern approach (Haffar and Searcy, 2018 ; Story et al., 2017 ; Gioia et al., 2013 ; Eisenhardt, 1989 ), based on coder discussions (Gioia et al., 2013 ; Cassell and Symon, 2004 ; Krippendorff, 2004 ). The coders read each website and extracted the service and sustainability activities. In case of a disagreement on an item, the coders discussed the item and read again the websites. Iterations stopped at the theoretical saturation point when full agreement on definitions and classifications of each service and sustainability activity was reached (Bryman, 2015 ). Twenty-eight (28) sustainability activities and twenty-nine (29) service activities emerged from the first round. After three additional rounds of refinement, discussion, and analysis, nine sustainability activities and twelve service activities were identified (Tables A.1  and A.2  in Appendix A ). As an example of the procedure, during the first round, both the “Pallet Recycling” and “Pallet Reutilization” emerged as different sustainability activities. During the discussion, the two coders and the other authors agreed on putting them under the standard label “Recycling.” Using another example, during the first round of website examination, “Product Shipment” and “Parts Shipment” were counted as separate service activities; again, during the discussion phase, the authors agreed to create a new label titled “Products/parts shipment” to include both. At this point, the sustainability activities were paired with the SDGs. Similarly to the extraction of the activities, the pairings were performed by two coders. For each SDG, a thesaurus of keywords was developed analogously to van der Waal et al. (2021)  and Sullivan et al. (2018) . This thesaurus is reported in Appendix A  (Table A.3 ). The sustainability activities were matched to the SDGs based on the semantic similarity between each activity's definition and the goals’ description in the thesaurus (Sánchez and Batet, 2013 ). amongst the 17 SDGs, only 16 were considered. SDG 17 was discarded because it is dedicated to a cross-cutting means of implementation for the whole set of SDGs (Le Blanc, 2015 ). As noted by Le Blanc (2015) , SDGs have a complex network structure consisting of many links amongst them. This is reflected in the analysis below in the one-to-many relationship between sustainability activities and SDGs. Reliability analysis was performed using the ‘percentage agreement’ criterion (Kassarjian, 1977 ), in which the agreement between the authors’ and external coder's classification was measured. There was a 93% agreement, thus the results were accepted as this agreement is higher than the recommended Kassarjian's acceptance threshold (85%) (1977) (Damert and Baumgartner, 2018 ; Montabon et al., 2007 ). In the final step, firms were scattered on the SOSI matrix according to how many sustainability and service innovation activities each performed.   4 Descriptive case study – fitness equipment manufacturers 4.1 Sample description The analytical approach explained in the previous section was applied to analyse a sample of 23 fitness equipment manufacturers with the highest turnover and market share according to the “Global Fitness Equipment Sales Market Report 2017″ issued by “Market Research Hub”. The expected revenue increase in the market of fitness, sports and performance wearables have been forecast to rise from $3.5 billion in 2014 to $14.9 billion in 2021 (marketwired.com, 2015), signalling the potential of fitness equipment manufacturers to contribute to both economic growth and global health. The sample selection is based on both turnover and market share rankings and it is consistent with analogous studies using rankings from business magazines such as “Corporate Knights” (Haffar and Searcy, 2018 ), “Fortune” (Pollach et al., 2009 ), and the “Dow Jones Sustainability Index” (Lopez, 2020 ). Table 1   reports the 23 firms in the sample along with their geographical location and key business figures.  4.2 Service and sustainability activities Table 2   presents the name of the 12 service activities, their acronyms (SER), their definition, and examples of the strings used for their identification. Analogously, Table 3   reports the 9 sustainability activities, their acronyms (SUS), their definitions, and several examples of strings extracted from the firm's websites to identify them. Table 3  also shows the matching between the detected sustainability activities and the SDGs. As explained in the above, the relationship between sustainability activities and SDGs is often one-to-many because the SDGs have a high degree of internal connection (Le Blanc, 2015 ). For example, based on the descriptions in Table 3  and the thesaurus in Table A.3 , the sustainability activity SUS2 (Adoption of processes, practices, and technological solutions explicitly aimed at reducing the consumption of resources, and thus pollution) is matched with SDG12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns) and SDG13 (Combat climate change). Additional data in granular form for both tables (i.e., the sustainability and service activities extracted from each company) are reported in Appendix B  (Tables B.1  and B.2 ).  4.3 Analysis at the sample level Fig. 3   reports the percentages of the environmental and socio-economic activities adopted by the firms. Environmental activities were found to be almost double in proportion to social activities. Sample firms considered their ecological footprint as their primary responsibility; nevertheless, the pursuit of specific socio-economic goals was explored to tackle particular issues. For example, after noticing a cancellation of gym memberships at the rate of 30% a year, “Life Fitness” decided to improve the quality of their customer experience by enhancing their equipment's health and safety (SUS 7). As a result, they are now delivering a new Halo Fitness Cloud service to allow fitness members to integrate their gym experiences with wearables (e.g., Apple Watch) for supporting retention through monitoring during and between training sessions. Fig. 4   reports the percentage of basic and advanced service activities adopted by the firms in the sample. Both basic and advanced service activities were adopted at a higher proportion than sustainability activities (Fig. 4 ). Basic services stood out with a median adoption rate of more than 90%, while for advanced services, the proportions were significantly lower (about 40%). The data can be explained by noting that advanced services, as well as sustainability-orientated business models, implied a more radical transformation of the manufacturer's business. Finally, Fig. 5   shows the SDGs and their percentage pursued by the 23 firms. Fig. 5  shows that the SDG3 (“Good Health and Well-being”), SDG7 (“Affordable and Clean Energy”), SDG8 (“Decent Work and Economic Growth”), SDG12 (“Responsible Consumption and Production”), and SDG13 (“Climate Action”) were the five most pursued SDGs. As shown in Table 3 , partnerships with medical centers (SUS 9) and local communities (SUS6) for creating shared value (SUS9), product safety, and consumer welfare (SUS7) allow contributing to the SDG3. The design and commercialization of innovative products such as the “ECO-POWR” by “SportsArt,” which converts human kinetic energy into grid power (SUS5), supports the production of affordable and clean energy (SDG7). Decent work and economic growth (SDG8) is pursued through direct sponsorship of initiatives for promoting economic or social benefits for the local community (SUS6). Product design and manufacture consistent with health risk reduction (SUS7), as well as human resource management inspired by the work-life balance of employees (SUS8), contribute to the SDG8. Responsible production and consumption (i.e., SDG12) are pursued through the production of long-lasting products (SUS1), the sparing of energy and materials through process redesign (SUS2), the adoption of recycling practices (SUS4), and the banning of hazardous materials (SUS7). Finally, energy and material consumption reduction (SUS2) and recycling (SUS4) are the main initiatives supporting the achievement of the SDG13 (“Climate Action”).  4.4 Analysis at the firm level This section reports the firm-wise analysis of the activities adopted by each firm. Then, using the SOSI Matrix, it analyses these activities and their role in achieving the SDGs. Appendix C  and D report the firm-wise graphs in the format of the previous section. At the firm level, the most adopted service activities are SER2, SER3, SER5, SER6, SER10, and SER12, whereas the most adopted sustainability activities are SUS1, SUS2, SUS4, SUS5 and, to a lesser degree, SUS7 and SUS9 (see Appendix A  and B for granular data). These activities can be grouped in product-related activities (SUS1, SUS2, SER2, SER5, SER6, SER10) and customer-related activities (SUS7, SER3, SER12). The former are concerned with fitness equipment firms’ main goals as traditional manufacturers willing to improve their sustainability practices. These activities boil down to making durable products and assisting customers in using them. The latter set of activities is peculiar to those manufacturers that have shifted their value-creation paradigm to service and, at the same time, are willing to improve their sustainability performance. These manufacturers focus on their stakeholders (the users of their equipment) by developing products with training programmes aimed at improving their health. Fig. 6   uses the SOSI Matrix to display the overall adoption of service and sustainability activities as well as their interaction. As explained earlier, the radius of each point is proportional to the number of SDGs contributed to by the firm. The median percentage of overall service activities adopted by the firms in the sample is 55%. In comparison, the median percentage of overall sustainability activities is 11%. Six firms are outperforming the adoption of median sustainability practices. They are pursuing both environmental and socio-economic goals as a whole rather than as a set of independent aspects (e.g., environmental and socio-economic). Almost half of the firms (11 out of 23) did not report any environmental or socio-economic sustainability activity (see also Appendix D.1). On the other hand, all the firms are active in service provision. However, while the proportion of firms engaged solely in basic service activities is not negligible (i.e., 26%), almost 70% of firms considered some form of advanced service as essential for their business (see also Appendix D.2). In addition, the SOSI Matrix shows that quite a number of firms are playing a role in achieving the SDGs. In particular, 52% of the firms are contributing to at least one SDG (see also Appendix D.3). The firms in the SOSI quadrant are those that are most contributing to the SDGs. Each of them but one is contributing to SDG3 (circled in red). Overall, the SOSI Matrix shows the existence of a “latent” effect of services on the SDGs: sustainability initiatives, coupled with services, have a more significant influence on the SDGs than sustainability initiatives alone. If that would not be the case, one would expect the same contribution to the SDGs in the SOI and SOSI quadrants, which is not the case. The contribution of the service dimension to the SDGs is “latent” because the service activities have not been linked to the SDGs as the sustainability activities have.   5 Discussion 5.1 The analytical approach Assessing the contribution of firms to the SDGs is an intricate question that has been addressed from different angles in previous literature (van der Waal et al., 2021 ; Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Lopez, 2020 ; Eustachio et al., 2019 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019a -b ; Jiang et al., 2018 ; Müller et al., 2015 ). The present study furthers the literature devoted to developing frameworks and procedures to better understanding the contribution of companies to sustainable development (van der Waal et al., 2021 ; Centobelli et al., 2020 ; Jiang et al., 2018 ). It does so by developing an analytical approach that relates sustainability and service innovation activities to the SDGs. Its major contribution is that it enables practitioners to explore how certain business activities can be combined to create value and to contribute to the SDGs (Lopez, 2020 ; Endl et al., 2019 ; Eustachio et al., 2019 ). It also gives firms the opportunity to be aware of the best practices in their sector thus, hopefully, fastening their diffusion (Lopez, 2020 ; Villagra and López, 2013 ). Another relevant point is that the approach uses web data, which have the double advantage of being readily available and intimately connected to the companies’ real actions (Lopez, 2020 ). In fact, the web is a well-established source that firms use to share their activities, including the sustainability-related ones (Guziana, 2011 ; Coope, 2004 ), which can be analysed and linked to the SDGs through the approach presented here. Finally, this analytical approach is relevant because it encourages proactivity in contributing to the SDGs. Most of the previous approaches perform ex-post evaluations of how certain factors, or activities, have affected the contribution to the SDGs as a whole (see for example García-Sánchez et al., 2020a -b  and Rosati and Faria, 2019a -b ). These approaches are useful to monitor the progress toward the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and to single out the factors that may prevent this achievement. Yet, they leave firms clueless as regards the SDGs they can pursue with their business as well as the actions they can enact to empower their contribution in creating value for all their stakeholders (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ).  5.2 The SDGs and service innovation strategies The results in this study are particularly meaningful because nowadays pressure on firms is mounting requiring them not only to maximize profits but also to contribute to sustainable development. Some firms may consider this expectation to be unfair, too ambitious and challenging to manage. Firms may also be reluctant to acknowledge their responsibilities in creating the problems that they are now called on to solve (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). The SOSI strategy offers a way forward to reconcile apparently contrasting shareholder and stakeholder expectations and to allow firms to align their core service innovation with SDGs requirements. As regards the fitness equipment manufacturers, they adopt four strategies characterized by different combinations of “service” and “sustainability” activities. All four strategies have so far proved to be effective because they have been implemented by companies with turnover and market share above the sector average. Nevertheless, only the SOSI strategy is heavily orientated toward the integration of the SDGs into the firm's strategy and, therefore, into capturing the challenges related to contributing to them proactively (Calabrese et al., 2018a -b). For example, one firm following a SOSI strategy (“Technogym”) announced a joint initiative with IBM for the development of a new generation of fitness coaching platforms based on artificial intelligence. The aim is to create a virtual coach able to interact with people through natural language, to offer personalized training programs based on weather conditions, personal commitments, and diet, and to encourage the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle (i.e., SGD3). Notably, Technogym's SOSI strategy allows the pursuing of the SDG3, which is closely connected to the core business of fitness equipment manufacturers, namely to promote healthy lives and well-being. About 90% of firms belonging to the SOSI quadrant (i.e., the red circles of Fig. 6 ) contribute to SDG3 through their sustainability and service innovation strategies. Being so closely linked to the value proposition of fitness equipment manufacturers, this SDG is marked as a “core SDG” to the sector under investigation.  5.3 The “Core SDGs”: a proposal for integrating the SDGs into firms’ strategies The fairest way to maximize profit is to create “shared value” (Porter and Kramer, 2006 ) or “shareholder welfare” because several shareholders are prosocial and care about both their firm's success, and the health of society at large (Hart and Zingales, 2017 ). A consistent approach mixing profit maximization with social and environmental goals could be accomplished by aligning service innovation strategies to the SDGs which are closely connected to the core business of a firm. This study suggests to refer to these goals as “Core SDGs”. For gym equipment manufacturers, the “Core SDGs” are the SDG3 (i.e., contributors to societal health and well-being), SDG7 (i.e., affordable and clean energy), and SDG12 (i.e., responsible consumption and production). The latter two SDGs are peculiar to any manufacturing firm, while the first one is specific to gym equipment manufacturers. The SDG3 promotes healthy lives and well-being for all people at all ages, which is a typical side effect of responsible physical activity. amongst other things, the SDG3 makes for the first time non-communicable diseases (e.g., stroke, cancer, diabetes, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune diseases) an explicit objective of health policy (Campbell et al., 2017 ). These diseases are threatening economic and social development on a worldwide basis (Bloom et al., 2011 ) and their prevention is crucial because they account for 54% of disability-adjusted life years, and 87% deaths (Campbell et al., 2017 ). As argued in this study, not only policy makers, but also private firms can play a significant role in achieving this goal. Fitness equipment manufacturers in particular can make a difference. Physical activity is one of the primary antecedents for health promotion and prevention of the primary non-communicable diseases (Pate et al., 1995 ). Instead, sedentary-living habits are still widespread in people of all ages, genders, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status, and represent a significant obstacle to healthy lives and well-being (Church et al., 2007 ). Physical activity is also a valid clinical intervention in patients with heart disease, breast cancer, and diabetes to reduce the risk of mortality. Consequently, sustainability and service innovation strategies aimed at contributing to the SDG3 are of paramount importance in the fitness sector and represent an unexplored business opportunity for both technological innovation and social change. Not only fitness equipment manufacturers, but also several industrial sectors can contribute to the healthy lives and well-being envisioned by the SDG3 through service innovation (van Vuuren et al., 2015 ). For example, alcohol and beverage firms can use innovative strategies to prevent alcohol abuse or to limit sugary beverages. Similarly, food-manufacturing companies can switch from the production of ultra-processed products to healthier products, thus creating new conditions for their economic sustainability (Calabrese et al., 2018b ). In addition, other industrial sectors can work out their own “core SDGs” and innovate their sustainability and service strategies to provide at once profit for shareholders and welfare for stakeholders.   6 Conclusion and limitations The SDGs can be a long-term strategic compass for companies as well as a driver of sustainable development for society as a whole. However, the distance between the high-level political agreements underpinning the SDGs and the actual business strategies can generate the feeling that the SDGs are unattainable and, therefore, discourage consistent strategic initiatives to pursue them. Several step-by-step tools are available to support the integration process between business strategies and SDGs such as, for example, the SDG Compass developed by the Global Reporting Initiative, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (UNGC, GRI, and WBCSD 2015 ). The analytical approach developed in this paper can be employed to analyse how firms’ sustainability and service innovation strategies are contributing to the SDGs. Compared to other approaches, mostly devoted to ex post measurement of targets, this one includes a tool, the SOSI Matrix, which encourages a proactive approach to contribute to the SDGs. In fact, it argues in favour of the addition of value-added service activities side by side to sustainability initiatives. Its employment to the analysis of the firms in the fitness equipment manufacturing sector has shown that service innovation is essential for firms to contribute to the SDGs. Furthermore, the definition of “Core SDGs”, namely SDGs aligned to the firm's value proposition, has shown that they are pursued by firms adopting a SOSI strategy. Taking this into consideration when planning a strategy will allow an increase in the integration of SDGs in business strategies while avoiding the SDGs that only create additional costs and burdens for firms. Future research can be devoted to applying the SOSI Matrix and the analytical approach shown here to other sectors. This will increase our knowledge about the progress of sustainable development and the contribution of the private sector to such progress. In addition, being this study cross sectional, other scholars are encouraged to perform an analogous analysis on datasets spanning more than one year. As a further point, as the scale adopted in this study allows the evaluation of the firms’ contribution to the SDGs, other studies can use different scales to evaluate, for example, the firms’ impact on the Goals. Finally, using the notion of “SDG Core”, firms in different segments can identify those goals most suitable to be integrated to their business and pursue them through appropriate sustainability and service activities. On the other hand, policy makers can take advantage of this approach to funnel their resources to the adoption of core SDGs in each business segment.
