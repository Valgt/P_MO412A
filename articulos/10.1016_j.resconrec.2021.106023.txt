                  The construction industry plays an essential role in a country's economic growth. The industry has been criticised for activities and processes that generate high volumes of waste, whilst obstructing sustainable development goal (SDGs) targets. The circular economy (CE) increases waste minimisation by keeping materials and resources in a closed loop. This concept has continued to gain positive traction as a potential solution to achieve sustainable development. The authors argue that contextualising the circular economy (CE) as part of the discourse towards implementing the United Nations (UN) SDGs Agenda 2030 is crucial for managing the increasing amounts of waste generated by the construction industry. This paper provides a framework that establishes a detailed relationship between the SDGs, construction waste management and the CE to direct future sustainable development research, policies, and innovations. The study adopted a narrative literature review methodology. Scopus and Web of Science were scoured for relevant literature published between 2015 and 2021. Initially 65 articles were identified with this number being reduced to 24 following a detailed inspection of their applicability to the study. The findings from the articles were summarized, synthesized, and incorporated into the study. A key theme that emerged was that an understanding of the SDGs-circular economy linkages in construction waste management is integral to establishing long-term innovative solutions for developing multi-sectorial measures for waste prevention, eco-design, and re-use of materials. These linkages increase competitiveness, stimulate innovation, and boost economic growth. This study proposes that all stakeholders who generate waste should apply new innovative technologies, methods and strategies leading to transdisciplinary and transformative change.

Initially 65 articles were identified with this number being reduced to 24 following a detailed inspection of their applicability to the study. The findings from the articles were summarized, synthesized, and incorporated into the study. A key theme that emerged was that an understanding of the SDGs-circular economy linkages in construction waste management is integral to establishing long-term innovative solutions for developing multi-sectorial measures for waste prevention, eco-design, and re-use of materials. These linkages increase competitiveness, stimulate innovation, and boost economic growth. This study proposes that all stakeholders who generate waste should apply new innovative technologies, methods and strategies leading to transdisciplinary and transformative change.

Likewise, finite natural resources that are used as raw materials for construction are increasingly being depleting due to continuous extraction. Waste generation resulting from human activities during construction is also on the rise, with little effort being made to minimise it. Hossain et al. (2020)  argues that the industry not only produces waste but also absorbs a significant amount of resources. This appears to be throughout the world. In the United Kingdom (UK), DEFRA (2021)  estimated that about 137.8 million tonnes of construction, demolition and excavation waste was generated in 2018. During the 2018–19 fiscal year, Australia generated 12.7 million tonnes of construction waste (ABS, 2020 ). In 2016, 13.8 million tonnes of construction waste were recorded in Finland (Official Statistics of Finland, 2018 ). In 2017, approximately 5.4 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste in South Africa generated (Tiseo, 2020 ), while China generated 2.36 billion tonnes of construction waste in 2018 (Ginga et al., 2020 ). The Environmental Protection Agency estimated that 600 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste were generated in the United States in 2018 (U.S. E.P.A, 2021 ). It is important to note that the bulk of the waste is often sent to landfill, while less than one-third is either reused or recycled (WEF, 2016 ). Landfilling, as opposed to reuse and recycling endangers human health, and has an impact on biodiversity. It is evident that the construction industry generates waste while consuming scarce resources and generating pollution through its operations. As a result of these detrimental consequences, the construction industry presents a major challenge towards promoting sustainable development of materials used in its operations. Gautam et al. (2019 :220) described sustainable development as “a constraint upon present consumption in order to ensure that future generation will inherit a resource base that is no less than the inheritance of the previous generation ”. Given the current rate of raw material extraction, future generations are likely to run out of finite resources to meet their needs. In addition, the depletion of the ozone layer as a result of waste, pollution, and climate change is exacerbating the challenges of living sustainably. Consequently, governments around the world, academics and industry practitioners are making concerted efforts to ensure that sustainable development is achieved. Governments across the globe agreed to implement a set of priorities known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 (United Nations, 2017 ). Good health and well-being (goal 3), clean water and sanitation (goal 6), affordable and clean energy (goal 7), decent work and economic growth (goal 8), industry, innovation, and infrastructure (goal 9), sustainable cities and communities (goal 11), responsible consumption and production (goal 12), climate action (goal 13), life below water (goal 14) and life on land (goal 15) are the basic characteristics of resource efficiency, and a pollution and waste-free environment. The application of SDGs to the construction industry by organisations and governments has shown that goals 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17 can be achieved ((Czerwinska, 2019 ); Goubran, 2019 ). However, a sustainable method of construction is needed to achieve these goals. Sustainable construction is an industry approach to achieving sustainable development and the SDGs, with the goal of reducing waste to improve resource efficiency and environmental protection. Pomponi and Moncaster (2017)  observed that the built environment is a conduit to minimising environmental degradation caused by construction activities. More so, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2020)  revealed that the built environment contributes to human well-being through sustainable construction of infrastructure, public spaces, and urban form. Kibert (2016 :10) identified principles of sustainable construction to include “reduce resource consumption; reuse resources; use recyclable resources; protect nature; eliminate toxics; apply life-cycle costing; and focus on quality ”. The demand for a sustainable construction approach that integrates all of these principles to provide a holistic solution to the industry's challenge of achieving the sustainable development continues to gain traction. The circular economy (CE) concept is identified as a potential sustainable construction approach to meet the needs of the industry. Through design and intention, the CE can restore and regenerate materials (Murray et al., 2017 ; Qian and Wang, 2016 ). It can also increase waste minimisation by keeping materials and resources in a closed loop. Therefore, it is perceived amongst policymakers as a novel approach to sustainable development and a framework for implementing the SDGs at local and national levels. Many governments have also pledged to include the circular economy in their national development goals. The European Union, for example, created a circular economy action plan, while Uruguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Chile have created specific roadmaps. Other countries, like the United States, Australia, and China, have created circular economy initiatives and policies. The CE provides strong opportunities to reduce emissions and waste as well as to conserve material (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ). As a result, the World Green Building Council acknowledged the CE as one of the innovations that could enable the built environment contribute to sustainable development. Applying the CE to construction processes is feasible and has been investigated by several authors (Murray et al., 2017 ; Moreno et al., 2015 ; Ghisellini et al., 2018 ). Their findings have shown that the CE is significant in reducing waste and resource extraction. Despite the potential of the CE, there is limited research on the relationships between it, construction waste management and the SDGs. This is apparent from the meagre attention it has attracted from scholars. Several studies have examined the significance of CE practices to the SDGs (Schroeder et al., 2019 ) and how CE practices can aid in achieving the SDGs (van Kruchten and van Eijk, 2020 ). These studies revealed that the CE can be used as a tool and implementation technique to achieve significant percentage of SDGs. It can also decrease environmental consequences by reusing materials and providing product as a service. In spite of these results, the relationship amongst the CE, construction waste management and the SDGs is yet to be explored. This study is novel because it examines the relationship amongst the CE, construction waste management and the SDGs, which is integral to establishing long-term innovative solutions for developing multi-sectorial measures for waste prevention, eco-design and re-use of materials while increasing competitiveness, stimulating innovation, and boosting economic growth. The objectives of this paper are to:• investigate the applicability and opportunities for circularity in the construction industry; and  • explore linkages amongst the CE, construction waste management and the SDGs.    A relationship framework that establishes the mechanism between the CE, construction waste management and the SDGs was developed. It provides opportunities for construction professionals and stakeholders to implement the CE at all phases of construction. The remainder of the paper is organised into sections. Section 2 discusses the SDGs, while section 3 describes the methodology adopted for the study. Section 4 highlights construction waste minimisation approaches, sustainable construction, and its principles, while section 5 describes the circular economy concept. Section 6 identifies the applicability and opportunities for circularity in construction activities and links amongst CE, construction waste minimisation and SDGs. Section 7 concludes the study.  2 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) For the purpose of this study, sustainability will refer to the current actions, processes and methods adapted by construction professionals and stakeholders to respond to existing and emerging industry needs while maintaining a balance of social, economic, and environmental factors. Sustainability is multifaceted in the sense that it spans all sectors and can be viewed from different perspectives. As such, it has neither an accepted nor a common definition. Nevertheless, its essence stems from its capacity to be long-lasting and preserve resources. As a result, many sectors, including construction, manufacturing, agriculture. and marketing, have adopted sustainability in their processes. Likewise, (Rantala et al., 2018 ) observed that individuals, institutions, governments, and organisations have also adopted the concept of sustainability. This further attests to the importance of sustainability in daily life, in particular its ability to mitigate environmental pollution, reduce costs, increase safety, and enhance air quality, all of which are goals of sustainable development. The SDGs were established in 2012 and revised in 2015 as Agenda 30, resulting in 17 goals. The SDGs emerged as a replacement to the successful Millennium Development Goals, which tackled poverty. The SDGs comprised 17 interrelated goals developed as a result of global efforts to maintain peace and justice, eliminate hunger, and preserve the environment (United Nations, 2015 ). Major industries, sectors and organisations typically impact (positively or negatively) on achieving the SDGs. However, some roles and goals can be specific to certain industries. For example, a study by Ogunmakinde (2019b)  identified specific SDG goals (3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 15) that can be accomplished by the construction industry. According to Opoku (2019) , the built environment can achieve SDG 15 (life on land) through biodiversity conservation, while Goubran (2019)  stated that SDG 11, SDG 6, and SDG 7 are heavily reliant on the industry. Similarly, Omer and Noguchi (2020)  demonstrated that building materials have a direct positive impact on seven SDGs: 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 15. Based on these and other research (see Table 2 ), it is possible to conclude that there are numerous SDGs that are directly and/or explicitly linked to the operations of the industry. They include SDG 3–good health and wellbeing; SDG 6–clean water and sanitation; SDG 7–affordable and clean energy; SDG 8 - decent work and economic growth; SDG 9 - industry, innovation, and infrastructure; SDG 11 - sustainable cities and communities; SDG 12–responsible consumption and production; SDG 13–climate action; SDG 15–life on land; and SDG 17–Partnerships for the goals. Other SD goals that are indirectly and/or implicitly connected to the construction industry are SDG 1–No poverty; SDG 2–Zero hunger; SDG 4–Quality education; SDG 5–Gender equality; SDG 10–Reduced inequality; and SDG 16–Peace, justice, and strong institutions. The United Nations (UN) (2017)  outlined particular areas needing support for the implementation of SDGs, which are performance management, data information, capacity building, technical assistance, and allocation of sufficient financial capital. The potential for these areas to contribute to achieving the SDGs is yet to be investigated in a rigorous manner. However, it is possible and desirable for these areas to be explored by construction researchers to achieve the SDGs (Table 1  )  3 Methodology To address the two research objectives, a narrative literature review was conducted. Narrative reviews critically and objectively examine extant knowledge on a topic within a context. The goal of a narrative review is to find studies that describe a specific problem of interest (Demiris et al., 2019 ) and to connect studies on various topics in order to show their relationships. The use of narrative literature is not new in construction waste investigation. Ghisellini, Ji, Liu, and Ulgiati (2018) , for example, utilised this approach to investigate building waste management in China. For this study, the review was conducted in four steps. The first was to identify keywords, the second involved searches of relevant database(s), the third was to review abstracts and articles, while the last step was to document and analyse results. Keywords such as “circular economy”, “construction waste”, and “sustainable development goals” were used to identify relevant literature. The keywords were looked up in two different databases: Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). These databases are regarded as the most credible scientific citation indexes for construction-related topics, with stringent screening procedures (Zhai et al., 2021 ; Bastidas-Manzano et al., 2021 ). They contain peer-reviewed and scholarly articles written by reputable scholars and researchers in their fields and published by prestigious journals. The search format was “circular economy” AND “construction waste” AND “sustainable development goals”. The search was structured in this manner to limit the results to only papers that addressed all the search terms. More specifically, the Boolean operator (“AND”) was used as a conjunction to integrate the keywords in order to achieve more focused and productive results, given the various ways in which authors may have phrased the keywords. In addition, a timeframe of 2015–2021 was used to narrow search results because SDGs was introduced in 2015 and the discourse of construction waste minimisation emerged during this time frame. Based on the keywords and the timeframe, a total of 65 articles (Table 2  ) were retrieved from the two databases (Scopus = 35 and WoS = 30). As part of the reviewing process, all duplicates (18) were removed, and the abstracts of the remaining 47 articles were inspected to identify those relevant to the problem being examined. Following a thorough review of the abstracts, a total of 24 articles (including conference papers, journal articles, books, and government publications) were determined to be pertinent to the study. Thereafter, each article was read to determine its contents, patterns, ideas, and findings, as well as to ensure that it addressed the research objectives. The findings from the articles were summarized, synthesized, and incorporated into the study's discussion and other areas as deemed necessary.  4 Construction waste minimisation The dynamic nature of the construction industry is also reflected in its processes and activities. Construction processes entail creative actions to unite the different parts of a structure to form a whole within a limited time. This implies that construction is a project-based activity (Koolwijk et al., 2018 ) requiring resources, time, and a goal. The four levels common to each construction project are the site operation, detailed project cycle, the construction business and the creation of human settlement as described by Irurah (2001) . Construction activities are classified as input and output, with the former being resources (e.g., materials and funds) that are chanelled into a construction project and the latter being products (e.g., infrastructure, GDP contribution, and waste) generated from the project (Fig. 1  ) (Ogunmakinde, 2019b ). This study focuses on the waste output. It can be argued that all phases and activities of construction generate waste. The volume of waste generated from each phase and/or activity may vary. However, there is a need to ensure that as much waste as possible is minimised. Construction waste minimisation is aimed to reduce waste by determining its causes, reducing it from source and applying ameliorating techniques (Osmani, 2011 ). Waste can be minimised at all phases of construction, including design, procurement, and actual construction (Yuan, 2013 ). This highlights the importance of minimising waste prior to generation instead of managing waste upon generation. Waste minimisation strategies (Yuan 2013 ; Osmani, 2011 ) as well as legislative approaches (Oyedele et al., 2013 ; Brown and Johnstone, 2014 ) are identified in the literature. Design strategies that might be utilised to avoid waste include design for deconstruction and flexibility, design for waste-efficient procurement, design for off-site construction, design for material optimization and design for reuse and recovery (WRAP, 2009 ). Other design approaches as practiced by UK architects to minimise waste include conducting a feasibility study on waste estimation, specifying recycled materials and precast units, and using standard units and dimensions (Osmani, 2011 ). Dimensional coordination, modular design (Formoso et al., 2002 ) and waste prediction tools such as a waste index that calculates volume of waste per square metre (Poon et al., 2001 ) and a classification model that predicts the quantity of waste (Solís-Guzmán et al., 2009 ) have been used. Using data from previous construction projects to quantify waste, the Building Research Establishment, UK developed a digital waste management tool known as SMARTWaste. Similarly, Jalali (2007)  invented the component index and the global index. The former employs global data to estimate waste per square metre, while the latter uses building components. A tool (NetWaste) developed by the WRAP (2008)  in the UK has been used to forecast waste quantity and cost through project information. WRAP developed tools that are role-specific for professionals in the construction industry in identifying and minimising waste. Examples include Design-Out Waste Tools for Civil Engineers (DOWT-CE) and Design-Out Waste Tools for Builders (DOWT-B). In order to evaluate potential waste from design, Ekanayake and Ofori (2004) produced a Building Waste Assessment Score (BWAS) that can help designers apply appropriate minimisation measures. These tools have the capacity to predict waste but depend on the collection, classification, and storage of existing data. These are not trivial activities, requiring the commitment of resources as well as adherence to defined procedures. The reality of present-day workplaces is that these requirements are rarely prioritized over mainstream construction activities. Instances where they have been found to occur are where clients wish to obtain high sustainability ratings for their new buildings (Newaz et al., 2020 ). This practice is far from widespread, and the aforementioned tools appear as yet to be seldom used in the construction industry. During the procurement phase, waste minimisation strategies can and have been employed. Factors like prompt delivery, adequate storage, procurement of less packaged materials and limiting over-ordering of materials (Greenwood et al., 2003 ) can assist in waste minimisation. Dainty and Brooke (2004)  described the just-in-time approach as a potential waste minimisation measure at the procurement phase. This allows materials to be delivered to site as and when required, thus preventing prolonged storage. Ogunmakinde (2019b)  also identified ‘buy green’ and ‘act green’ as efficient procurement strategies to reduce waste. These can only be effective if there is strong collaboration and a genuine intention to minimise waste amongst stakeholders responsible for the design, manufacture, and supply of materials. Off-site construction, sorting, reuse, and recycling of materials are common measures for waste minimisation during the construction phase. Off-site construction, including prefabrication and precast, is a technique that enables building components to be manufactured offsite and transported to site for installation. These measures have been successful in reducing on-site waste (Lu and Yuan, 2013 ) and are still recommended. This is due to their ability to save labour costs, provide a rapid timeline, consistent quality and a material waste saving of about 52% (Jaillion et al., 2009 ). Reuse is described as “any operation by which products or components that are not waste are used again for the same purpose for which they were conceived ” (den Hollander et al., 2017 :518). This means that materials may be reused whether on the current or another project with or without subsequent processing. According to Ajayi (2017) , some materials cannot be reused, while others may have a limited number of re-uses, Moreno et al. (2015)  argued that reuse is still preferred over recycling. This is because reuse provides a great opportunity to divert materials from landfill and is energy efficient. Over time, the construction industry has considered sorting and recycling of materials as a potential waste minimisation strategy. Sorting and recycling are mutually inclusive. Sorting is the collection of materials that are recyclable while recycling is the process of producing new products from materials considered to be waste (US EPA, 2016 ). Sorting precedes recycling and helps to avoid co-mingling. Recycling is the last resort for construction materials which cannot be reused. It has some benefits, including the diversion of waste from landfill, the reduction of environmental pollution and resource extraction (US EPA, 2016 ). Amidst several major benefits, recycling has been condemned for high energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions (Saraiva et al., 2012 ). It lacks established markets because recycled products are rarely marketed (Yuan, 2013 ). Recycling is not considered as a comprehensive waste management solution, particularly for construction waste, because not all materials can be recycled (Ajayi, 2017 ; Oyedele et al., 2013 ). However, a holistic waste minimisation technique for construction waste needs to be developed to mitigate its harmful effects on the environment. From a legislative viewpoint, some laws, policies, and regulations have been enacted by governments around the world to discourage undue waste generation and to promote proactive waste minimisation. These include Extended Producer Responsibility, Pay-As-You-Throw, Site Waste Management Planning and Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme. 4.1 Sustainable construction Construction activities are important for the success of a project, but they can also have a major effect on the environment through pollution and resource depletion. The industry's response to minimise its environmental impacts include building sustainably by ensuring that all activities and operations are consistent with sustainability protocols. Guerin (2017)  argued that, for the construction industry to realise sustainable development, its activities need to be well coordinated from start to finish. It is therefore important to evaluate and proffer solutions to environmental challenges at the outset of a construction project (Ding, 2008 ). This will result in some environmental benefits not only for the project, but also for potential users. In addition, Guerin (2017)  noted that if the environment was considered, industry stands to benefits from reduced costs and delays. Abidin (2010)  observed that these strategies satisfy the demands of the industry to build a sustainable built environment. Therefore, Conte (2018 :2) revealed that sustainable construction emerged “as the means by which it is possible to create and responsibly manage a built environment able to ensure the healthiness of inhabitants and, at the same time, of natural environment, by saving its resources and controlling its pollution ”. It is evident from this definition that sustainable construction considers issues related to the three pillars of sustainable development–social, economic, and environmental. Although these issues may be a concern for construction professionals, they offer the industry great opportunities to achieve the sustainable development goals. One such opportunity is the need for construction professionals to adopt sustainable development principles throughout the lifecycle of a project (Shen et al., 2008 ; Matar et al., 2008 ). Ogunmakinde (2019b)  demonstrated the possible relationship between sustainability, sustainable construction, and sustainable development in Fig. 2  . Environmental sustainability is a proactive approach to conserving finite natural resources while also protecting ecosystems for future generations. Economic sustainability seeks equitable and efficient resource distribution to achieve long-term economic growth free of social and environmental problems. Social sustainability, on the other hand, ensures that humans' basic needs are met, and that social justice is served. It also helps to ensure equity and identifies the impacts of businesses on people and communities. It is clear from Fig. 2  that, while the aim of sustainable construction is to achieve sustainable development through social, economic, and environmental factors of sustainability, sustainable construction and sustainability are highly interdependent.  4.2 Principles of sustainable construction According to Kibert (2016 :10), the principles of sustainable construction are “reduce resource consumption; reuse resources; use recyclable resources; protect nature; eliminate toxics; apply life-cycle costing; and focus on quality”. These principles are consistent with the focus of sustainable construction (waste reduction, environmental conservation, and resource efficiency) to achieve sustainable development. They are also pivotal to a project's success because they can inform the decisions of the stakeholders. Sustainable construction principles, construction phases and the fundamental resources of a project (ecosystems, water, land, and materials) are closely interlinked (Kibert, 2016 ) and this relationship (Fig. 3  ) will achieve sustainability while at the same time mitigating challenges in the built environment. It is crucial for construction professionals and stakeholders to understand the principles of sustainable construction and their applicability, especially in the different phases of construction. This will help them to make appropriate and informed decisions that maximise project success (Abidin, 2010 ). However, the principles of sustainable construction, government structures, construction phases, clients’ requirements and stakeholders’ decisions need to be carefully considered in order to achieve sustainability.   5 The circular economy concept A simple overview of the linear economy helps to explain the concept of the circular economy. The linear economy is a system where raw materials are extracted and manufactured into products, which are disposed of at the end of their useful lives. This is what the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2013)  referred to as the “take-make-dispose” approach. This approach inevitably leads to environmental pollution, high volumes of waste, energy use and pressure on resources (Xinan and Yanfu, 2011 ). The linear economy does not promote reuse and recycle and, as such, is unsustainable. The CE is an alternative to the linear economy. According to Guohui and Yunfeng (2012) , the CE emphasises the regeneration of products rather than their disposal at the end of their lives. This guarantees the circularity of products, which implies that products are returned to the system. The CE relies on the principles of waste minimisation and environmental protection (Barón et al., 2020 ). Likewise, it decouples economic growth and development from the consumption of finite resources and creates value from environmental pollution (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015 a). Although perspectives of the CE vary, they revolve around similar issues. For instance, Yunyan and Biao (2014)  described resource reduction, high technological requirements and benefits for communities, organisations, and individuals as key features of the CE. Similarly, Li and Li (2008)  listed the source-economised economy (minimising new material use during production), the ecological economy (the ecological chain as a result of partnerships amongst industries) and the hi-tech economy (reduced use of virgin material and energy sources) as basic characteristics of the CE. Also, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015 a; 2013) summarized the five main characteristics of the CE as design out waste (optimizing both technical and biological parts for repair and reuse), build resilience via diversity (using potential solutions to ensure sustainability), depend on renewable energy, think in systems (linking parts to whole) and think in cascades (extracting added value from materials). These characteristics highlight the ability of the CE to benefit the environment, consumers, and producers. Consequently, drastic changes in the patterns of production and consumption are required for the timely integration of the CE. For example, Esposito et al. (2016)  noted that such changes would require producers to offer products as a service. Likewise, Bocken et al. (2014)  encouraged a shift from the linear economy business approach to CE-focused business models. Arcadis (2017)  referred to CE business models as building blocks because they have the potential to reduce material waste. This view is endorsed by Jones and Comfort (2018)  who foresaw business models rooted in maintenance and service rather than sales as precursors to the widespread adoption of the CE in the construction industry.• Product design     Approximately 80% of the carbon footprint of products is determined during the design process (European Commission. 2012 ). This implies that product design plays an important role in reducing environmental pollution and enhancing the material close loop. Arcadis (2017)  argued that design for disassembly, use of standard sizes, and modular components are ingredients of efficient production. These practices can be used to manufacture products that are sustainable, cost effective and durable (Bakker et al., 2014 ). However, the product design strategy is a critical factor determining the degree to which a product will be used, its efficiency and value (Ogunmakinde, 2019b ). Although a number of product design strategies have been studied and proposed in literature, their aim is to limit the types of materials while at the same time increasing their reuse capacity (Allwood et al., 2011 ). Van den Berg and Bakker (2015)  stressed the use of eco-design elements in conjunction with design for disassembly in the product design framework. When products are designed for disassembly, the benefits include waste elimination (Esposito et al., 2018 ) technical upgrades and durability (Geldermans and Rosen-Jacobsen, 2015 ). These are clear indicators that circularity in design and products is a fundamental requirement of the CE concept. Therefore, by integrating a circular design in the lifecycle of a product, material closed loops can be achieved (Geisendorf and Pietrulla, 2018 ). As suggested by Lieder and Rashid (2016) , designers should consider developing products with multiple phases of use, which will increase reuse and remanufacture.• Business Models     The linear economy principle of ‘sell more, sell faster’ (Bakker and Hollander, 2013 ) is not feasible at a time when sustainability is highly significant. On the other hand, the CE through viable business opportunities accelerates economic growth, drives performance, and enhances creativity and productivity (Gerholdt, 2015 ). This suggests that the perceived performance of the CE relies not just on the durability of products, but also on repair, reuse and remanufacture. Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010, p. 6)  described a business model as “the rationale of how an organisation creates, delivers and captures value ”. While business models relate to circular design, a shift in the socio-technical aspects of business (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ) will achieve total circularity. Consequently, there is a need for a fundamental shift in the perception of products by consumers and producers. Consumers should regard products as resources, while producers should perceive customers as users (Lacy et al., 2013 ). Basically, there are five common business models that are applicable to the CE. They are lifespan model, circular input model, product as service model, platform model and waste value model (Rabobank Industry, 2015 ; Accenture, 2015 ; Bakker and Hollander, 2013 ; Hieminga, 2015 ).1 Lifespan model: this business model adds value to products and improves their durability through repairs, improvements, and remanufacturers, making them economically viable (Gerholdt, 2015 ). Esposito et al. (2018)  referred to this model as a product life-extension system where utmost consideration is given to the longevity of products to prevent regular replacements. This suggests that product design is key factor for improving the performance and lifespan of products.  2 Circular input model: this business model creates materials that substitute finite resources with renewable ones (Gerholdt, 2015 ) while generating revenues through the resale of essential items (Bakker and Hollander, 2013 ). While design is essential to creating a circular input, designers need to incorporate waste minimisation strategies such as reuse and design for disassembly.  3 Product as service model: this model renders a product as a service in the form of a lease or performance agreement, thereby discouraging consumer ownership and promoting a high level of maintenance by service providers (Gerholdt, 2015 ; Ernst and Young Accountants, 2015 ). In this model, the emphasis is on service-based products where producers are liable for their products. Producers retain their products while consumers pay for them only when they need to. As a result, both producers and consumers benefit.  4 Platform model: this business model adopts a collaborative consumption technique (Lacy et al., 2013 ) where materials are shared to maximise the sustainable use and value of the products and services (Ernst and Young Accountants, 2015 ; Gerholdt, 2015 ). The model is based on a socio-economic principle that promotes resource sharing while building social interactions. Its benefits encompass economic (financial resilience), environmental (sustainable resources) and social (relationships and networks) opportunities (Crowther and Gilman, 2014 ).  5 Waste value model: this business model adopts technology to recover the added value of waste, either by recycling or upcycling, to optimise economic benefits (Ernst and Young Accountants, 2015 ; Lacy et al., 2013 ). Factors such as product design and resource efficiency should be considered to stimulate the conversion of waste to wealth and to improve energy efficiency.    These business models reflect approaches to closing resource loops through waste minimisation, sharing platforms or collaborative consumption, product life expansion and adoption of renewable energy sources.• Reverse networks     As the name implies, a reverse network is a method that enables consumers to return used products to their manufacturers. Manufacturers take responsibility for the collection and subsequent processing (such as reuse, recycle or upcycle) of products. Lewandowski (2016)  argued that by providing incentives for consumers, they could be encouraged to return products. Similarly, Arcadis (2017)  noted that a return acceptance obligation could assist manufacturers to recover their products. The return and earn scheme, which is becoming more popular around the world, is a typical example of the reverse network.• Enabling Conditions     Arcadis (2017)  has established some enabling conditions for a smooth transition to the CE. These conditions apply explicitly to manufacturers and governments. They include creating customer awareness and education about reuse and recycling potentials, eco clustering of businesses (i.e., business working together to reduce their environmental impacts), provision of infrastructure (e.g., recycling facilities), legislation (including laws and regulations), provision of financial capabilities, and enhancement risk management.  6 Relationship between the CE, construction waste minimisation and SDGs The CE as a sustainable concept has a vested interest in the actualisation of the SDGs. Hence, the CE is placed at the heart of sustainable development. A variety of studies have shown the importance of the CE and how it contributes to sustainable development. For example, the CE is considered to be a novel framework of sustainable development (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ) as well as a useful model for sustainable development (Sauvé et al., 2016 ). While the CE encourages the implementation of sustainable development, it has been recognised as being one of the strategies for achieving sustainable development (Kirchherr et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, sustainable development is considered as the main aim of the CE (European Environment Agency, 2016 ; Ghisellini et al., 2016 ). The CE as an economic model offers a holistic sustainable development paradigm that can achieve the triple bottom line of sustainability (Fig. 4  ). In terms of environmental impacts, the CE has the potential to reduce glasshouse gas emissions by diverting construction materials from landfill. Similarly, carbon dioxide emissions from construction materials and activities can be reduced through resource/material efficiency and reuse. Economically, a shift to the CE would benefit the construction industry by increasing resource productivity. Reusing materials could lower construction costs, while recycling would close the material loop. The adoption of the CE in the construction industry would create jobs, particularly in the manufacturing and recycling sectors. These benefits of CE are visible in some countries where they have been adopted. In China, the CE was adopted as a framework for energy and material efficiency (Ogunmakinde, 2019a ; Su et al., 2013 ), environmental change and economic growth (Ogunmakinde 2019a ; Murray et al., 2017 ). It was implemented in Germany to reduce waste disposal land and increase reuse and waste recovery. The goal of implementing the CE concept in Japan was to improve energy efficiency. The overarching aim of the CE in these countries was to achieve sustainable development. According to Qian and Wang (2016) , the CE has also been acknowledged by some developed countries, especially in Europe as a possible route to sustainable development. The interaction between CE and sustainable development demonstrates that the latter integrates environmental and economic elements of sustainability into the former whilst achieving the social component via individual and organisational social obligations (CIRAIG, 2015 ). It is clear that the CE has the potential to achieve sustainable development, but its environmental, economic, and social capabilities need to be clearly defined in order to avoid it being over-hyped.• Environmental Impacts of the CE     The CE has been adopted by governments, industries, and business for its environmental protection capacity. For instance, governments in countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Scotland, Sweden, Japan, and Germany have legislated the CE concept in a bid to achieve sustainable development. Companies such as Phillips, IKEA, and Schneider Electric have incorporated circular economy design into their products. This not only raises their profile as environmentally friendly nations or companies, but it also helps them to contribute meaningfully to achieving the SDGs. The CE's positive impacts, especially on environmental issues, are regarded as novel solutions (Persson, 2015 ). Since the environment is one of the main considerations of the SDGs, the CE demonstrates the ability to minimise the adverse environmental effects of industrialization. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015 b) predicts a 32% and 53% decline in finite material use by industries in 2030 and 2050, respectively. In addition, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015 b) also noted that by 2035, the carbon footprint of a nation (Denmark as a case study) could be reduced by up to 7% and raw material consumption down by 5% - 50%. Likewise, Korhonen et al. (2018)  revealed that the CE can mitigate the free flow of finite materials through the use of renewable sources. As a result, emissions and waste materials will be reduced. More importantly, Geng et al. (2012)  highlighted some of the attributes that render CE a potential fit for achieving the SDGs. These include “conservation of natural resources (especially non-renewable resources such as water, fossil, fuels and minerals), reduced environmental impacts through efficient energy and material and less water discharge, avoidance of toxic materials, extended life cycle of landfill sites, and recovery of local ecosystems ” (Geng et al., 2012 :221). Evidence suggests that, as the CE is implemented in the construction industry, the potential beneficial outcomes are the elimination of waste and reduced costs (Minunno et al., 2018 ). Therefore, the adoption of the CE in the construction industry can also serve as a springboard for the industry to mitigate its environmental impacts and contribute to the SDGs.• Economic Impacts of the CE     The CE's economic contributions have generated several projections in literature. The CE is expected to generate economic growth, including massive jobs and contribution to the GDP of countries. For instance, Korhonen et al. (2018 :41) observed that the CE aims to “reduce the economic production-consumption system's raw material and energy costs, waste management and emissions control costs, risks from (environmental) legislation/taxation and public image as well as to innovate new product designs and market opportunities for businesses ”. Similarly, Geng et al. (2012)  and Moreno et al. (2015)  linked resource efficiency, material cost savings and revenue growth from waste sales to the CE. Other economic advantages of the CE are the development of business models (Antikainen and Valkokari, 2016 ) and substantial cost benefits for businesses (Benton et al., 2014 ). In terms of job creation and GDP growth, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015 a) argued that when resource efficiency is increased by 30%, the CE will raise GDP by 1%, generating about two million jobs worldwide by 2030. With steady development, over 0.2 million new jobs can be created yearly by the CE from 2030 onwards (Rizos et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, GDP growth is possible as jobs are created as a result of the elimination of carbon emissions (Wijkman and Skånberg, 2015 ). Companies and organisations adopting the CE in their processes would also benefit from the economic opportunities. Such businesses could save up to USD630 billion in costs of material by 2025 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015 a). Likewise, profits from companies that recover and remanufacture materials could grow by around 50% while material waste could be decreased by 90% (Esposito et al., 2018 ). According to CIRAIG (2015) , the manufacturing sector alone could generate about €600 billion annually when CE principles are adopted in its processes. It is also expected that converting waste into energy would exceed USD4.5 trillion by 2030 (Lacy and Rutqvist, 2016 ). Apart from the advantages for companies, countries are also projected to benefit from the economic gains of adopting the CE. Over 0.05million jobs and €12 billion were predicted in the UK waste treatment, recycling, and deconstruction sectors alone (ESA, 2013). Approximately 0.054million jobs were estimated for the electrical, biotic and base metal waste management sectors in the Netherlands (Bastein et al., 2013 ). In Denmark, economic value was projected at between 3–6%, 0.8–1.4% GDP growth and 13,000–17,000 jobs across industries such as real estate and construction, food and beverages, machinery, hospitals, and plastic packaging (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015 ). According to Finland's Independence Celebration Fund (FICF) and Mckinsey (2014) , the adoption of the CE in Finland is capable of generating €2.5 billion in economic gain. It is evident from the foregoing that the transition to the CE in the construction sector should bring economic benefits, including significant job creation (recycling and remanufacturing of materials), cost savings (use of renewable energy and reuse of materials), new business models (product as a service) and an increased contribution to GDP. With these and many more benefits, CIRAIG (2015)  revealed that the CE is regarded an economic solution to achieve sustainable development.• Social Impacts of the CE     The social impacts of the CE have generated a series of debates in the literature. Some authors have claimed that the CE has ignored equity (Moreau et al., 2017 ; Sauvé et al., 2016 ) while others have argued for the CE, particularly for its ability to enhance conservation of resources that are beneficial to both humans and the environment (Murray et al., 2017 ). The CE is not only an environmental or economic model, but also a social tool. It has the ability to address existing and emerging social needs. The CE is socially constructed as a result of what was called the sharing economy (Pomponi and Moncaster, 2017 ), which allows members of a society to share their resources. This creates a platform for community members to interact with each other. Some of the social impacts of the CE have been widely studied. Korhonen et al. (2018)  noted that a reduction of emissions and efficiency of resources can be achieved through the sharing economy. More so, the CE is capable of creating avenues for mutual trust and partnership to develop amongst clients, manufacturers, and stakeholders (Persson, 2015 ). This type of relationship is also possible between communities and industries (Geng et al., 2012 ) and can create resource sharing and reuse networks (Faraud, 2016 ). Aside from social interactions, the CE can also enhance national defence through the renewable supply of energy (Su et al., 2013 ). Other social impacts include the capacity to boost community wellbeing (Ness, 2008 ), resolve economic disparities and foster social equality (Zhijun and Nailing, 2007 ), all of which are part of the SDGs. Unethical practices common to the linear economy should be eradicated with the adoption of CE business models because of the need to guarantee that products are designed to last or delivered as a service (Andrews, 2015 ). It is important to note that the social impacts of the CE can lead to organisational and individual behavioural changes required to achieve sustainable development. 6.1 Opportunities for circularity in the construction industry The processes and activities of the construction industry are amongst the key contributors to waste and pollution. The CE provides the industry with an opportunity to mitigate these issues and to achieve sustainable development (Fig. 4 ). It is a mechanism that ensures materials are used effectively, waste is minimised, carbon emissions are reduced, and products are durable (Stahel, 2016 ). With these benefits, the construction industry is regarded to be the sector with the “highest potential” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015 b:111) for the adoption of the CE. As regards the minimisation of construction waste, Liu et al. (2017)  recognised the CE as the best approach because it helps with the reuse of products. More so, the CE principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle can be adopted to minimise waste (Nuñez-Cacho et al., 2018 ; Huang et al., 2018 ). Reuse means that materials deemed to be waste or no longer needed may be used again. In this approach, waste is considered a resource, thereby reducing the need to buy new materials. Consequently, production processes and the energy used in production are reduced (Uygunoğlu et al., 2014 ). Recycling, on the other hand, involves the mechanical conversion of a material or its parts into a new product. Although the recycling process consumes energy, it is still considered as a potential strategy for minimising construction waste. van Sante (2017)  argued, however, that it should only be considered if reuse was not an option. This suggests that recycling lacks the quality to be the priority of the CE, and that reuse is preferable. Construction professionals need to optimize material reuse during the design and procurement phases in order to minimise waste effectively. The way in which design is performed requires some changes to incorporate the requirements of the CE. Transitioning to the CE in the construction industry will require the design of appropriate schemes for the repair and restoration of products (Murray et al., 2017 ). For ease of product maintenance, repair, upgrade, refurbishment, recycling and remanufacturing, Arup and Bam (2017)  recommended that a circular design approach should be adopted at the design phase. This implies that design is an important factor to be considered in the adoption of the CE in the construction industry. Design and the attitudes of professionals to waste minimisation need a thorough overhaul, which is achievable through policies. According to Bourguignon (2016) , the CE policy of the European Commission has been successful in reducing waste in the construction sector. It is also likely that policies would lead to change in behaviour resulting in effective waste minimisation.  6.2 Practical approaches to the CE in the construction industry With respect to the CE, its key functions are to reduce waste and improve the efficiency of resources. The former is a CE attribute that can be used to eliminate construction waste, while the latter reduces the environmental footprint of the industry, which is a way of achieving the SDGs. This is an indication that the CE, construction waste minimisation and SDGs are interrelated. Having previously highlighted the potential impacts (environmental, economic, and social) of the CE on construction waste minimisation and sustainable development, this section describes the connection between the CE, construction waste minimisation and the SDGs. To explain this relationship, it is necessary to clarify the factors that have influenced it. A framework describing the relationship (Fig. 4 ) has therefore been established. This framework is a product of extant literature and is described below: 6.2.1 Design approaches Design is central to minimising construction waste. It has the capacity to greatly improve the reuse of materials and increase the lifespan of buildings, particularly when flexible spaces and versatile features are integrated into the design (Allwood, 2016 ). Design aimed at implementing the CE is a circular design, which requires some improvements to current styles (Sanchez and Haas, 2018a ). With respect to circular design, specifications, materials, and designs need to focus on diverting waste from landfills rather than on aesthetics. This means that design approaches for building materials are required to incorporate reuse and recycling components (Andrews, 2015 ). Likewise, buildings should be designed to be deconstructed rather than to be demolished. According to Rizos et al. (2017) , by adhering to construction standards and specifying durable materials, buildings can be designed to last longer. This would prevent continual requests for maintenance and waste generation. However, designers need to pay special attention to design methods, procurement approaches and specifications, including material selection, use of modular parts and materials with reuse options (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). Esposito et al. (2018) , RSA (2013)  and Bakker and Hollander (2013)  have established design approaches with a great propensity to improve circularity in the industry by extending product life and minimising waste. These include design for off-site construction, design for material optimization, design for waste-efficient procurement, design for flexibility and deconstruction, design for reuse and recovery, design for product attachment and trust, design for product durability, design for ease of maintenance, design for standardisation and compatibility, design for upgradability and adaptability, and design for disassembly and reassembly. Technology develops apace and future CE applications will benefit from Big Data Analytics, Internet of Things, and BIM.  6.2.2 Reuse and recycling approaches The adoption of reuse and recycling approaches in the management of construction waste is no longer new. These approaches are part of the CE principles and are crucial for its implementation in the construction industry to achieve the SDGs. A number of studies have shown that reuse and recycling are effective in reducing construction waste and energy. For instance, Ng and Chau (2015)  reported that reuse and recycling might save up to 6.22% and 54% embodied energy, respectively. The majority of construction materials can be reused and recycled. Reuse is preferred for some materials rather than recycling, and vice versa. For windows and doors, Ng and Chau (2015)  revealed that reuse is preferred, while both reuse and recycling are good choices for wall and roof structures. Recycling is ideal for concrete and steel (Yellishetty et al., 2011 ) and a whole building can be reused (Al-Obaidi et al., 2017 ). From an environmental point of view, reuse is crucial in reducing waste, while recycling helps to minimise emissions despite its low energy efficiency. From an economic perspective, salvaged materials are of premium value in terms of costs compared to new materials (Diyamandoglu and Fortuna, 2015 ). On the basis of this understanding, it is important to state that reuse is key to material circularity and reducing the volume of waste deposited in landfills. Recycling, on the other hand, may be considered as an option when reuse is not possible.  6.2.3 Construction methods The role of construction methods in waste minimisation and achieving the SDGs cannot be overemphasised. Owing to the high volume of waste generation from construction activities, the industry needs to adopt methods that are capable of optimizing materials and enhancing resource efficiency. Lean construction and prefabrication are possible methods that can be used to achieve material circularity. Lean construction is a strategy based on value to the client while reducing waste. According to Sacks et al. (2010)  the implementation of lean construction through building information modelling (BIM) has shown efficiencies in waste elimination. This implies that lean construction as a stand-alone method or in conjunction with BIM can predict and eliminate waste. BIM provides detailed information, including the type, quantity, location, and size of building components, as well as their relationship with the building structure. The tracking of building elements throughout the supply chain is possible with BIM (Wu et al., 2017 ), which makes it possible to reduce waste. Green supply chain management is another construction method that can be adopted. It considers the economic and environmental impacts of materials prior to procurement in order to reduce emissions (Ying and Li-jun, 2012 ). Prefabrication of construction elements is not a new concept. It involves the production of building components on or offsite, which are then assembled to form a whole. Prefabrication is vital to minimising waste because it allows for an appropriate inventory of materials (Minunno et al., 2018 ), flexibility of the structural system (Sanchez and Haas, 2018b ) and ease of deconstruction. For example, the 2012 London Olympic Park was deconstructed after the games. These approaches can increase material circularity, minimise waste and enhance resource productivity. Construction professionals can utilise a wide variety of technologies, including BIM and Integrated Digital Delivery, to enhance circularity of materials. However, there is need for hands-on training for construction professionals on how to adapt these measures to their processes. The CE business models, including the sharing platform, building products to last, recovery and recycling, circular supply chain and product-as-a-service are relevant in the construction industry. Furthermore, the sharing platform, take-back scheme and product-as-a-service models provide an excellent opportunity for the industry to achieve the social aspect of sustainable development and eventually some SDGs such as reduced inequality and responsible consumption and production. A practical approach to the take-back scheme in the construction industry was identified in Salvo (a business trading in Europe) (Jones and Comfort, 2018 ). An example of the sharing platform in construction is through open building plans, where spaces can be shared and converted to suit diverse needs (Zuidema, 2015 ). The PaaS model encompasses the renting and leasing of replaceable parts of a structure. These parts include lightbulbs, kitchen pods, doors and windows which can be provided as a service or on lease to clients over a period of time. The economic implications of these business models are cost savings for the industry and clients. Furthermore, ARUP (2016)  encouraged the reuse and repurposing of buildings. This should boost the production of durable materials.  6.2.4 Waste and energy measurement tools Some measuring tools have been developed to determine the amount of waste produced and energy usage resulting from construction activities. The Life-cycle assessment is one such tool. It is often used to assess and enhance the implementation of CE in the construction industry by means of a cradle-to-cradle concept (P. Ghisellini et al., 2018 ). Another tool is the material flow analysis, which measures “net additions to stocks ” for effective management of building stock (OECD, 2008 :11). The Internet of Things (IOT) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems are digital tools that can also be used. IOT is able to measure the efficiency of appliances in buildings (ARUP, 2016 ). RFID may also be incorporated into prefabricated parts to allow forward and reverse logistics chains (Minunno et al., 2018 ).  6.2.5 Policies Policies are a set of principles which guide decisions in order to achieve desired outcomes. The purpose of policies is to influence decision-making whether it is convenient or not. Policies may be required for compliance purposes, especially when a new concept or idea is introduced. However, some policies are required in the case of construction waste minimisation. There are several waste minimisation policies that relate to the construction industry. For instance, Ogunmakinde (2019b)  identified two categories of policies (recommended and required) that are necessary for effective waste minimisation. ‘Recommended policies’ include extended producer responsibility, construction waste disposal charging schemes, stepwise incentive schemes and site waste management planning, while ‘required policies’ are landfill bans and pay as you throw. These policies discourage waste generation and, where it is difficult, encourage producers to take full responsibility for its management, including disposal. However, governments need to intervene to enforce these policies to ensure that waste is minimised and that raw materials are sustainably sourced.    7 Conclusions The purpose of this study is to establish relationships between the CE, construction waste minimisation and the SDGs. The CE concept has been discussed as a sustainable model capable of reducing waste and optimising resources. The study also explores the concepts of sustainability, sustainable development, and sustainable construction, and how they relate to each other. Construction activities with integrated sustainable construction principles minimise waste and emissions. The CE is a sustainable model as identified by its environmental, economic, and social impacts. It has an important role to play in closing material loops through waste minimisation approaches. The construction waste minimisation approaches described in this study include design, reuse and recycling, construction methods, business models, waste and energy measurement tools and policies. Although all of these measures would reduce waste, their integration in construction projects could achieve the overall aim of sustainable construction and sustainable development. The adoption of the CE as an overarching approach to waste minimisation could lead to the actualisation of the SDGs. Through its environmental impacts, the CE can reduce pollution, while its adoption and implementation can create jobs and economic growth, particularly in terms of GDP growth. Furthermore, the CE as a sharing economy, can create social interactions between clients and producers through its sharing platform, the PaaS model, and the take back systems. Overall, the CE has the potential to make a major contribution to the environment and human development. Therefore, it is recommended that it is integrated in all phases of construction, including the pre-construction and post occupancy stages. In addition, all stakeholders who generate waste should apply new innovative technologies, methods and strategies leading to transdisciplinary and transformative change. With the implementation of the CE, all professionals should be trained to recognise and appreciate the potential for circularity in the construction industry. This study has shown that the industry has opportunities to realise the SDGs by adopting CE, construction waste minimisation and sustainable construction principles, which is the goal of sustainable development. It is important to note that, while the adoption of the CE in the construction industry may require some changes in design, procurement and construction approaches as well as business models, government policies are needed to enforce waste minimisation and resource efficiency. The novel contribution of this study is that it presents a relationship framework which links the CE, construction waste minimisation and SDGs together. Whilst this study is based solely on extant literature, the findings are relevant for academic, construction professionals, and policy makers. Its key contribution is the development of a framework that directs future sustainable development research, policies, and innovations. Future studies can adopt quantitative and/or qualitative survey techniques to measure variables. The relationship framework can also be further developed into a conceptual framework on the basis of future findings.
