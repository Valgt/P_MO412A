                  Built environment plays a series of key roles in the society and in everyday life and it is also worldwide recognised to be one of the main contributors to the global energy demand and to the emission of greenhouse gases. Achieving sustainability in the building and construction industry is, therefore, crucial to contribute the global transition to a sustainable carbon-neutral built environment: in this regard, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the related SDGs would play a strategic role.
                  This paper was set and developed with the aim of identifying the multiple key interactions between buildings and SDGs and, consequently, drawing considerations and points-of-view on a possible, preliminary approach to assess the role of buildings in the achievement of SDGs and their targets.
                  A quantitative evaluation approach focussed on the environmental dimension of sustainability and based on Life Cycle Assessment on the building scale was proposed by the authors. The approach could represent the potential basis for the development of a comprehensive and scientifically-based method for large-scale applications aimed at determining and improving the way buildings affect SDGs. According to this paper's authors' proposal, after the selection of a comprehensive set of indicators and their linkage to the various SDGs, the assessment should be carried out considering reference values for the indicators, specific targets coherent with SDGs (and their targets) for each indicator and key statistical parameters for the built environment, such as the yearly built area.

It represents the ensemble of human-made surroundings that provide settings for human activities and encompass spaces and places like buildings, open spaces, and hard and soft infrastructures (Roof and Oleru, 2008 ). These infrastructures include: power grid; transports; waterways; waste management systems; gas networks; and societal management services (Sarwat et al., 2018 ). So, it is understood that the built environment actually plays a series of prominent roles in the society and can be considered as the result of lots of socioeconomic factors and processes, that are known to cover a huge centrality in the global process of pursuing sustainable development (Forsberg and von Malmborg, 2004 ; Corrente et al., 2023 ). The latter is aimed at enhancing the quality of life, through allowing people to live in healthy environments and to improve socioeconomic and environmental conditions for present and future generations (Ortiz et al., 2009 ; Ioppolo et al., 2019 ). Despite the many beneficial aspects, creating and managing contemporary built environments implies usage of large amounts of material and energy commodities, and leads to generating waste as well as the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) and other gaseous pollutants. Such environmental aspects result in negative environmental impacts to the stock of the natural and primary-energy resources, to the health of humans, and to the quality of the natural ecosystem (Forsberg and von Malmborg, 2004 ; Ioppolo et al., 2019 ). Buildings is acknowledged to be the largest contributor to those impacts (Ingrao et al., 2018 ; Scrucca et al., 2020 ), as it is responsible for:- 36% of the global energy consumption and 37% of the global energy-related CO2  emissions (UNEP, 2021 );  - 12% of the global freshwater withdrawals,  - 30% of the global consumption of raw materials and also for the generation of nearly 20% of water effluents and 45–65% of landfill waste globally (Goubran, 2019 ; Omer Mohamed and Noguchi, 2020 ).    Overtime, the building industry has become one of the main contributors to the global economy and global employment market, mainly due to the urbanisation phenomenon that has led the global urban-population proportion increasing from 30% to 56% over the past seventy years (Madanian et al., 2018 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Corrente et al., 2023 ). The consequence of this is significant challenges being posed to the climate change, the health and well-being of human beings, and to the quality of the entire ecosystem, both on the local and on the global scale (Omer Mohamed and Noguchi, 2020 ). Those challenges will tend to increase, considering the alarming prediction that, by 2050, 66% of the world population will move to live in cities (Madanian et al., 2018 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Corrente et al., 2023 ). Such will lead urban areas to increasingly expand, with the risk that life will be more complex inside them, also considering the enhanced needs of citizens for energy, food, and other commodities (Corrente et al., 2023 ). Hence, there is the urgent need for a building design that could support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), based upon a series of links, that take into account the multiple central roles that buildings themselves play in terms of economic growth, social progress and environmental protection (Sev, 2009 ; Omer Mohamed and Noguchi, 2020 ). This puts emphasis upon the relevance of specific building phases or subsectors, as well as of specific building performance or building materials, to achieve SDGs (Maalouf et al., 2018 ). Here comes the green building movement, in recognition of positive and negative impacts caused by buildings to people and the environment, and of the urgent need to mitigate negative impacts, whilst enhancing those features that provide, instead, positive benefits (Allen et al., 2015 ). Sustainable buildings, often called as “green buildings”, are known as resulting from the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient, throughout the building's life cycle. According to Allen et al. (2015) , green buildings focus, in fact, on:- minimising environmental impacts, through reduced energy and water consumption;  - minimising environmental disturbances from the building site; and  - improving human health through design of healthy indoor environments.    In this context, the assessment and improvement of a building's sustainability performance is generally carried out by means of tools that use quantifiable scientifically-based indicators for different sustainability criteria (Awadh, 2017 ), and are known as Green Building Rating Tools (GRBTs). Ali and Al Nsairat (2009)  documented them to be valid for assessing, rating, and promoting green buildings that meet the requirements of a multi-dimension sustainable development. They include existing tools like LEED, BREEAM, Green Star, CASBEE, with all of them being characterised by a scheme providing an internationally-recognised scientifically-based rating system of multiple energy-environmental indicators. GRBTs were documented by Wen et al. (2020)  to be relevant for the assessment of the relationships between buildings and SDGs, and so to show how effective green buildings are for their achievement. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that relevant international organisations, such as for instance the World Green Building Council (WGBC, 2022 ) and the UNEP (UNEP, 2022 ), explored the multiple ways green buildings intersect with the 17 goals, highlighting contributions in varying degrees and bringing out some different views. The SDGs are now recognised to be a reference point for the global process of policy-making (Kørnøv et al., 2020 ). Adotpting them represents a change in the way of thinking about domestic and international development, as well as about economics, environment, and society, and a transformation of those towards sustainability (Kørnøv et al., 2020 ). The SDGs span global challenges such as poverty, health, climate change, injustice and equality and, so, should be seen as a holistic and indivisible entity (Johnsson et al., 2020 ). Under this perspective, it is understood why they have links that generate synergies and trade-offs, with all productive sectors and human activities: those were explored with resource and business management (e.g., Bansal et al. (2022) , and Lee and Zhou, 2022 ), energy (e.g., Niet et al. (2021) , Fuso Nerini et al. (2018) , and Santika et al. (2019) ), and agriculture and food production (e.g., Filho et al. (2022)  and Ladha et al. (2020) ), and in many others (Anderson et al., 2022 ). The link between buildings and SDGs seems, however, to have not been clearly defined and thoroughly investigated yet and, to the authors' knowledge, the interaction of the different building activities with the SDGs and their targets represents an emerging research direction. The specialised literature reported of several attempts that were made by scholars worldwide to establish that link and evaluate the contribution of buildings to SDGs. The majority of those attempts were limited, however, just to one or two of SDGs, and were based upon only qualitative analyses, most of the times conducted with the aim of exploring only part of the buildings-SDGs relationship. This paper's authors are well aware, though, that that relationship is very complex and difficult to be measured through quantitative indicators and, under this perspective, they conceived this paper as follows. In Section 2 , the authors started with performing a synthetic review of the specialised literature to present a snapshot of what has been done and found thus far on the relationship between buildings and SDGs. The review process led the authors to identify a reasonable series of positive and negative correlations between sustainable buildings and SDGs. Then, in Section 3 , the authors used the findings from the combined work of literature review and buildings-SDGs relationship analysis to draw considerations and points-of-view on the current and likely-future directions towards integrated holistic assessments of the relationship at issue. As the key part of this process, the authors suggested a possible way to quantitatively estimate and monitor the achievement of environmental sustainability in the framework of the 2030 SDG Agenda. According to this paper's authors, such an approach represents the novelty aspect of their work since, to the best of their knowledge, it had never been conceived and proposed before. Finally, in the conclusions section, the authors highlighted the potential implications/future developments of their proposed approach.  2 Analysis of the relationship between SDGs, sustainable buildings and building sustainability assessment tools The way in which sustainable buildings and GRBTs can contribute to achieving SDGs was found in the literature by this team of authors to be discussed both in qualitative and in quali-quantitave terms. So, the authors carried out a review of the literature currently available on the subject with the main aim of learning which SDGs buildings was determined to be interacting with in previous papers. Consistently with such an aim, the review was conceived to provide a literature synthesis that could form the basis for the authors to build upon the linkages currently documented between SDGs and buildings, and so draw their viewpoints on the subject. A Literature Synthesis (LS) was defined by Aivazidou et al. (2016)  as summarising and connecting the findings from multiple sources to provide valuable qualitative results, like existing gaps, overlaps and future research opportunities. It was used by recently-published studies like Corrente et al. (2023)  with the same contextualisation and backgrounding purposes, though on a different research subject. So, it is understood that, already in the aim and scope, a LS clearly differentiates from a systematic literature review (SLR). According to Do et al. (2021) , a SLR is based, in fact, upon an explicit, rigorous, and reproducible design to identify, assess and interpret the existing large body of completed and recorded work from researchers, scholars and practitioners. Under this perspective, consistently with the overall aim of this manuscript, the intention of the authors was to conduct not a SLR being worth a stand-alone article but a review that, though being synthetic, could be effective in determining similarities and differences among studies exploring the current interactions between buildings and SDGs. As already stated above, the authors used the review findings to draw their personal considerations and points-of-view on a possible, preliminary approach to assess in a quali-quantitative manner the buildings-SDGs link. For review development, the authors selected “buildings”, “sustainable development goals” and “life cycle assessment” as the three research-representative keywords that were combined by the authors to locate scientific contributions on the subject. Those were searched within titles, abstracts and key-words of articles. To achieve a high scientific impact for this review development, the bibliographical search was extended to Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), considering the fact that the literature recognises them to be the most comprehensive databases of peer-reviewed journals (Do et al., 2021 ; Zingale et al., 2022 ). The review was limited to documents written in English, considering just original-research and review articles: the latter were found by this team of authors as representing, together, a total of 60–65% of all the indexed document types available on the sustainable-buildings subject. This means that all other types of documents, including books, book chapters, along with conference proceedings, were excluded from the review, due to the renowned difficulty of extrapolating them from the literature (Zingale et al., 2022 ). Ten papers, published in the period 2015–2020, were selected by the authors based upon their content, with the aim of creating a review sample that were consistent with the aim and scope of this study, and so relevant for this review. Those were reviewed here in terms of their key objectives and findings, trying to create a reasonable logical thread by best linking them to each other. From the review, it was found that, according to Gellers (2015) , there are ways in which the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits and prerequisites can favour the achievement of the SDGs n. 3, 6, 7, 11, and 15. In particular, the various LEED categories feature several specific credits and prerequisites that are geared towards improving building performances directly related to the SDGs, mainly by: reducing exposure to hazardous chemicals and air pollution; reducing water consumption and increasing water efficiency; and reducing energy consumption and the environmental and economic issues associated with fossil fuels. Several years later, Miyazaki et al. (2019)  investigated the correlation of SDGs with another evaluating and rating method, i.e. the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE), founding an indirect contribution of many assessment items to SDG 11 and SDG 12. Similarly, Tsim et al. (2019)  analysed the connection with the Assessment Standard for Green Buildings (ASGB), showing that the ASGB can significantly contribute to SDGs 6, 7, 11, and 12. Alawneh et al. (2019)  developed a new framework linking the SDGs to the Jordanian GBRT and found that the considered assessment indicators contributed significantly to SDGs 3, 6–9, 11–13, 15. Potable water consumption was the largest contributor in that regard, because of the Jordan conditions of water scarcity and the significant role that water plays in achieving the UN SDGs. Moreover, Alawneh et al. (2018)  focussed their study on the use of water and energy, analysing the relationship between SDGs and the water- and energy-efficiency indicators provided by the LEED system using a quantitative descriptive methodology. In their study, the authors proposed a new specific index to assess the contributions of the implementation of LEED v2.2 prerequisites and credits in both “water efficiency” and “energy and atmosphere”, showing a positive relationship between these categories and the UN SDGs 6–9, 12, 13, and 15. In particular, their evidences linked the water efficiency indicators to the SDGs 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 15, whilst the SDGs 7, 8, 9, 12, and 13 were found to be more closely related to the energy efficiency indicators. From their study, the authors came to the conclusion that the proposed index can be a reliable and robust tool to evaluate the contribution to achieve the UN SDGs of water and energy efficiency in LEED v2.2-certified green buildings. Wen et al. (2020)  studied in detail how green buildings can support the achievement of the SDGs, proposing a realistic mapping tool using GRBT as the mean for assessing the contribution. They developed a model for identifying and quantifying green buildings contribution to the SDGs and validated it in a real case study (i.e. a certified building), referring to the LEED for non-residential new construction 2009 version. In this model, a common framework of GRBT was established and a qualitative relationship between indicators on different SDG Targets was defined, identifying those strongly, moderately and weakly related. Then, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was selected to convert the qualitative relationships into quantitative information. The findings of Wen et al. (2020)  showed that the contribution of GBRT to the goals are significantly different. In particular, SDGs 3, 7, 11 and 12, emerged as the ones significantly supported by the GBRT, with SDG 12 being the main beneficiary, whilst the contribution of GBRT to SDGs 9, 13 and 15 was relatively small. Moreover, the specific SDG Target on energy efficiency (7.3) came out as the largest intermediate pathway in the GBRT's contribution to the SDG. They also developed a visual identification system, which provided relevant information, such as the GBRTs' contribution to the SDGs, the extent of achievement by the GB, and the ranking of the SDGs-derived benefits. It also made more intuitive to understand the GB's contribution to the SDGs, suggesting that publicizing this important information could help to raise public awareness on sustainable development and to promote people's support for green buildings. Regarding the significance of buildings life cycle on SDGs, a direct relationship between the design phase and SDGs has been highlighted by Goubran and Cucuzzella (2019) , which found the early stages of building design directly impacting on SDGs 6, 7, 9, and 17 and also indirectly impacting on SDGs 4, 8, 11, and 15. They proposed two analytical tools to be applied during the building design process with the aim of tracking the integration of SDGs in the building projects and analysing the building design approaches and visions in reference to the topics of the goals. Similarly, using a specifically developed scoring system, Omer Mohamed and Noguchi (2020)  showed that building materials can significantly contribute to achieving 13 goals and 25 targets of SDGs, with direct positive contribution to the SDGs 3, 7, 9, 11–13, and 15, and invisible contribution on SDGs 2, 5, 10 and 16. Opoku (2018) , instead, studied the impact and the role of the sustainable built environment on biodiversity conservation, that is central to the realisation of SDG n. 15, adopting a qualitative research methodology. In line with previously published literature, the use of building materials in an efficient and responsible way was identified as a main issue for the built environment to significantly contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and the realisation of SDGs. Di Foggia (2018)  studied the relationship between energy efficiency in buildings and SDGs, highlighting the contribution of energy performing buildings to meeting SDG 11 and 13 and indicating that the implementation of effective measures and strategies oriented to energy efficiency maximisation can reduce the cost of the building, support the main goals of the current energy and climate policies, and boost global environmental well-being. Findings from the review conducted were summarised in Table 1  , associating each reviewed paper with the type and object of the analysis it presented and the SDGs which buildings was found to be relating to. The analysis of the existing literature was expanded to LCA, which is an objective assessment method that finds several applications in buildings to contribute to their quality, energy efficiency and sustainability (Ingrao et al., 2018 ). Over the years, LCA was applied in many different areas of buildings (from the level of materials and components to the whole building dimension), and with different methodological approaches, including those providing the use of time-dependent inventories (e.g., dynamic LCA) (Anand and Amor, 2017 ; Ingrao et al., 2018 ; Asdrubali et al., 2020 ). Direct qualitative and quantitative relationship between LCA of buildings and SDGs have not yet been explored, but the need for combining life cycle evaluation (in particular, Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment) and SDGs is clear and is considered particularly relevant for sectors that are as resource-, energy-, and emission-intensive as construction is (Backes and Traverso, 2022a, 2022b ). Moreover, it seems that the use of LCA to carry out evaluations in different phases of the building life cycle can effectively support the achievement of different goals and/or specific targets of the SDGs. Doing so could make it possible to find solutions for improvement of the building's energy efficiency and environmental performance, thereby contributing to transitioning to equitable, sustainable, post fossil‑carbon societies. Overall, from the review the authors found the SDGs n. 2–9, 11–13, and 15–16 to be mostly interacting, both directly and indirectly, with buildings on several of the environmental and socioeconomic dimensions of sustainable development, including: people health and well-being; water consumption and efficiency; renewable energy; job creation; climate-change resilient infrastructures; sustainable communities and cities; societal decarbonisation through GHG-emission mitigation; biodiversity improvement; and partnership creation. The authors believe that each of the reviewed studies represent a concrete step forward in such a research content area, but the majority of those studies only used qualitative or quali-quantitative analyses to understand the existing links and evaluate the multiple contributions of buildings to SDGs. This paper's authors are aware, though, that the relationship is very complex and difficult to be clearly established and quantified, and also that SDGs (and their targets) are both positively and negatively influenced by buildings. In light of such a consideration, the authors elaborated Fig. 1  , based upon findings from the paper sample review. It should be underscored, however, that the chart depicted in the figure was conceived and created at the level of SDG targets, considering that the latter are the levers for achieving other goals and targets (Anderson et al., 2022 ). So, the prospect of Fig. 1  on the buildings-related SDGs and targets puts emphasis upon the urgent need for actions oriented to sustainability enhancement in the entire life cycle of the building. The consequence of this would be multiple interactions among SDGs that generate synergies and trade-offs and that, so, can contribute to rescuing the 2030 Agenda from the deceleration process it has gone through, due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Anderson et al., 2022 ; Pradhan, 2023 ). It is required, however, to give priority to some SDGs where transformative actions can be taken to maximise synergies and resolve trade-offs, with the consequent progress across most SDGs (Pradhan, 2023 ). It is quite obvious, for instance, that pursuing resource efficiency along the whole building life cycle (through a series of pre-designed actions) leads to:- reducing primary energy demand;  - increasing renewable energy use;  - reducing the emission of GHGs and other pollutants; and  - reducing water consumption and waste generation.    In light of this, it can be asserted that SDG n. 12 has major indirect relations with the SDGs n. 3, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 13. There is evidence of this from Fig. 2  , in which the authors diagrammed the network of the SDGs that were previously shown in Fig. 1  as interacting with buildings. Fig. 2  is the result of the authors' personal elaboration from Mohr (2016)  early work that, in turn, was inspired by the one conducted by Le Blanc (2015) . The “strength” of the interconnections shown in the figure was expressed through the thickness of the connecting lines, that was based upon the “weights”, namely the number of targets that a given goal shares with other goals (Le Blanc, 2015 ; Mohr, 2016 ). In particular, the authors accepted and used the weights already attributed by Mohr (2016)  and so, from his work, extrapolated just those associated with the interconnections between the buildings-related SDGs shown in Fig. 1 . Such an approach is in line with Pradhan (2023) , stating that, to prioritise SDGs, the analysis of their interactions, including their networks and underlying mechanisms, should be carried out. The authors did so in this study of theirs, and concluded that the SDG-12 can be considered as the focus point in: the (eco-)design, construction and management of sustainable buildings; and in the assessment/monitoring of the multiple contributions they can make towards achieving SDGs. Furthermore, in this regard, authors believe that both the design and construction of the building are the most strategic phases in its life cycle. This is mainly because the choices that are made in those phases for material and technology selection can directly influence the energy performance and environmental profile of the building in a life cycle perspective. As the result of this, those choices can contribute significantly to the achievement of many of the SDGs selected in this study and depicted in Fig. 1 . The result is that selecting building materials based upon their environment and health protection is generally regarded as one of the most crucial steps towards the SDGs achievement, also because it has direct consequences on the other building life cycle phases. The choice of proper building materials and construction technologies was documented in the literature as significantly influential of the sustainability rate of the downstream phases of use and end-of-life in the building's life cycle (Ingrao et al., 2016 ; Ingrao et al., 2019 ; Ingrao et al., 2018 ). So, it is urgently needed that, in the future, research is designed and developed to show how each phase of the building life cycle acts towards achieving SDGs and which the most fruitful criteria and measures are, that need to be considered to reach the optimal interactions with those SDGs. In this regard, LCA is considered particularly strategic and specific ways to link it with SDGs should be the focus of specialised literature aimed at evaluating/monitoring the contribution of sustainable buildings to SDGs.  3 On the accounting of buildings' contribution to SDG achievement: A possible step forward? Previously-published literature identified mathematical quantitative methods to be suitable for the modelling of sustainability issues, and considered monitoring and evaluating as the progress towards achieving the SDGs as a priority (Allen et al., 2021 ; Aly et al., 2022 ). In light of this, this paper's authors believe that a quantitative method would be essential to effectively assess and monitor the contribution of buildings to achieving SDGs and their targets. It would allow, in fact, for assessing baselines and monitoring the progress over time in reaching specific quantitative targets towards the achievement of SDGs. Such would be possible, however, only after a proper correlation analysis and the setting of an assessment framework (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Moreover, as highlighted by recently-published studies like Hametner (2022) , trying to go beyond the trade-off between socioeconomic activity and environmental preservation and to ensure that the achievement of the 2030 Agenda's objectives does not generate ecosystems degradation, the implementation of SDGs should put a stronger focus on the environmental dimension. So, the authors analysed the correlation between buildings and the 2030 Agenda with a strong focus upon environmental issues. They did so, because:a) the environmental dimension of sustainable development is the one recognised to be most directly affected by the building industry and the role that construction has in supporting the achievement of the related SDGs is clear and well understood (essentially linked to the potential of operating changes on the building scale paying particular attention on the consumption of materials and energy as well as on the construction technologies); and  b) environmental evaluations can be based upon widely used and accepted solid systematic quantitative methods, such as LCA.    The authors, therefore, formulated their personal proposal for evaluating/monitoring the role of sustainable buildings in achieving SDGs with a focus on the environmental dimension, both at the global, national and regional scale according to scope of the given assessment. In particular, based on a combined, full energy-environmental LCA on the building scale, it should be done by:a) identifying a comprehensive set of indicators, such as for instance the one provided by the EF method (Zampori and Pant, 2019 ), including climate change, land use, water use and fossil resources. Doing so will make it possible to account for a wide range of buildings-representative environmental aspects;  b) clearly and consistently linking those indicators to the various SDGs considering their specific environmental effects and the way they are related to issues like resource-stock preservation, climate change, human health, and ecosystem quality that are addressed by the various SDGs. In this regard, it would be relevant to know that previous literature studies, including Sala (2019) , Sanyé-Mengual et al. (2019) , and Sanyé-Mengual and Sala (2022) , have already addressed the multiple links between EF impact categories and SDGs. So, it is the authors' opinion that results from those studies could be extrapolated and used to complement this assessment method.  c) defining a “business as usual” (BAU) value for each selected indicator to be then normalised to the built area (Ii, BAU /m2 ), based on a baseline scenario for the building sector at a reference year. The latter could be 2015, as it is the year in which the 2030 Agenda with the attached 17 SDGs was published. Therefore, it is since then that researchers, scientists, academia, producers, decision-makers and other stakeholders have begun to explore the multiple ways in which different manufacturing sectors (e.g., the construction industry) meet the SDGs.  d) setting specific targets for each indicator (Ii, TARGET /m2 ), coherently with SDGs and their targets. By way of example, target 7.3 aiming at doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency could be translated into a specific percentage reduction for the indicator resource use, fossils  expressed in MJ;  e) determining the specific representative value of each indicator both for conventional (Ii, CONV /m2 ) and sustainable buildings (Ii, SUS /m2 ), based on the mean characteristics/normative requirements related to existing conventional/new sustainable buildings;  f) retrieving the new conventional (m2 , CONV ) and sustainable (m2 , SUS ) annual built area;  g) comparing hypothetical BAU and TARGET evolution scenarios with the scenario calculated on the basis the m2 , CONV , m2 , SUS , Ii, CONV /m2 ba  and Ii, SUS /m2  values.    Fig. 3   reports an example that shows how the contribution of buildings to SDGs could be calculated and monitored on the basis of the proposed assessment method, focusing only on the Climate Change indicator.  4 Conclusions The building industry significantly contributes not only to the global economy and the global employment market but, also, to the impacts on the environment, the quality of the natural ecosystem and the human health. The multiple key roles that buildings play in terms of economic growth, social progress and environmental protection, as well as the urgent need for a building sector that could support SDGs are, therefore, well understood. Anyway, the definition of links between buildings and SDGs and the evaluation of buildings contribution to SDGs and their targets seems to have not been clearly defined and thoroughly investigated. With the awareness that the buildings-SDGs relationship is very complex and difficult to be measured, in this paper the authors tried to define a possible way to quantitatively estimate and monitor the contribution of buildings in the achievement of SDGs and their targets. The proposed approach is focussed upon the environmental dimension of sustainability and it is based upon a full LCA on the building scale. According to the evaluating/monitoring proposal here presented, the selection of a comprehensive set of indicators and their proper linkage to the various SDGs should obviously represent the starting point of the evaluation. Then, the key aspect of the assessment is the definition of “business as usual values” (representative of baseline scenario for the building sector at a reference year) and “target values” (coherently set with SDGs and their targets) for the selected indicators. The contribution of buildings to SDGs could be, therefore, quantitatively calculated and monitored based on the following parameters: a) specific representative value of each indicator referred to the building area (both for conventional and sustainable buildings); and b) statistical data on the yearly built area. To this paper's authors' best of knowledge, such an approach had never been conceived and proposed before and could be considered as the thing that gives novelty and added-value to this work. However, it should be underscored, that the proposed solution is just a preliminary idea of a quantitative method to effectively assess and monitor the contribution of buildings in achieving SDGs and their targets that has to be studied/refined/developed in a framework of future devoted research. Therefore, the paper could represent the basis to feed future developments of a comprehensive, internationally-recognised scientifically-based method for large-scale applications aimed at determining and improving the way buildings affect SDGs. Finally, the potential integration of the approach here proposed with the existing GBRTs in a multi-indicator framework for the assessment of sustainability and the progress towards sustainable development and related goals could represent a further research development.
