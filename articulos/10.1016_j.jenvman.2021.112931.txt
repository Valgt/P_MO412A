                  Belt and Road initiatives (BRI) transportation infrastructural development project started a new bilateral relationship amongst countries and acquired an important position to contribute to tourism and sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2030. The SDG1 (Poverty alleviation) and SDG 15 (Environmental protection) are globally highly challenging goals. Therefore, the current study using an integrative conceptual model addresses the fundamental role of BRI in achieving SDG 1 and SDG 15 in the presence of tourism development (TD) as a mediating variable. Based on stakeholder theory, using subjective analysis, the present study examines residents' perception of the BRI transportation infrastructural development, tourism development, SDG 1, and SDG 15. Using a self-administered questionnaire, collected a sample of 800 questionnaires data. The structural equation modelling analysis (SEM) indicated that the residents' perceive that the BRI transportation infrastructural development as a catalyst positively contributing to achieving SDG 1; however, it negatively correlates with SDG15. Besides, residents' perception of tourism development partially mediates between BRI transportation infrastructural development and SDG1 and SDG15. The study contributes to stakeholder theory and understanding residents’ perceptions that may help key stakeholders in future policy and planning.

Nankai Business School Nankai University 94 Weijin Rd Tianjin 300071 China       Belt and Road initiatives (BRI) transportation infrastructural development project started a new bilateral relationship amongst countries and acquired an important position to contribute to tourism and sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2030. The SDG1 (Poverty alleviation) and SDG 15 (Environmental protection) are globally highly challenging goals. Therefore, the current study using an integrative conceptual model addresses the fundamental role of BRI in achieving SDG 1 and SDG 15 in the presence of tourism development (TD) as a mediating variable. Based on stakeholder theory, using subjective analysis, the present study examines residents' perception of the BRI transportation infrastructural development, tourism development, SDG 1, and SDG 15. Using a self-administered questionnaire, collected a sample of 800 questionnaires data. The structural equation modelling analysis (SEM) indicated that the residents' perceive that the BRI transportation infrastructural development as a catalyst positively contributing to achieving SDG 1; however, it negatively correlates with SDG15. Besides, residents' perception of tourism development partially mediates between BRI transportation infrastructural development and SDG1 and SDG15. The study contributes to stakeholder theory and understanding residents’ perceptions that may help key stakeholders in future policy and planning.   Keywords Belt and road initiative  Tourism development  Residents perception  SDG1  SDG15    1 Introduction The history of the concept of sustainable development is divided into three periods. The first period focuses on the period from economic theories, including (Adam Smith, Karl Marx), who realised the unfavourable impacts of development on the environment. The second period of sustainable development starts after the Stockholm conference. The United Nations held the first conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972; however, it did not associate environmental concerns with development, but it stressed the need for economic development change policy. The third period of sustainable development starts after the Brundtland period, and this period lasts until now. It introduced the real sense of sustainable development (Drexhage and Murphy, 2010 ). This report clearly explained sustainable development from the Triple bottom line concept, including economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and socio-cultural sustainability. It is compulsory to balance all three key sustainability pillars to attain sustainability (Gursoy et al., 2002 ). In the contemporary period, achieving sustainable development is a big challenge. However, from the day of its establishment, the United Nations (UN) organisations have been active in achieving sustainable development through Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs). To cope with this challenge in 2015, the United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, which contains 17 SDGs (UN, 2015 ). The primary purpose of SDGs 2030 is to alleviate poverty; ensure a prosperous, healthy life; and ensure environmental sustainability. Tourism is one of the rapidly growing sectors and has a remarkable contribution to economic growth, employment creation and SDGs (UNWTO, 2019b ). Prior studies acknowledged the fundamental role of sustainable tourism in MDGs (Saarinen and Rogerson, 2014 ) and the great potential of sustainable tourism in achieving SDGs (Hall, 2019 ; Scheyvens and Hughes, 2019 ). Sustainable tourism balance economic, environmental, and socio-cultural impacts (Waligo et al., 2013 ) by increasing positive impacts while diminishing negative impacts (Nepal et al., 2019 ; Picard, 2015 ). Worldwide, countries incorporated strategies and projects in policy to ensure their citizens' well-being and achieve SDGs 2030 (Xu et al., 2018 ). All countries' endeavour to achieve SDGs 2030, and their effort is significant; however, countries that face financial crises have higher poverty rates because they spend less on education and health (Antoniades et al., 2019 ). The developing countries that suffer from poverty, hunger, and energy crises need global support for investment, innovation, and technological development. The bilateral economic development collaboration provides a platform for socio-economic development (Menhas et al., 2019 ). Under this circumstance, the Belt and Road initiative (BRI)'s multi-dimensional socio-economic development project might help achieve SDGs 2030 (Li and Zhu, 2019) . The BRI is considered a new Silk Road because it is an extension of the old Silk Road. The China government's cross-border mega-infrastructural development project provides a network of connectivity and helps industrialisation boost trade and energy generation. It began a new bilateral relationship between countries and acquired an important position to contribute to SDGs 2030. SDG 1 (poverty alleviation) and SDG15 (environmental protection) are considered global challenges (Koehler, 2017 ). The mega-infrastructural development projects contribute to economic growth and provide millions of employment opportunities (Chen et al., 2018 ); however, it utilises extensive natural resources including energy and water (Akadiri et al., 2012 ). Therefore, it is compulsory to investigate does mega-infrastructural development project equally contributes to poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability? Recently studies focused on objective analysis in analysing the role of BRI infrastructural development to economic growth and poverty alleviation (Javid, 2019 ) and environmental impacts (Teo et al., 2019 ). Despite much research attention, the previous research overlooked subjective analysis of residents’ perceptions. Residents are the most important stakeholders of any development project (Byrd, 2007 ). Therefore, it is crucial to know to what extent the public/residents are aware of environmental concerns, and their support to solve that problem shows readiness to contribute (Dunlap and Jones, 2003 ). Besides, transportation infrastructural development (TID) is the primary antecedent of tourism development (TD) (Chen and Haynes, 2015 ; Francesca Pagliara et al., 2017 ). Which ultimately contributes to economic impacts (Jaafar et al., 2015 ) and environmental impacts (Latkova and Vogt, 2012 ). However, prior studies unnoticed the mediating role of TD. Therefore, the current study is the first attempt to fills the research gap and based on stakeholder theory, its novel contribution to academic research is threefold. First, many economic development processes increased environmental concerns, leading to an increase in society's awareness about environmental problems (Paz et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it is crucial to understand residents' perceptions of any development activity to promote sustainable development (Liu et al., 2019 ). Thus, the present study contributes to the literature on residents' perception of the role of BRI in achieving SDG 1 and SDG15. Second, the study investigates the mediating role of TD between TID and SDG 1 and between TID and SDG15. Third, residents' perception may vary with their demographic characteristics including, age, gender, profession, and education (Parizanganeh et al., 2011 ; Shen and Saijo, 2008 ). Therefore, to analyses differences in perception, the current study tests the hypothetical model using multi-group analysis, which is entirely new.  2 Literature review 2.1 Conceptual framework Based on stakeholder theory, the stakeholder is an individual or any group who affects or is affected by achieving organisations' objectives (Freeman and Vea, 1984 ). The residents are the main stakeholders of any development project; therefore, their involvement and perceptions are important to make those projects successful (Byrd, 2007 ). This theory has been widely adopted in prior tourism studies to analyse all stakeholders' attitudes and interest in the tourism development process (Byrd et al., 2009 ). Therefore, the current study employed the conceptual framework to contribute to the academic horizon to understand the relationships between residents’ perceived impact of transportation infrastructural development in poverty alleviation and environmental protection. Besides, it examines the mediating role of TD between transportation infrastructural development and poverty alleviation and environmental protection. The conceptual model is shown in Fig. 1  .  2.2 Transportation infrastructure development and tourism development Recently a little attention has been paid to residents' perception of the BRI transportation infrastructural development and its contribution to tourism development (Nazneen et al., 2019 ). Several studies acknowledged the positive role of transportation infrastructure development in tourism development (Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2007 ) in different countries, including in Japan (Kurihara and Wu, 2016 ), Spain (Albalate et al., 2017 ), China (Chen and Haynes, 2015 ) and Italy (Pagliara et al., 2017 ). The transportation infrastructure development plays a significant role in increasing travellers’ flow and expands the tourism market (Li et al., 2018 ). The transportation infrastructural development network contributes to developing destinations, promoting destinations, providing access, and attracting tourists to tourism destinations (Nazneen et al., 2020 ). Therefore, scholarly research widely acknowledged a positive relationship between transportation infrastructure development and tourism development (Chen, 2013 ; Li et al., 2018 ). Following the prior literature, the hypothesis is suggested as:H1a The transportation infrastructure development has a positive relationship with tourism development.    2.3 Transportation infrastructure development and SDG 1: Poverty alleviation Worldwide, countries exert significant effort to achieve SDGs 2030 (Antoniades et al., 2019 ), and among them, SDG1 (Poverty alleviation) is a global challenge (Koehler, 2017 ). Poverty is a multi-dimensional issue and more acute in rural areas than the urban areas; therefore, various policies and measures can help reduce it. The investment in transportation infrastructural development refers to society's fundamental pillar that provides essential services, including transport infrastructure, energy, technology, and telecommunications, that create employment opportunities, increase household income, and contributes to SDGs 2030 (Thacker et al., 2019 ). Infrastructural development projects, including road network, improve local industrial development, make markets accessible, and provide employment and business opportunities (Asomani-Boateng et al., 2015 ). Besides, it provides accessibility to leisure activities, health and education facilities (Jones and Lucas, 2012 ). Further, transportation infrastructural development boosts industrial and non-industrial sectors' progress, which has a multi-dimensional and significant effect on communities' lives (Menhas et al., 2019 ). In that scenario, industrial development projects play a vital role in providing job opportunities, improving income, and alleviating poverty (UNDP, 2019 ). Accumulatively from both countries, China and Pakistan, the CPEC project employed millions of people (Ibrar et al., 2018 ). Besides, from subjective analysis, residents perceive that transportation infrastructural development boosts the trade and tourism industry (Nazneen et al., 2019 ), provides entrepreneurship opportunities (Kanwal et al., 2019 ), and enhance the quality of life (Mamirkulova et al., 2020 ). Scholarly research acknowledged that investment in transportation infrastructural development has an overall positive impact on economic growth (Wetwitoo and Kato, 2017 ), poverty alleviation (Chen et al., 2018 ) and achieving sustainable development (Menhas et al., 2019 ). Following the previous literature, the hypothesis is suggested as:H1b The transportation infrastructure development positively contributes to SDG 1.    2.4 Transportation infrastructure development and SDG 15: environmental protection Economic growth is the primary objective; however, environmental concerns are often left behind (Ruhanen, 2013 ). Therefore, the purpose of SDG 15 is to ensure environmental protection. The previous research indicates that mega-infrastructural development projects are threats to the environment and aquatic biodiversity (Zhang et al., 2018 ). In the context of CPEC, the transportation infrastructural development project along mountainous regions, including the Karakoram Highway, leads to loss of biodiversity and is under the threat of land sliding (Derbyshire et al., 2001 ), and depletes other resources, including clean water (Khawaja et al., 2018 ). The movement of heavy transport in the region increases CO2  emission (Yang et al., 2015 ), negatively affect human life and wildlife (Demir et al., 2015 ), and causes glaciers to melt (Nabi et al., 2017 ). The negative impacts of transportation infrastructural development on the environment have a negative relationship with environmental protection. Following the preceding literature, the below hypothesis is proposed as: H1c The transportation infrastructure development has a negative relationship with SDG 15.  2.5 Tourism development and SDG 1: poverty alleviation In the last 70 years, from 1950 to 2019, international tourism increased from 25 million to 1.4 billion and contributed 1.7 trillion USD to revenue (UNWTO, 2019a ). Tourism creates employment opportunities and plays a vital role in poverty alleviation (UNWTO, 2018 ). Over the past six decades, tourism is considered the main contributor and an effective strategy for alleviating poverty. The benefits of tourism include the increase in investment (Nazneen et al., 2019 ), economic growth, increase tax revenues, employment creation (Nunkoo and Gursoy, 2012 ), increase household incomes (Jaafar et al., 2015 ), and improve living standards (Andereck and Nyaupane, 2011 ). Therefore, a bulk of research acknowledged the positive relationship between TD and poverty alleviation (Scheyvens, 2007 ; Scheyvens and Russell, 2012 ; Vanegas, 2014 ; Vanegas et al., 2015 ; Xu et al., 2018 ), which ultimately contributes to SDG 1 (Scheyvens and Hughes, 2019 ). In the light of the preceding discussion, it is hypothesised that: H2a TD has a positive relationship with poverty alleviation.  2.6 Tourism development and SDG 15: environmental protection The SDG 15, environmental protection became a global challenge. Most of the research addresses the negative relationship between an increase in tourism demand and environmental protection (Wolf et al., 2013 ). The tourism sector involves transportation services that consume energy and contribute to CO2  emission (Katircioglu et al., 2014 ), ultimately increasing environmental pollution and global warming (Katircioglu et al., 2014 ; Solarin, 2014 ). Besides, tourism contributes to traffic congestion and overcrowding (Latkova and Vogt, 2012 ), increasing litter and waste (Lankford and Howard, 1994 ), and ultimately destroying the environment (Ko and Stewart, 2002 ). Therefore, stating that tourism can contribute to protecting the environment is challenging. Following the previous literature, the hypothesis is suggested as; H2b TD has a negative relationship with environmental protection.  2.7 Tourism development as a mediating variable The mediation role of TD between transportation infrastructural development and SDG1 and SDG15 is new to the academic literature. However, the previous research acknowledged a direct positive relationship between transportation infrastructure development and TD (Li et al., 2018 ; Nazneen et al., 2019 ; Pagliara et al., 2017 ), between transportation infrastructural development and poverty alleviation (Thacker et al., 2019 ) and between TD and poverty alleviation (Nunkoo and Gursoy, 2012 ; Scheyvens and Hughes, 2019 ). Scholarly research also acknowledged that transportation infrastructural development has many unfavourable impacts on the natural environment, including air pollution, noise pollution, increasing waste and litter (Zhang et al., 2018 ). Besides, it widely investigated the negative relationship between TD and environmental protection (Latkova and Vogt, 2012 ; Solarin, 2014 ). Therefore, following the direct relationships between variables, the hypothesis is proposed as: H3 TD mediates between transportation infrastructural development and SDG1. H4 TD mediates between transportation infrastructural development and SDG15.   3 Materials and methods 3.1 Site description The BRI infrastructural development project consists of six economic corridors alongside Eurasian countries (Asia, Europe, and Africa); however, the present study exclusively focuses on one of the corridors, “The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor” (CPEC). The current study was conducted in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, located at a strategic position and is the gateway to the CPEC shown in Fig. 2  . The CPEC transportation infrastructural development project through Gilgit-Baltistan connects China to Central Asia. The Gilgit-Baltistan is a culturally diverse place and rich with tourism potential; it is surrounded by the world's highest mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, the Karakoram, and the Hindukush. Also, the second-highest peak, K2 and the Nanga Parbat, are there. Besides, it is famous for sightseeing, flora and fauna, and the clean and green environment shown in Fig. 3  . The destination is also well-known for skiing, hiking, camping, and polo sports. The CPEC transportation infrastructural development facilitated sports tourism activities, including “Tour de Khunjerab” and “Sarfarang cold desert rally” shown in Fig. 4  . Gilgit-Baltistan is rich with tourism potential, yet tourism is at the inception stage. However, the CPEC transportation infrastructural development played a reinforcing role in tourism development; it made destination easily accessible and increased tourism arrivals exponentially in the last few years, presented in Fig. 5  .  3.2 Instrument development and data collection With a quantitative research approach, developed a five-part self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire comprises four variables: transportation infrastructure development, tourism development, SDG 1, and SDG 15. The first part enquired about demographic characteristics, including age, occupation, gender, and education. The second section measured transportation infrastructure development impacts, and we adopted related items from prior studies (Kim et al., 2015 ). The third section measured tourism development, and we took related items from previous tourism studies (Gursoy et al., 2010 ). The fourth part measured SDG1 “poverty alleviation” and adopted relevant items from previous studies (Barrios, 2008 ). The fifth part measured SDG 15 “environmental protection” and adopted relevant variables from earlier studies (Kim et al., 2015 ). We employed a five-point Likert scale to measure all the items, with 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. A pilot test was conducted to test the questionnaire's internal consistency, and the Cronbach's α score of 0.812 was employed for further study. For effective parameter estimation, the sample of 200 respondents is a minimum requirement of structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988 ). The population of the study was residents who are permanent residents of Gilgit-Baltistan. Using a stratified random sampling technique, 8 out of 10 districts, including Skardu, Ghanche and Kharmang, Gilgit, Hunza, Ghizer, Astor, and Nagar, were selected to achieve the required sample size. Further, we approached a sample of 1000 residents' older than 18 years and were aware of the CPEC transportation infrastructure development project with the purposive sampling. The respondents’ work in government organisations, non-government organisations, schools, colleges, universities, hotel and restaurants staff, business persons from markets and shops, and social activists. Using a self-administered questionnaire collected data from respondents and assured anonymity of their personal information. We utilised 800 filled questionnaires for data analysis.   4 Results 4.1 Socio-demographic characteristics The respondents’ demographic characteristics included gender, age, occupation, and education. The analysis indicated that 61.6% of the sample were men, and 38.4% were women. A total of 76.4% of the respondents were between the 20 and 40 age group, and 19.5% were between 40 and 60. In terms of occupation, 54.0% were public/private employees, 15.4% were self-employed, and 26.3% were students. The analysis results are shown in Table 1  .  4.2 Descriptive statistics The descriptive analysis indicated that the respondents rated all items favourably. The variables’ overall mean scores are presented as follows: transportation infrastructural development M = 4.05, TD M = 3.84, SDG1 M = 3.73, and SDG15 M = 2.33. The means and standard deviation of the construct are displayed in Table 2  .  4.3 Measurement model Based on the (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988 ) two-step approach, the current study examined the measurement and structural models (Hair et al., 2011 ). For the measurement model, using confirmatory factor analysis, we measured construct composite reliability (CR), convergent validity (CV), and discriminant validity (DV). The CR values were on the recommended threshold of 0.70 (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994 ), shown in Table 2 . Besides, the measured factor loading (λ) and average variance extracted (AVE) values for the CV of the model indicated that λ and the AVE values were higher than 0.5 (Hair et al., 2011 ), shown in Table 2 . We also measured the DV by comparing the AVE of items with the squared correlation between latent variables. The findings showed that each construct's AVE value is higher than the squared correlation value between each construct (Hair et al., 2011 ), shown in Table 3  . Besides, the goodness of fit results for the measurement model was χ2 = 464.221, df = 161, p <  0.000, χ2/df = 2.771, RMSEA = 0.049, GFI = 0.946, AGFI = 0.930, NFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.948 and CFI = 0.986, indicated a good measurement model fit. Thus, the measurement model is reliable, valid, and statistically fit.  3.2 Structural model To verify the study's model and validate the hypothesised relationships, we used the maximum likelihood method and applied 2000 bootstrap samples with a 95% confidence interval. The overall structural model fit indices showed that the χ2 = 471.380, df = 162, p <  0.000, χ2/df = 2.909, GFI = 0.946, AGFI = 0.930, NFI = 0.979, IFI = 0.986, TLI = 0.983, CFI = 0.986, and the value of (RMSEA = 0.049) indicated a good structural model fit.  4.4 Mediation analysis The current study analysed the direct effects of BRIs’ transportation infrastructure development on tourism development, SDGs 1 and SDG 15 and the indirect effect on SDGs 1 and SDG 15 in the presence of tourism development as a mediating variable. The direct hypothesised relationships indicate that transportation infrastructure development has a positive relationship with TD (β = 0.036, t = 22.626) and SDG 1 (β = 0.039, t = 8.049). Therefore, H1a and H1b  are supported. However, transportation infrastructure development negatively influences SDG15 (β = 0.045, t = −2.770), thereby it supports H1c. Further, TD has a positive relationship with SDG 1 (β = 0.036, t = 19.483) and has a significant negative relationship with SDG15 (β = 0.039, t = −2.289), thereby supporting H2a and H2b. The standardised estimates and t-values are provided in Table 4  . Besides, the indirect hypothesised relationship results indicate that TD partially mediates between transportation infrastructural development and SDGs 1. Likewise, TD also partially mediates the relationship between transportation infrastructural development and SDGs 15, shown in Table 5  .  4.5 Multi-group analysis Every individual with different demographic characteristics may possess different perceptions. Therefore the current study using multi-group analysis tested hypothesised model with demographic characteristics, including gender, age and employment. The analysis results indicated that all residents with different professions, gender and age group possess the same perceptions about the impact of BRIs’ transportation infrastructure development on tourism development, SDGs 1 and SDG 15. The multi-group analysis results are given in Table 6  .   5 Discussion The current study extends stakeholder theory's applicability in the context of transportation infrastructural development, tourism development, SDG 1 and SDG 15. The model fit analysis showed a good fit for both the measurement and the structural models; therefore, we tested the hypothesised model empirically and analysed direct and indirect structural relationships between variables. The study results confirmed a significant positive relationship between transportation infrastructure development and TD, indicates that residents perceive transportation infrastructure development contributes to boosting TD and increases tourism demand; these results support previous studies (Nazneen et al., 2019 ). The study results confirmed a significant positive relationship between transportation infrastructure development and SDG 1, specifying that residents perceive transportation infrastructure development contributes to employment creation, household income, poverty alleviation, and ultimately to SDG1. These findings are consistent with previous studies (Thacker et al., 2019 ). It shows that residents possess a favourable attitude towards the fundamental role of transportation infrastructure development in TD and SDG1. The current study results confirmed the significant negative relationship between transportation infrastructure development and SDG 15, indicating that residents perceive transportation infrastructure development negatively contributing to environmental protection. These findings support previous studies that identified that infrastructure development projects cause climate change and environmental pollution (Zhang et al., 2018 ). The study findings indicating that residents' being responsible stakeholder, are aware of the negative impacts on the environment and perceive that transportation infrastructure development fails to contribute to SDG 15. Besides, the study results confirmed the positive impact of TD on SDG1, which shows that residents' appreciates the positive role of TD that directly contributes to SDG1and these results are consistent with (Nunkoo and Gursoy, 2012 ). Also, the negative relationship between TD and SDG 15 indicate that residents' are not satisfied with the role of TD in protecting the environment, and these findings support prior studies (Nunkoo and Gursoy, 2012 ), which also focused on residents perception of TD and the environmental degradation. These findings are also consistent with previous studies that acknowledged that TD increases income for the short run; however, it depletes the environment for the long run (Gilliland et al., 2020 ). For a deeper understanding of relationships amongst variables, the current study investigated the indirect hypothesised relationships between transportation infrastructure development and SDG1, between transportation infrastructure development and SDG15 in the presence of TD as a mediating variable. The findings showed both direct and indirect effects between transportation infrastructure development and SDG1 are significant and positive, suggesting that TD partially mediates the relationship. These findings specify that transportation infrastructure development, directly and indirectly, contributes to achieving SDG1. The direct and indirect effects between transportation infrastructure development and SDG15 are significant and negative, specifying that TD partially mediates the relationship. TD's partial mediation effect indicates that transportation infrastructure development, directly and indirectly, harms the environment and cannot contribute to SDG15.  6 Conclusion The theoretical contribution of the present study to the stakeholder theory, debate around residents perceptions. The model provides a broad understanding of infrastructure-driven development impacts on tourism development, SDG 1 and SDG 15 from subjective analysis perspectives. The study area is rich with biological diversity, natural scenic beauty, and tourism potential, and the transportation infrastructure development exponentially increased tourism demand. Our study analysed residents' insights and explored that residents’ acknowledged the constructive role of transportation infrastructure development project that lifted TD and significantly improved tourism demand. Besides, they recognise the contribution of transportation infrastructure development in providing necessary life facilities, poverty alleviation and achieving SDG1. Residents appreciate the benefits; however, they do not ignore its unfavourable impacts on the environment. They perceive that transportation infrastructure development, directly and indirectly, exploits the natural environment and cannot sustain the environmental quality. The current study contributes to a deeper understanding that countries cannot achieve economic growth without compromising the environment. Developing countries in the transition phase are currently struggling for economic growth and compromise on the ecosystem. Therefore, the study recommends some policy implication. The managerial contribution is based on the study's empirical results. The present study suggests the following policy implication. Firstly, all stakeholders' perceptions and involvement in development activity play a significant role in promoting sustainable development (Liu et al., 2019 ). Secondly, the government can play a vital part in integrating sustainability concerns in their policy plan and should focus on green infrastructure to protect biodiversity and the ecosystem (Valente et al., 2020 ). Thirdly, to attain sustainable tourism and reach SDGs, there is a need to reconsider human-environment relations (Hall, 2019 ); therefore, policymakers should align ecological policies with transportation infrastructural development projects (Teo et al., 2019 ). Lastly, implementing sustainable practices in tourism firms is vital for their competitive advantage (Rosato et al., 2021 ). The study has a broader contribution to the theory and academic literature: however, it is not without limitations, and the study concludes with few study limitations, which opens future research opportunities. First, the present study findings’ generalizability is limited because we conducted it in one economic corridor. Therefore, future research can apply the model and conduct a study across different geographical areas of other economic corridors of BRI. The magnitude of the relationship among study variables might differ due to different geographical settings.
