                  The increasing demand of stakeholders for information on sustainability, the effects of the recent financial crisis and the role of the financial sector in sustainable development have compelled many banking institutions to provide sustainable disclosures in line with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030. The purpose of this study is to examine the materiality of the banking sector disclosures. The materiality implies the identification of economic, social and environmental issues that are relevant to the organization itself but also to stakeholders. Thus, an SDG Materiality Analysis Framework (SDGs_MAF) has been developed and applied on a sample of 37 European banking institutions. This framework is based on the SDGs and scoring/benchmarking techniques to analyze the content of sustainability reports. The results show the high priority of the banking sector for SDGs regarding the promotion of economic growth and decent work, the promotion of fairness and transparent processes at all levels. In addition, it is pointed out that the rather low alignment of materiality issues with SDGs oriented to environmental matters, as well as several managerial implications in relation to its strategic planning and the communicating of sustainability disclosures.

Venizelou str., Kallithea Athens 17671 Greece       Editor: Prof. Edeltraud Guenther The increasing demand of stakeholders for information on sustainability, the effects of the recent financial crisis and the role of the financial sector in sustainable development have compelled many banking institutions to provide sustainable disclosures in line with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030. The purpose of this study is to examine the materiality of the banking sector disclosures. The materiality implies the identification of economic, social and environmental issues that are relevant to the organization itself but also to stakeholders. Thus, an SDG Materiality Analysis Framework (SDGs_MAF) has been developed and applied on a sample of 37 European banking institutions. This framework is based on the SDGs and scoring/benchmarking techniques to analyze the content of sustainability reports. The results show the high priority of the banking sector for SDGs regarding the promotion of economic growth and decent work, the promotion of fairness and transparent processes at all levels. In addition, it is pointed out that the rather low alignment of materiality issues with SDGs oriented to environmental matters, as well as several managerial implications in relation to its strategic planning and the communicating of sustainability disclosures.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Materiality framework  Business sustainability  Banking sector    1 Introduction Nowadays, there are several interest groups (stakeholders) which influence and are influenced by corporate operations (Seuring and Gold, 2013 ). While previously the focus had been on addressing the concerns of shareholders currently the focus shifts to meeting the needs of stakeholders (Seow et al. , 2006 ). To sufficiently inform the most demanding stakeholders, organizations have incorporated sustainability information into their accounting and reporting processes (Perrini and Tencati, 2006 ). Essentially, they have employed techniques of sustainability accounting and reporting. These techniques have been implemented to record and disclose necessary sustainability information to their stakeholders in a systematic and transparent way (Rinaldi et al. , 2014 ). It is worth noting that sustainability information has also been necessary mainly since the recent financial crisis where the absence thereof appears to have been responsible for financial risks, both for businesses and society (García-Benau et al. , 2013 ). To ensure the transparency of such information, principles such as accountability, corporate governance and materiality should be tested (Bergmann, 2014 ). Information has recently been disclosed showing the progress of organizations in sustainability issues (Foran et al. , 2005 ). Many disclosure practices have been adopted by organizations to provide sustainable information to stakeholders using the triple bottom-line approach . The type and terms of sustainability information have evolved in a similar way comparable to the concept of sustainable development. From focusing only on environmental protection to promoting the SDGs of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, which place for-profit organizations at the heart of environmental and social policy. Indeed, several for-profit organizations have adopted the latest ways to address the SDGs (Raith and Siebold, 2018 ) and techniques to incorporate SDGs in reporting (Tsalis et al. , 2020 ). These techniques have also recently been identified in banking institutions and contribute to SDGs (Avrampou et al. , 2019 ). In general, financial institutions are an important sector of business which is consider essential for developing the global economy and fulfilling multiple roles in promoting economic and social prosperity (Jones et al ., 2017 ). They are also indirectly responsible for environmental protection through lending procedures to environmental sensitive firms (Chatzitheodorou et al. , 2021 ). Their role is distinct and decisive due to the mediating role they play in investments and financing (Aras et al ., 2018 ). However, apart from the indirect effect it has on lending and supporting business sectors throughout the economy, it is still a separate business unit that belongs to the wider service sector. The United Nations Global Compact presents specific industry examples and ideas for every industry in relation to the SDGs. The SDG Industry Matrix for financial services identifies opportunities for shared values and outlines initiatives for the financial sector tailored to help achieving every SDG (UN Global Compact 2015 ). However, few academics have investigated the level of alignment of banking institutions with SDGS  and how these institutions record relevant information in their sustainability reports (Cosma et al. , 2020 ). Many have focused on examining the content of banking sustainability reports regarding SDGs (Avrampou et al. , 2019 ). It is known that the most of such studies are at a very early stage without verification or concrete techniques to analyze the most important and relevant topics of banking sustainability reports (Eccles et al. , 2012 ; Jones et al. , 2016 ). Materiality analysis is a relatively new approach in the literature on sustainability reporting (Whitehead, 2017 ). Materiality relates “to identifying and prioritizing the most relevant sustainability topics, taking into account the effect each topic has on an organisation and its stakeholders ” (AccountAbillity, 2018 , p. 20), where a topic is defined as material when it “will substantively influence and impact the assessments, decisions, actions and performance of an organization and/or its stakeholders in the short, medium and/or long term” (AccountAbillity, 2018 , p. 20). In order to contribute to this under-researched field, an SDG Materiality Analysis Framework (SDGs_MAF) has been designed in order to clarify the content of banking sustainability reports. It is based on scoring–rating techniques deemed appropriate for analyzing the content of sustainability reports. A set of materiality items are presented classified according to the SDGs and the relevant literature. The framework is designed to shed light on this innovative academic research. It is applied in a sample of firms in the financial sector in order to examine how such firms incorporate the SDGs in their sustainable reports. Also, the quality of this information is in relation to the goals of sustainable development. Another scope is to show if firms emphasize on an explicit set of SDGs and any potential interrelationship with the materiality assessment. An additional aim of the research is to examine which dimension of sustainability is highlighted through the material issues, taking into account the nature and the peculiarities of the respective sector examined. For the purpose of this academic research, the SDGs_MAF was applied to a sample of 37 European banking institutions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the theoretical background in the field of corporate sustainability, reporting and SDGs and materiality analysis in corporate sustainability followed by an analysis of the building blocks of the suggested framework in order to identify the materiality analysis of the banking sector's sustainability reports. The fourth section includes an application of the framework and the fifth includes some key concluding remarks.  2 Literature review This section describes the key findings of the literature which plays a critical role in building the materiality analysis framework suggested. It consists of three sub-sections to examine the experience of the relationship between SDGs, corporate sustainability and sustainability reporting as well as to record the current knowledge of materiality analysis of reporting sustainability. Primarily, the first sub-section analyzes the most crucial findings of the current literature concerning the ways in which organizations meet the SDGs, while the next sub-section provides information about the current status of sustainability reporting for SDGs. The final sub-section includes insights regarding materiality analysis from the literature of sustainability reporting. 2.1 The current experience of the business community and SDGs Today, the current literature offers numerous definitions of corporate sustainability which can be classified into various categories. Some of these definitions refer to the corporate organizational level and strategic management where sustainability practices could be explained as a result of five key drivers: a) alignment with relevant legislation, b) aiming to profit through sustainable development strategies, c) the balancing of three aspects of sustainability (economic, environmental and social), d) win-win solutions for firms and stakeholder cooperation, and e) a complete strategy for corporate sustainability (Van Marrewijk, 2003 ; Van Marrewijk and Werre, 2003 ). Other academics have suggested various criteria to classify corporate sustainability such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or Corporate Sustainability (CS) (Montiel, 2008 ), or through a natural, societal or business orientation (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002 ). Another key criterion to analyze the concept of sustainability in organizations is the progress of sustainable development. The examination of the relationship between the concept of sustainable development and sustainability of organizations is a very significant task. The analysis of this relationship offers the context to make this concept more widely understood and identify all notable milestones of its evolution from only one goal (environmental protection) to a broader set of 17 goals of sustainable development (e.g. environmental protection, economic development and social cohesion). The evolution of the definition of sustainable development has also been apparent into the evolution of the definitions of sustainability of organizations (Nikolaou and Tsalis, 2020 ). The analysis of certain milestones is necessary to shed light on these relationships (Fig. 1  ). The first known milestone which is tied with the concept of sustainable development, as this was presented in the Brundtland report and is the starting point for the analysis. This means that economic development has to meet the needs of the current generation without compromising the abilities of future generations to meet their needs (WCED, 1987 ). The key points of this definition are mirrored in the relevant definition for organizations to meet “the needs of a firm's direct and indirect stakeholders without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well ’’ (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002 : p. 131). The emphasis of this definition is mainly on the protection of the natural environment and the promotion of social equity by seeking a well-balanced and fair allocation of natural resources between current and future generations. Indeed, most of the initial definitions of corporate sustainability focused on the environmental aspects of firms (Montiel and Delgado-Ceballos, 2014 ). However, Brundtland-oriented corporate sustainability definitions also go beyond the classical idea of profit-maximization of firms by assuring wealth-maximization of society (Signitzer and Prexl, 2007 ). The second milestone is marked by the 1992 UN Summit for Development and the Environment and Agenda 21 (Fig. 1 ). After this summit, sustainable development has been defined as using a three-dimensional approach focusing on economic development, environmental conservation and social equity. Based on this definition, the academic discussion has focused on determining the content of each dimension and identifying the proper ratio of each dimension in the overall concept. Part of the academic debate has focused on clarifying the content of the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development. Essentially, this debate stemmed from the economic theory of capital where the economic dimension (economic capital) includes man-made capital (Foy, 1990 ), the environmental dimension considers the protection of natural resources including quality and quantity and the social dimension promotes social equity and cohesion issues (Dempsey et al ., 2011 ). Based on the economic theory of capital, the academic debate has placed more emphasis on identifying the acceptable level of substitution among the three types of economic, environmental and social capitals. When any amount of capital can be freely substituted this is referred to as weak sustainability. Strong sustainability implies that the level of substitution follows a standard ratio in order to maintain a minimum critical amount of each of the three types of capitals (Hediger, 2006 ). It is worth noting that Ekins et al.  (2003)  have defined ‘critical natural capital’ as these environmental functions and natural resources which are responsible for the regeneration of natural capital and the life of living organisms. These academic debates are present in the evolution of the field of corporate sustainability. Initially, the concept of weak sustainability was mirrored in corporate sustainability through the term of ‘business case of sustainability’ (economic or financial side of corporate sustainability). Then it evolved to ‘environmentally friendly firms’, to ‘eco-efficiency firms’ (economic and environmentally sufficient) and to ‘stakeholding firm’ (more emphasis on environmental sustainability), corporate social responsibility (social-oriented definition), and corporate citizenship (Valor, 2005 ). Ultimately, the concept of strong sustainability is mirrored in corporate sustainability as good citizen firm, corporate responsibility and business ethics (mainly more social sustainable firm) (Sinkin et al. , 2008 ). The term corporate weak sustainability also encompasses corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the triple-bottom-line approach, which allows unlimited substitution among economic, environmental and human capital (McWilliams et al. , 2006 ). The term triple-bottom-line was created by Elkington in 1998 to show the classical distinction among economic profitability, environmental protection and social equity in a firm (Elkington, 1998 ). The term corporate strong sustainability includes theories that seek to introduce specific limits, mainly for natural capital, by utilizing the concepts of planetary boundaries (Whiteman et al. , 2013 ) or by defining boundaries within which firms should operate with the intention of maintaining a minimum amount of the three types of capital (Nikolaou and Tsalis, 2020 ). In the context of the business community, strong sustainability is translated as the specific limits (thresholds) within which firms should operate in order to reduce pollution and resources consumption. Beyond these limits, the operation of firms destroys the critical capital of resource reproduction and exceeds the carrying capacity of ecosystems (Nikolaou et al ., 2019 ). Finally, the third key milestone is defined when the concept of corporate sustainable development evolves in line with the 17 SDGs of Agenda 2030 (Griggs et al. , 2013 ). Agenda 2030 was developed in September 2015 and includes a set of 17 SDGs and 169 targets. These goals are based on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of the United Nations (UN) which provided new prospects in order to broaden the classical agenda of economic, social and environmental dimensions by including more targets to solve contemporary social problems (Allen et al. , 2016 ). In this logic, several of academics have suggested the alignment of corporate sustainability with SDGs (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). Vildåsen (2018) supports that the integration of SDGs into business management, offers a more social-oriented approach for corporate sustainability. They emphasized the lack of discussion of the interconnection between the SDGs and corporate sustainability. Ike et al.  (2019)  examine the priorities of SDGs in a set of Japanese MNEs and identified that the most important SDGs are Quality of Education (SDG_4), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG_8), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG_9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDGs_11), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG_12), Life Below Water (SDG_14) and Partnerships to Achieve the Goal (SDG_17). Additionally, Topple et al.  (2017)  examine various efforts to integrate SDGs into the strategic management of a sample of 112 multinational enterprises in throughout South-East Asian countries. Moldavska and Welo (2019)  developed an original framework to assist firms in recognizing suitable sustainability strategies in order to achieve many of the SDGs. Similarly, Vildåsen (2018) considers SDGs as a good strategic tool in order for firms to provide appropriate solutions for current social and environmental problems with the assistance of stakeholders. They have highlighted the critical role of SDGs in improving corporate organizational learning. Rather than focusing on the incentives of the business community to adopt SDGs, Scheyvens et al.  (2016)  have identified many barriers faced by firms in their attempt to address SDGs. To overcome such barriers for firms to address SDGs, they suggested certain institutional interventions. Ike et al.  (2019)  have studied the awareness of stakeholders regarding SDG practices adopted by a sample of MNEs in specific countries (ie the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam). They pointed out that public authority in the host countries should prepare suitable education programs and assure strong institutional procedures in order to demarcate the operations of MNEs under SDGs. Finally, (ElAlfy et al., 2020 ) have analyzed how and when firms communicate information regarding SDGs on social media with the aim to increase their legitimacy. Lu et al.  (2020)  developed a model to assist in integrating SDGs into Corporate Social Responsibility as well as to overcome some of the existing limitations in the corporate sustainability literature such as greenwashing, the engagement of stakeholders and the different CSR strategies between countries. Di Vaio and Varriale (2020)  examine how a sample of Italian airports meets SDGs 11 and 17. Malay and Aubinet (2021)  identify that there is a discrepancy between businesses and the national level regarding SDG. The biggest discrepancy is observed between business and the state mainly in SDGs 9, 10 and 11 as well as a lack of quantitative goals. Finally, Nikolaou and Tsalis (2020)  connect the concept of corporate strong sustainability with SDGs. They classify three aspects of sustainability with 17 SDGs and suggest specific limits in which firms should be operate.  2.2 The level of alignment of sustainability reporting with SDGs The field of sustainability reporting has evolved in a similar way with the evolution of the concepts of sustainable development and corporate sustainability. As seen in the previous section, three key milestones provide the context for the analysis of the evolution in sustainability reporting (Fig. 1 ). The first milestone arises from the Brundtland reports where the majority of corporate reporting focused on disclosing information regarding the environmental management and practices of organization (Niskala and Pretes, 1995 ). Huizing and Dekker (1992)  examine some environmental aspects of businesses through the concepts of green reporting, accounting and environmental auditing. Rubenstein (1992)  shows how businesses could include natural assets in corporate accounting and reporting practices. The second milestone is associated with the triple bottom line approach where the emphasis is on the three pillars of sustainable development: economic development, environmental preservation and social equity (Fig. 1 ). In line with this approach, sustainability accounting and reporting provide techniques to record and disclose information regarding these three categories (Milne and Gray, 2013 ). To facilitate organizations to disclose sustainability information in line with the three pillars of sustainable development, the international organization Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was launched in the late 90s and soon after it became popular and was considered useful guide. Based on content analysis techniques and GRI guidelines, Raar (2002)  studies voluntary environmental disclosures in the annual reports of firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Jamali (2006)  examined the triple-bottom-line strategies of businesses and identified various learning characteristics to different aspects of sustainability performance among businesses. The last milestone refers to SDGs which have recently been included in corporate sustainable reporting. Some academics have suggested methods and techniques to incorporate SDGs into corporate accounting, while others have focused on examining the level of integration of SDGs in corporate sustainability reporting (Avrampou et al. , 2019 ). The former approach focuses on including a number of normative frameworks which facilitate the introduction of SDGs into corporate sustainability accounting. Sapovadia (2017)  provided a framework to introduce SDGs into International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which is useful to standardize corporate disclosures regarding SDGs. Frostenson (2019)  pointed out the crucial role of corporate accounting in order for firms to transfer the wealth of experience of SDGs from the macro-level to a more early stage micro-level of firms. Another significant framework was developed by Bebbington and Unerman (2018)  in order for the business community to integrate some SDGs. Furthermore, Charnock and Hoskin (2020)  offered an approach to evaluate SDGs through corporate sustainability accounting. Finally, Bebbington and Unerman (2020)  found that there is a delay in integrating the essential information regarding SDGs in corporate accounting. The most recent approaches in literature focuses on analyzing existing corporate reporting in relation to SDGs (Fonseca and Carvalho, 2019 ). Specifically, Rosati and Faria (2019a)  conducted a survey to examine how 27 institutional factors affect the content and the structure of corporate sustainability reporting regarding SDGs from a sample of 90 countries. They also investigated the relationship between a set of organizational factors and SDG in corporate reporting by elaborating a logit model in a sample of 408 firms worldwide (Rosati and Faria, 2019b ). Tsalis et al.  (2020)  suggested an evaluation framework to detect the amount of disclosure topics from CSR/sustainability reports regarding SDGs by utilizing scoring-benchmarking systems. Similarly, Van der Waal and Thijssens (2020)  examined the way in which firms address SDG by utilizing logistic and quintile regressions through 2,000 sustainability reports. Finally, Izzo et al.  (2020)  examined 134 European firms which disclose information using integrating reporting (IR) guidance, which is utilized to cover issues in relation to SDGs.  2.3 The materiality status of sustainability reporting A primarily and necessary clarification regarding the concept of materiality is its origin from the financial reporting literature where it assists in assuring sufficient auditing procedures for financial accounting (Steinbart, 1987 ). To explain the content of materiality, a classical definition is provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as the information which “if omitting it or misstating it could influence decisions that users make on the basis of the financial information of a specific reporting entity”  (Eccles et al ., 2012 : p. 66). Materiality analysis is also useful for investors offering a clear signal regarding the significance of disclosure information in financial reports (Khan and Serafeim, 2016 ) and to incorporate stakeholders’ expectations and demands (Whitehead, 2017 ). Expanding on the original concept, many academics and firms use materiality analysis for both financial and sustainability issues (Morrós Ribera, 2017 ). Similarly, another international organization for the sustainability issues of organizations,  GRI, provides an explicit framework to designate the content of sustainability reports including, inter alia , the materiality analysis process (Calabrese et al ., 2017 ). However, in a short period, materiality analysis has been utilized as a multi-purpose instrument in the sustainability reporting field. This includes research studies focusing on developing certain procedures to analyze the materiality significance of disclosures and identify the most significant groups of stakeholders for organizations (Torelli and Balluchi, 2020 ). Calabrese et al . (2019)  developed a framework to conduct materiality analysis especially for firms with limited experience in sustainability disclosures. The implementation of materiality analysis has been empirically used to prioritize sustainable information with the intention of identifying the relationship between sustainability disclosures and the performance of organizations (Lindman et al.,  2020 ). Although there is increasing attention on sustainability topics and many firms disclose some sustainability issues, materiality analysis is very limited (Beske et al ., 2020 ) and few researchers employ an empirical methodology (Calabrese et al. , 2016 ). Materiality analysis may also play a critical role for firms strengthening their ability to gather appropriate information in a systematic way and related to the needs of stakeholders (Ranängen and Lindman, 2020 ). Some studies seek to identify the materiality level of corporate sustainability reporting by also examining sector-specific characteristics (Bellantuono et al ., 2018 ) and firm size (Bellantuono et al ., 2016 ). The most common and significant approach of recent studies is primarily to determine the accurate content of materiality items. For example, Hsu et al., (2013)  focused in the technology sector by means of Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) in order to determine appropriate criteria to select certain and key materiality items. Similarly, Lindman et al . (2020)  focused on a sample of the Nordic mining industry to examine differences in the priorities of materiality among different companies. Whitehead (2017)  used materiality analysis to clarify sustainability priorities in a sample of firms operating in the wine industry. By analyzing a range of external drivers of sustainability, he identified that environmental matters are high priority followed by social issues especially related to employee wellbeing. A positive contribution of this work is the re-evaluation of what is significant for stakeholders and the ways in which materiality analysis can redefine the content of sustainable reporting and corporate social responsibility considering the needs of stakeholders. The amalgamation of these multiple needs can improve organization strategy and respond to stakeholders’ expectations (Font et al ., 2016 ). Furthermore, in a sample of Spanish SMEs, Muñoz-Torres et al . (2013)  provided a materiality analysis framework to address the most significant environmental, social and corporate governance items that enables stakeholder groups to monitor sustainability performance. It is generally accepted that some firms adopt strategies to protect natural resources and society. These are considered either as profit-driven strategies or as a response to meet the needs of stakeholders. In the case of increased environmental and social awareness of stakeholders, firms consider stakeholder beliefs in their behavioral intentions and production choices. Thus, firms increase their transparency and accountability in order to establish long lasting relationships and for organizations’ goals to be achieved (De Villiers and Van Staden, 2010 ). To implement this strategy, a materiality framework should be designed to analyze the content of sustainability reports and respond to the preferences of stakeholders. Calabrese et al.  (2015)  proposed a framework to evaluate materiality items in the context of social responsibility from the perspective of different stakeholders groups, encouraging stakeholder engagement processes into business-sustainability strategy. It is worth noting that a higher level of stakeholder comprehensiveness is positively associated with a higher quality of materiality analysis of sustainability reports. There are many examples which suggest the connection of materiality analysis with stakeholder engagement (Beske et al. , 2020 ), while there are examples which shows a connection of materiality analysis with management opinion. By utilizing integrated reporting (IR), Lai et al.  (2017)  designed a materiality analysis framework which connects sustainability information with various capital contributors (e.g. human, intellectual capital) and shareholders. Organizations with less sustainability disclosures seem to have substandard communication with their stakeholders (Torelli and Balluchi, 2020 ). In the context of social value, materiality analysis is a useful tool for determining the level of alignment between social benefits and corporate profits (Saenz, 2019 ). Additionally, sustainability investments have better potential for growth for those cases where organizations disclosures are based on the materiality principles (Khan and Serafeim, 2016 ). A few studies have focused on the materiality analysis of SDG issues through sustainability reporting (Betti et al. , 2018 ). Van Tulder and Lucht (2019)  developed a framework to analyze materiality items in the context of SDGs. Schönherr et al.  (2017)  examined the role of materiality items in assisting mainly transnational firms in adopting SDGs. Similarly, a framework was developed by Garcia-Torres et al.  (2017)  based on content analysis techniques to examine sustainability reporting of SDGs. The majority of such frameworks seem to be in the initial stages and much more work should be conducted in order to make the materiality analysis of SDGs more comprehensive.   3 Methods It is worth emphasizing two important aspects concerning the methodology. The first aspect focuses on describing the research questions of this study while the second concentrates on developing a suitable methodological framework to answer them. Specifically, four research questions are developed in Section 3.1  regarding materiality disclosures of CSR and sustainability reports. The other sub-sections (3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5) provide the basic steps of the suggested methodological framework and are analyzed in order to evaluate the level of materiality of SDGs information arisen from corporate sustainability reports. Predominantly, this framework aims to identify organizations’ priorities to align their sustainable strategies with SDGs. It is based on ideas of materiality analysis by selecting the key items of materiality analysis through the relevant literature per category for the SDGs. The other basic aim of the suggested framework is to identify key SDG items which are considered vital by stakeholders and the organizations themselves. 3.1 Research questions Firms use sustainability and CSR reports to present economic and non-economic information related to their sustainability activities. As previously mentioned, a number of evaluation procedures are used to present the content of the information they want to communicate. Therefore, many firms have started to disclose information on activities related to sustainable development goals as set out in the Agenda 2030. This is a key point for many firms because results of their strategies could offer insights on the material issues according to their activity and their areas of interest. An additional critical issue to be considered is the examination of the relationship of each with the goals of sustainable development. Thus, a key research question is: RQ1: How do firms incorporate SDGs in sustainability reports and what is their interrelationship with the materiality assessment? SDGs cover a wide range of key issues related to the overall well-being of the environment and society as a whole. A critical point is to identify the most relevant SDGs and significant topics of a firm as presented in the sustainability reports. The results of the materiality analysis determine the topics of each firm which indicates different importance in specific goals. The basic aim is to identify the goals given the most and least importance and to explain this difference. Thus, the key research question is: RQ2: Which SDGs are highlighted and assessed as important through the materiality analysis framework? In addition to identifying the most important goals through materiality analysis the quality of information provided by a firm is also defined. The purpose of many firms is to examine the information of the content of each objective as it arose from the significant topics presented in the reports. This is examined through the evaluation of the quality of the information for all the material topics that correspond to the overall set of SDGs. Thus, a significant research question is: RQ3: What is the quality of the sustainability reports in relation to the SDGs? Another critical point is to examine whether and to what extent firms promote the sustainability concept and if emphasis is placed on one of the three pillars of sustainable development. This evaluation can consolidate the results of the efforts and actions provided by firms. In this way, the significance provided by the material topics and SDGs is discernible. Subsequently, it is possible to identify any weaknesses or failures in issues and their contribution to enhancing sustainability within the business unit, offering opportunities for improvement. Thus, from this the significant research question is derived: RQ4: Which dimension of ​​sustainability is most relevant to the material issues of firms as presented in the sustainability reports and how is this explained?  3.2 The structure of the SDGs_MAF The suggested SDGs_MAF has been classified in three interrelated steps (Fig. 2  ). In the first step (Fig. 2:  [S1]), the key items for the materiality analysis are determined. This procedure is based on two further activities. The first activity focuses on analyzing the SDGs and the second on drawing information from relevant literature regarding the preference of stakeholders. These activities are defined as the inputs of the suggested SDGs_MAF. In the second step (Fig. 2:  [S2]), a scoring system was designed to evaluate key items determined in the previous step. The final step (Fig. 2:  [S3]) focuses on an application of SDGs_MAF in a sample of corporate sustainability reports. In this step, two further tasks have been made: sample selection and analysis of results. This is essentially the output of the suggested SDGs_MAF.  3.3 Key materiality items A number of frameworks (Cinelli et al ., 2014 ) and methods (Escrig-Olmedo et al ., 2014 ) have been suggested to evaluate the materiality of corporate sustainable disclosures. Sustainable scoring-rating frameworks are commonly accepted tools to benchmark and evaluate disclosures as well as to construct specific indicators in sustainability reporting literature, providing a widely used statistical technique and evaluation method in this area (Singh et al ., 2009 ). In the field of SDGs and corporate sustainability reporting, only a few previous studies exist which adopt scoring-rating systems to evaluate the quality of non-financial disclosure according to GRI Guidelines (Morhardt et al ., 2002 ). Similarly, Skouloudis et al . (2010)  developed a scoring and benchmarking methodology to evaluate sustainability reports and Avrampou et al . (2018) and Tsalis et al.  (2020)  suggested methodologies to analyze the content of sustainability reports in respect to SDGs. The majority of such frameworks only focused on the triple-bottom-line and GRI guidance; they have focused more on evaluating the quality of corporate sustainability reports regarding SDGs and very little on materiality analysis. The suggested SDGs_MAF aims to fill the gap of the previous frameworks. Specifically, it aims to evaluate the materiality of the disclosed information in corporate social responsibility reports. The selection of materiality items was made through the content of SDGs and the literature review. Table 1   shows the final selection of materiality items suitable to be evaluated in corporate sustainability reports.  3.4 Scoring – rating system Two types of assessment are used to evaluate the information presented in the companies' annual reports. One method is content analysis (Unerman, 2000 ) based on data such as the number of words and pages while the second method is scoring or benchmarking methods. The second method refers to the specific scoring scales usually 0 to 3, 4 or 5 points in order to define the quality of provided information. This type of evaluation is used either by organizations (Deloitte ToucheTohmatsu, 2002 ) or academic researchers (Avrampou et al ., 2019 ). This research is based on the benchmarking/scoring techniques and in line with previous literature, a scoring system was created in order to evaluate the relationship between the materiality items (MI) presenting in their annual sustainability or CSR reports and the SDGs. The suggested scoring system ranges from 0 to 5 points indicating a weak to strong relationship between MI and SDGs. In relevance with previous studies (Avrampou et al ., 2019 ; Skouloudis et al ., 2010 ), 0 points are assigned for no relevant linkage between the materiality item and each SDG, 1 point is assigned for minimum linkage, 2 points for weak linkage between the materiality item and each SDG, 3 points for moderate relationship, 4 points for strong relationship and the maximum score is 5 points which is assigned for a very strong relationship (Table 2  ). The assessment scoring system was evaluated independently by three experts in relevant grading schemes. While materiality analysis prioritizes the issues most significant to a firm and its stakeholders, it should be emphasized that the significance of materiality items differentiates between the various stakeholders groups and the firm itself. Firms present the results of materiality analysis in their sustainability reports, and the scope of this research is to examine whether these issues are related to materiality items (Table 1 ) and whether each of them presented by each firm based on the content of the information is strongly or weakly linked to each SDG. Examining the sustainability reports, materiality items that arise and are presented are prioritized as they are not evaluated as equally important. The quality and the way firms communicate their practices related to sustainable development and specifically in the achievement of the SDGs such as materiality matrix, tables, support the classification of materiality items in two different levels. Based on the recommendations of three experts in sustainability and CSR and the evaluations of the reports, it was decided that there would be a weighting criteria of the evaluation responding to the significance that the sample presents in their disclosures. This means that if a materiality items receives a high score (e.g. 5 points) because of its strong relationship with a SDG, it will receive half of that (e.g. 2.5 points) if it has been presented as less significant by the bank. To estimate the weighting of each materiality item, the ratio among two factors A and B, given as A=2B (or B=A/2), was utilized. The first factor A represents the higher score of materiality items with the greater significance (the integer value of the scale), and B indicates the less significant materiality items. To measure the materiality score from corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports concerning SDGs, a composite index to estimate the score of separate SDGs as well as their overall score was designed. Eq. (1 ) shows the total score for each SDG for an organization. Specifically, it is calculated as the sum of the scores of each materiality item for each SDG.(1) SDGi =  ∑ i = 1   z  SDGi * A  +  ∑ p = z + 1   n  SDGp * B      Where i  = 1,…, 16 represents the number of examined SDGs, k  = 1,…, z  denotes the number of materiality items with higher significance, p =z +1,…, n denotes the number of materiality items with the less significance. The maximum score for the SDGs depends on the number of the materiality items covered in corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports. It should be noted that the 17th  goal of sustainable development has been excluded from the suggested framework because the aim of this goal is to encourage the worldwide partnership of governments and organizations to promote sustainable development goals (Stafford-Smith et al.,  2017 ). This goal might be a difficult if not impossible to be quantified through corporate and sustainability reports.  3.5 Sample selection and data collection The SDGs_MAF was applied to a sample of banking institutions by drawing information and data from their published annual corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports. The selection of the sampled banking institutions is based on some specific criteria. Firstly, the information necessary was only drawn from the GRI Sustainability Disclosure Database (https://database.globalreporting.org/ , date of visit: 23/08/2020). The GRI database provides free access to a number of CSR and sustainability reports. Secondly, the study focused on a specific sector to ensure comparability of the results and in order to be able to generalize findings for the banking sector. The focus is on the banking sector due to its fundamental intermediate role in economic development and in promoting the concept of sustainable development through lending and investment procedures (Evangelinos et al. , 2009 ) and because of its active role in all economic activity (Aras et al ., 2018 ). Banks are not directly connected with environmental and social impacts, due to the nature of their activities, and have no obvious effect either on the degradation of the environment, as is considered as environmentally friendly in terms of pollution (Biswas, 2011 ) or on the achievement of sustainable development in general. However, although the banking sector is not considered as polluting as the energy, transportation, chemical, mineral and the manufacturing sectors which greatly contribute to carbon emissions, even current financial activities have an increased environmental footprint due to impacts such as increased energy consumption and paper use (Bhardwaj and Malhotra, 2013 ). Moreover, they also have an indirect effect through funding projects which impact the environment, society and economy to varying degrees. Banks are related through the activities of their customers and funding of multiple investment projects (Gordon et al ., 2011 ; Sobhani et al ., 2012 ). It should be emphasized that the sample was limited to the European banking sector. Thirdly, the reports selected are those most currently available (e.g. published in 2018). Fourthly, reports without a section on materiality assessment have been excluded. Finally, the sample was limited to those CSR and sustainability reports published in English. The final sample included 37 European banks (Table 3  ). The majority of the banking institutions sampled is privately-owned banks listed on Stock Exchange Indexes. The country status characteristic refers to whether the bank is situated in a country which is a member of the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), if it receives any development aid through the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), or if it belongs to an Upper Middle Income Countries and Territories (DAC-UMIC). For the size of the sample, the GRI database follows the EU definition regarding large, MNE and small organizations. Large organizations specifically are those which fulfill one of the following criteria: turnover of over €50 million, a value of balance sheet greater than €43 million and more than 250 employees. The conditions of large companies are also applied to MNE, including staff numbers greater or equal to 250 and multinational organizations. Table 3  also refers to the value of total assets (in thousands of euro and Table 4   presents the distribution of sampled firms per country.   4 Results and discussion This section presents the application of the proposed methodological framework and addresses the posed research questions. The first research question (RQ1) derives from the process of materiality analysis which appears on a variety of sustainable items for an organization. It includes items which have a direct or indirect relationship with the sustainability issues of organizations. Through the process of identifying topics with significance, each organization displays an unspecified number of material issues having a consequential impact on its activities. This leads to a non-consolidated amount of material topics which also implies a different maximum score for each financial institution as Table 5   presents. For reasons of comparability and simplicity, the SDGi   scores are normalized by dividing them with the SDGi, max  scores for every bank, as showed in Appendix 1 (Tsalis et al ., 2020 ). The normalized scores range from 0 to 1. The total score of each SDG (TSDG) for the total sampled firms ranges from 0 to 37 where a score near to 37 points indicates a strong relationship of the materiality item to the corresponding SDG, while a score near to 0 indicates a weak or non-existent relationship between the materiality item and SDG. The second (RQ2) and third research questions (RQ3) are examined in Figs. 3 and 4   . Specifically, Fig. 3  illustrates the total scores of the banks sampled per SDG. The findings show that the majority of the sample banks highlighted promote ‘Peace and Justice Strong Institutions’ and ‘Decent Work and Economic Growth’ (SDGs 16 and 8). Specifically, the highest scores were achieved by Bank 34 (BI_34: 0.756 points) and Bank 13 (BI_13: 0.733 points). The majority of the sampled banks have placed significant emphasis on ‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’ (SDG_9). As can be observed, the vast majority of financial institutions score zero on issues related to SDG 15, ‘Sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity’ and SDG 14, ‘Sustainable sea resources’. Banks do not include in their strategic planning process and core business topics actions related to land and sea conservation as indicated by these objectives. Exceptions are topics such as ‘facilitation of water safety, climate mitigation and biodiversity’ and ‘supporting biodiversity conservation projects’ from banks BI_11 and BI_22, that are characterized as significant and have a moderate relationship with the relevant SDGs. Thereinafter, Fig. 4  represents the average total score for each SDG. The highest scores as expected are observed for SDG_8 (score: 0.401) and SDG_16 (score: 0.352) and items strongly linked with the major objective of the banking sector. This implies that the results of the materiality analysis of many of the sampled banks regarding SDG_8 naturally emphasize the promotion of economic growth and their employees’ welfare. They are directly concerned with its core business which are the various types of money transactions, indicating that the emphasis is on the economic dimension of sustainability (Roca and Searcy, 2012 ). The economic system provides services vital to long-term economic growth. It promotes economic growth through the management and distribution of savings and resources by providing banking services to countries, organizations, businesses and individuals (Levine, 1996 ). This core process of banking institutions is of particular importance as a means of achieving sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, by supporting more efficient capital allocation and enabling the facilitation of cash flow and consumption (UN Global Impact, 2015). This emphasizes the role of banking institutions both as a business and as an intermediary in the financial system. This result and the emphasis given by banking institutions to working conditions are in line with prior studies that demonstrate the workplace stress of bank employees due to increased work demands is a potentially important factor for mental and physical health (Giorgi et al ., 2017 ). This effect is reinforced by the constant changes that occur in all firms due to the uncertain and unstable economic conditions which were particularly evident during and after the economic crisis and which often lead to a highly stressful work environment. So, banking institutions recognize and communicate through their sustainability reports the importance of working conditions as a primary goal of non-financial goals. Additionally, many institutions focus on the promotion of sustainability issues in society and strive to improve the quality of institutional procedures and simultaneously increase their business efficiency focusing on providing data protection, transparent and fair service (SDG_16). Since the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, data protection has been highlighted especially in firms that provide services involving personal data (Tikkinen-Piri et al.,  2018 ); this topic is supported from the research results. This is a logical finding since the banking sector has frequently been blamed since the economic crisis for the failure of the economic system (Tadesse, 2006 ) and for failure to adequately address financial crime and corruption. Previous research underlines this importance concluding that a low level of corruption has a positive effect on the stability of the banks (Toader et al ., 2018 ), but less attention has been paid to sanctions developed to combat corruption and corrupt practices in their activities (Seiler and Madir, 2012 ). Furthermore, a great emphasis has been placed on SDG_9, focusing on access to financial services for all, innovation, IT and cyber security and digitalization. These results highlight the importance of innovation themes, which gain growing interest for sustainable development knowledge (Stafford-Smith et al ., 2017 ), that has been explored even more in the literature so far (Mio et al , 2020 ). Innovations that reflect market realities and challenges are more likely to lead to sustainable advantage (Lengnick-Hall, 1992 ). The literature on strategic management endorses the pursuit of innovation as a competitive advantage variable through innovative business models, services, products, markets and technologies. Firms have to introduce innovative approaches and methods to survive today's unpredictable environment (Ireland and Webb, 2007 ) and to gain competitive advantage (Sullivan et al ., 2018 ) crucial to the economic success of every firm (Urbancova, 2013 ). One the most important market driven innovations in the financial sector is financial technology providing a more diverse environment and differentiating financial services. Fintech startups, technology developers, governments, financial customers and traditional financial institutions are elements that contribute to an innovative financial industry, which is facing significant changes in traditional financial services (Lee and Jae, 2019 ). Retail banking in particular needs to address the entry of these new entrants who offer products and services tailored to the needs of customers and with enhanced technology and innovation in e-banking and mobile services. Banks address these challenges and highlight them as material issues, as market dynamics require a clear vision of digitalization (Niemand et al ., 2020 ) and an immediate and personalized management and customer service tailored to market needs (Pousttchi and Dehnert, 2018 ). A crucial example of abrupt change in digital financial services and transactions to accelerate financial inclusion has emerged recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, re-establishing the relationship between banks and all stakeholder groups in developed and developing countries (Sahay et al.,  2020 ). Another SDG with a high score is SDG 4 (score: 0.209). This implies a strategy to assure a high quality education, which in the case of banks, refers to topics such as training opportunities, employee development, and financial literacy. Moreover, banks often emphasize on issues of educational orientation of society, such as cultural issues and financial education. It is a component of human capital enhancing behaviors of financial well-being (Huston, 2010 ). This finding is also confirmed by Khan (2002)  where banks contribute to the educational sector by giving scholarships and gifting books to college and university libraries. These initiatives aim to provide households with sufficient tools to manage their budget (Remund, 2010 ). Conversely, banks achieved extremely low scores for SDG _15 (score: 0.005), SDG_14 (score: 0.006), SDG_6 (score: 0.036) and SDG_7 (score: 0.046) referring to areas that are not related to the primary activities of the banking sector. Topics related to biodiversity protection, water protection and sanitation are not in the main interests of either the stakeholders or the banking sector. Over 80% of the sample scored zero for SDGs_14 and 15 (Table 6  ). Generally, the findings reveal a very low relationship between the materiality items of the sample with SDGs (Table 7  ). Particularly, six of the SDGs (e.g. SDG_3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 16) achieved scores above the Average Total Sustainable Development Goals score (ATSDG score), representing the average total score for each SDG for the entire sample, which is 0.135 and none achieved scores above the mean of data range (0 to 1) which is 0.5 (Table 7 ). The findings are in line with Fonseca and Carvalho's (2019) research which found a moderately low quality of disclosure information of sustainable development goals in published reporting. This research has introduced an approach addressing the complex relationship between the emerging research fields of sustainable development goals from the organizational strategy towards sustainable development expecting higher financial earnings and asset quality through enlarged reputations gains. Banks have become more interested in addressing sustainability aspects in non-financial reports, acknowledging the potential risks to their corporate image and reputation and improving stakeholder relationships (Carnevale and Mazzuca, 2014 ), but there is a limited degree of contribution to sustainable development as it is set up through the SDGs. Finally, RQ4 is examined in Fig. 5  . In order to address the above research question, the following analysis is based on the triple bottom line approach (i.e. economic, environmental and social aspects) as this has been the main paradigm for the majority of businesses and banks (Sweeney et al. , 2001 ). Based on the classification of Nikolaou and Tsalis (2020) , the first dimension of sustainability (economic) could encompass SDGs_8, 9, and 12, the second dimension (environmental) SDGs_6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15 and final dimension (social) might encompass the remaining SDGs_1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 16. Fig. 5  shows the economic dimension of the sampled banking institutions. It indicates, as mentioned above, that the majority of the banks sampled have focused on promoting sustained economic growth and improving work conditions for their employees. This approach has lately become extremely common in the banking sector as their operations require higher levels of productivity and skilled employees, not merely staff who are part of a well-organized automated production line. Firms adopt sustainability projects mainly to create new knowledge (the knowledge-based view theory) and new resources and capabilities (the resource-based view theory) (Rousseau, 2017 ; Nikolaou, 2019 ). This shows that employees play a crucial role not only in meeting the goals of sustainability but also in achieving the traditional goals of the institutions including viability, profitability, and productivity (primarily SDGs_8 and 9). The banks sampled have placed less emphasis on issues such as sustainable consumption and production (SDG_12), two areas where the majority of the business community has shown increasing interest (Artiach et al. , 2010 ; Gianni et al. , 2017 ). The difference in these results is easily explained by the focus of banks on financial services and not on the production processes of the corporate sector. Banks are labor-intensive businesses, not capital-intensive, which justifies the emphasis placed on employees rather than on making their production or consumption procedures directly sustainable, (Figs. 6 and 7   ). In the environmental dimension, the sampled banks have focused on issues related to urban sustainability and climate change. These are two fundamental issues that can be understood by the way in which banks operate within society as well as the indirect contribution to climate change issues. Many banks have recently focused on climate change issues, either directly through practices adopted to reduce their impacts on climate change (Achua, 2008 ) or indirectly through greening their lending procedures to force borrowers (firms and organizations) to eliminate their direct impacts on climate change (Piscicelli et al. , 2015 ). Less but equally important emphasis is given by banks to providing affordable energy to all citizens as a result of their overall strategy to promote sustainable cities and practices to eliminate climate change. For example, some of the sample (e.g. BI_17, BI_23 and BI_26) achieved a higher score in SDG_7, they adopt strategies such as green bonding for local energy infrastructures, providing energy market services by developing innovative energy projects, renewable projects for hydroelectric power plants in transitional economies, environmentally banking products and services oriented to clean energy. The lowest score was for SDGs_14 and 15 which refer to the protection of the land and sea. This is explained by the nature of the work of banks concerning financial services not directly related to the protection of the natural environment. In the social dimension of sustainability, most of the sample place great emphasis on the development and promotion of peaceful, just and strong institutions, namely they promote SDG_16. Banks also focused on SDGs_3, 4 and 10. That is, banks promote SDGs such as health, education and the reduction of inequalities in society. These findings are in line with the work of Fluch (2007)  who identified that 30 central banks in different countries offered certain financial products to promote educational programs. Finally, they place less importance on issues such as poverty (SDG_1), hunger (SDG_2) and gender equality (SDG_10). Fig. 8   shows that the banks place great emphasis on the economic dimension, followed by the social dimension and finally the environmental. Based on the classification of Nikolaou and Tsalis (2020) , the economic dimension was the average of the scores achieved by the 37 banks for SDGs 8, 9, and 12. Respectively, the environmental dimension is the average scores for SDGs 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15 and for the social dimension the average for the SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 16 for the 37 banking institutions. The emphasis on the economic dimension is to be expected since the banking sector primarily pays greater importance to economic issues, then social issues based on promoting human resources issues (as human capital-intensive business). Finally, the results showed that banking institutions put less emphasis on environmental issues mainly by eliminating indirect impacts on the natural environment. One reason could be that they do not have a significant direct impact on the natural environment unlike other sectors such as heavy industry, chemical industry and any kinds of commercial production (Kolk et al ., 2001 ). The connection of the main activity with their responsibility for the protection of the environment is not visible. Generally, a service company has a low environmental impact per turnover, but the overall impact on the natural environment is not negligible if the energy consumption of the buildings and the commuting of employees are taken into account (Junnila, 2006 ). Also, the environmental impact of firms belonging to the services sector is not similar. There is a difference between the sub-sectors of the services sector such as transport, restaurants, tourism, education, public administration, communications, and financial intermediation (Alcántara and Padilla, 2009 ). However, even if the energy consumption of banks is not higher than other firms of the service sector, the relation of the financial services with the environment is in its indirect effects. Nevertheless, some efforts are evident. One is to reduce their environmental footprint including energy, water, paper and fuel usage. The other focuses on the strengthening and financing of green investments, green loans and bonds, and the inclusion of environmental criteria. These findings are in line with previous research that disclosure of environmental information is generally excluded from annual reports and websites of banks and therefore is an area for improvement (Menassa, 2010 ).  5 Conclusions Globally, companies recognize that they are called upon to play an important role in the economic, social and environmental responsibilities of achieving the goals of sustainable development. In collaboration with governments, NGOs and local authorities, the banking sector contributes to and highlights material issues that influence the enhancing of sustainability. Banks are a special service sector, going beyond their existing role as a business with the ultimate goal of making a profit, as they are also the main mediating factor of the financial system. This particularity makes its role crucial in promoting business solutions, calling on it to respond to business strategies by incorporating solutions that enhance the viability of the organization itself. Also crucial is meeting the requirements of stakeholders, supporting the notion of sustainable development, ethics, volunteering and existing legislative commitments on socio-environmental practices. The motivation of this research is to examine the level of alignment of the issues that banking institutions communicate as important in their sustainability disclosures and the SDGs. For this purpose, this paper suggests an innovative framework to evaluate the materiality of sustainability reporting disclosures concerning SDGs suitable for banking institutions. The findings show that the sample has emphasized some SDGs mainly in relation to the main scope of their mission. Specifically, the findings showed that the banks sampled put more weight on promoting economic growth and better working conditions. The finding is reinforced considering the fact that banking institutions are responsible for the cash flows of the financial system and this is a major concern for all types of stakeholders, as well as those responsible for shaping the political and socio-economic structure. At the same time, with the adoption of practices related to this goal, elements are being incorporated to promote change from financial growth to the broader concept of sustainable development. Another main concern is their workforce since it is a work-intensive sector. A well-organized structure and the need for satisfactory working conditions are a driving force for enhancing productivity and employee satisfaction. Employee welfare including satisfaction and decent working conditions in all areas of the banking sector is an area for improvement. Especially at a time when all kinds of relationships are being disrupted and redefined by social change, maintaining and enhancing fair working conditions is particularly important. The positive and stable economic situation of financial institutions implies an ethical stance on issues related to the fair and legal management of specific topics. The results of the research confirmed that the second most important goal is the management of issues such as financial corruption, financial crime and the management of personal data issues, which is a very sensitive subject for bank customers and is often disputed. Therefore, it is particularly important to be inextricably linked to the feeling and the strengthening of important values ​​of a fair financial system on the one hand but also the confidence that the personal data of each interested party are protected. These topics are increasingly integrated as banking services become more convenient and simpler to customers as required by current conditions. Consequently, the results of the research show the emphasis given to the SDG in relation to issues which improve customer service and are included in the facilitation of services such as digitization, innovation techniques, cyber security and internet banking. This result implies the need for intensification and the necessary modernization of all banking services, whether it concerns the customer service or the management and operational processes within the organization. In addition, areas that have been emphasized include the improvement of education such as financial literacy, human capital management, training opportunities and skills development of the workforce and the public. Interestingly however is the overall result of a rather low linkage of the material topics related to the environment dimension and the SDGs in the banking sector. In the first place, the connection between the banking sector and its effects on the natural environment, like various other sectors, mainly the production of products and industries, is not obvious. Previous research shows however that the impact of financial institutions on the natural environment is not insignificant. This is not just about energy consumption inside and outside the organization by their daily processes. The banking sector has a significant indirect effect through the environmental criteria for financial transactions and investments, whether they address environmental issues or simply take into account the respective environmental impact in lending and investment processes. Finally, despite the assessment of some sustainable goals which receive higher reporting scores than others, the overall results give a rather weak linkage of the topics emerging from the materiality analysis and sustainable goals in the banking sector.  This study has certain limitations which can provide directions for future research. Firstly, the proposed methodological framework was applied to a specific business sector. The results of the research cannot be generalized, not even to the wider service sector as the latter includes sectors such as transport which has a direct environmental footprint. Secondly, the empirical application of the framework examined European banking institutions. Therefore, in view of these limitations, it would be interesting to consider the potential linkage of materiality items and SDGs in other service sectors and therefore in different operational areas, industries and geographical regions. Future research may also investigate the confirmation of the results in the long term.
