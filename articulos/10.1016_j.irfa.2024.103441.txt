                  In lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, where campaigns are specifically focused on entrepreneurial proposals that address significant social and environmental challenges, it is still not clear what factors are more likely to favor a campaign's success. The literature recognizes that project descriptions constitute a major source of information for funders and can influence their choice of whether to lend financial resources. Given the nature of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, we focus on the presence of different sustainable development goal (SDG) themes in project descriptions, identified through topic modeling analysis, and we measure their impact on the success of a campaign. Using data collected from the Kiva platform, we show that some SDG themes have a negative effect, while others have a positive impact on the success of a campaign. The outcomes of this research contribute to overall scientific understanding of the phenomenon and provide useful insights for entrepreneurs and policymakers to increase the success of their campaigns and further spread lending-based prosocial crowdfunding.

In lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, where campaigns are specifically focused on entrepreneurial proposals that address significant social and environmental challenges, it is still not clear what factors are more likely to favor a campaign's success. The literature recognizes that project descriptions constitute a major source of information for funders and can influence their choice of whether to lend financial resources. Given the nature of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, we focus on the presence of different sustainable development goal (SDG) themes in project descriptions, identified through topic modeling analysis, and we measure their impact on the success of a campaign. Using data collected from the Kiva platform, we show that some SDG themes have a negative effect, while others have a positive impact on the success of a campaign. The outcomes of this research contribute to overall scientific understanding of the phenomenon and provide useful insights for entrepreneurs and policymakers to increase the success of their campaigns and further spread lending-based prosocial crowdfunding.

More precisely, crowdfunding allows individuals, organizations, and communities to overcome geographic constraints in order to solicit funding from backers worldwide. As a result of the digitalization of the business environment and of the general public, crowdfunding has evolved to become a vibrant and significant option for startups to raise considerable funds (Seigner et al., 2024 ; Walthoff-Borm et al., 2018 ), and it has thus drawn the close attention of scholars, practitioners, and policymakers (Block et al., 2018, 2021 ; Giudici et al., 2018 ). Recent data supports this tendency; for example, Statista anticipates that the size of the crowdfunding market reached $1.41 billion in 2023 (marking a 12.8% increase vis-a-vis the previous year, 2022), and it is expected to reach $3.62 billion by 2030 (Statista, 2023). The crowdfunding phenomenon can be categorized into four primary types: equity, lending, reward, and donation (Chen, 2023 ; Mollick, 2014 ; Mollick & Robb, 2016 ; Yasar, 2021 ). Equity crowdfunding (Cumming et al., 2021 ; Johan & Zhang, 2022 ; Vulkan et al., 2016 ) enables investors to trade funds for equity shares, so they match their financial returns with the venture's performance (Troise et al., 2022 ; Troise & Tani, 2020 ). Lending-based crowdfunding includes individuals lending money to projects with the promise of being refunded in the future (Cappa et al., 2021 ; dos Santos Felipe, Mendes-Da-Silva, Leal, & Santos, 2022 ; Jiang et al., 2021 ; Leone et al., 2023 ). In reward-based crowdfunding backers provide funds in exchange for a tangible item or service (Cappa, Pinelli, Maiolini and Leone, 2021 ; Crosetto & Regner, 2018 ; dos Felipe et al., 2022 ; Jiang et al., 2021 ; Maiolini et al., 2023 ). Finally, donation-based crowdfunding is motivated by compassion, with backers donating to causes without expecting any financial or material rewards (Alegre & Moleskis, 2021 ; Robiady et al., 2021 ; Salido-Andres et al., 2021 ; Zhao & Shneor, 2020 ). Each of these categories reflects a distinct approach to crowdfunding, responding to the diverse requirements and expectations of entrepreneurs and backers. However, all the categories share the fact that backers are generally non-professionals (Murray et al., 2020 ) and projects compete with each other to emerge (Weinmann et al., 2023 ). Given the growing size of this phenomenon in terms of funds invested and the number of projects backed, scholars have dedicated considerable effort to trying to figure out what factors make campaigns successful (Cordova et al., 2015 ; Deng et al., 2022 ; Giudici et al., 2018 ; Parhankangas & Renko, 2017 ; Shneor & Vik, 2020 ). The motivations driving backers in various crowdfunding models display a distinct spectrum, emphasizing either intrinsic or extrinsic factors (Allison et al., 2015 ; Cappa, Franco, Ferrucci, & Maiolini, 2022 ; Cappa, Franco, & Rosso, 2022 ). Intrinsic motivations in crowdfunding are driven by internal delight, with backers motivated by the fulfillment that comes from supporting a project that often aligns with their values or interests. These motives are especially evident in reward-based crowdfunding, where backers are motivated by the enjoyment and engagement they find in the projects they support (Allison et al., 2015 ; Bagheri et al., 2019 ) and in donation-based crowdfunding, where people donate money to charity (Chan et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2020 ; Pan & Dong, 2023 ). Extrinsic motivations, in comparison, are generally oriented towards the achievement of outcomes, such as cash benefits or material rewards. These benefits, whether monetary or material, are notably prevalent in equity-based crowdfunding, where backers are primarily motivated by financial gain, similar to traditional investment processes (Zhang & Chen, 2019 ), or lending-based crowdfunding, where backers receive annual interest (Bernardino & Freitas Santos, 2021 ; Bock et al., 2022 ; Cumming & Hornuf, 2022 ). The existing research has concentrated on how motivations drive the success of equity and reward-based crowdfunding, whereas there is a noticeable lack of studies on factors affecting the success of lending-based crowdfunding (Nisar et al., 2020 ; Stefanelli et al., 2022 ). This gap in understanding success factors is even more significant in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, where campaigns are specifically focused on entrepreneurial proposals that address significant social and environmental challenges (Emanuel-Correia et al., 2022 ). In other words, lending-based prosocial crowdfunding projects are focused on tackling “grand challenges,” i.e., global problems affecting the environment and society (Cumming et al., 2024 ; Foray et al., 2012 ; Goergen & Rondi, 2019 ; Kuhlmann & Rip, 2014 ; Mansouri & Momtaz, 2022 ; Morea et al., 2023 ), which means seeking to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs), which in recent years have become an important issue, especially in finance literature (Andrikopoulos, 2020 ; Guterres, 2022 ; Kara et al., 2021 ; Nedopil Wang et al., 2022 ). In light of increasing societal focus on SDGs, enhancing the success of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding campaigns is becoming more critical and it is important to understand what factors trigger backers' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to fund these campaigns. As in other forms of crowdfunding, entrepreneurs should convince investors of the value of their campaign, since they have limited information available. To this end, the signals provided in campaign descriptions are crucial to urge backers to provide money (Ahlers et al., 2015 ; Piva & Rossi-Lamastra, 2018 ; Reichenbach & Walther, 2021 ; Steigenberger & Wilhelm, 2018 ; Vismara, 2018 ). From this perspective, the description of a project can signal and emphasize the SDG themes of the crowdfunding campaign it aims to contribute to, which is the foundation of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, along with the extrinsic motivations of earning a profit from the loan. This work aims to investigate what impact SDG-related themes have on a campaign's success, in this specific crowdfunding context. Thus the research question addressed in this study is the following: Do SDG-related themes affect the success of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding campaigns? We investigated the above-mentioned research question by running an explorative textual analysis based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a topic modeling technique, on campaign-specific textual data from 2,060,871 lending-based prosocial crowdfunding projects collected from Kiva data, a well-known international lending-based prosocial crowdfunding platform. In this manner our study aims to uncover whether the presence of environmentally and socially significant themes connected to SDGs, such as climate change, poverty reduction, and healthcare innovation, can indeed increase investor support for these crowdfunding platforms. In particular, a topic model was performed to identify the SDG-related themes in each campaign. Then, through regression analysis, we analyzed the impact of these themes on a campaign's success. Our results show that themes related to “community development,” “energy,” “education,” and “water and sanitation” favor the success of lending-based prosocial campaigns, whereas certain other themes, i.e., “agriculture” and “financial services,” have a negative effect. The outcomes of this research contribute to overall scientific understanding of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding. By shedding light on how the themes used in the description of a campaign positively affect success, we offer interesting insights for scholars, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2  we review the main literature on the topic, in Section 3  we describe the methodology adopted in detail; in Section 4  we highlight the outcomes of our analyses; in Section 5  we discuss the results and contributions generated by this study; and, finally, in Section 6  we report conclusions, limitations and future developments.  2 Literature review Crowdfunding offers numerous benefits for all stakeholders. It allows entrepreneurs to have direct contact with their backers, and also offers them a quicker, cost-effective fundraising solution (Hornuf & Schwienbacher, 2018 ; Ordanini et al., 2011 ); backers have the opportunity to financially support the initiatives they like thanks to a mix of personal interest in gaining some sort of bounty and pleasure in aiding worthy projects (Cappa et al., 2023). Finally, society as a whole benefits from a smoother distribution of capital among entrepreneurial projects that produce economic development as well as benefits in terms of SDGs. (Cappa et al., 2023; Cumming et al., 2024 ). In all types of crowdfunding, in order to secure funding, companies disclose information about the quality of their economic activities and their capabilities to potential investors (Chakraborty & Swinney, 2021 ; Wasiuzzaman, 2021 ), as they try to convince the latter to invest in their entrepreneurial idea. The issue of fundraising maximization has been addressed from several different theoretical perspectives, and signaling theory has emerged as one of the most commonly used lenses due to its ability to explain how signals reduce the information asymmetries present in these online-mediated campaigns, helping investors to obtain the resources they desire (Steigenberger & Wilhelm, 2018 ). According to this theoretical approach, the likelihood of crowdfunding success is greatly increased when there are trustworthy signals from entrepreneurs and signs of a high-quality project (Baier et al., 2022 ; Camilleri & Bresciani, 2022 ; Chakraborty & Swinney, 2021 ; Huang et al., 2023 ). Signaling theory highlights the importance of information communicated between entities (Kleinert et al., 2022 ; Lim & Busenitz, 2020 ), especially for crowdfunding where entrepreneurs must signal the viability of their projects and their own credibility to potential backers (Connelly et al., 2011 ). Indeed, many projects that collect money through crowdfunding are never completed due to a lack of credible or convincing information (De Crescenzo et al., 2020 ; Piening et al., 2021 ; Stevenson et al., 2022 ). Therefore, signals regarding the quality of entrepreneurs and projects are absolutely critical, especially since they demand specific efforts on the part of entrepreneurs (Colombo, 2021 ; Connelly et al., 2011 ). In fact, despite the relatively low economic cost of certain campaign elements, such as narratives, the value of the signals communicated can be crucial, as suggested by Steigenberger and Wilhelm (2018) , especially on crowdfunding platforms like Kiva, where backers are not professional investors. The success of crowdfunding efforts often centers on the effectiveness of these signals (Davies & Giovannetti, 2018 ), as they manifest project viability and the credibility of entrepreneurs (Cappa et al., 2021 ), neither of which are readily apparent (Kirmani & Rao, 2000 ). Extensive research in entrepreneurial finance leverages signaling theory to comprehend how entrepreneurs might use various signals to legitimize their ventures (Mochkabadi & Volkmann, 2020 ). However, among the multiple signals analyzed so far, the use of sustainability-related signals remains overlooked and presents contradictory results, which we will try to summarize in the next section. 2.1 Crowdfunding and sustainability Recent studies have focused on the role of sustainability-related signals in driving the success of crowdfunding campaigns, as these are becoming increasingly important in financial investment in general (e.g., Guterres, 2022 ). Professional investors, such as venture capitalists, may look at sustainability initiatives as investments that are less appealing than traditional entrepreneurial ventures (Messeni Petruzzelli et al., 2019 ) because they have higher perceived difficulty in providing tangible and measurable outputs in the short term, and they consequently have a higher level of market uncertainty (Calic & Mosakowski, 2016 ; Taeuscher et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, further studies have found that sustainability-based investment projects may attract investors willing to finance them (Shahid et al., 2023 ). In crowdfunding, this shift is apparent since campaigns that integrate signals of sustainability tend to attract attention, even though their impact on overall success is still not clear (Bouncken et al., 2015 ). The connection between sustainability orientation and crowdfunding has only recently begun to receive attention in the literature, with a major focus on environmental aspects (Messeni Petruzzelli et al., 2019 ; Vasileiadou et al., 2016 ). Vismara (2019)  investigated the concept of sustainability in equity crowdfunding. His findings demonstrated that a focus on sustainability, in the equity type of investments, does not enhance the likelihood of crowdfunding campaigns being successful, nor does it raise the likelihood of attracting professional investors. Unlike professional investors who prioritize economic returns, smaller investors often have broader motivations. In the same vein, Ortas et al. (2015)  demonstrated that businesses with a focus on sustainability have had a tough time acquiring funding from outside sources. On the other hand, further research has found a positive relationship between environmental goals and the success of campaigns (Hornuf et al., 2022 ). Siebeneicher and Bock et al. (2022)  found that ecological and social elements are also valued by backers, and they have a positive impact on the success of crowdfunding campaigns. Other studies in the reward crowdfunding sphere suggest that sustainability orientation has minimal impact on project success. Hörisch (2015) , using Indiegogo as a platform, found no significant correlation between sustainability orientation, particularly environmental focus, and crowdfunding outcomes. Additionally, Testa et al. (2020)  examined food-related projects on Kickstarter and found that highlighting self-centered product attributes, such as personal taste, is more influential in garnering crowdfunding support than focusing on societal concerns like sustainability. The contradictory outcomes of research regarding the influence that sustainability topics have on crowdfunding, which returned both positive and mixed results, suggest that more research is needed on this issue. In addition, most previous studies have focused on equity and reward-based crowdfunding, while less emphasis has been devoted to lending-based crowdfunding. Yet we believe that, given this lack of a shared view on the topic, there is a clear need to analyze the impact of sustainability-related signals on campaign success, including the case of lending-based crowdfunding, to enhance comprehension of the topic. This places the groundwork for understanding the distinct benefits of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding as a form of lending-based crowdfunding where funds are provided to fundraisers with expectations of both social and economic returns (Berns et al., 2020 ; Figueroa-Armijos & Berns, 2022 ).  2.2 Lending-based prosocial crowdfunding and sustainability Lending-based prosocial crowdfunding has been gaining traction, with platforms dedicated to supporting projects with more general social or environmental aims (Nakagawa & Kosaka, 2022 ). Scholars have been dedicating their resources and attention to acquiring an understanding of this forward-thinking approach ever since the launch of the very first lending-based crowdfunding platform, Zopa, in the year 2006. More specifically, several studies have been implemented to understand decisions regarding the amount of money to invest (Galak et al., 2011 ). However, studies have investigated the decisions that individual investors make regarding the speed at which they invest. This strategy leverages both extrinsic and intrinsic motives, considerably increasing the effectiveness and appeal of campaigns focused on social and environmental advantages, and this indicates the growing importance of sustainability in fintech and crowdfunding domains. The combination of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations among backers is what distinguishes crowdfunding, which is based on lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, from other forms of crowdfunding (Chen et al., 2021 ). According to Messeni Petruzzelli et al. (2019) , this model attracts individuals who are motivated not only by the possibility of financial returns but also by the desire to support social or environmental causes. The fundraisers that participate in this type of crowdfunding typically have goals that are aligned with social or environmental benefits (Green, Tunstall, & Peisl, 2014 ), which resonates deeply with donors who are motivated to bring about positive change (Bagheri et al., 2019 ). This one-of-a-kind combination of reasons improves the appeal and impact of crowdfunding initiatives that are geared towards helping the community. Studies on lending-based prosocial crowdfunding focus on how different motivational factors influence the speed and success of fundraising (Berns et al., 2020 ; Galak et al., 2011 ). Unlike traditional models, success in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding is not just measured by the amount raised but also by the rate of funding (Allison et al., 2013 ; Dorfleitner & Oswald, 2016 ). In fact, the majority of projects ask for a low amount of money, and their success indicator is mainly the time needed to raise the requested financial resources. In this paper, the application of social and environmental signals in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding is framed within the broader context of SDGs, or sustainable development goals. These encourage all nations — rich, poor, and middle-income — to promote prosperity and environmental protection. They acknowledge that eradicating poverty requires methods that generate economic development, address social needs including education, health, social protection, and employment opportunities, and address climate change and environmental protection (Erin et al., 2022 ; Suárez Giri & Sánchez Chaparro, 2023 ). According to Kara et al. (2021) , access to credit directly impacts the achievement of SDGs, which aim to eradicate poverty and enhance health, education, and equality. They also argue that the global challenge of reaching these goals requires the collaboration of governments, the private sector, civil society, educational institutions, and the media. Within this cooperative framework, the financial system plays a crucial role by enabling households to access essential financial services like savings accounts, consumer credit, and mortgages. While SDGs do not explicitly target credit access, it can be argued that such access can significantly advance broader SDG aims, including those of reducing poverty and inequality (Guterres, 2022 ; Suárez Giri & Sánchez Chaparro, 2023 ). Given the cooperative nature of SDGs, they present an ideal focus for lending-based prosocial crowdfunding because, by aligning crowdfunding initiatives with SDGs, projects can utilize these goals as powerful signals to attract backers who are intrinsically motivated by social and environmental causes. This alignment not only enhances a project's appeal to potential investors but also reinforces the credibility of fundraising efforts, making it a strategic approach to address global challenges through collective financial support. For this reason, we believe SDGs could provide proper signals to help explain lending-based prosocial crowdfunding initiatives.   3 Methods We collected data about lending-based prosocial crowdfunding campaigns from the database Kiva, founded in 2005 and considered the “world's largest public database of micro-entrepreneur profiles” (Flannery, 2009 ). We downloaded information on 2,060,871 entrepreneurial projects founded from 2011 to 2022 in >60 countries. Our dataset includes the textual description of each project, the year of fundraising, the funding request initiation date, the closing date upon successful funding, the total number of lenders, the count of borrowers soliciting funds, and Kiva's project sector classification. To identify the main theme of the campaigns, we used topic modeling. Topic modeling includes a variety of computer methods for identifying textual subjects (Hannigan et al., 2019 ). Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic modeling fundamental, underpinned our investigation. LDA uses probabilistic frameworks to model word associations in order to identify themes inductively. In developing our topic modeling methodology, Python was the main instrument used for sophisticated textual data analysis. The process started by applying the following steps to the text contained in the project description of our dataset: a) lowercasing, i.e. each description was lowercased to promote uniformity and eliminate case-sensitive word recognition issues; b) punctuation removal, i.e. all punctuation was removed in order to have clean, analyzable data without syntactical interruptions; c) English word filtering, to ensure consistency and clarity in our linguistic study1  1 A thorough collection of English terms from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt ] was used to filter out non-English words.  ; d) removal of stopwords, i.e. deleting all stopwords from the dataset to improve analysis quality and focus2  2 To run it we used Python's “spacy”  library.  ; e) personal and geographic name removal, so that personal names and city names were removed from each description to ensure anonymity; f) two-character words were omitted to minimize noise from abridged acronyms or abbreviated names and to focus on more meaningful terms. Our topic modeling approach employed the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP),3  3 Utilized from Python's “gensim.models.hdpmodel.HdpModel”  module.   due to its ability to autonomously identify the number of topics present in a dataset, which eliminated the need for prior specification. To better focus the results of our topic model, eliminating noise elements, we implemented specific parameters in its configuration. In our model, we filtered out words that appeared in <20 documents (considered infrequently used) or in over 40% of the documents (considered overly common). This approach was instrumental in emphasizing terms that are significant yet not overly pervasive. For the remaining parameters of the HDP model, we maintained the default configurations. This strategy was adopted to take advantage of the HDP model's established, well-optimized frameworks, allowing us to focus our customization efforts on crucial aspects of data preparation and setting appropriate word frequency thresholds. Topic modeling revealed six principal themes, which we subsequently aligned with specific SDGs related to grand challenges. This alignment was conducted ex-post by examining the keywords within each theme and comparing these with the descriptions of the SDGs available on the United Nations website. Through this process, we were able to carefully craft each topic's title from its keywords to accurately reflect its focus, ensuring a coherent connection between the themes identified and the relevant SDGs that address these grand challenges in detail. Building on the methodology outlined above, our analysis sought to identify connections between the keywords derived from topic modeling and the broader SDGs. As described in the forthcoming paragraph, this approach allowed us to construct a detailed description of each theme through the lens of SDGs. By starting from specific keywords and elaborating on them, we sought to elucidate the thematic connections to SDGs, thereby providing a grounded understanding of how each theme identified aligns with global sustainability objectives. The alignment of the emergent themes with the SDGs is evident in their contribution to global development targets (Kuhlmann & Rip, 2014 ). The first theme, agriculture , emphasizes farming and rural livelihoods with terms like “farming,” “farmers,” and “agriculture.” This topic highlights agriculture's importance in developing countries' economies, especially in supplying income and nourishment to a substantial portion of people. This theme aligns with SDG 2 (zero hunger). Agriculture is fundamental in addressing hunger and achieving food security. Sustainable agricultural practices also support SDG 15 (life on land) through responsible land use and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) through sustainable food production systems. Community development  was the second important issue, with terms like “fellowship,” “community,” and “social.” Social aspects emphasize community engagement and social networks in micro-entrepreneurship. It also favors community-based economic development. This correlates with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Community development efforts enhance the sustainability of cities and communities, promoting inclusivity, safety, resilience, and sustainability. The third theme, energy , includes words like “electricity,” “solar,” and “energy,” indicating an intensifying focus on renewable energy. This shows the growing importance of energy access and sustainability in developing regions and the role of crowdfunding in promoting clean energy solutions. It is directly associated with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). This sector's focus on sustainable energy sources contributes to ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. The fourth theme is education  with keywords like “school,” “education,” and “university.” Education is crucial to development, and crowdfunding can support educational efforts, affecting long-term socioeconomic outcomes, and education ties in with SDG 4 (quality education). Education is crucial for empowering individuals and promoting lifelong learning opportunities, thereby fostering overall sustainable development. The fifth theme, water and sanitation , features “water,” “clean,” and “health.” This dataset emphasizes the importance of clean water and sanitation in improving public health and living circumstances for neglected populations. It aligns with SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Efforts in this sector are essential to provide access to safe water and sanitation for all, a critical component of global health and well-being. Finally, financial services  emerged with terms like “financial,” “loans,” and “revenue.” Crowdfunding provides financial services for entrepreneurs and small enterprises, especially in places without access to regular banking (Troise et al., 2023 ). It relates to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). Financial services, particularly when focused on inclusion, support economic growth and work towards reducing inequalities by providing access to financial resources for underserved populations. Table 1   brings together the topics and the keywords. The 6 themes identified constitute the independent variables in our regression analysis model. We study their effect on the success of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding. Unlike other forms of crowdfunding, where success is measured in terms of funds collected for the goal and campaigns seldom exceed the goal by overfunding, lending-based prosocial crowdfunding presents a different scenario. In lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, the total amount funded typically matches the amount requested, as this is probably the most successful form of crowdfunding in terms of funding goals achieved, often involving modest sums. Consequently, success in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding is evaluated through a different metric, namely the number of days taken to close the funding campaign, as shown in recent research (Allison et al., 2015 ; Conger et al., 2018 ; Williamson et al., 2021 ). This metric has been adopted in various research papers as a more accurate measure of success for lending-based prosocial crowdfunding initiatives (Moss et al., 2015, 2018 ; Salahaldin et al., 2019 ; Williamson et al., 2021 ). Thus the dependent variable in our paper is funding time . Therefore, the negative coefficient of the independent variables resulting from our analyses will be associated with positive results, because the lower the number of days taken to close the campaign the higher the success level of the campaign. We conducted a Poisson regression because this type of regression performs effectively for temporal variables. Indeed, it can handle count data over a defined period. This statistical method models non-negative integer count data (Kripfganz, 2023 ). It works best when occurrences are counted and occur independently during a set observation time. In cases where the dependent variable is the number of occurrences of an event within a given time frame, the Poisson regression incorporates the distributional characteristics of count data to provide more accurate and interpretable results. Poisson regression is useful in such situations because it accounts for count data variability, which typically defies the normality assumptions of linear regression models (Gardner et al., 1995 ). In our analysis of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, we incorporated several control variables that have been acknowledged as influential in previous studies (Flannery, 2009 ; Moss et al., 2015, 2018 ; Williamson et al., 2021 ). These include sector categorizations as codified by Kiva, namely fundraising year  and funded amount , the latter measuring the amount of a loan (in US dollars) purchased by lenders. Lenders total count  measures the total number of lenders and teams total count  measures the number of individuals in the potential teams of investors which make up collective investment groups, and this offers insights into the community and collaborative aspects of funding. The variable flexible fundraising enabled  is a dummy variable that has a value of 0 if the entrepreneurs refund money to lenders if the goal set is not achieved, and 1 if entrepreneurs finance their projects with the amount of money received, even if it does not achieve the set goal. Currency exchange loss  measures the portion of a loan not repaid due to currency fluctuations. These two variables are crucial in understanding the financial and exchange rate dynamics at play. Additionally, borrower count  is the number of entrepreneurs that participate in the project, and lender repayment terms  indicate the number of months before the amount of money lent is repaid, and these provide a framework for assessing the credit structure and risk associated with these campaigns. These control variables are integral in painting a comprehensive picture of the factors that influence the success and functionality of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding initiatives. Descriptive statistics for the above-mentioned variables are reported in Table 2  .  4 Results To check for the absence of multicollinearity, we ran correlations among all the variables in our dataset, as shown in Table 3  . The outcomes of the Poisson regression analysis carried out in this research are presented in Table 4  . Model 1 incorporates solely the control variables, while Model 2 also includes the independent variables, specifically the 6 topics that we obtained by exploring the dataset through the HDP model. In Model 2 of our Poisson regression analysis, we can see the impact of the 6 themes identified through topic modeling for funding time. Notably, themes with a positive coefficient, such as “agriculture,” “education” and “financial services,” imply slower funding times. In contrast, themes with a negative coefficient, including “community development,” “energy,” and “water and sanitation,” demonstrate a quicker pace in raising funds. Furthermore, for campaigns focusing on “agriculture,” there is a notable increase in funding time (β = 3449.00 with p -value <0.001) concerning the average number of days. This suggests that projects related to agriculture may require a longer period to secure funding. Similarly, projects centered on “education” (β = 2154.00 with p -value <0.001) and “financial services” (β = 95.42 with p -value <0.001) also show an increased funding duration. Conversely, themes like “community development,” “energy,” and “water and sanitation” exhibit negative coefficients, indicating a reduction in funding time. Specifically, projects with themes related to “community development” (β = −2991.00 with a p -value <0.001) and “water and sanitation” (β = −2828.00 with a p -value <0.001) are likely to see their funding time decrease, exhibiting the most substantial decrease in funding time. “Energy”-related projects (β = −982.50 with a p -value <0.001) also tend to have a shorter funding duration. This variation in funding times depending on the subject matter shows that particular areas of focus within the sphere of crowdfunding acquire financial assistance at different rates than others. It is possible that initiatives that fall under the categories of “agriculture,” “education,” and “financial services” will take a longer time to accumulate the necessary cash. This could be because of the nature or scale of these projects. On the other hand, organizations that come under the categories of “community development,” “energy,” and “water and sanitation” appear to receive financial support more quickly. This may reflect the fact that these themes are considered high priority or urgent by their respective lenders, thanks to the use of SDGs as a lens. Our analysis of control variables reveals other factors that impact funding time for lending-based prosocial crowdfunding campaigns. For both the funded amount (β = −0.07 with a p -value <0.001) and the total number of lenders (β = −3.00 with a p -value <0.001), a negative coefficient was found, indicating a shorter funding time, which is a favorable result in our study. This suggests that fewer lenders and greater funding targets are linked to faster funding. The intricate nature of group dynamics in financing is highlighted by the positive coefficient for the total count of teams (β =33.45 with a p -value <0.001), despite its tendency to increase funding time. Sector-wise, negative coefficients in industries like. food (β = −975.90 with a p -value <0.001) and housing (β = −231.10 with a p -value <0.001) suggest a faster funding procedure, whereas positive coefficients for construction (β =203.00 with a p -value <0.001) and entertainment (β =218.40 with a p -value <0.001) indicate lengthier funding timeframes. In spite of their positive coefficients, the factors of flexible fundraising enabled (β =380.30 with a p -value <0.001) and currency exchange loss lenders (β =83.99 with a p -value <0.001) show a possible trade-off between the advantages of flexible financing possibilities and the dangers of currency exchange. The borrower count has a slight negative effect (β = −14.28 with a p -value <0.001), indicating that having more borrowers is beneficial in shortening funding time. Finally, a positive coefficient (β =27.47 with a p -value <0.001) for lender repayment duration may suggest lengthier funding periods, suggesting that lenders would prefer shorter repayment terms.  5 Discussion This work aimed to investigate what influence the presence of SDG-related issues in project descriptions could have in backers' decision to finance lending-based prosocial crowdfunding campaigns. We analyzed 2,060,871 campaigns using a topic model and a Poisson regression analysis to assess the influence of SDG-related topics in the financing times of campaigns. Our findings indicate that certain themes, including community development (SDG11: sustainable cities and communities), energy (SDG7: affordable and clean energy), and water and sanitation (SDG6: clean water and sanitation) lead to shorter financing times for crowdfunding campaigns. When it comes to pushing agendas that are focused on urgent global concerns, these areas are crucial, and they can boost lenders' willingness to support activities related to these challenges. Therefore, when collecting money in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding these aspects should be highlighted in the project descriptions. On the other hand, themes such as agriculture (SDG2: zero hunger, SDG12: responsible consumption and production; SDG15: life on land), education (SDG4: quality education), and financial services (SDG8: decent work and economic growth; SDG10: reduced inequality) lead to an increase in funding time. Although they are essential to long-term sustainability and economic resilience, they are less valued by backers. As a result, these themes might not stressed in such crowdfunding campaigns. Overall, these outcomes produce interesting insights for scholars, managers, and policymakers, as detailed below. 5.1 Theoretical contributions Firstly, this article contributes to signaling theory in terms of crowdfunding, in particular enriching our understating of which signals are effective in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, where backers are motivated by a mix of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations (Chen et al., 2021 ; Deci & Ryan, 2000 ; Galak et al., 2011 ; Steigenberger & Wilhelm, 2018 ). In particular, we have highlighted that signals related to SDG themes are crucial to determine the success of such campaigns, thanks to increasing public awareness of grand challenges (Goergen & Rondi, 2019 ) and SDGs (Guterres, 2022 ; Suárez Giri & Sánchez Chaparro, 2023 ). In addition, we have provided evidence that while some SDG themes have a positive effect on success, others have a negative effect, demonstrating that not all SDGs are considered equally by backers. In summary, the theoretical contribution of this research is focused on integrating SDGs into lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, using a signaling theory lens. Crowdfunding projects that employ SDGs as powerful signals could attract investors interested in environmental and social issues more rapidly. This congruence not only increases the appeal of projects for prospective investors but also strengthens the legitimacy of fundraising efforts. This study proposes that SDGs might act as unique signaling mechanisms that aid in the comprehension and effectiveness of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding efforts, offering a viable path for jointly solving global concerns.  5.2 Practical implications These results also provide useful insights for practitioners and policymakers. Indeed, we have highlighted the finding that references to SDG themes in project descriptions may have positive or negative effects on lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, thus providing detailed insights to favor the success of the campaigns in such a context. Our research underscores the significance of adding a sustainable framework, such as SDGs, in order to improve understanding of the dynamics involved in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding. In other words, highlighting the presence of specific SDG themes can favor the success of these fundraising campaigns, providing a useful suggestion for raising money. Specifically, in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, it might be effective to make themes related to community development, energy, and water and sanitation emerge clearly in project descriptions. This understanding may be of assistance to practitioners in the process of strategically building and marketing crowdfunding campaigns that not only match global sustainability objectives but also successfully connect with the financial and ethical motivations of prospective supporters. By linking their ideas with SDGs, entrepreneurs may use these global goals as persuasive signals when seeking funding, which increases their enterprises' attractiveness and legitimacy. This strategy not only promotes financial success but also helps entrepreneurs contribute constructively to global concerns by putting their projects at the forefront of entrepreneurship. For policymakers, our findings emphasize the importance of fostering an ecosystem that supports SDG-aligned entrepreneurship. By understanding how SDGs can act as powerful signals in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, policymakers can design and implement frameworks that encourage the use of SDGs in entrepreneurial ventures. Such policies would not only stimulate economic growth but also ensure that this growth aligns with broader social and environmental objectives, promoting sustainable development at various levels of governance. Furthermore, since crowdfunding is a growing alternative form of financing, these results might be useful to favor the success of entrepreneurial activities and consequently the economic development of nations.   6 Conclusions Through the use of topic modeling techniques with the vast Kiva database, we were able to identify the primary themes that were present in lending-based prosocial crowdfunding campaigns. We conducted an analysis to bring out the SDG themes that characterize such topics in project descriptions and to assess their effect on the success of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding. In particular, our outcomes offer a comprehensive view of the factors that contribute to greater speed in reaching set monetary goals. Indeed, communicating how one's entrepreneurial activity may be beneficial in terms of certain SDG themes might align the perspective of lenders with the overarching goals of sustainable development that permeate society in general, leading to lending-based prosocial crowdfunding success. In this manner we have enriched understanding of the phenomenon and provided interesting insights for a wide audience of scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged, but these also pave the way for possible future developments. While the sample size is sufficiently large to support the generalizability of our findings, the data were sourced exclusively from Kiva. Future research could enhance the robustness of these findings by utilizing data from multiple crowdfunding platforms. Additionally, this study focuses on lending-based prosocial crowdfunding, which is particularly receptive in prosocial projects. Future studies should explore whether the tendencies observed here also apply to other types of crowdfunding and determine if the success factors highlighted in this study are unique features of lending-based prosocial crowdfunding or a broader phenomenon in the crowdfunding landscape. In addition, future research could also explore the mechanisms that lead some SDG themes to have negative effects on crowdfunding success. We hope that by starting conversations regarding the relationship between SDGs and crowdfunding we can improve both academic and management discourse about it. This study is expected to increase our knowledge of policy dynamics that combine SDG interventions with the regional features of sponsored projects. Furthermore, it opens up new study avenues by connecting geographical characteristics with local socioeconomic and environmental concerns. Such findings might lead to more specialized interventions and targeted financial support for entrepreneurship, encouraging a nuanced approach to addressing distinct regional requirements.
