                  The Sustainable Development Goals are a set of 17 wide ranging goals that articulates the desired outcome of sustainable development. The private sector is a key factor in achieving these goals through actions of corporate sustainability. However, there is a paucity of research regarding the application of Sustainable Development Goals at the firm level and it remains unclear how the private sector can operationalise and achieve the goals through corporate sustainability. While every Sustainable Development Goal is deemed of equal importance, it is up to individual firms to interpret and prioritise their implementation. Using a case study approach, this paper identified the specific goals considered by Japanese manufacturing multinational enterprises as a priority when establishing or significantly expanding operations in developing countries. The methodology employed allowed the retrospective analysis of corporate sustainability data through a Sustainable Development Goal lens. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 58 respondents from 16 sample firms operating in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The results show the multinational enterprises in the sample focus on a particular set of Sustainable Development Goals when establishing, or significantly expanding, subsidiary operations in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The findings show policy makers in the host countries should ensure Sustainable Development Goals such as education and strong institutions are in place to attract multinational enterprises to their shores. Other stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations and the community were also seen to influence the prioritisation of certain goals considered by firms.

They provide “a more universally accepted understanding of sustainability” (Hacking, 2018 , p. 4) and cover a wide spectrum of SD related issues (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ). The private sector is a key factor in achieving these goals (Salvia et al., 2019 ; Topple et al., 2017 ). The private sector engages in SD through actions such as cleaner production, provision of decent work and economic growth (Ike et al., 2019 ; UNDESA, 2019 ). These actions are collectively described as corporate sustainability (CS) and may be viewed as a subset of SD (Ashrafi et al., 2018 ; Ike et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the private sector can operationalise and achieve the SDGs through CS (Sullivan et al., 2018 ). Hacking (2018 , p. 2) states that one of the “key challenges remaining are ... how to connect the SDGs, set at a global level, to the local-level”. One of the issues appears to be the extremely broad, albeit comprehensive, coverage of the SDGs. The 17 SDGs detailed in Fig. 1   are all deemed to be of equal importance, and it is suggested by the United Nations that they should be implemented as a whole (Weitz et al., 2018 ). A range of sustainability initiatives, guidelines and standards provide guidance and directions at the organisational level on actions that may be implemented (Borgert et al., 2018b ; Ranängen et al., 2018 ). However, it is still up to the firm to interpret and prioritise such actions (Ranängen et al., 2018 ). Indeed, this prioritisation is affected by the context, for example the country in which the analysis is centred (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ), the regulatory or standards frameworks directing firms (Donovan et al., 2017b ; Ike et al., 2018 ), or the culture of the stakeholders (Chapman and Shigetomi, 2018 ). While literature has begun to emerge on tools to assist prioritisation at the national level (for example, see Caiado et al., 2018 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ), there is a paucity of research studying the prioritisation of SDGs at a local (Hacking, 2018 ; Leal Filho et al., 2018 ) or firm level (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). The knowledge gap is partially a result of the recency of the SDGs. While some firms have begun incorporating them into their reporting (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ), they are nevertheless not yet ubiquitous in the CS parlance within firms. Furthermore, there is a paucity of empirical studies showing evidence of actual SDGs being considered a priority, and being engaged with, by firms. This research aims to contribute to filling this knowledge gap by investigating which SDGs are important to Japanese multinational enterprises (MNEs) when establishing or expanding operations. A case study approach is taken, framing the existing management viewpoints on CS in the context of the SDGs. These management viewpoints are important in determining the internal and external influences that shape organisational SD processes. It is hoped that by determining these factors, it will assist policy makers, local communities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other stakeholders to actively assist in practices that contribute towards the SDGs. A case study approach allows “rich data collection” (Acquier et al., 2016 , p. 628), as well as in-depth analysis of current practices and the management decision-making process (Borgert et al., 2018b ). A literature review is carried out below, followed by a discussion of the background of the case study samples. The methodology will then be presented, followed by the findings, discussion and conclusion. 1.1 Sustainable development and the private sector While the SDGs have only recently been introduced, there is a significant body of literature examining the integration of SD at the private sector firm level through the concept of CS (Ashrafi et al., 2018 ; Chang et al., 2017 ). Much of the extant literature can be traced back to the publication of the Brundtland Report (World Commission on Environment Development, 1987 ), which originally defined SD incorporating a “triple bottom line” view of sustainability (Antolín-López et al., 2016 ; Engert et al., 2016 ). It is posited, however, that SD, and consequentially CS, cannot be simply treated as three separate dimensions of the environment, society and economy (Aras et al., 2018 ). This treatment of sustainability as three distinct dimensions may have led to the somewhat fragmented development of CS research. There is a notable body of work concentrating on the environmental aspects of CS (for example, see Z. Wang et al., 2018 ; Xu and Lin, 2017 ), others on the social aspect of CS, typically in the vein of corporate social responsibility (CSR) (for example, see Luo et al., 2017 ; Pisani et al., 2017 ), and yet others on the economic impacts and outcomes of CS (for example, see Alshehhi et al., 2018 ; Xiao et al., 2018 ). The number of such papers reflects the fragmented approach to examining CS from a non-holistic perspective. In advancing the debate on sustainability beyond the three dimensions, and the increasing realisation for a greater need for integration (for example, see Rodríguez-Serrano et al., 2017 ; Schrippe and Ribeiro, 2019 ), a significant amount of research has been generated on the definitional aspects (Zollo et al., 2013 ). While the debate still continues on “what” constitutes CS (Antolín-López et al., 2016 ; Chang et al., 2017 ), an important observation was made by Montiel and Delgado-Ceballos (2014)  that the private sector was a key driver for this definitional activity. This has led to research such as by Ike et al. (2019)  in understanding CS from a management viewpoint. In conjunction with the definitional debates on “what” constitutes CS, there is also a growing body of literature revolving around defining and implementing indicators to measure sustainability performance of firms (for example, see Jiang et al., 2018 ; Schrippe and Ribeiro, 2019 ). To this end, guidelines and standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indicators have proved beneficial in providing an international framework for corporate sustainability assessment (Chang et al., 2017 ; Donovan et al., 2017b ). Nevertheless, the context dependency and lack of integration to accounting and management control continues to pose challenges (Maas et al., 2016 ). Another delineation that can be made with CS literature is around the significant number of papers related to the motives for, or “why”, the private sector to adopt sustainable behaviour beyond purely economic benefits. Many connect CS motives to theories of the firm, such as stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, agency theory, and the resource-based view theory (Aras et al., 2018 ; Lozano et al., 2015 ). Other frameworks such as the paradox theory have been applied when relating CS to ethical and justice issues (for example, see Hahn et al., 2018 ; Ivory and Brooks, 2017 ). As early as 2013, Zollo et al. (2013)  were calling for the need to move from the “what” and “why” questions, to understanding the “how” question. They pointed to a paucity in research on “the processes through which firms actually navigate the multiple change requirements to identify, experiment with, and eventually realize more sustainable models of the enterprise” (Zollo et al., 2013 , p. 242). This is reinforced in more recent times by Chang et al. (2017)  who state that knowing “what” should be done, does not necessarily lead to the acceptance of sustainability by the private sector. It is important to leverage the knowledge of “why” the private sector engages in CS into “how” more firms may implement more sustainable practices. It is also important to grasp the influencing factors such as international commitments by headquarters to global standards or best practices have on the adoption of CS. In order to achieve this, the current practices of the private sector from the management viewpoint in implementing CS, and consequentially SD, need to be understood.  1.2 From sustainable development to the SDGs The recent implementation of the SDGs presents a distinct challenge for the private sector in implementing SD through CS. While contributing greatly to “what” constitutes sustainability by effectively providing a comprehensive definition (Hacking, 2018 ), it represents a daunting array of potential actions that may be undertaken from the MNEs’ viewpoint. Research is increasingly starting to investigate this dilemma by examining different influencing factors, focal areas, and processes for how the private sector engages with and prioritises SD and the SDGs. From the perspective of different influencing factors and focal areas, the research by Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018)  is particularly insightful. They investigated which SDGs MNEs engage with, as well as salient factors such as the MNE's home country, host countries and industry sector. While they found MNEs in their study engaged with all of the SDGs to some extent, the SDGs that were rated as being “moderately engaged” or greater were Goal 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions , Goal 5: Gender Equality , Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth , Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production , Goal 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal , Goal 4: Quality Education , Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy , Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being , Goal 13: Climate Action , and Goal 10: Reduced Inequality  (in decreasing order of engagement). While providing important insights, their research is limited to MNEs based in Europe and the United States of America. Furthermore, no distinctions were made regarding the host countries that these MNEs operated in, only the number of different host countries related to the MNE. The study by Salvia et al. (2019)  also provides insights into different focal SDGs, drawing on the views of 266 “specialists” from around the world. They found that Goal 4: Quality Education, Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities  and Goal 13: Climate Action  were the most researched and emphasised amongst the individuals surveyed, while Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth , Goal 14: Life Below Water , and Goal 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions  were the least ‘popular’ in terms of research. It should be noted that over 80% of the “specialists” were connected to universities or research organisations, and fewer than 17% were connected to the private sector. While interesting in providing potential focal areas within the SDGs, this study is nevertheless limited in terms of the insights it can offer into private sector practices. One promising area of research that moves beyond broader influencing factors and potential focal SDGs, is the use of materiality analysis by the private sector. This is primarily connected with the GRI reporting guidelines, and is a method through which the private sector engages with both internal and external stakeholders to determine the most salient or ‘material’ sustainability issues to be considered (Borgert et al., 2018a ; Donovan et al., 2017b ). Materiality analysis has largely been a voluntary process implemented by firms committed to the GRI standards (Topple et al., 2017 ), although recent initiatives in the Asia Pacific region, have also seen countries like Malaysia regulate its use by listed companies (Bursa Malaysia, 2018 ). Most recently, Ranängen et al. (2018)  presents the use of materiality analysis in determining the importance of specific SDGs. They apply the analysis through workshops with two Swedish municipalities, with Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation , Goal 13: Climate Action, Goal 14: Life Below Water , and Goal 15: Life on Land  appearing to be identified as the most important. They argue materiality analysis allows the inclusion of a wide range of stakeholder needs, an observation reinforced by Borgert et al. (2018a)  and Donovan et al. (2017b)  from a private sector perspective. Materiality analysis may offer a practical tool to deal with the complex problem presented by the interconnectedness of the SDGs. The need for a multi-stakeholder, system view of SDG analysis due to the way the goals interact and impact on each other in different ways is described by Weitz et al. (2018) . As an accepted practice often included in the sustainability reports of many MNEs (Donovan et al., 2017b ), prioritising the SDGs using materiality analysis may be an area into which more research is warranted. While these different studies have started to open avenues into potential influencing factors and processes used by the private sector, there remains a distinct paucity of literature addressing a fuller range of influencing factors such as local laws and commitments by MNEs to different sustainability standards. This is particularly in the context of the prioritisation of the SDGs by the private sector. This may not be surprising given the nascent stage of development of SDG related research. Nevertheless, as the latest development in the field of SD from a theoretical standpoint, at the private sector firm level, the knowledge gaps identified for CS are as relevant for SDGs as they are to SD. It is a question of “how” SDGs can be operationalised through prioritisation, and what external and internal factors influence their adoption. This paper directly engages with this challenge, contributing to filling this knowledge gap through investigating how Japanese MNEs are prioritising their CS activities when establishing or significantly expanding their operations in overseas subsidiaries.   2 Background of sample The SDGs are set to alleviate issues that beset developing countries (Leal Filho et al., 2018 ), such as poverty, gender inequality, and poor health (Cobbinah et al., 2015 ). In order to achieve the SDGs however, significant financial input is required, the very thing that developing countries lack (Leal Filho et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, “sustainability research in the developing world lags behind the research performed in developed countries, creating knowledge gaps that require attention” (Leal Filho et al., 2018 , p. 132). The challenges are further compounded when a developing country is located in an ecologically significant and sensitive region, and is undergoing rapid industrialisation and urbanisation (Ike et al., 2019 ). Such a confluence of a multidimensional sustainability challenges is found in the developing countries of the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam (PITV) (ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity, 2017 ). Home to a combined total of over 517 million people, they are among the most populous in Southeast Asia, yet with some of the lowest GDP per capita in the region (ASEAN, 2016 ; World Bank, 2018 ). Manufacturing MNEs are of specific concern in the PITV from a sustainability perspective. They use significant amounts of water and energy, as well as generating waste material and pollutants (Abdul-Rashid et al., 2017 ; Ike et al., 2019 ). Fossil fuels are the primary source of energy in the region leading to significant greenhouse gas emissions (Lee et al., 2017 ; Saboori and Sulaiman, 2013 ; Xu and Lin, 2017 ). Japanese MNEs are significant participants in the PITV as part of their globalisation strategy for the region (Edgington and Hayter, 2016 ). This is evidenced by the PITV being hosts to over 1000 Japanese manufacturing MNEs (Japan External Trade Organization, 2017 ). According to a recent survey by the Japan External Trade Organization (2017) , some 35% of manufacturing companies operating in the PTIV planned to expand production capacities in these countries in the coming years. Given these factors, understanding the CS prioritisation activities of Japanese Manufacturing MNEs when establishing, or significantly expanding, their subsidiary operation in the PITV, provides a compelling case study for identifying the relevant SDGs at the firm level.  3 Methodology The research for this paper was carried out in four phases as shown in Fig. 2  . Phase one involved the identification of the research problem, carrying out the literature review and identifying the appropriate research philosophy and approach. Phase two consisted of collecting both the primary and secondary data through interviews and website searches. Phase three involved qualitative analysis of the data that was collected, before mapping the findings onto the SDGs in the final phase. The collection and analysis of the primary and secondary data occurred between March 2014 and December 2017. This research takes an exploratory approach in seeking to identify how CS issues are prioritised by the subsidiaries of Japanese MNEs when establishing or expanding their operations. As CS issues themselves are not concrete concepts, but open to interpretation by the management of the MNEs (Ike et al., 2019 ), an interpretive philosophy (Saunders et al., 2015 ) is adopted in this paper and reflects recent work by Morioka and Carvalho (2016) , Schrippe and Ribeiro (2018) , and Borgert et al. (2018a) . The research in this paper is inductive, developing an understanding of the motives of management in prioritising certain CS issues within their operations. For such inductive work, a case study approach was most appropriate in obtaining in-depth data required for this investigation (Chassé and Boiral, 2016 ; Jasiński et al., 2016 ). Semi-structured interviews were chosen as the method for primary data collection in phase one to allow flexibility for the interviewers to adapt to specific company situations. It also allows for deeper exploration of particular topics of interest to the respondents (Ike et al., 2019 ; Jasiński et al., 2016 ). Japanese manufacturing MNEs operating in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region were selected using a non-probabilistic purposive sampling approach described by Hosseini et al. (2017) . Three criteria were required to be met by the MNEs in the sample. The first was that the size of investment by the MNE in the subsidiary was greater than US$20 million, increasing the probability the operations had a noticeable impact on the area in which they were located. The second condition was that the company published sustainability reports on their corporate website(s). Finally, the subsidiary had to have been established, or significantly expanded in the preceding five years. The MNEs approached were requested to provide up to four participants in charge of, or familiar with CS related activities within the company. Sixteen companies responded to the requests, providing a total of 47 individuals at the subsidiary level (Table 1  ). Interviews were typically carried out face to face at the company premise, or over the telephone where this was not possible. Interviews ran from between 45 and 90 minutes and the interview guidelines are provided in the Appendix. The distribution of companies approximate findings by the Japan External Trade Organization (2016) , with Thailand and Vietnam having the largest presence of Japanese MNEs, and Indonesia/Philippines having a smaller exposure. Headquarter companies were also approached for interviews. Japanese parent companies and/or regional head office interviews were granted and carried out as shown on Table 2  . Transcripts were taken from recordings where allowed by the company, or from hand written notes where this was not possible. The transcripts were then sent to the interviewees for confirmation and editing. Phase two involved the collection of secondary data from corporate websites of the MNEs interviewed. Numerous studies related to CS topics have successfully used this approach to allow triangulation of results (for example, see Muñoz-Villamizar et al., 2018 ; Silva et al., 2018 ), as well as finding differences and nuances to yield additional information (Doolin, 1996 ). Sustainability reports, CSR reports and annual reports were taken from respective company websites, both at the headquarter and subsidiary level where they existed. Other publicly available collateral on the internet was searched for using the company name in combination with keywords including “CSR”, “community”, “society”, “sustainability” and “environment”. In the third phase, QSR's NVivo 11 (QSR International ) was used for coding, in a process largely synonymous to that described by Lei et al. (2017) . The first stage of data familiarisation was carried out by the research team members reading and re-reading the transcripts. Initial coding schemes were then discussed and developed, and the coding applied to the data. Multiple meetings were then held to iteratively refine the themes (Lei et al., 2017 ). The qualitative analysis of the data allowed the identification of the main CS issues considered by the MNEs at establishment or major expansion of their subsidiary operations. Further, the importance and priorities placed on these issues were identified. This allowed the construction of a decision-making process flowchart for the prioritised CS issues considered by the organisations involved in this research. In the fourth phase, the elements of the process flowchart were mapped to the SDGs by the research team to allow the identification of SDGs considered important at the establishment or significant expansion of the subsidiary operations of Japanese manufacturing MNEs. This was achieved using a mental mapping technique utilised by Hockerts (2015) , Ferreira et al. (2016) , and Dos Santos et al. (2019) , as the CS issues identified did not have a one-to-one correspondence with the SDGs. Each SDG was studied to identify a relationship with the CS issues identified in the process flowchart.  4 Findings and discussion The interviews with the Japanese MNEs in this study give insight into the importance they place on various CS related issues. While each company displayed individual processes and methods, there were some commonalities identified. It is important to note that the CS related issues were based on the management's interpretation of CS (Ike et al., 2019 ), as the private sector appear to be spearheading the development of the CS concept (Montiel and Delgado-Ceballos, 2014 ). As recognised by Donovan et al. (2017a)  in their wide ranging study of manufacturing MNEs in Thailand, fundamental business decisions were noted to be of primary importance before the consideration of CS issues. This was illustrated starkly by the respondent at the headquarters of Company A:“Basically for investment, the first consideration is if there a business opportunity for us. If there is no business opportunity, we cannot invest … So we communicate with various customers, and sales might be good or not, and based on such information, for example if there was a local factory we can be close to the customers, our communications would be good, deliveries would be more cost effective; and as we look back over the years, we see sales growth, business growth, the market in Indonesia growing - we start to see these. This becomes the first point of deciding on investment” (Company A)   It should be noted however that business considerations run concurrently with the product's social impact, that is the benefit to be brought to the host country and society at large. The aspects of being close to the customers, being more affordable, shorter delivery lead times and better communications mentioned are all elements of benefiting the consumer. Donovan et al. (2017b)  also observed that in addition to the basic financials of the business proposition of establishing the subsidiary, companies considered local issues such as availability of human resources. The respondent from the headquarters of Company F gives credence to this finding, stating:“… when deciding [on the location]. It is a balanced assessment. Even if there is abundant labour force it cannot be considered if there is no benefit from country's legal structure, foreign investment [benefits]. On the other hand, even if there are many such things, it cannot be chosen if there is no labour force. Having both is the ideal location” (Company F)   It appears then, that along with social benefit of the product, the availability of human resources is the second main consideration. It should be noted that these may not necessarily be sequential but are amongst some of the first CS issues to be considered. It should also be noted that these deliberations happen in parallel to the business considerations. It was also made clear by the managers in the sample MNEs, that it is insufficient merely to have sufficient labour, but they must be appropriately skilled. MNEs may need to look at alternative sources of skilled labour, which may be located in neighbouring countries other than the host country. Beyond this point, the interview data suggests a combination of local regulatory and other stakeholder concerns are brought into consideration. Once again, this is generally in line with the observations made by Donovan et al. (2017b) . Table 3   summarises the ways in which MNEs in the sample met the various CS challenges identified. In order, these were found to be the use of industrial estates (Companies A, B, D, E, F, H, J, M, O, and P), situating the factory in a remote location (Companies G, J, K, L, and N) and engaging the local community (Company C, G, and N). It should be noted that these strategies are not mutually exclusive, as exemplified by company J which selected an industrial estate in a remote location. 4.1 Industrial estates The most common way the companies in the study dealt with environmental concerns in the location of their subsidiary, was through the use of industrial estates (Companies A, B, D, E, F, H, J, M, O, and P). Most of these companies expressed a view that the ready-made nature of industrial estates from a physical and policy perspective means that only a basic environmental impact assessment was required during their application procedure. Company A is typical of these companies in minimising the issues with planning approvals and environmental assessments in the host country:“… we would mitigate the risk by assessing and selecting by constructing in industrial parks which the local municipality is trying to attract foreign investment to … There was no problem by the planning approval, because it is located in an industrial zone” (Company A)   A similar view was expressed by company H:“… we consider about the environment and decided to establish the operation within the industrial estate” (Company H)   It is apparent in the view of these companies that industrial zones not only remove any complications and delays of environmental assessments, but that they are also responding to an active solicitation from the host country to establish in those locations. Such solicitations and incentives may include simplified import and export procedures, working visas and tax holidays (for example, see PEZA, n.d. ). The other implication from these observations is that the site is selected prior to any regulatory assessments being carried out. In addition to the benefits from the environmental management aspect, there is a benefit identified in that industrial estates will not affect local community and urban infrastructures. A typical view was expressed by interviewees at Company E regarding the avoidance of local community issues:“We are [established in] the industrial estate so that we haven't [had to be] concerned about these issues because our surrounding is factories. We have done everything under the regulation of the Ministry of Industry. Any enquiry of the community is the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry … It's already a framework so that you can just go in and do your business” (Company E)   Again, the attraction of a ready-made location to “just go in and do your business” as this respondent from Company E stated, is evident. It can be seen that the responsibility for any issues with the local community are passed on to the local government body. While not completely absolving the MNE from being responsible to this aspect of CS, it nevertheless makes the assessment of the suitability of the location much easier by avoiding the need for a full sustainability assessment. When faced with a choice of industrial estates in the same country or region, business reasons such as logistics and supply chain constraints, as well as communications came into play. In the case of Company O, one estate 30 km away from Hanoi was going to be easier to obtain approval for when they established. However, in the end they chose one in Hanoi itself, as it would be easier to communicate and obtain support from government offices (Company O). There are cases, however, where the selection of a specific industrial estate went beyond simple business requirements. This is exemplified by Company A which selected an industrial estate developed by a Japanese MNE:“In the case of Indonesia, we leased land in an industrial park developed by a certain Japanese company so there was no problem” (Company A)   In this case, the respondent was from the headquarter office in Japan. It indicated a desire to mitigate risks by selecting an industrial park developed by a Japanese company, so that they felt assured of the quality of the compliance with all requirements. The words “so there was no problem” (Company A) infers that there may be issues with non-Japanese construction projects, or it may simply be an issue where communication is easier with a Japanese counterpart. In another example, Company J gave up on a preferred site, as the industrial estate selected by them came under accusations from NGOs of having been developed in an environmentally protected area. While the first site would obviously have suited the company economically, environmental concerns meant that the company was willing to establish at a different, more sustainable location. This shows how MNEs do take issues beyond pure business acumen into consideration when selecting locations.  4.2 Remote locations Another way in which MNEs could avoid issues of adversely affecting local communities was by locating in remote areas far from urbanisation. Local governments can also be more accommodating in order to bring more business to the local area. The respondent at Companies G stated:“Forty five years ago, it is like there was no local community but empty field … We do not want to have a new project in the midst of local area because it is quite uncomfortable for complaining, especially in some local areas, the problems with local government are quite serious and we are trying to avoid that. We have to check the factors affecting the local people growth because the local community will expand until reaching us” (Company G)   Remote locations may however pose logistics and supply chain issues from a business perspective. Furthermore, remote locations in themselves may be ecologically sensitive, as previous developments may have not affected wildlife habitats. Company J faced such an issue when they selected an industrial estate in a remote location to minimise all risks connected to approvals. However, the industrial park that was initially selected came under allegations that it was built on environmentally sensitive land, and they were forced change their plans. Occasionally the government will play a part in forcing a specific company away from urbanised areas due to predicted issues on the local communities. Company N is an example of this situation where the respondent explains:“The recent zoning plan of [the local] People's Committee does not encourage this production industry as it may create dust and noise. In fact, the production of the company does not create environmental pollution … There is little noise and sound that might have negative impacts to the city” (Company N)   Nevertheless, they perceived noise and dust problems meant the company could not get permission to operate closer to the transport infrastructures they needed. They compromised their commercial benefits in order to meet the CS demands of the locale and established further away in a remote region.  4.3 Local community involvement If establishing in an industrial estate or remote area is not a viable option, then the local community must be lobbied and satisfied of the benefits and safety of the subsidiary operation. This is illustrated in the case of Company C, who established a new factory in a developed area. The respondent from Company C states:“The support of the local government was an important issue for us. When we were starting, I personally requested a meeting with the mayor. The agenda was just to inform him about our plans. Just to get a feel of the perspective that they may have having such a facility in the locality. We told them about the employment opportunities and hopefully some conditions that can give them a better life in the future” (Company C)   This underlines the importance of MNEs to understand the political, as well as legal structure and hierarchies in the locale. The impact to the constituencies need to be cast in a positive light, highlighting the CS benefits that will be brought to the community. The respondent went on to explain:“We had a third party to do the details for us. It's an environmental consultancy group. They do the scoping of the community. There are clearances that they secure from the barangays, it is part of the requirement; the documentations, water, surveys and air. We have to refer [the consultants] to the community, because we know the barangay captains, home owners. So it was also through our people that they were able to access the correct people. They put together the documentation of the Environmental Impact Assessment. On an informal basis, we practically know these people, the homeowners, the officers, the local government officials, barangay captain, police stations, Bureau of Fire” (Company C)   This indicates the importance of local social networking in addition to basic business acumen when locating subsidiaries in close proximity to residential areas. The implication is that for situations such as this, it is critical for MNEs to engage local, well-connected individuals to lobby on behalf of the MNE. Without knowing the correct influential individuals, there is a likelihood that the application to establish the subsidiary will be rejected.  4.4 Prioritisation process at the establishment or expansion phase In summarising the preceding sections, a process of prioritisation of the CS issues can be constructed. The process model is shown in Fig. 3  . Upon finding a potential location:1. The MNE looks at the benefit they can bring to the host country through their product or through being located there.  2. The availability of a suitably skilled workforce is considered next.  3. Specific building sites are then considered with minimal risks of rejection from the host country regulatory authorities. These have been found to be industrial estates or remote locations. Where neither of these are possible, skilled negotiators with local knowledge and personal connections are required to lobby the local administrative authority and their constituents to enable the establishment to proceed.  4. After the specific sites have been selected, the formal application process to the regulatory authorities begin, and undertaking of government mandated impact assessment. This impact assessment process may include further community consultation.    Once the local stakeholders agree, the physical construction process may begin.  4.5 Mapping corporate sustainability issues to SDGs The elements of CS issues identified in the previous sections were analysed by the research team to identify alignment with the SDGs. This allows elucidation of which SDGs are considered by Japanese manufacturing MNEs when establishing or expanding the overseas operations in the ASEAN region. The first CS issue considered by the entire sample was related to whether there is a positive impact to the society by establishing the subsidiary. Japanese manufacturing MNEs can provide benefits beyond basic wages through bonuses and good working conditions (Ike et al., 2019 ). The MNEs can further contribute to economic growth of the host country through increased supply chain activities such as logistics, local suppliers and exports (Kida and Fukikura, 2015 ). These issues are most closely aligned with Target 8.1  for growth of gross domestic product per capita, Target 8.5  relating to hourly earnings of employees, and Target 8.8  which relates to worker safety (UNDESA, 2019 ). These targets form part of Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth  (UNDESA, 2019 ). A connection to Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure , specifically Target 9.B  for domestic technology development in developing countries (UNDESA, 2019 ) can be argued with the presence of Japanese manufacturing MNEs. This is because there may be technology and manufacturing process spillovers to the host country promoting innovation (C. C. Wang and Wu, 2016 ), as well as contributing to sustainable industrial development (Li et al., 2018 ). Advanced manufacturing techniques from developed countries such as Japan, combined with the provision of more sustainable products at lower costs along with better services through local production can promote several targets contained within Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production . These include: Target 12.2  for the efficient use of natural resources; Target 12.4  for environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes; Target 12.5  for the reduction of waste generation; and Target 12.6  for encouraging large companies to adopt sustainable practices (UNDESA, 2019 ). Target 12.A  echoes Target 9.B  discussed above, for the support of developing countries to strengthen scientific and technological capabilities for sustainable consumption and production (UNDESA, 2019 ). Finally, in terms of business impact, foreign direct investment (FDI) is a key indicator of Target 17.3  to mobilise additional financial resources for developing countries. Target 17.3  is a component of Goal 17: Partnership to Achieve the Goal.  As such, the goal forms a relationship with MNEs establishing their operations in host countries (UNDESA, 2019 ). The managers in the sample MNEs emphasised the need for a skilled and educated workforce. This connects directly to Target 4.3  for affordable, quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, and Target 4.4  for increasing the number of youths and adults who have relevant technical and vocational skills (UNDESA, 2019 ). These targets are contained within Goal 4: Quality Education  and highlights the need for host countries to provide necessary education to its working populace in order to attract MNEs from Japan. In terms of the use of industrial estates, there is a connection to management of wastewater and hazardous wastes management, although according to Kida and Fukikura (2015)  the effectiveness and regulatory enforcements vary within the ASEAN region. Nevertheless, industrial estates present clear connections to Target 14.1  for preventing and reducing marine pollution from land-based activities contained in Goal 14: Life Below Water  (UNDESA, 2019 ). Furthermore, industrial estates show an attempt by the host country government to manage environmental impact, air quality and waste management of cities, which are all elements of Target 11.6  contained within Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities  (UNDESA, 2019 ). Selection of remote locations by MNEs for their subsidiaries can similarly alleviate possible pollution effects to nearby communities and again are connected to Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities . The connection is further strengthened by Target 11.A  which calls for strengthening of regional development planning (UNDESA, 2019 ). Finally, local community involvement in the decision-making process to locate factories are part of participatory planning which forms Target 11.3  (UNDESA, 2019 ) contained within Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities . The relationship between the sample MNEs, their CS considerations at establishment or major expansion, and the corresponding SDGs are shown in Fig. 4  .  4.6 Comparison of priority SDGs in different contexts Building on the findings above, comparisons can be made of SDGs considered in other contexts of business. Extant literature indicates firms do not consider all SDGs with the same importance. In terms of policy proposals directing the actions of firms, as well as understanding perceptions of different actors, it is important to understand which SDGs are considered important in various situations. Kourula et al. (2017)  conducted a wide-ranging review of research published in international business and management journals and categorised them according to the SDGs. Their findings indicate the literature in this field considers Goal 1: No Poverty , Goal 2: Zero Hunger , Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy , Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Goal 10: Reduced Inequality, Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, Goal 13: Climate Action , and Goal 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal . In contrast, Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018)  found top European and American MNEs engaged with a slightly different set of SDGs. These were Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, Goal 4: Quality Education, Goal 5: Gender Equality, Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, Goal 15: Life on Land, Goal 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions , and Goal 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal.  This is important, as international business and management research may not be focussing on SDGs that are considered important by major participants in the business world. It is also useful to understand the views of the Japanese society on the SDGs, to see if there are any similarities between these and the views held by the Japanese MNEs when they are establishing subsidiary operations. The study by Chapman and Shigetomi (2018)  is useful in this aspect. They find that Japanese society places importance on Goal 1: No Poverty, Goal 2: Zero Hunger, Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Goal 10: Reduced Inequality,  and Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities . Ranängen et al. (2018)  provides yet another view, this time from the public sector. Their sampling of Swedish municipalities gives some indication of SDGs that are considered important by governments, however these may not be applicable to developing countries. They identify Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, Goal 13: Climate Action, Goal 14: Life Below Water , and Goal 15: Life on Land.  Finally, a recent study by Salvia et al. (2019)  is presented here as an effective update to Kourula et al. (2017) . Salvia et al. (2019)  identifies the SDGs that current academic and other researchers engage with are Goal 4: Quality Education, Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,  and Goal 13: Climate Action.  This is important in identifying changes from past research work, and whether these changes alter the gap between the SDGs considered important by MNEs compared to researchers. The combined results of the above papers, as well as the findings of this paper, have been presented on Fig. 5  . It is noteworthy that every SDG is considered a priority in at least one of the contexts. Furthermore, Goal 4: Quality Education , Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth , Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure , Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities , Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production , Goal 13: Climate Action  and Goal 17: Partnerships to Achieve the Goal  are considered priorities in the most number of contexts. Academic research interests identified by Kourula et al. (2017)  and Salvia et al. (2019)  show differences in the area of Goal 1: No Poverty , Goal 2: Zero Hunger , and Goal 13: Climate Action  to those considered by MNEs as priorities. These goals appear to intersect more with the interest shown by the public sector and communities as evidenced by Chapman and Shigetomi (2018)  and Ranängen et al. (2018) . Of specific interest for this paper is the difference between U.S. and European MNEs identified by Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018) , and the Japanese MNEs in this paper. There are commonalities in Goal 4: Quality Education , Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities , Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production , and Goal 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal . While the sample MNEs in Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018)  have a much wider consideration of SDGs, they do not consider Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure  and Goal 14: Life Below Water  which the Japanese MNEs in this paper do. This may be due to the fact that the MNEs in the study does not specifically focus on subsidiary operations of MNEs, as opposed to this paper which specifically looks at the SDGs considered at the establishment of subsidiary operations.   5 Conclusions The comprehensive and wide-ranging SDGs may prove daunting for the private sector to implement in its entirety. In order to assist in its operationalisation, firms may prioritise specific goals, allowing a staged implementation. This paper illustrated, through a case study approach, how the current CS actions of private sector firms could be mapped against the SDGs, thereby enabling the identification of goals considered as a priority by them. The sample Japanese manufacturing MNEs in this study were shown to prioritise certain SDGs when establishing or significantly expanding subsidiary operation in South-East Asia. By retrospectively applying an SDG lens on CS issues, it was determined that the MNEs in the sample considered the following SDGs in their decision making process:• Goal 4: Quality Education   • Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic growth   • Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure   • Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities   • Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production   • Goal 14: Life Below Water   • Goal 17: Partnerships to Achieve the Goal     Local communities, NGOs, host country regulations and regulatory authorities were found to influence the prioritisation of certain SDGs. Therefore, host country policy makers need to ensure important elements of the SDGs, such as education and strong institutions, need to be in place to attract the economic growth and other benefits offered by MNEs. Conversely, if stakeholders such as governments, the community or NGOs, wish MNEs to consider other SDGs a priority at establishment or expansion, influencing factors such as local regulations or community action are needed to encourage or mandate this. In comparing the results of this paper to findings from other research, it was found that fewer SDGs were considered by the Japanese MNEs during the establishment phase of subsidiary operations compared to large U.S. and European MNEs. No correlation was found between the SDGs considered a priority by Japanese society and Japanese MNEs in this paper's sample. Finally, the SDGs considered a priority by Japanese MNEs in this paper were found to be in the scope of current academic research priorities, with the exception of Goal 14: Life Below Water . 5.1 Limitations and future directions A limited number of Japanese manufacturing companies were able to be interviewed in the study. Difficulties were encountered in obtaining a full set of headquarter interviews, however this was offset in most cases with comprehensive secondary data to confirm validity of the primary data. The transferability of the findings to other developing countries are not clear and require further investigation. For example, the South-East Asian countries are geographically and culturally closer to Japan than developing countries in Africa and South America. This may mean that the findings may be applicable to MNE subsidiary expansions in Laos or Cambodia. This study investigated the SDG, and consequentially SD and CS, priorities of Japanese MNEs in the establishment or major expansion phase. These priorities may change in a steady state operational phase of the subsidiary and needs further investigation. It is plausible that some of the SDGs not considered at the establishment/expansion phase are considered later, and therefore an empirical study of how these firms monitor and evaluate their operational CS performance is warranted. Likewise, further research into how sustainability actions are reported by firms will provide greater clarity on the entire process of managing sustainability.
