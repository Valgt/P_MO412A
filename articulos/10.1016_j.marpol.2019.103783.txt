                  While there have been estimates for the overall funding needs of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for specific SDGs, there has been no attempt to estimate the funding needs of SDG 14, life below water, despite an impressive mobilization of financial sources the last couple of years. This lack of resourcing estimates is likely the result of the absence of information mainly at the national level of funding devoted to SDG 14 targets and of the complexity of identifying standards and actions for measuring SDG 14 targets. Using information from the proceedings of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2017 UN Ocean Conference, this paper presents the first ever attempt to present a likely cost for saving our oceans and a likely estimate of the funding gap for implementing SDG 14 until 2030. This paper also presents an analysis of this funding gap and recommendations for bridging it. It concludes with an estimate of US$174.52 billion per year needed for the health of our oceans. Knowing the resourcing requirements, efforts can be further stepped up and better targeted by different stakeholders, contributing thus to better conservation and sustainable use of our oceans.

Keywords Sustainable development goal 14  Funding gap  Aichi targets  Convention on biological diversity  2017 UN ocean conference  Public  Private  Innovative finance    1 Introduction In 2015 the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development was adopted by the 193 UN Member States. This Agenda, made up of 17 concrete goals, the Sustainable Development Goals, provides for the economic, social and environmental sustainability of humanity. Sustainable Development Goal number 14 (SDG 14) aims to protect the health of our Ocean and to ‘conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’. 1.1 Objective and main results Four years following the adoption of SDG 14, this paper reviews the status of our Oceans and the status of SDG 14 implementation. It examines the financial sources for SDG 14 and the funding required to achieve the Goal by 2030. The paper concludes with the key message that there is a financial gap of US$149.02 billion per year. The paper shows how SDG 14 funding is related to overall biodiversity funding. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has estimated the financial needs for the Aichi targets (these correspond to the SDG 14 and SDG 15 targets) at US$ 150–440 billion per year, while currently around US$ 52 billion is spent per year on biodiversity. The funding for SDG 14 is lagging behind in a similar fashion. At the 2017 UN Ocean Conference a rough amount of US$25.5 billion was committed for SDG 14, while this report estimates that the funding needs of the Goal are averagely at US$ 174.52 billion per year.  1.2 Background Our Ocean is vital for our ecosystem and for our economy. It provides us with most of the oxygen that we breathe, water that we drink, food that we eat and is the foundation for an economic activity estimated at around US$3 trillion per year.1  1 WWF, Reviving the Oceans Economy: The Case for Action—2015.   Yet, human actions are threatening the oceans: pollution, climate change, overfishing have direct impacts on marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs and mangroves. The damages also cause a loss of trillions of dollars to our economy. SDG 14's ten concrete targets address the basic challenges to our Ocean, from marine pollution, to unsustainable fisheries, from conservation of ecosystems, to assistance for Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries. Yet, SDG 14 still awaits good implementation: four of the Goal's targets have 2020 as a deadline for substantial progress (these are protecting ecosystems, regulating fishing practises, establishing 10% of Marine Protected Areas, prohibiting fisheries subsidies). However, this progress is not evident. Capacity building and further research and knowledge are needed for the fulfilment of the Goal, while pollution and unsustainable fisheries are still untamed challenges. Positive news comes from the mobilization over the last couple of years of the international community and the concrete commitments pledged. The UN Ocean Conference in June 2017 resulted in around 1500 Voluntary Commitments towards the SDG 14 targets from governments, organizations, businesses, academia and philanthropy. In 2018 a new World Bank  Trust Fund, PROBLUE, was established to strengthen the financial means for implementing SDG 14. Yet, resources allocated to SDG 14 are still limited.   2 Assumptions and data 2.1 Estimating the financial cost to implement each SDG 14 target until 2030 To estimate the cost of achieving each individual SDG 14 target by 2030 this paper has mainly used existing findings of the CBD proceedings regarding the Aichi targets, because specific Aichi targets match the SDG 14 targets. The Aichi targets on biodiversity are 20 targets on terrestrial and marine biodiversity (SDG 14 and SDG 15) with deadlines until 2020, adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2011. The Aichi targets that match the SDG 14 targets are: Aichi target 8, on marine pollution, which matches SDG 14.1, Aichi targets 5 and 10, on marine ecosystem protection and restoration, which match SDG 14.2, Aichi target 6 on sustainable fisheries, which matches SDG 14.4, and Aichi target 11 on conservation of coastal and marine areas, which matches SDG 14.5. The strong interdependence between the CBD and the SDGs is also established by the technical note of the WB, UNEP, UNDP, FAO and CBD2  2 https://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/SDGs/English/Biodiversity_2030_Agenda_Technical_Note.pdf .   which stipulates that:The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity has been recognized as setting the global framework for priority actions on biodiversity. The 2030 Agenda is consistent with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity. The SDGs and the Strategic Plan are mutually supportive and reinforcing, and therefore the implementation of one contributes to the achievement of the other.   The scope of the CBD has three main dimensions according to Article 1 of the Convention: conservation, sustainable use and equitable benefits. These are the main concerns of SDG 14. The first High-Level Panel report (HLP 2012) of the CBD presented a global assessment of the costs of meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Targets by 2020, estimating that between US$150 billion and US$440 billion per year would be required. The Panel acknowledged a range of uncertainties, and recognised that further research is vital to help refine these estimates. The Panel also estimated the cost for each individual Aichi target and some of these estimates are used in the present paper. This paper assumes that the CBD estimates for each individual Aichi target are still valid today. This is also the assumption of the UNDP 2018 Biofin Workbook3  3 http://www.biodiversityfinance.net/sites/default/files/content/knowledge_products/BIOFIN%20Workbook%202018.pdf .   which specifies that:A global assessment estimated the resources required to implement the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (2011–2020) at US$150–440 billion per year. Parker and others provide a similar estimate in the range of US$300–400 billion per year.   Already, the UN has used CBD to assess cost of financing SDG 14 in the chapter on ‘Ocean’ of the UNTT Working Group on Sustainable Development Financing: Review of global investment requirement estimates.4  4 Please see page 21 of the following report: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/2096Chapter%201-global%20investment%20requirement%20estimates.pdf .   And more recently, the UN Ocean Conference analysis of Voluntary Commitments states that one method of monitoring and following up commitments on the Ocean is measuring progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity targets.5  5 Please see chapter 11 of the analysis below:https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/17193OCVC_in_depth_analysis.pdf .   In the present study, SDG 14 targets A, B and C are considered as vital and enabling means for the implementation of all other seven SDG targets. Particularly, SDG 14 B and C relate to the degree of progress by countries in the application of legal, regulatory, policy or institutional frameworks. This paper therefore does not attribute costs for the achievement of these targets.  2.2 Estimating the current expenditures of SDG 14 This has been a difficult task since there is no official national or international reporting on SDG 14 related expenditure. This expenditure is primarily registered as voluntary commitments at international ocean conferences, such as the annual Our Ocean Conference and the 2017 UN Ocean Conference. For this paper we have used the data provided by the 2017 UN Ocean Conference. The 2017 first UN Ocean Conference resulted inter alia in the registration of around 1500 voluntary commitments. Although we have no financial information for all of the commitments, we do know that 541 of them amount to approximately US$25.5 billion. The UN Ocean Conference enjoyed global participation and engaged all stakeholders on the Ocean, governments, NGOs, organizations, private sector, etc. They all had the opportunity to register their commitments, as they did to a great extent, and re-registered commitments that were done in other fora. The UN Ocean Conference, this paper assumes, has consequently registered the main expenditures for SDG 14. The known amount covers one third of the commitments made. So, if all of them were priced, theoretically we would have an amount close to US $ 75 billion. However, this paper assumes that this calculation is counterbalanced by the fact that the US $ 25.5 billion is spread out over a period of 10 years for some of the commitments. The analysis report of the UN Ocean Conference notes that ‘there are large spikes in the graphs for the deliverables of the commitments for the years 2017–2018.’ The amount of US $ 25.5 billion is therefore taken as indicative of global expenditures per year for SDG 14. This assumption is backed by the more general spending for biodiversity. This is in the order of US $ 52 billion per year. While for biodiversity the expenditures needed are approximately US$ 295 billion, for SDG 14 the expenditures needed are in the order of US$174 billion. This relationship, SDG 14 requiring approximately half of the biodiversity expenditure, should be reflected also in the proportion of current spending for the two. Therefore SDG 14 spending should be around half of the biodiversity spending.  2.3 Analysing the financial gap Analysing the financial gap of SDG 14, this paper considered numerous reports on the issue of filling the financial gaps for biodiversity and SDG 14. Additionally, it relied on a set of targeted interviews with stakeholders6  6 UN, EU,NGOs, Governmental and Research Institutes, Business.   pertinent to SDG 14.   3 Results 3.1 The estimated cost of implementing SDG 14 targets by 2030     SDG 14 Targets Aichi Biodiversity Targets Resources needed per year Range of uncertainty   SDG 14.1 Reduce Marine Pollution Target 8 Pollution US$ 87.3 billion Medium to high  SDG 14.2 Protect and Restore Ecosystems Targets 5 and 10 Loss of natural habitats and Coral Reefs US$ 34.1 billion Medium  SDG 14.3 Reduce Ocean Acidification Target 5 Loss of natural habitats Overlap with resources needed for SDG 13 and SDG 14a. –  SDG 14.4 Sustainable fishing Target 6 Sustainable fisheries US$ 28.4 billion High  SDG 14.5 Conserve Coastal and Marine Areas Target 11 10% conservation of coastal and marine areas US$ 5.9 billion Medium to high  SDG 14.6 End subsidies – (Resources added of US$ 20 billion) –  SDG 14.7 Increase economic benefits to SIDS and LDCs – Overlap with resources needed for SDG 14.4 –  SDG 14 A Increase scientific knowledge, research and technology for ocean health – Not accounted in the present study   SDG 14 B Support Small Scale Fisheries – Not accounted in the present study   SDG 14 C Implement and enforce international Law of the Sea – Not accounted in the present study   Total Cost  US$ 155,7 billion Medium to high       3.1.1 SDG 14.1: marine pollution The Convention of Biological Diversity estimated that fulfilling the Aichi target 8 on pollution would require a worldwide expenditure of an average US$87.3 billion per year .7  7 CBD-Resourcing the Aichi Biodiversity Targets: a first assessment of the resources required for implementing the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011–2020, page 63. https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/fin/hlpgar-sp-01/official/hlpgar-sp-01-01-report-en.pdf .   The actions considered for this estimate were mainly marine debris clean–up programs; investments in converting synthetic plastic production to biodegradable plastic production; increase in wastewater treatment capacity to cover populations living upstream of dead zones without access to sanitation; installation of best available technologies for stationary and mobile sources of pollution including industries and coal-fired power plants. Discussing this estimate, the CBD noted that it is sensitive to many factors such as scale of implementation and precise nature of the activities. Different analysts using different assumptions about what activities are appropriate and on what scale they should be implemented will find significantly different results. Nonetheless, the CBD analysts were confident that the results presented represent a pragmatic approach designed to provide a plausible first assessment of the likely magnitude of expenditure for marine pollution.8  8 ibid.   The main activities chosen by the CBD are supported by best practise regarding marine pollution: international clean-up; development of local waste management; keeping plastic pollution leakage points closed; re-engineering plastic lifecycle through innovation.9  9 Andreas Merkl -United Nations Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, New York – June 15, 2016.  Relevant investments for these actions are substantial: the EU for example spends US$ 620 million per year on the coastal clean-up of its territory10  10 https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/catching-public-pressure-marine-litter .  .  3.1.2 SDG 14.2: protect and restore ecosystems Aichi Targets 5 (wetlands component) and 10 (coral reefs) give us a good indication of actions related to marine ecosystem protection and restoration and their cost. Actions include wetland banking, protection of wetland communities, improving national wetland inventories, management of new Ramsar sites, integrated coastal management. These are actions also covered by SDG 14.2. The cost attributed by CBD to these actions amount to an average of US$ 34.1 billion per year .11  11 ibid, pages 57 and 65.   Τhe CBD discussion noted that the results of Target 5 represent a pragmatic approach designed to provide a plausible first assessment of the likely magnitude involved. Regarding coral reefs the CBD discussion noted that while the unit cost estimates produced are accurate, they may be underestimated in some cases where relevant data was lacking. In the study ‘The cost and feasibility of marine coastal restoration’ by El.Bayraktarov and others, findings showed that while the median and average reported costs for restoration of 1 ha of marine coastal habitat were around US$80 000 (2010) and US$1 600 000 (2010), respectively, the real total costs (median) are likely to be two to four times higher.12  12 The cost and feasibility of marine coastal restoration, by Elisa Bayraktarov, Megan I. Saunders, Sabah Abdullah Morena Mills, Jutta Beher, Hugh P. Possingham, Peter J. Mumby, Catherine E. Lovelock, 2015.   A degree of uncertainty and underestimation is therefore always present.  3.1.3 SDG 14.3: reduce ocean acidification Ocean acidification may come to be understood as one of the most serious human-caused threats to our ocean13  13 IUCN- Ocean Acidification International Policy and Governance Options,D. Herr, K. Isensee, E. Harrould-Kolieb, and C. Turley.   and estimating costs for research, resilience and reduction of emissions for ocean acidification is particularly challenging. Ocean acidification is interdependent with SDG 13, which complicates a separate estimation for SDG 14.3. There is nowadays more and more evidence that ocean acidification and warming pose significant risks of systemic collapse of many critical ocean and coastal ecosystem services.14  14 Ocean Acidification and Warming: The economic toll and implications for the social cost of carbon by John Talberth and Enrie Niemi, 2019.  Carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean and dissolves to form carbonic acid. The result is that the ocean becomes more acidic, which seriously affects marine biodiversity. Studies have shown that current levels of acidity have increased by 27% since the start of the Industrial Revolution and by 2050 ocean acidity could increase by 150%. CO2 emissions and climate change could affect 60% of the current biomass in the oceans. The direct link of ocean acidification with climate change is also reflected at the methodology for defining the measurement of the indicator of SDG 14.3: the average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations. There is therefore good reason to rather attribute any costs for minimizing ocean acidification and adaptation to SDG 13. Additionally, SDG 14.3 relates directly with SDG 14.a ‘increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries’. As mentioned, this Goal is not accounted for in this study.  3.1.4 SDG 14.4: sustainable fisheries According to the CBD estimates the fisheries sector will require an average of $ 28.4 billion per year  for reducing fishing effort and improving fisheries’ management.15  15 CBD-Resourcing the Aichi Biodiversity Targets: a first assessment of the resources required for implementing the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011–2020, page 58.   The harmful subsidies for fisheries, estimated at $ 20 billion per year,16  16 Global fisheries subsidies: An updated estimate. U. Rashid Sumaila, et. Al. Marine Policy 69.2016.   could be used to contribute to this cost. According to best practise, three elements necessary for fisheries management are: a) provision of science, b) decision making, and c) securing compliance. The systematic collection of reliable basic data on fisheries is a cornerstone of fish stock assessment and scientific advice. This data collection has a significant cost and there is an additional cost in helping fishery communities to diversify their economic base. Examples of costs include replacing fishing vessel engines to promote safety, with restrictions intended to result in a reduction in capacity. Additionally, possible costs cover industry incentives to act sustainably and enforcement of fisheries management regulations.17  17 Baltic Sea 2020 – Best practises for fisheries management.http://www.balticsea2020.org/images/Bilagor/best%20practice%20fisheries%20management.pdf .   The CBD had found the task of estimating the cost for sustainable fisheries challenging and the estimates presented inevitably uncertain, given the available data and resources. However, estimates used had synthesized data from some of the most comprehensive databases of global fisheries catch, effort and economics that were available to use. The most uncertain component of the estimate was the management cost required to maintain sustainable fisheries.18  18 CBD-Resourcing the Aichi Biodiversity Targets: a first assessment of the resources required for implementing the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011–2020, page 58.    3.1.5 SDG 14.5: conserve coastal and marine areas According to the CBD, estimates for relevant costs for establishment and annual management of MPAs average $5.9 billion per year .19  19 Craigie and Gravestock estimated the costs of the MPA network at US$0.8 to 5.9 billion per annum between 2013 and 2020, comprising one off-establishment costs averaging US$0.19 to 1.20 billion per annum and annual management costs of US$0.58 to 4.70 billion per annum.   This cost is compatible with the studies that estimate that a global MPA network which would conserve 20–30% of the world's seas would cost between $5 and $19 billion per year20  20 The worldwide costs of marine protected areas, Andrew Balmford, Pippa Gravestock, Neal Hockley, Colin J. McClean, and Callum M. Roberts, 2004.  . However, the above cost can have a relatively high uncertainty because, as the CBD discussion notes, there are many inherent challenges in estimating the resources required to achieve Target 11, such as establishing costs of indigenous and community conserved areas and private reserves; disaggregating overlapping costs; identifying optimal levels; scaling up costs from limited data sets and literature review; assessing the highly variable costs of creating new protected areas; challenges in estimating the cost of policy environments and sustainable finance; distinguishing between certain costs. Additionally, there is still further analysis needed regarding the effects of technology in MPA management and the costs related to MPAs in the High Seas. However, as Balmford, Gravestock, Hockley, McClean, and Roberts note in their study, expenditure will be disproportionately concentrated in inshore areas, whereas high seas conservation will be far cheaper.21  21 Ibid.    3.1.6 SDG 14.6: end/reduce subsidies contributing to overfishing Global fisheries subsidies are estimated at $20 billion per year. Fuel subsidies constitute the greatest part of the total subsidy (22%), followed by subsidies for management (20%) and ports and harbours (10%). Subsidies contributed by developed countries are far greater (65%) than those contributed by developing countries (35%). Asia is by far the greatest subsidizing region (43%), followed by Europe (25%) and North America (16%).22  22 Rashid Sumaila, Vicky Lam, Frédéric Le Manach, Wilf Swartz, Daniel Pauly, Global fisheries subsidies: An updated estimate, Marine Policy, 2016. RashidSumailaa VickyLambFrédéricLe Manachb Wilf Swartzc Daniel Paulyb    3.1.7 SDG 14.7: increase the economic benefits to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) FAO has identified the main indicator for the implementation of SDG 14.7: this is ‘sustainable fisheries as a percentage of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries’. This indicator is intended to measure the value of sustainable fisheries. It is expressed as a percentage of the country's Gross domestic product (GDP). But still relevant data has not been produced. The SDG indicator 14.7.1 has been categorized as a Tier III indicator, which means that no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator.23  23 http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1471/en/ .   In a recent FAO paper, ‘Understanding and measuring the contribution of aquaculture and fisheries to gross domestic product (GDP)’, Cai, J.N., Huang, H. & Leung discuss the methodological difficulties of addressing this indicator. Not only, according to the authors, measuring the contribution of aquaculture and fisheries to GDP is challenging, but also setting a policy target for GVA (Gross Value Added) has many different parameters to consider: while production quantity is a common policy target in aquaculture and/or fisheries sector development plans, setting a policy target on GVA (for example a 3% annual growth in the sector's production during the planning period) can help avoid or mitigate boom-bust cycles that have been common for aquaculture development in many places. Setting a policy target on GVA may also help mitigate overfishing and contribute to the production quality.24  24 Cai, J.N., Huang, H. & Leung, P.S. 2019. Understanding and measuring the contribution of aquaculture and fisheries to gross domestic product (GDP). FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 606. Rome, FAO. 80 pp.   Leaving this inconclusive discussion aside, it is a commonplace that FAO monitoring of stocks will be enhanced with the implementation of SDG 14.4, indicator 14.4.1, which tracks progress towards more fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels at national, regional (across FAO Major Fishing Areas) and global levels. Therefore, the cost estimates for SDG 14.4 have a direct impact on the cost estimates for SDG 14.7, despite the fact that additional costs may be envisaged in order to bring forward the full production potential of SIDS and LDCs.  3.1.8 SDG 14A, SDG 14B and SDG 14C In the present study, SDG 14 targets A, B and C are considered as vital and enabling means for the implementation of all other seven SDG targets. Particularly, SDG 14 B and C relate to the degree of progress by countries in the application of legal, regulatory, policy or institutional frameworks. This paper therefore does not attribute costs for the achievement of these targets. SDG 14 A is a cross-cutting target, which has a very specific indicator: ‘Proportion of total research budget allocated to research in the field of marine technology’. In its 2017 Global Ocean Science Report (GOSR), UNESCO-IOC estimated that for the 29 countries under study, this proportion was between < 0.04% and 4% of the total research and development expenditure.25  25 UNESCO, Global Ocean Science Report. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000250428 .   This proportion is considered low and as the GOSR notes the Ocean science expenditure is highly variable worldwide. The present paper does not include expenditures for SDG 14 A for two reasons: some of the above expenditures include costs on science and technology, like marine pollution, ecosystem protections and acidification. Secondly, the upcoming UNESCO-IOC Global Ocean Science Report (GOSR) in June 2020 will have detailed data on this issue.  3.1.9 Conclusion All in all, the above estimates, once the inflation from 2012 is calculated, amount to an average overall financial cost of US$174.52 billion per year  to save our Ocean. Combatting marine pollution appears to be the most resource demanding cluster, with expenditures averaging $87.3 billion per year. Next comes the ecosystems’ protection cluster (ecosystems and MPAs) with an average cost of $40 billion per year. Then follows the fisheries cluster with average expenditures of $28.4 billion per year, while acidification and improving the economic benefits to SIDS and LDCs are unaccounted because they coincide with costs for SDG 13 and SDG 14.4 respectively. To return to the CBD and the resources needed for achieving the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets (SDG 14 and SDG 15) by 2020, these amount to US$150–440 billion per annum. Furthermore, it is estimated that at least US$52 billion is currently spent on biodiversity per year globally. This amount is thought to have been relatively stable in the 2010–2015 period. The above estimates lead to the conclusion that approximately half of the total biodiversity expenditure should be devoted to marine biodiversity, largely as foreseen in SDG 14.   3.2 The current financial cost of saving our ocean The 2017 first UN Ocean Conference resulted inter alia in the registration of voluntary commitments for the implementation of SDG 14 by governments, NGOs, UN entities and others. These numbered around 1500 commitments. Although we have no financial information for all of the commitments, we do know that 541 of them, that is one third of the total, amount to approximately US$25.5 billion.26  26 UNDESA- In-depth analysis of Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitments to support and monitor their implementation, 2017.   Though this amount, as pointed out in the relevant UN analysis of the commitments, should be interpreted with caution (due to the ongoing verification of the available data), it offers a good indication of current finance dedicated to SDG 14. While this amount is not a cost per year (some of the commitments extend to two, three or more years), this paper treats it as a per year amount for two reasons: firstly, the analysis report of the UN Ocean Conference notes that ‘there are large spikes in the graphs for the deliverables of the commitments for the years 2017–2018; secondly, the annual spending for biodiversity is of the order of US $ 52 billion. We have shown that while for biodiversity the expenditures needed are in the order of US$ 295 billion, for SDG 14 the expenditures needed are in the order of US $ 155 billion. This relationship, SDG 14 requiring approximately half of the biodiversity expenditure, should be reflected also in the relationship of current spending for the two. Therefore SDG 14 spending is highly probable to be around half of the biodiversity spending. While these estimates on the current spending for our Ocean seem highly uncertain, a recent OECD paper prepared for the G7 French Presidency (May 2019) supports their above range (and at the same time underlines the lack of basic data which could lead to safer estimates). According to this paper, partial data on domestic finance on biodiversity-relevant activities, as reported to the CBD Clearing House Mechanism by 40% of the Parties, was estimated at approximately USD 49 billion in 2015. Drawing on several other data sources – most of which do not include domestic central public biodiversity finance – preliminary estimates suggest that finance flows to biodiversity amount to roughly USD 39 billion. This estimate includes finance flows from economic instruments (such as biodiversity offsets), philanthropy and impact investing, and may feature some double counting owing to the way the data are reported across different data sets. It is important to note that these two estimates are partial and incomplete, and cannot be added due to a degree of overlap. As noted above, further work is required to develop robust estimates of global biodiversity finance.27  27 OECD (2019), Biodiversity: Finance and the Economic and Business Case for Action, report prepared for the G7 Environment Ministers' Meeting, 5–6 May 2019.   It is therefore newly underlined that biodiversity spending (terrestrial and marine) still is in the order of USD 50 billion per year and consequently the current financial cost for the ocean is a part of this expense.28  28 The OECD report discussion reiterated the CBD findings regarding biodiversity spending: The global finance needed to meet the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets by 2020 has been estimated at about USD 150–440 billion (US dollars) per year (CBD High-Level Panel, 2014 [190]). Global finance flows for biodiversity were estimated at about USD 52 billion in 2010 (Parker et al., 2012 [191]). While acknowledging some uncertainties in these estimates, it is clear that a major gap in the finance needed to halt biodiversity loss exists (page 64 of the above report).    3.3 Analysing the funding gap of SDG 14 3.3.1 The funding gap According to the estimates presented here, achieving SDG 14 by 2030 will require resources of US$174.52 billion per year, while currently US$25.5 billion is spent annually. This indicates a funding gap of US$149.02 billion per year.  3.3.2 The funding sources and instruments gap In the last couple of years, we have seen increased awareness of and willingness to act upon ocean sustainability issues. We have seen political willingness for action, numerous high-level meetings for ocean issues, progress in negotiating ocean related agreements, a proliferation of initiatives and tools addressing the ocean's challenges and SDG 14. Corresponding vigour has been noticed in the finance mechanisms supporting funding for the oceans. In brief, in the context of the G-7 and the G-20, the UN and the EU, as well as the African Union and the ASEAN we have witnessed important initiatives dealing with the ocean. Ocean pollution was on the agenda for the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan in 2019. In 2017 Malaysia launched the ASEAN Strategic Plan on the Environment (ASPEN) which has as main priority the conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems. The ASPEN shall serve as a comprehensive guide for ASEAN cooperation on environment for the period of 2016–2025. In 2015 the African Union launched the 2015–2025 Decade of African Seas and Oceans in the context of achieving the African Union Agenda 2063. In addition to annual conferences on the Ocean, such as the ‘Our Ocean Conferences’, which have been taking place since 2014 and the Economist World Ocean Summit, there has been the ground-breaking UN Ocean Conference in June 2017, which brought forward around 1500 voluntary commitments on SDG 14. In parallel, remarkable initiatives developed that mobilized attention to the ocean's health issues and ocean action. For example, the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ initiative convened by the World Economic Forum. This is a coalition of 51 ocean leaders who are fast-tracking solutions to the most pressing challenges facing the ocean. Another important initiative is the High-level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, launched by the Norwegian Prime Minister E. Solberg. This is a group of world leaders from around the globe committed to developing, catalyzing and supporting solutions for Ocean health and wealth in policy, governance, technology and finance. The global governance for the Ocean was promoted, as efforts were intensified to develop a legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Another positive development is the negotiations of regulations to manage the impacts of mining in the seabed and ocean floor by the International Seabed Authority. However, despite greater awareness of the financial need, funding for SDG 14 remains largely dependent on voluntary contributions from states, NGOs and donors. Nevertheless, more financial sources have been identified in the last couple of years and more innovative ways of financing have been considered and implemented. Currently, the main current financial sources include: 1) public domestic sources and official development assistance, 2) multilateral ocean finance (Trust Funds and MDBs), 3) private ocean finance (domestic and international), 4) innovative finance and 5) philanthropy. The majority of financial resources for biodiversity (including SDG 14) is allocated by domestic and international public finance . These represent approximately 80% of the biodiversity funding,29  29 Parker, Cranford, Oakes&Leggett,2012.   with the public domestic expenditures reaching around US$ 25 billion per year30  30 GCP-The Little Biodiversity Finance Book.   and the ODA biodiversity allocation approximately US$ 8.3 billion per year in 2015–16.31  31 OECD-Biodiversity Related Official Development Assistance 2016.   Though the exact amounts of domestic and international private investment  in SDG 14 are unknown, private capital committed to conservation grew from less than a billion in 2004–2008 to US$8.2 billion in 2015.32  32 Hamrick, K. (2016). State of Private Investment in Conservation 2016: A Landscape Assessment of an Emerging Market. Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace.   However, it is widely agreed that the private sector could be contributing more, particularly by forging synergies with the public sector. A recent UN study examined the commitment to the SDGs of the 100 most profitable and globally admired companies. Regrettably, SDG 14, Life below water, ranked at the bottom of the list. This was also the case regarding the visibility of the SDGs: SDG 14 was the least visible goal for these companies.33  33 SDG Commitment Report 100: Tracking companies' efforts to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, UN Academic Impact, UNGSII.   In addition, investor understanding of the sustainable Blue Economy is currently very low, and only 26% of current investments fit a broader definition of sustainability.34  34 Principles for Sustainable Investment in the Blue Economy, Accenture Development Partnerships, 2017.   Almost half of the commitments at the 2017 UN Ocean Conference were registered by governments (44%), followed by NGOs (20%). Civil society and the private sector had an equal participation with 8% of the commitments each. Philanthropic contribution registered 1% of the commitments. These statistics reflect to a great extent the above data on public and private funding sources. Innovative finance  was first established with the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals and the Monterrey Conference on financing for development. However, funding from Innovative Finance Instrument for the Ocean is still very low. Good examples though exist regarding climate change and health goals. Only green bonds – bonds specifically earmarked for climate and environmental projects – raised over US$100 billion in 2016. Regarding SDG 14 a recent example is the launch of the first ever blue bond by Seychelles, on October 20, 2018.35  35 https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/29/seychelles-launches-worlds-first-sovereign-blue-bond .   From 2009 to present, some funding estimates suggest an allocation of US$ 6.5 billion in grants and US$3.1 billion in bilateral and multilateral aid for the ocean, mostly from US-based foundations.36  36 https://maps.foundationcenter.org/#/charts/?subjects=all&popgroups=all&years=all&location=6295630&excludeLocation=0&geoScale=ADM0&layer=geo_area&boundingBox=-187,-66,187,76&gmOrgs=all&recipOrgs=all&tags=all&keywords=&pathwaysOrg=&pathwaysType=&acct=oceans&typesOfSupport=all&transactionTypes=all&amtRanges=all&minGrantAmt=0&maxGrantAmt=0&gmTypes=all&minAssetsAmt=0&maxAssetsAmt=0&minGivingAmt=0&maxGivingAmt=0&andOr=0&includeGov=1&custom=all&customArea=all&indicator=&dataSource=oecd&chartType=facets&multiSubject=1&listType=gm&zoom=2 .   Global efforts are underway to increase philanthropic contributions  towards ocean sustainability. However, the outcomes of the UN Ocean Conference voluntary commitments show that philanthropic organizations registered the fewest commitments.37  37 UNDESA-In-depth analysis of Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitments to support and monitor their implementation (2017).   The international development community is increasingly responding to the oceans’ financial needs, including the establishment of targeted  Funds. To the existing UN Funds, such as the GEF, others are now added, for example, the China Ocean Fund (COSIIF) and the Althelia Sustainable Ocean Fund. In September 2018, The World Bank Group established PROBLUE, a new multi-donor trust fund that will support the implementation of SDG14. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs),  such as the European Investment Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and others play an increasingly important role in debt finance regarding SDG 14 and Ocean projects. In 2017 MDBs mobilized a record high US$35.2 billion for climate change. This allocation has implications also for the oceans. However, targeted ocean action could be fostered further in the MDBs’ agenda. At the UN Ocean Conference the first and third largest commitments were from the European Investment Bank. The first was a commitment of US$8 billion in loans for supporting SIDS to reduce their vulnerability to climate change and build a more resilient ocean economy. The third largest commitment at the Conference – also by the European Investment Bank – included US$3 billion for supporting projects to strengthen the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems through reduction of pollution.38  38 UNDESA-In-depth analysis of Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitments to support and monitor their implementation (2017).   Analysis suggests that pension and sovereign wealth funds could forge cooperation with MDBs and help bridge the SDG infrastructure gap. This would require rerouting, through MDBs resources managed by institutional investors  towards sustainable development finance.39  39 UNCTAD-Scaling up finance for the Sustainable Development Goals, 2018.   In conclusion, as also suggested by most of the interviewees for this report, the global political attention to the Ocean's issues in the last couple of years is very positive and can catalyse additional funding resources. However, such funding resources are currently limited. Particular attention should be given to the role of the private sector, especially the area within the private sector that benefits from the oceans and to the role of philanthropy. Particular effort is also needed in order to change the narrative regarding funding for the oceans and make it more value oriented, for business and the public sector. MDBs and Trust Funds, as well as regional marine conservation organizations also have an important contribution to make. Each instrument has its own added value and through effective coordination their collective impact can be significant.  3.3.3 The target, geographical and ‘overall approach’ gap to achieve SDG 14 The Analysis of the Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitments indicate that the three SDG 14 targets which received the least commitments were target 14.6 (prohibiting certain forms of fisheries subsidies) with only 3% of the commitments, target 14.3 (minimizing and addressing impacts of ocean acidification) with 6% of the commitments, and target 14.b (providing access to small-scale and artisanal fisheries to marine resources and markets) equally with 6% of the commitments. The targets which received most of the voluntary commitments were target 14.2 (sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems), followed by target 14.1 (preventing and reducing marine pollution by 2025). Of note is also that target 14.1 seems to be receiving the majority of commitments from the private sector. It is assumed here that voluntary commitments also receive the necessary funding for their implementation and thus are indicative of the allocation of resources. Therefore, priority should be given to the funding gaps of the least addressed targets  by the voluntary commitments. Also, attention should be paid to the timeframe gap: four targets have as timeframe the year 2020 (these are the commitments of promoting ecosystems sustainability (14.2), improving fishing practises (14.4), conserving at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, (14.5), and reducing fishing subsidies (14.6). In conclusion and taking into account views expressed by interviewees for this report, there is scope for leveraging further investment for small scale fisheries, while putting an end to subsidies can itself add significant resources for financing SDG 14. Researching and mitigating acidification and reducing marine pollution (including constructing sewage systems in developing countries) will also require considerable investment in the future. It goes without saying that the progress towards achieving the SDG 14 targets varies by regions and targets. Nevertheless, a general finding from the CBD reviews is that across regions  similar progress has been made on the targets related to protected areas, while a similar lack of progress exists regarding fisheries, fisheries subsidies, and marine pollution. There is additionally a need to focus more on technology transfer and capacity building in all regions and to give greater assistance to the developing countries, particularly with issues of fisheries and marine pollution. In addition, while discussing the financial gap of SDG 14 with representatives of the ocean community, this paper identified another significant gap for this analysis: the overall approach gap.  This is to say the fundamental change in the thinking and acting which is required for filling any other gaps for SDG 14. This change has to do with individually and collectively realizing the need to change the culture of production and consumption so that, for example, there could be more consumption of eco-labelled fish and more limited use of plastics. This change relates to the crucial enabling conditions for successful investment in SDG 14: a political leadership that cares about the oceans and good governance, as well as a set of convincing arguments for investing in the health of our oceans which resonate with the public and private sector. If so, more initiatives like the Seychelles blue bond, for example, will begin to materialize. Thirdly, overcoming the overall approach gap has to do with robust coordination at all levels: above all, coordination in marrying the ocean needs, especially of the developing world, with the investment opportunities of the donor community. Good project proposals from developing countries are needed to attract investment, and coordination will guarantee targeted investments that avoid duplications of efforts by the donor community.    4 Discussion While the results of this study provide valuable information regarding the estimation of total cost of achieving SDG 14 by 2030 and the funding gap that needs to be filled, they should be treated with caution for a number of reasons. Like all cost-related studies, the present one also has inherent difficulties, like the lack of information at international, regional, but especially national level. Examples include lack of country by country assessments on costing requirements for the fulfilment of SDG 14 and the lack of country by country data on SDGs spending. Other inherent difficulties relate to SDG 14 indicators, which belong mostly to tier III (Tier 3: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested) and the relationship of different SDG 14 targets between them. As mentioned, in several occasions the same targets require the same actions to be fulfilled like in the case of SDG 14.4 and SDG 14.7 or SDG 14.3 and SDG 14a. What is more, SDG 14 relates closely in specific issues to other SDGs, like acidification to climate change. This study has kept focus on SDG 14 targets and did not include a cost/benefit analysis (though references are made in different parts of the report). More specifically, this study relied heavily on the Convention on Biological Diversity findings on resources needed to fulfil the Aichi 2020 Targets and on the results of the UN Ocean Conference of 2017. Average estimates were provided with significant methodological limitations. These limitations are briefly discussed here (more discussion is found in the CBD report ‘Resourcing the Aichi Biodiversity Targets’ from 2012). They are reflected though in this study, taking into account that discussion, with an identification of uncertainty with a high, medium and low grade. Also, the CBD estimates conducted in 2012 were made for targets until 2020 and include estimates for targets that closely, but not exactly, correlate with SDG 14 targets. However, CBD and researchers continue to work with these estimates, considering them still relevant today, and until further analysis is conducted – preferably country-based – these are the best illustrative estimates. Bringing the 2012 amounts to 2019 values, in other words calculating the inflation, has not contributed to a considerable difference in overall estimates and in the CBD's calculations of costs initial investments and annual management costs have been accounted. For current expenditure on SDG 14 (US$ 25.5 billion) this study relied on the financial findings of the UN Ocean Conference. However, these should be used with caution, given that they only cover one third of the voluntary commitments made and are not an annual expenditure. Yet, the amount makes sense in the context of the more general biodiversity expenditure (US$52 billion per year).  5 Conclusions-recommendations Achieving SDG 14 by 2030 will require at least six times the resources currently allocated. This study has identified some potential ways of leveraging additional resources following an analysis of gaps in targets, regions, financial sources and mechanisms. This study concludes with the following suggestions for better resourcing SDG 14: 5.1 Address the cultural challenge For too long we have taken nature for granted, and this needs to stop. We can no longer ignore the impact of current unsustainable production models and wasteful lifestyles. These must be accounted for and addressed’ (2018 WWF Living Planet). This is certainly true of our Oceans. Most of our Oceans' problems are human-made and the responsibility lies with all of us. From marine pollution to overfishing, from acid oceans to unprotected marine areas, from the bleaching of coral reefs to added economic burdens for SIDS and LDCs, the question is: would the picture be the same if our consumption models were more measured, the measure being our own and our planet's health?  5.2 Keep the ocean and SDG 14 high on the global agenda Change can occur when there is sufficient political will and public awareness. It is encouraging that the last couple of years have seen a great mobilization for our Oceans, at the international political level and at the local level. It is important to continue this mobilization.  5.3 Invest in enabling policy and institutions for SDG 14 Effective delivery of the SDG 14 targets can only be achieved if a few enabling conditions are met. Two of them are the necessary policies and institutions at all levels, but mostly at the country level and particularly in developing countries.  5.4 Invest in enabling capacity building and research Developing expertise can often be more important than financial resources. Capacity building can help overcome governance and management challenges that hinder sustainable ocean action. In the same vein, scientific capacity development and technology transfer are crucial for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, also in the areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ).  5.5 Readjust existing spending for SDG 14 Global allocations for SDG 14 could profit considerably from better targeted spending. Firstly, funds would be freed by phasing out subsidies, which currently amount to US$20 billion. Secondly, mainstreaming SDG 14 targets into development and environmental fields, such as in the Blue Economy and in Climate Change, could help provide more varied and effective financial instruments for implementing SDG 14. Thirdly, rethinking the resource needs could lead to moving allocations to areas with greater impact.  5.6 Increase ‘traditional’ funding for SDG 14 As part of the biodiversity funding, SDG 14 is funded mostly by domestic and international public sources (80% of the funding). In this respect, increases in the domestic resource mobilization and ODA have an important role to play in filling the SDG 14 financial gap. Currently around US$ 25 billion of global domestic revenues is dedicated to biodiversity and out of US$146 billion per year in ODA assistance to developing countries around US$8 billion is set aside to cover their biodiversity (terrestrial and marine) needs. With the right interventions there is potential to scale up these amounts.  5.7 Promote SDG 14 innovative (non-traditional) solutions that engage the private sector The current contribution of the private sector to SDGs 14 and 15 is limited, estimated at 8% of total SDG 14 financing. There is scope for further growth of innovative instruments that can benefit from the private sectors investment, such as payment for ecosystem services, blue bonds, biodiversity offsets, blended finance and others.  5.8 Engage (more) philanthropy for SDG 14 Estimates are that philanthropy contributes with around US$ 1 billion per year to the ocean's health. At the same time, there is rising awareness of philanthropy's potential to help fill the overall SDGs' financial gap and the willingness from philanthropy's side to commit more resources to the SDGs cause.  5.9 Invest in coordination (of financial) efforts for SDG 14 – support the trust funds and regional cooperation At the national, regional and global level there are dozens of marine conservation trust funds, which adequately cover all targets of SDG 14. Trust funds are effective financial mechanisms for the ocean's sustainability and most of them are in very biodiverse countries – a great potential advantage, given that these countries do not benefit as much as they should from biodiversity assistance. Additionally, regional efforts (such as the Regional Seas Programs and the Regional Fishery Bodies), which exhibit many good examples of coordinated marine conservation, should be further supported.  5.10 Invest in coordination (of financial) efforts for SDG 14 – add a 10th community of ocean action on sustainable financing for the ocean This could be a platform in the context of the UN Ocean Conference to coordinate SDG 14 financing for the implementation of the Ocean Voluntary Commitments and overall the SDG 14 targets.
