                  Arsenic (As) contamination in paddy soils and its further translocation to the rice is a serious global issue. Arsenic loading to the rice depends on soil physico-chemical parameters and agronomic practices. To minimize this natural threat, as a natural substance, rice straw was used to produce rice biochar (RBC) and doped with iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles, another eco-friendly composite. In this study, RBC was used at three different concentrations- 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% alone as well as conjugated with fixed 20 ppm IO nanoparticles. These treatments were compared with the control soil and control plants that had only As in the setup, without any amendments. The application of these treatments was efficient in reducing soil As bioavailability by 43.9%, 60.5%, and 57.3% respectively. Experimental data proved a significant percentage of As was adsorbed onto the RBC + IO conjugate. Further, the 1% RBC + IO conjugate was found to be the best treatment in terms of making soil macro-nutrients bioavailable. Rice seedlings grown under this treatment was more stress tolerant and produced less antioxidant enzymes and stress markers compared to the control plants grown under As-stress only. Rice plants from these different growth setups were observed for internal anatomical integrity and found that the RBC alone and RBC + IO conjugate, both improved the internal vascular structure compared to the control plants. To minimize soil As stress in crops, IO-doped RBC was proven to be the best sustainable amendment for improving soil-crop quality and achieving the proposed motto of Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations.

Handling Editor: T Cutright Arsenic (As) contamination in paddy soils and its further translocation to the rice is a serious global issue. Arsenic loading to the rice depends on soil physico-chemical parameters and agronomic practices. To minimize this natural threat, as a natural substance, rice straw was used to produce rice biochar (RBC) and doped with iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles, another eco-friendly composite. In this study, RBC was used at three different concentrations- 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% alone as well as conjugated with fixed 20 ppm IO nanoparticles. These treatments were compared with the control soil and control plants that had only As in the setup, without any amendments. The application of these treatments was efficient in reducing soil As bioavailability by 43.9%, 60.5%, and 57.3% respectively. Experimental data proved a significant percentage of As was adsorbed onto the RBC + IO conjugate. Further, the 1% RBC + IO conjugate was found to be the best treatment in terms of making soil macro-nutrients bioavailable. Rice seedlings grown under this treatment was more stress tolerant and produced less antioxidant enzymes and stress markers compared to the control plants grown under As-stress only. Rice plants from these different growth setups were observed for internal anatomical integrity and found that the RBC alone and RBC + IO conjugate, both improved the internal vascular structure compared to the control plants. To minimize soil As stress in crops, IO-doped RBC was proven to be the best sustainable amendment for improving soil-crop quality and achieving the proposed motto of Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations.

Biochar, being sustainable and eco-friendly, with the high adsorptive capacity of toxic metal(loid)s, its application is well-documented for arsenic (As) removal from aqueous phases (Zhang et al., 2013 ; Srivastav et al., 2021 ). Arsenic dynamics can be well-understood by studying the sedimentation and its linkage to the agricultural soils ((Majumdar et al., 2020a ) Although its application for As mitigation in soil systems is not well reported, especially in rice fields, previous studies suggested the potential in immobilizing As in soil by biochar alone or by mixing up with other chemical groups like Mn-oxides, KOH, hydrogel etc. (Vithanage et al., 2017 ; Naeem et al., 2017 ). Arsenic contamination is world's one of the biggest toxicological calamities which is still affecting millions of people across the globe (Majumdar et al., 2020b ; Moulick et al., 2021 ; Singh et al., 2021 ). Depending on the agronomic practices and variable soil physico-chemical conditions, the redox status of As gets altered and translocated to the rice plant (Upadhyay et al., 2020 ; Shrivastava et al., 2020 ; Tyagi et al., 2022 ). Among different available strategies to minimize this As toxicity from soil to crop, biochar is also gaining interest. Another environmental concern that is growing with each passing year is burning crop residues in open fields after their harvest pertaining not only air pollution but also triggers changes in the subjected soil (Chen et al., 2019 ; Porichha et al., 2021 ). Open incineration of crop residues produces ash with a considerable amount of biochar in it (Anand et al., 2022 ), hence it is recommended that the burning should be in a controlled procedure or within enclosed chambers to avoid high ash production. Such controlled production of rice biochar can be further applied to the field at a large scale. Sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations, are promoting studies that can propose eco-friendly means to reduce ever-growing soil pollution including As toxicity (Lal et al., 2021 ). Biochar in this context is being considered highly in the promotion of SDGs (Mazarji et al., 2021 ). In this study, we chose to use rice straw residues as a source of biochar production in a controlled manner and doped with iron oxide nanoparticles to maximize efficiency. This idea to reuse rice straw residues as a source of biochar production will not only reduce the chance of air pollution by preventing open-air burning after its harvest but also achieve the recommendations of SDGs. In terms of As chelation or adsorption, iron nanoparticles have been extensively studied in different forms, as a sustainable tool for environmental clean-ups (Zou et al., 2016 ; Qian et al., 2017 ; Majumdar et al., 2022 ). It has been reported also that the adsorption and transformation of arsenite [As(III)] onto iron-coated biochar occurs better than the adsorption of arsenate [As(V)] at pH 6–9, which is the natural soil pH in most of the agricultural fields (Vithanage et al., 2017 ). Iron oxide or zero-valent iron nanoparticles, both provide a sufficient surface to the soil nutrients which allows the associated plants to take up nutrients in a more efficient way compared to the control soil (Ding et al., 2016 ). This allows us to question what is the right proportion of biochar alone and doped with iron oxide nanoparticles to be applied in the agricultural soil, especially in rice fields for maximum As mitigation while improving the soil-crop quality. Biochar amendment can certainly change soil pH, redox potential (ORP), and organic matter (OM) content, influencing the availability of soil nutrients which increase plant nutrient uptake (Lal et al., 2021 ; Diatta et al., 2020 ; Yi et al., 2020 ), although, no such reports are available in a single study where plant biochemical analyses were performed simultaneously. Combined studies focusing on crop plants' biochemical responses along with the application of composite biochar and nanoparticles have been hardly reported. This again raised a query about the plant's own response during the amendment of biochar and iron-doped biochar for As stress mitigation and nutritional enrichment. To answer all these concerns together, this study was conducted using rice biochar (RBC) and iron oxide (IO)-doped RBC at different concentrations to identify the right dose of biochar application in soil for rice cultivation. Simultaneously, rice plant stress-responsive biochemical assessments and internal anatomy observations were conducted to prove the sustainable applicability of biochar alone as well as doped with IO nanoparticles.  2 Materials and methods Experimental setup and sampling phases-   The whole experiment was conducted using a pot culture approach where natural arsenic-contaminated paddy field soils were used to fill the pots. Arsenic-contaminated soil was taken from a nearby rice field at Deganga block, North 24 Pargana (22°41′13.2″N 88°38′40.6″E), West Bengal (with farmer's consent) that was previously reported to be highly contaminated with natural As (Roychowdhury, 2010 ; Chowdhury et al., 2018 ) Each pot was filled up with 5 kg of As-laden paddy soil, and moisture content was maintained at 75% (Srivastav et al., 2021 ). Sampling setups were divided into four major parts depending on the application of the prepared rice biochar (RBC) and iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles- (i) control soil with only naturally contained As, (ii) As-laden soil with 0.5% w/w RBC and 20 ppm IO, (iii) As-laden soil with 1% w/w RBC and 20 ppm IO, and (iv) As-laden soil with 1.5% w/w RBC and 20 ppm IO. Each of these four setups was sampled for soil and plant at four different time points-the 0th  day (the initial day before the experiment begins), the 7th day, the 15th day, and the 30th day of RBC-IO treatments. Rice seeds (Satabdi IET 4786) were disinfected and surface sterilized with 1% mercuric chloride, followed by a thorough wash using double distilled water five times. Seeds were kept hydrated and left for germination wrapped with a wet piece of cotton for 7 days. After the germination, seeds were grown using a full-strength Kimura B solution for the next 20–25 days (Srivastava et al., 2016 ). From these rice seedlings, each pot was transferred with 12 seedlings for four sampling days in triplicates. Preparation of rice biochar and iron oxide nanoparticle-   Dry rice shoots from the local farmers were bought and finely chopped with subsequent drying in a hot air oven. The pyrolysis process was conducted slowly and avoided atmospheric oxygen as much as possible. The temperature rise was 20 °C per min and was finally maintained at 400 °C for 45 min (method taken and modified from Naeem et al., 2017 ). After the pyrolysis process, the biochar was allowed to cool down and sieved through a 2 mm sieve for homogenization. Fabrication of iron oxide nanoparticles was followed and slightly modified from Chen et al. (2019) . Briefly, FeCl3 ·7H2 O and FeSO4 ·3H2 O solution mixtures were taken at a 2:1 M ratio to which an NH4 OH solution was dropwise added at a rate of 20 drops/minute, continuing for 30 min. Synthesized Fe3 O4  nanoparticles (hereafter IO) were filtered and rinsed with double distilled water five times. A previous study from our lab established that the application of IO nanoparticle at a 20 ppm rate is it was proved to be efficient in As adsorption as well as inducive to the plant's health, and not a harmful amendment to the soil (Majumdar et al., 2022 ). This let us also fix this 20 ppm concentration for this study where the 20 ppm indicates the 20 mg of IO NP dispersed in water to be used for 1 kg of soil. The doping of these IO nanoparticles to the RBC was performed by taking 20 ppm IO, and three different concentrations of RBC- 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% separately into a beaker with 500 ml of double distilled water, and each of these mixtures was stirred using a rotary shaker for 3 h at 37 °C. Finally, the RBC-IO composites were dried completely at 90 °C for 6–7 h. Characterization of RBC and IO nanoparticles-   Synthesized IO nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR Nicolet I5, Thermo Scientific) and X-ray diffraction (XRD Rigaku with mini flex). For the FTIR scanning, the spectra were recorded within 400–4000 cm−1  with a resolution of 4 cm−1 . In the case of XRD, Cu Kα = 1.54059 Å radiation at 40 kV/15 mA was set. The data were recorded within the 15° to 70° 2θ range with a scanning rate of 5° 2θ per minute. The absorption of As was tested further by analyzing the RBC-IO nanoparticle composites using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Oxford INCA) docked field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP). A control RBC, followed by As-sorbed RBC, RBC + IO, and As-sorbed RBC + IO samples were visualized and quantified using the EDX. To check the efficiency of this synthesized RBC alone and combined with IO nanoparticles to adsorb As from the media, a solution of As (using sodium arsenite as a solute in double distilled water) was prepared, and the adsorption test was carried out for a period of 1hr. This resulted in elemental peaks being marked, and measured concentrations were expressed as weight% for each detected element. Soil-plant sample preparation for bioavailability assessment-   Soil samples were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters like pH, redox potentials (ORP) with Oakton Waterproof PCS Testr 35 and ORP Testr 10, and soil organic matter (SOM) were analyzed following the HCl titration method (Majumdar et al., 2019 ; Walkley and Black, 1934 ). Soil samples were taken from each setup for total and bioavailable As measurement. For total As quantification, 0.5 g of soil was taken and digested by the tri-acid method and ICP-MS (Parkin-Elmer) (Majumdar et al., 2018 ), followed by a cross-check analysis using the press pellet method in WD-XRF (Bruker S8 Tiger) (Tyagi et al., 2022 ). Instrumental specifications are given in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 . For internal standardization and calibrations, NIST 2711a, MESS3, JSD3, and SDC1 standard reference materials were used in both cases. For the bioavailability assessment of the soil As, a sequential extraction method was followed (Tessier et al., 1979 ; Upadhyay et al., 2022 ). Amongst five fractions, the first two fractions (exchangeable and carbonate-bound) were considered as the soil elements' bioavailable concentrations. Detailed steps and reagents are given in Supplementary Table S3 . Analysis of this bioavailability was measured using the ICP-MS, and NIST 2711a was used as reference material (Shrivastava et al., 2020 ). The details of standard reference materials are given in Supplementary Table S4 . The destructive diacid-digestion process was followed for the elemental quantification in rice seedlings (Majumdar et al., 2018 ). Rice seedlings were analyzed for both As accumulation and stress-responsive marker profiling. Analysis of rice plant stress-responsive markers-   Rice seedlings were processed and analyzed for two stress-responsive markers-malondialdehyde (MDA) and total protein content. For the MDA assessment, about 120 mg of fresh seedling leaves were grounded using a mortar and pestle in a mixture of 0.5% 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min was done, taking out the supernatant to heat for half an hour in a water bath (at 90 °C) to develop the color. Absorbance reading was taken at 532 nm and rectified for any unspecific absorbance at 600 nm by subtracting accordingly. The blank was prepared using the same mixture of TBA and TCA. An extinction coefficient of 155 mM−1  cm−1  was used to quantify the concentration of MDA as a representative of the lipid peroxidation and thus the degree of cellular damage (Yadav and Srivastava, 2021 ; Heath and Packer, 1968 ). Total protein content was estimated using the developed method by Lowry et al. (1951) . Determination of stress regulatory enzymes in plants-   To manage As stress generation in plant tissues, four antioxidant enzymes were assessed-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX). SOD assay:  This method was developed by Beauchamp and Fridovich (1971) , and here we followed with minor adjustments. The process considers the inhibition of the photochemical reduction of nitrobluetetrazolium (NBT) ability by SOD. The reaction mixture contains 13 mM methionine, 50 mM phosphate buffer, 0.15 mM EDTA, 75 μM NBT, 2 μM riboflavin, and the needed aliquot of the enzyme extract to make up 3 ml of the total reaction volume. A 15 W fluorescence lamp was used and kept around 30 cm above the reaction tubes. The absorbance data was recorded at 560 nm. One activity unit indicates the amount of protein needed to stop the initial 50% reduction of NBT under light (Yadav and Srivastava, 2021 ). CAT assay:  An extraction buffer was used for this assay, mixing up 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 N NaOH, 0.5 ml sodium-potassium tartrate, and 0.5 ml CuSO4 . The method was taken from Aebi (1974) . The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7, and 200 mM H2 O2,  and required an aliquot of enzyme extraction to make the final reaction volume 3 ml. The molar extinction coefficient of H2 O2  was 0.04 cm2  mM−1,  and the data was recorded at 240 nm (Majumdar et al., 2022 ). APX assay:  This process estimated the rate of ascorbate oxidation at the extinction coefficient of 2.8 mM−1  cm−1  and 290 nm absorption by the APX enzyme (Natasha et al., 2022 ). The total volume of this reaction was 3 ml, consisting of 0.5 mM sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM H2 O2 , 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7, and the required volume of the enzyme extraction aliquot (Srivastava et al., 2006 ). GPA assay:  This method was developed by Hemeda and Klein (1990)  and followed in this study with minor changes. A 1000 μl of reaction mixture volume contained 100 μl of 1.2% guaiacol (v/v), 100 μl of 0.4% of H2O2, 80 μl of 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.6, and 10 μl of enzyme extract with a volume made up of double distilled water. With the gradual oxidation of guaiacol, absorbance increases and was recorded at 470 nm with an extinction coefficient of 26.6 mM−1  cm−1  (Srivastava et al., 2007 ). Plant ultra-structure visualization-   Rice seedlings were tested for internal alteration due to the imparted As stress. Focusing on the qualitative analysis of the vasculature system in seedling shoots was needed. Shoots were cut into delicate thin cross-sections and preserved within liquid nitrogen storage for structural integrity, avoiding any sheer external stress on the plant anatomy. These thin sections were further coated with gold ions using a stab holder and a sputter coater (Edwards S150B), covered with a supra-thin layer of gold ions for a better resolution. Xylem, phloem, and bundle sheath were focused on for this visualization (Majumdar et al., 2019 , 2022 ). The prepared thin sections were put inside the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP) and when the inside chamber reached the vacuum condition, the sections were magnified up to 1270X with a resolution of 10 μm to observe the structural features. Statistical justifications and data analysis-   All the data represented here were analyzed for statistical reliability by using one-way ANOVA. The dependable and independent variables were considered based on their nature of involvement in this study. Graphpad Prism 6, SigmaPlot (ver. 12) and PAST (ver. 3.2.1) were used for the graphical and statistical analysis. To increase the data reliability, we performed Duncan multiple range test (DMRT) and the Mann-Whitney U  test as post-hoc analysis.  3 Results in brief Features of RBC and IO nanoparticles arsenic absorption-   Synthesized IO nanoparticles and prepared RBC were visualized for the structural features using the FE-SEM as given in Supplementary Fig. S1 . From the microscopic observations, it was evident that the biochar size was within 200 nm to 1 μm and the Fe3 O4  nanoparticles were within the 30–40 nm range. Analysis for the presence of any chemical groups in the synthesized nanoparticles was performed by FTIR and XRD, as presented in Fig. 1  . In XRD scanning, six prominent peaks were found that were similar to other literature reports showing features of Fe3 O4  nanoparticles using XRD, as shown in Fig. 1 A (Zhang et al., 2013 ; Zhuang et al., 2015 ). These observed diffraction peaks with crystal planes 220, 311, 400, 422, 511, and 440 from the XRD were prominent at 30°, 36°, 43°, 54°, 57° and 63° angles of 2θ were compared to the conventional characteristic peaks of Fe3 O4  inverse spinel structures and were similar to the peaks report mentioned in (PCPDFWIN v.2.02, PDF No. 89–0691). No additional peaks for any reactive chemical group were detected in this analysis. For further confirmation and assessments of commonly present chemical groups, the IO nanoparticles were analyzed for FTIR scanning, as shown in Fig. 1 B. The scanning wavelength range was 500–4000 cm−1 , and all the relative chemical groups were marked in the graph. The sharp peak at 1384 cm−1  might be an in-plane bending vibration of OH−  groups. The broad band at 3445 cm−1  was due to O–H stretching vibrations, indicating the presence of some moisture content in the synthesized nanoparticles. The observed bands at 1033 cm−1  and 1640 cm−1  might be due to C–H stretching and C–O bending, respectively. The presence of two prominent peaks at 577 and 632 cm−1 , which can be assigned to the Fe–O bond, confirmed the synthesized particles to be iron oxide nanoparticles (Chen et al., 2019 ; Naeem et al., 2017 ). Arsenic adsorption onto RBC and IO-doped RBC-   Adsorption of As onto the prepared conjugate of RBC and IO was visualized and quantified using EDX-FESEM, as shown in Fig. 2  . EDX was essential to identify the predominant composition of the RBC, as in Fig. 2 A, with the highest occurrence of carbon and oxygen followed by other macroelements. This EDX analysis also supported the finding and statement of nutritional input to the soil by the amended biochar. All the EDX data presented in Fig. 2  indicated the applicability of this prepared RBC as a soil quality enhancer. Adsorption of As was confirmed by the observed peaks in Fig. 2 B and D  by the RBC alone and RBC doped with IO nanoparticles, respectively. Fig. 2 C showed the perfectly doped IO particles to the RBC matrix, and it was clear that the adsorption of As onto the RBC + IO matrix was more efficient than the RBC matrix alone. The weight % of EDX-quantified As was 3.28% in the RBC + IO conjugate compared to the 3.18% of As in RBC alone. In some other repetitive measurements, the adsorption was even higher and proved that the conjugate could adsorb As up to 4.2 wt %. The content of As onto the RBC alone and RBC + IO conjugate was assessed by the EDS analysis and that gave the As content of 3.18% and 3.28% respectively. If we consider these numbers while converted to the ppm unit, then we get a difference of 1000 ppm which is promising in the case of soil clean-up perspective. Bioavailability of arsenic in soil and rice seedlings-   The total As concentration in collected soil samples was 39.27 ± 1.06 mg kg−1  whereas the bioavailability got altered due to the application of RBC and RBC + IO treatments. Tested soil samples were also diverse regarding the other elemental bioavailability and physico-chemical parameters (Supplementary Table S5 ). Pot soils were, as mentioned, kept 75% moist, which helped keep the pH within a range of 6.28–6.87, the average pH found in agricultural soils. ORP values fluctuated between −151.57 ± 2.99 mV to 178.35 ± 2.65 mV, indicating a short, reducing condition during the water application followed by a prolonged oxidized state during the drying period. Soil samples were collected from a paddy field with an organic matter of 1.29–1.44%. Supplementary Table S5  presented all the physico-chemical data as per the sampling phases. Due to the application of RBC and RBC + IO conjugate, soil pH was increased within 1 unit while the ORP was reduced by 20–25 units. Soil OM was inevitably increased due to this RBC addition, in subsequent sampling phases. These data were similar to any general paddy field physico-chemical status (Majumdar et al., 2019 ; Chowdhury et al., 2018 ). The sequential extraction process was used to separate five fractions of elemental concentrations in soil-exchangeable, carbonate-bound, Fe–Mn bound, organic matter bound, and residual concentration. Among these fractions, the first two together were considered as the bioavailable content of As and other nutritional elements in the soil (Srivastav et al., 2021 ; Upadhyay et al., 2021 ). In Fig. 3  , the bioavailability concentration of As in pot soil and the respective As concentration that was taken up by the rice seedlings are presented. The reliability of the data was checked by using the post-hoc DMRT analysis as shown in the figure. Fig. 3 A–C  presents the As bioavailability in the soil at three different RBC treatment setups and the rest 3D  to 3F  show the As content in rice seedlings. It was clear that on the 0th  day or on the initial day of the soil, available As content was more or less the same in these setups; 7.9, 7.88, and 7.45 mg kg−1  respectively in control, RBC, and RBC + IO setups. With gradual treatment and sampling phases, the bioavailability was reduced in the RBC and RBC + IO soil to 4.6 and 4.16 mg kg−1 , respectively. This reduction was observed in the 0.5% w/w RBC setup. In the other two concentrations of RBC, the result obtained were more prominent. In 1% w/w RBC treatment, the reduction was measured to be 3.28 and 2.97 mg kg−1  from 7.98 to 7.53 mg kg−1  respectively in RBC and RBC + IO soils. While in 1.5% w/w RBC treatment, the reduction was 3.6, and 3.26 mg kg−1  from 8.08, to 7.72 mg kg−1 , respectively in RBC and RBC + IO soils. Reduction of As bioavailability using biochar is similar to the other recent reports (Shaheen et al., 2022 ; Natasha et al., 2022 ). Rice seedlings also showed a similar trend in As uptake with respective pot As contents. Rice seedlings, as mentioned before, were transferred to the pot soil setups after a hydroponic growth of 25 days, and those plants were considered the 0th -day plants. But no As was found in plant tissues due to controlled growth in a hydroponic medium, hence, in Fig. 3 D–F , 0th -day plant As uptake is not shown. From the graphical plots, it was evident that the control pot having As only, had the highest plant accumulated concentrations compared to the RBC and RBC + IO treatments. With the gradual growth of the rice seedlings in the As-laden soil, all the seedlings accumulated higher As at the end of the 30th-day sampling compared to the 7th-day and 15th-day seedlings, irrespective of RBC and IO amendments. The difference was remarkable when compared between control plants and RBC or RBC + IO amended plants. Amongst these three RBC concentrations, the least As accumulation was found in 1.5% RBC-applied soils, although the 1% RBC-amended soils were also efficient and later found to be the most suitable setup for plant growth and stress management. Soil nutritional enrichments using RBC and IO conjugate-   The IO nanoparticles were applied externally and thus the Fe measurement was not considered in this case. Other essential soil nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg and Na) were quantified and presented in Fig. 4  . This figure represents the data obtained from 1% w/w RBC-applied setup and the other two data sets are given in Supplementary Fig. S2 . This 1% RBC application was proven to be the best setup for soil nutrient enrichment in terms of bioavailability. Four phases of the sampling are marked in this figure from 4A  to 4D . Data were justified by using DMRT as shown in the figure. The fixed IO concentration of 20 ppm did impart additional nutritional input by chelating the natural nutritional content present in the soil. This graphical representation shows only the bioavailable fraction of these elements. Implemented RBC was enriched in different macro and micronutrients, as also confirmed by the EDX analysis (Fig. 2 ). The suitable concentration of the IO nanoparticles as a plant supplement was determined after checking different concentrations in our previous study (Majumdar et al., 2022 ). Here the best suitable concentration (20 ppm) was directly applied to the RBC medium knowing that this IO concentration explicitly imparts a positive effect on the plant and soil system. The combined effect of RBC and IO was obtained in retaining higher bioavailability of nutritional elements in the soil setups at all four sampling phases. From the result, it was evident that the control soil contained a low content of macro-elements compared to the RBC and RBC + IO amended soils. The fold change increase was found to be 21.15%, 21.52%, 21.31%, 21.11%, and 20.81% respectively for P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na when compared control soil to the RBC + IO soils on the 7th day of sampling. At the end of the 30th day of sampling, these fold changes even got increased to 38.82%, 39.11%, 38.95%, 38.79%, and 38.56% for P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na respectively. The overall fold change observed from the 0th  day to the 30th day was within a range of 44.9–46.1% for all of these elements. Similar data trends were observed in 0.5% RBC and 1.5% RBC amended soils as given in Supplementary Fig. S2 , although, the 1.5% RBC + IO application was superior to the 0.5% RBC + IO setup. The overall fold change in 1.5% RBC amended soil was within 24.29–38.75%. Plant stress-responsive markers and enzymes production-   Rice seedlings were germinated and grown for 25 days in hydroponics Kimura B medium after which these seedlings were washed with distilled water and transferred to the experimental setups. At this point, all the plants were having almost similar physiology with no As-stress imparted. Fig. 5  , hence shows natural growth-dependent cellular ageing and stress responses at 0th -day seedlings. From the 7th day onward, As stress was measured under different treatment plants. Stress-responsive markers MDA and total proteins (5A  and 5B ) were increased rapidly in control plants that were grown in soil with As only and no RBC or IO were supplemented to the soil. But in the presence of RBC alone and RBC + IO conjugate, the markers were increased at a lower rate. The reduction of MDA production in rice seedlings using RBC and RBC + IO was calculated to be 64.88% and 72.11% at the end of the 30th day compared to the control seedling shoots. For total protein, the reductions were 57.38% and 62.13% in rice shoots on the 30th day using RBC and RBC + IO respectively. These reductions were more prominent in rice roots compared to the shoot parts. These data were similar to the other reports showing the applicability of biochar and iron nanoparticles in minimizing plant stress (Naeem et al., 2017 ; Hossain et al., 2020 ). Antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, APX, and GPX activities are presented in Fig. 5 C-F. The resulting trend was more or less similar in these enzyme contents. For SOD and CAT in seedling shoots, enzymes were produced 60.31%, 59.11% and 55.44%, 53.97% less in the RBC and RBC + IO setups respectively compared to the control plant. These two enzymes act concurrently to reduce the reactive ionic stress generated within the plant cell, hence, the generation and reduction of these enzymes were closely associated. APX and GPX in rice seedling shoots were also generated lesser in quantity by 79.63%, 44.88%, and 68.1%, 66.3% respectively in RBC and RBC + IO supplemented plants. In all these markers and enzymes, the quantity was higher in seedling roots compared to the shoots, except for the total protein content. These data are presented from the 1% RBC setup while the rest of the results of 0.5% and 1.5% RBC applied plant markers and enzymes are given in Supplementary Fig. S3 . These stress-responsive markers’ data statistically valid or not was checked by performing the Mann-Whitney U  test as a post-hoc analysis of the results. Detailed values are given in Supplementary Table S6  where significant data were highlighted. From the data, it became evident that from 0th  day grown plants, the rest of the plants showed higher stress responses. Plant anatomical changes under RBC and IO treatments-   Rice seedlings were closely monitored for any stress response activity by checking enzyme production as well as physiological changes. Rice plants were reported to have different internal anatomy structures under variable stress and treatment conditions (Majumdar et al., 2021 , 2022 ). In Fig. 6  , 30th-day-grown rice seedlings were visualized under FE-SEM for internal vascular structures and the changes observed. The xylem, phloem, and bundle sheath of seedling shoots are marked as Xy, Ph, and Bs in the image. Control plants grown with As stress only suffered severe tissue breakage and fragility compared to the RBC and RBC + IO supplemented plants. Rice seedlings which were grown with 0.5% and 1.5% RBC, also showed similar structural integrity as in this presented seedling grown with 1% RBC. Structural confinements and cellular integrity were prominent in both RBC and the RBC + IO conjugate, but repeated observations proved that the RBC + IO conjugate was even better for maintaining plant rigidity.  4 Discussions Characterization and applicability of RBC and RBC + IO conjugate for soil management-  In South-East Asian countries crop residues, mainly straws from rice and wheat plants are dumped in the field after harvesting followed by an in-field open-air burning, producing a pile of crop ash (Chen et al., 2019 ; Porichha et al., 2021 ). This ash content has a considerable amount of biochar within it and influences soil properties to a greater extent (Anand et al., 2022 ). Burning of such crop residues is not recommended and controlled incineration should be practiced. A controlled process of crop residual burning can produce biochar with lower ash content with further potential for field applications. The study idea was to testify to the potential applicability of rice biochar alone and doped with iron oxide nanoparticles in the context of As bioavailability minimization and nutritional enrichment in the soil. It was documented earlier that biochars with impregnated additional molecules like zero-valent iron nanoparticles or iron oxide nanoparticles could be efficient in removing toxic elements from soil-aqueous systems (Zou et al., 2016 ; Qian et al., 2017 ). IO nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized as shown in Fig. 1 , without any doping to the RBC. It was essential to know the status of the synthesized IO nanoparticles as a pure composite without any unnecessary contamination. The XRD analysis revealed the presence of single-phase crystalline inverse-spinel of Fe3 O4  structures that were matched with the PCPDFWIN v.2.02, PDF No. 89–0691 for magnetite (Zhuang et al., 2015 ). The peaks obtained from the XRD diffractogram suggested that the synthesized IO nanoparticles were pure and no other additional peaks were observed in this analysis indicating the absence of any other impurities in these nanoparticles. FTIR, on the other side, showed different chemical groups present in the IO samples and as per the markings, it was clarified that the iron-oxygen (F–O) bonds were predominant at two specific points- 632 and 577. The 580 and its surrounding region specified the presence of this F–O bond coming from the iron oxide state at Fe3 O4  form. The 632 and its nearby region indicated the presence of the F–O bond, which might have been coming from the Fe2 O3  form (Hwang et al., 2014 ). The freshly prepared Fe3 O4  nanoparticles had some additional Fe2 O3  particles which were gradually converted to the Fe3 O4 . The study suggested the presence of Fe–O, OH, C–H, and C–O bonds play an essential role in toxic metals and metalloids immobilization on the surface of biochar and IO-doped biochar (Kamran et al., 2020 ), as it was found in this study also. To propose RBC as a potential adsorbent, it was essential to analyze the As removal capacity of RBC alone. It was expected that the RBC + IO conjugate would have a higher degree of As adsorption which was confirmed by using the EDX. Fig. 2  confirmed the potential of RBC and the IO nanoparticles in terms of macronutrient enrichment and As surface sorption. Several studies have been conducted on rice husk biochar, wheat straw biochar, and other crop residues for removing soil inorganic pollutants, especially metal(loid)s (Zhang et al., 2022 ). The present study correlates to these earlier reports. As expected, the sorption of As to the RBC + IO conjugate was greater than the RBC alone and it can provide a solution to an anthropogenic threat of burning rice residues after harvesting, which is increasing in recent times (Porichha et al., 2021 ). Results obtained from RBC and RBC + IO setups indicated the adsorption of As was considerably high and delineated with other earlier reports (Zhang et al., 2013 ; Shaheen et al., 2022 ; Natasha et al., 2022 ). Earlier reports suggested that the amendment of biochar alone or iron nanoparticle-doped increased soil pH, although marginally, yet effective in influencing nutrient bioavailability (Wang et al., 2014 ; Ding et al., 2016 ). A combined application of biochar and zero-valent iron nanoparticles was found to reduce soil ORP while increasing pH and OM resulting in the sorption of soil pollutants (Wang et al., 2022 ). These previous reports are well aligned with our present data trend as given in Supplementary Table S5 . The influence of such small alterations in soil physico-chemical parameters was prominently reflected in the nutrient bioavailability. From the data presented in Fig. 3 , it becomes evident that the bioavailability of As in soil got reduced due to the application of RBC and RBC + IO conjugate. Biochar can increase the organic matter content in the soil which in turn minimizes the mobility of soil pollutants (Alburquerque et al., 2014 ; Ahmad et al., 2014 ), hence the As became less available to the rice seedlings. With gradual setting time in the soil, RBC and RBC + IO improved the plant growth by reducing As bioavailability and uptaken concentrations. In a study by Tan et al. (2017) , the iron oxide doped rice straw biochar was found to be efficient in adsorbing and removal of cadmium to a greater extent compared to the simple biochar. This supports our finding in the present study where RBC + IO was proved to be better than RBC alone in minimizing As stress from the rice seedlings. The 1% RBC was clearly better than the 0.5% RBC treatment due to having greater organic matter content. Here it is important to note that the application of IO NPs also played a crucial role in retaining the partial As content to the RBC. In the case of 0.5% RBC + IO, the free chemical groups within the organic matter content were low, making the lower adsorption of As whereas the 1% RBC + IO the adsorption sites were better occupied by the As. In 1.5% RBC + IO, free spaces were greater than the As adsorption resulting in the reactivity of these chemical groups and ions within the RBC. Such activity of the RBC within the soil makes changes in the redox status of the RBC + IO conjugate and releases a partial fraction of the As content from the conjugate (Karimzadeh et al., 2017 ; Majumdar et al., 2020b ). That is why the 1% setup was found as the best treatment setup. Soil nutrient enrichment and plant stress management-   Studies have shown the potential of biochar in improving crop productivity by 10–25% greater compared to the control or no-treatment crops (Lal et al., 2021 ; Diatta et al., 2020 ). This improvement was also imparted to the rice seedlings by enhancing the soil nutritional quality in this study (Fig. 4 ). Soil nutrients are essential for plant growth and productivity while magnetic biochars can increase this nutrient availability and rhizospheric confinement manyfold (Yi et al., 2020 ; Natasha et al., 2022 ). Implementing 1% RBC and 1% RBC + IO greatly enhanced the bioavailability of the macronutrients in soil. Iron nanoparticles are widely researched and reported as a sustainable tool for increasing soil-plant nutrient availability by surface entrapment (Joseph et al., 2015 ; De Souza et al., 2019 ; Tawfik et al., 2021 ). Application of these IO nanoparticles would have provided a surface area and changeable redox conditions to the soil macro-nutrients which made this IO amendment more useful along with the RBC. Fig. 4  is suggestive enough that the application of RBC was indeed beneficial for the nutritional enrichment of the subjected soils, although, the application of IO, doped with the RBC was even more exciting in terms of soil quality enhancement. Nutritional enrichment in the soil, in turn, promotes soil microbial communities to facilitate As resistance and reduce the stress on the plant system indirectly (Afsal et al., 2020 ). While reducing the As stress from the rice seedlings, it was expected that the plant biochemical expressions will also change concerning the RBC and RBC + IO treatments. Fig. 5  shows the lower production of stress markers and antioxidant enzymes in RBC and RBC + IO amended seedlings proving the fact that these treatments can be applied in real-time field cultivations to minimize As toxicity in rice. In our previous study, it was proved that the application of iron nanoparticles at a 20 ppm rate, significantly reduced As stress from the associated plants and minimized stress-responsive marker productions (Majumdar et al., 2022 ). Besides, biochar is a widely accepted tool for minimizing plant abiotic stresses (Rizwan et al., 2016 ; Mansoor et al., 2021 ). To prove the statements from these studies, it was necessary to conduct different biochemical analyses of As-stressed rice plants in the presence and absence of RBC and RBC + IO. The obtained result was self-explanatory by showing the efficacy of these amendments in reducing the MDA and total protein production. These two are the primary markers for stress response where any stress imparted to the plant cell creates lipid peroxidation, detected by the assessment of MDA and overall plant protein generation to tackle the developed stress (Shri et al., 2009 ; Majumdar and Bose, 2017 ; Majumdar, 2021 ). Plants that are proven to be applicable in phytoremediation, although can tolerate As stress at a higher degree (Singh et al., 2022 ). Under abiotic stresses like As toxicity, superoxide radicals are generated within plant cells, and SOD minimizes that radical stress by converting those to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Further, these hydrogen peroxides get neutralized by CAT by producing oxygen and water (Srivastava et al., 2007 ; Majumdar and Bose, 2018 ). APX and GPX are also involved in minimizing the intra-cellular destabilization caused by the hydrogen peroxide at different compartments of a cell (Upadhyay et al., 2020 , 2022 ). From the obtained results of these biochemical analyses, it was proved with the growing phases of rice seedlings, RBC and RBC + IO reduced As stress and minimized the production of these stress markers and antioxidant enzymes as compared to the control plants. Rice plant roots were found to be more productive for these stress-responsive markers and enzymes compared to the shoot due to the closer proximity of the As in the soil system. Transportation of As to the upper plant tissues gradually decreases hence, the expression of these antioxidant enzymes was less in the shoot part (Upadhyay et al., 2022 ). Further, As stress had any effect or not on the rice plant's internal ultra-structure was crucial to assess. Electron microscopic observations (Fig. 6 ) made it clear that control plants having As stress suffered anatomical distress by losing the rigidity of plant xylem, phloem, and bundle sheath conformation. Under RBC and RBC + IO amendments, such structural integrity was less affected and a similar effect was also observed in our earlier studies (Majumdar et al., 2019 , 2022 ). In a study by Srivastav et al. (2021) , detailed molecular assessments were conducted related to the As stress on rice plants and it was found that the internal integrity distortion was due to the suppression of cellulose synthase genes CESA3 and CESA4. Downregulation of these genes under As stress causes a very low production rate of plant cellulose, hence, the internal anatomy gets destabilized. RBC and RBC + IO conjugate application minimized this As toxicity in the rice seedlings leading to higher cellulose production which in turn resulted in a better internal ultra-structure of xylem, phloem, and bundle sheath. Considering all these facts proven from this present study and previous pieces of literature, it is recommended to use the combination of RBC + IO conjugate for the soil As immobilization along with soil nutritional quality enhancement for better crop production.  5 Conclusion This study was conducted to assess rice plant biochemical responses under the treatment of rice biochar and iron oxide nanoparticles-doped rice biochar amendment to minimize arsenic bioavailability and nutritional enrichment. A properly controlled synthesis of IO nanoparticles and pyrolyzed RBC were characterized and different application rates were finalized. A thorough analysis of soil-plant samples at four different sampling phases, it was established that RBC + IO conjugate was more efficient in reducing As availability in soil, hence lesser plant uptake. The conjugate was also proved to be better than the control soil or RBC alone in terms of P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na bioavailability increment in soil and rice seedlings. Fold change of As bioavailability reduction and macro-nutrient increment were significantly higher in IO-doped RBC. The applicability of this conjugate in the real-time field was confirmed by the assessment of MDA and total proteins, being As-responsive stress markers in rice seedlings that were produced in lesser quantities under this conjugate amendment. Antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, APX, and GPX were also less generated under RBC + IO amended seedlings compared to the control plant. Finally, internal anatomy integrity assessment proved that the plant vascular systems were also enhanced under this RBC + IO conjugate compared to the As-stressed rice seedlings. In this whole experiment, 1% RBC+ 20 ppm IO application was found to be the most suitable rate of biochar for soil-crop quality maintenance.
