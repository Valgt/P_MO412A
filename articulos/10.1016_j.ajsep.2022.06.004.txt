                  In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and agreed that it is vital for current and future generations to pursue 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Science, education, and sport are seen as drivers and important enablers of sustainable development (SD). Yet, even though all professions are called upon to embed SD into their work to facilitate change, and even though sport and exercise psychology professionals could play an important role in this process, there seems to be only little awareness of the need to contribute to SD as a discipline. This paper aims at changing this by elaborating on the reasons why sport and exercise psychologists should care about SD and the SDGs; it explains how psychologists and their clients can benefit from using the principles of SD to guide their professional work and decision making. It will be illustrated how sport and exercise psychology professionals can promote sustainable physical activity and sustainable elite sport, and how they can contribute to the achievement of internationally agreed societal, and global goals as practitioners, as teachers, and as researchers. Furthermore, the normative dimensions of the concept of SD are being discussed.

Keywords Sustainable development goals  Sustainability  Societal accountability  Normative values    The field of sport and exercise psychology (SEP) is concerned with the development and application of psychological theories to understand and modify behavior regarding sport performance as well as participation in physical exercise to increase health and well-being (APA, 2020a ). This definition clearly denotes that one of the main tasks of SEP professionals is behavior change, and another one is the promotion of health and well-being. It is important to realize that, just like any educational efforts (Hattie, 2009 ), behavior change is not neutral, and that it is determined by a change agent's decision making, (health) goals, and moral values. However, only a little attention is given to the questions how the desired states of behavior are being determined and how health and well-being are being defined. In this paper, I will argue that SEP professionals should use the so-called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide their professional work and decision-making. By considering principles and definitions of sustainable development (SD), SEP professionals can sustainably support their clients while at the same time contributing to better global health levels and the achievement of crucial internationally agreed-on societal goals. This paper will synthesize relevant key publications, it will not provide a review of publications relating to SD and sports or physical activity in general. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance of the topic SD in the field of SEP, and to promote the acceptance of one's professional responsibility for societal and global goals. To achieve this aim, first, a brief explanation of the key concepts of sustainability will be given. In the main part of the text, it will be subsequently discussed why and how SEP professionals should and can consider principles of SD in their work. Here, the discipline's core topics physical exercise  and elite sport performance , as well as different professional roles, namely practitioner, researcher, and/or teacher , will be discussed separately. The paper concludes with a consideration of the normative dimensions of the concept SD and an outlook. The conceptual structure of the paper is also visually summarised in Fig. 1  . Key concepts: SD and the UN's sustainable development goals In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which centers around 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN. General Assembly, 2015 ). The UN created the 17 SDGs as a normative framework in response to the risks the planet and humanity face, e.g., the climate crisis, inequality, and hazards to good global health and well-being (UN. General Assembly, 1987 ). Example goals are good health and well-being for all (SDG 3), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and climate action (SDG 13); each goal has specific sub-targets, for instance the reduction of pre-mature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third for SDG 3. A summary of all 17 SDGs is displayed in Fig. 2  , a list of all 169 targets can be found in the Agenda 2030 (UN. General Assembly, 2015 ). The UN denotes the SDGs as “a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere” (UN. Sustainable Development Goals, 2021a ). As the name implies, all 17 SDGs center around aspects of SD, which can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (UN. General Assembly, 1987 ). More concrete, SD can be seen as a continuous negotiation process identifying compromises to achieve intra- and intergenerational justice, and a balance between the three intertwined sustainability dimensions: the socio-cultural , the environmental , and the economic interests  (UNESCO, 2021 ). These three dimensions are referred to as the three pillars of sustainability and it is important to understand that they are interdependent, applicable on a local and global level, and that they relate to nearly every decision an individual makes. For example, the decision to buy new running shoes in Europe will mean that money is spent on a product of a certain company (economic impact), which uses more or less recycled or renewable resources and produces more or less waste (ecological impact), and which does or does not ensure ethical production of their products, relating for instance to rights, safety, and health of most likely non-western workers (social impact). This example demonstrates that the professional actions made by an exercise psychologist who succeeds in engaging her/his client in running has consequences that go beyond the targeted behavior change. Some SEP professionals might think that it asks too much of them to think of such consequences, but it is important to acknowledge these links between SD and one's own work. The next section will explain why ethical decision-making in SEP also means paying attention to the overarching societal goals specified by the SDGs.  Why sport and exercise psychology professionals should care about SD Even though the SDGs represent an internationally agreed political agenda for several years, and notwithstanding the UN's urgent call for action to pursue the SDGs, not everybody is aware of this call as the first; the goals themselves as the second; and, one's responsibility in contributing to the achievement of these goals as the third (Smaniotto et al., 2020 ; UN. Secretary-General, 2019 ). While knowledge about the goals can be acquired quickly (see Fig. 2 ; UN: Sustainable Development Goals, 2021a ), it seems to be harder to promote an acceptance of personal responsibility (Frantz & Mayer, 2009 ). In addition to appealing to one's private individual responsibility, the UN also calls on the responsibility of all  professions to embed SD into their work to facilitate change (UN. General Assembly, 2015 ). This very general appeal easily leads to a diffusion of responsibility (Frantz & Mayer, 2009 ), and many professionals might not feel responsible to act. Thus, this paper firstly aims at reminding specifically SEP professionals of the general responsibility every  occupation should take on to tackle current societal challenges. Many SEP professionals who adhere to specific codes of ethics and conduct might not be aware that these codes also ask them to consider such a general responsibility in their work. The International Society of Sport Psychology (2020) , for instance, includes a social responsibility principle in their ethical principles, specifying that “members should be aware of their professional and scientific responsibilities to the community and the society in which they work and live” (p. 1). The British Psychological Society's (2018)  code of ethics and conduct furthermore acknowledges that psychologists should consider the “Communities and shared values within them” (p. 5); “Impacts on the broader environment – living or otherwise” (p. 5); “Respect for the welfare of human, non-humans and the living world” (p. 7), and “their responsibilities to persons and peoples, to the general public, and to the profession and science of Psychology” (p. 7). The British Psychological Society even refers to supplementary online guidance on new challenges “in a rapidly changing world, where new ethical challenges come from many sources. These include the unprecedented opportunities provided by innovations in science and technology as well as the threats posed by climate change and global conflicts" (p. 2). Thus, even if the concept of SD is not explicitly acknowledged in the main codes of ethics relevant to SEP professionals (Etzel & Skvarla, 2017 ), most current ethical guidelines already call for sustainable action in an indirect way. A second reason to care about SD is that one of the main goals in SEP, the protection and promotion of health and well-being (APA, 2020a ), is at the center of the concept of SD (Jaipal, 2014 ). By paying attention to the principles of SD in their work, SEP professionals can improve health and well-being levels in a more holistic way. For example, if an exercise intervention does not only aim at increasing exercise levels but also at improving intergenerational contact and understanding, this can benefit health and well-being levels more strongly (Minghetti, Donath, Zahner, Hanssen & Faude, 2021 ). Thirdly, it is important to acknowledge that sport and exercise psychological work offers unique opportunities to contribute to SD and that SEP professionals can play a prominent role in promoting SD. On the one hand, psychologists in general can be seen as experts in studying and influencing processes underlying behavior (APA, 2020b ). They can thus contribute to the understanding and shaping of sustainable as well as unsustainable decision-making and behavior (Di Fabio, 2017 ; Jaipal, 2014 ). On the other hand, as earlier stated, many aspects of sport and exercise psychological work revolve around behavior change. The SEP professional is in the unique position to support others in adopting new behavior – this can be seen as a great window of opportunity to work toward (more) sustainable behavior at the same time. Furthermore, the discipline's core topic sport  is regarded to be “an important enabler of sustainable development” (UN. General Assembly, 2015 , p. 10) as it can promote development, peace, empowerment, health, education, and social inclusion (UN. General Assembly, 2015 ). The next sections will illustrate these points further by depicting different ways in which SEP professionals can contribute to a more sustainable future.  How sport and exercise psychology professionals can make a difference SEP professionals hold many different positions and engage in a multitude of different tasks. It is impossible to outline all possible actions which could be undertaken to promote SD. Instead, this paper will help readers to identify which SD-related issues are generally relevant for practitioners, researchers, and teachers, and how they can start addressing them. This will be done by separately reflecting on four areas: 1) SD and exercise participation, 2) SD and elite sport performance, 3) SD in research, 4) SD in higher education teaching. SD and exercise participation The main question which needs to be answered is: How do physical exercise and sport performance relate to the SDGs and processes of SD? For the topic of physical exercise, several answers to this question have already been provided. In 2016, the Bangkok declaration on physical activity for global health and sustainable development was formulated. It briefly highlighted the need and opportunities to reduce physical inactivity and to contribute to eight different SDGs (SDG 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, and 16; ISPAH, 2017 ). Publications by for instance Dai and Menhas (2020) , Lindsey and Chapman (2017) , and Nigg and Nigg (2021)  present more detailed guidance on how physical activity can contribute to SD. Nigg and Nigg's (2021)  position paper considers the role of practice and research, making it most relevant for the field of exercise psychology. The authors explore how engagement in physical activity relates to the different SDGs and outline how physical activity can contribute “to improving malnutrition (SDG 2), health behaviors (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), reducing inequalities (SDG 10), sustainable cities (SDG 12), and peace (SDG 16) […] [and] sustainable consumption (SDG 11) and combating climate change (SDG 13)” (p. 945). The authors conclude that physical activity is not solely an individual health behavior, but that physical activity and behaviors associated with it can positively (or negatively, see below) impact planetary health and SD. To give a few specific examples: Exercise engagement can for instance go along with a healthier diet and transportation choices which lead to fewer carbon emissions (SDGs 12 & 13), and it can increase skills like cooperation and leadership, thus promoting social inclusion and empowerment (SDG 10) (Lawson, 2005 ; Nigg & Nigg, 2021 ) (for more examples and figures depicting the relationship between physical activity and the SDGs see Dai & Menhas, 2020 , and Nigg & Nigg, 2021 ). The last example highlights that engagement in exercise can also increase general competencies which are themselves beneficial for SD, a process called “education for sustainable development” (ESD2  2 ESD can be defined as an interdisciplinary approach to lifelong learning which aims at developing general core competencies (consisting of knowledge, skills, and willingness) for SD; learners should be empowered to make informed decisions and responsible action for environmental integrity, economic viability, and a just and healthy current and future society (UNESCO, 2020 ).  ). It has often been stated that even in extracurricular sports settings there is great potential for ESD (Düx & Rauschenbach, 2016 ; Osborne, 2012 ): Team sports participation can for instance promote fairness, respect, and tolerance (also referred to as sportsmanship), and physical exercise in natural settings can raise one's awareness of the natural environment (Goldstein & Iso-Ahola, 2006 ; Krein, 2008 ). However, as learning from exercise-related experiences does not always occur automatically, reflection might be needed to facilitate this process (Klaperski-van der Wal, 2022 ; Rieckmann, 2016a ). Based on the connections between SD/ESD and physical exercise as outlined above, two important tasks of SEP professionals who want to contribute to SD can be elucidated3  3 This applies to every SEP professional who is concerned with influencing exercise behavior to increase health and well-being, e.g., physical activity counselors, and academics investigating determinants or effects of exercise behavior.  : First, SEP professionals should encourage their clients to reflect on and learn from exercise-related experiences whenever possible (i.e., facilitate ESD). Second, instead of focusing on individual health only, SEP professionals can take planetary health and SD into account by promoting “sustainable physical activity”. Nigg and Nigg (2021)  define such activities as "those activities that are conducted with sufficient duration, intensity and frequency for promoting health, yet without excessive expenditure of energy for food, transportation, training facilities or equipment. Sustainable physical activities have low environmental impact and they are […] economically acceptable and accessible. Sustainable physical activities also promote social inclusion, empowerment, and the maintenance of cultural heritage and practices” (p. 949). This means SEP professionals should pay attention to the principles of SD when setting (new) goals for a client. To make this more specific, the SEP professional who tries to support clients in becoming more active could, for example, recommend activities that do not require using a car and which also have the potential to promote inclusion in the community. In addition to these implications for practitioners working in the field, academics are called upon to investigate the new concept of sustainable physical activity. Nigg and Nigg (2021)  summarized a multitude of important questions to address, like for instance the need to determine what type of activities can be characterized as sustainable, or the need to examine how interventions can best promote these activities (see Nigg & Nigg, 2021 , p. 949). There are hardly any systematic efforts to scientifically examine exercise-related ESD outside the formal physical education context and thus good evidence on how exercise can be used to promote ESD is still lacking (Klaperski-van der Wal, 2022 ; Nigg & Nigg, 2021 ). Furthermore, it is also important to acknowledge Nigg and Nigg's warning that engagement in physical activity “also has the potential to contribute and reinforce socio-cultural and ecological unsustainability” (p. 948). Exclusion from sport teams might, for instance, be causing individuals to feel discriminated against, sport facilities and equipment bring about ecological costs, and some amateur sportsmen might use performance-enhancing drugs and thus damage their health (Henning & Dimeo, 2018 ; Nigg & Nigg, 2021 ). Thus, physical activity engagement is no panacea but can also counteract SD. In addition to this, it is possible that a strong focus on sustainable effects or certain outcomes of physical activities can negatively impact exercise engagement. Seven (2006) , for example, warns in relation to physical education and non-sport-related learning objectives that the natural meaning structure of sport could be overshadowed by these extra-sporting objectives. Sports and exercise should not only be used by policymakers in an instrumental way as this could lead to reductions in more autonomous motivation and enjoyment and ultimately lower exercise engagement (Teixeira, Carraça, Markland, Silva & Ryan, 2012 ). Therefore, future studies need to examine potential tradeoffs between goals of sustainable physical activity, unsustainable side-effects, and negative effects on exercise motivation and enjoyment.  SD and elite sport performance Even though the question of how elite sport performance is related to SD and the SDGs has not received a lot of attention in the field of sport psychology, scholars have discussed the need and chances for “sustainable elite sport” (Dohlsten, Barker-Ruchti & Lindgren, 2020 , p. 2) for several decades now (Dohlsten et al., 2020 ). Barker and colleagues (2014)  propose that sustainable sport performance relates to first, the long-term development of athletes’ health and wellbeing, and second, the contribution of elite sport to the social, environmental, and economic needs of communities and future generations. The authors also explicate that the sport system in its current form hampers sustainable sport performance considerably: Due to a predominant market logic-based value system an attitude of performance maximization at any cost and a quasi-Darwinist selection process in a precarious context are prevailing (Barker et al., 2014; Dohlsten et al., 2020 ). This often results in risky, unhealthy, and unethical practices and outcomes like substance abuse (Blank, Kopp, Niedermeier, Schnitzer & Schobersberger, 2016 ), athlete burnout (Gustafsson, DeFreese & Madigan, 2017 ), and abusive behavior (Yukhymenko-Lescroart, Brown & Paskus, 2015 ), and leaves little room for the consideration of any consequences beyond an athlete's performance levels. One could thus conclude that elite sport is just inherently unsustainable and that the whole system first needs to drastically change to become sustainable (Dohlsten et al., 2020 ). However, instead of engaging in such black-and-white thinking, Barker and colleagues (2014) propose that today's elite sport can be more or less sustainable and that all stakeholders in the field can and should start to take steps towards a more sustainable elite sport. This corresponds with the International Olympic Committee's appeal to develop healthy, sustainable, and successful athlete careers (Bergeron et al., 2015 ). Questions practitioners, as well as researchers, should start asking are for instance: “How can sport support the long-term development of athletes’ health and well-being? How can sport develop in ways that serve the social, environmental, and economic needs of existing communities [and future generations]?” (Barker et al., 2014, p. 5). SEP professionals play a key role in pursuing these questions. On the one hand, because they belong to the stakeholders in the field, on the other hand, because they guide and advise the coaches and athletes, who will in the end be the ones making the decisions about their health, well-being, and goals. Thus, what are possible answers to the two questions posed above? When it comes to the promotion of athletes’ long-term well-being, health, and development, many SEP professionals will probably already engage in sustainability-related activities without consciously acknowledging this. Yet, there is little empirical evidence in this area. Most studies in the field have been conducted in the coaching context (Dohlsten et al., 2020 ). A study with Swedish coaches at the national level showed for instance, that all interviewed coaches were already working towards sustainable elite performance even if they were not calling it that way: They were listening to their athletes’ voices, engaging in dialog, and focusing on their players’ health and well-being, while still achieving competitive success (Lindgren & Barker-Ruchti, 2017 ). Other studies have shown that a stronger focus on learning and reflection can positively influence athletes’ development and performance (Dohlsten et al., 2020 ; Grahn, 2014 ). Thus, the SEP professionals who are already using such a holistic and athlete-centered approach should feel encouraged to pursue this way further; additionally, they should consciously align their work with the principles of sustainable elite sport performance. To do so is not just a matter of applying a trendy label, instead, it will help professionals to transparently determine and name their overarching goals and motives (see introduction). It will raise athletes’ awareness of the importance of holistic and long-term planning and allow SEP professionals to better support athletes who want to think and act more sustainably. In a recent study, Dohlsten et al. (2020)  found that many elite athletes already expressed a wish to learn "how to think sustainably (e.g., prioritizing health, well-being and social relevance)" (Dohlsten et al., 2020 , p. 13), but that a lack of support hindered them from doing so. This reflects the clear need for further education and training about ways to promote sustainable long-term growth for athletes and support staff members (Dohlsten et al., 2020 ) – another task that SEP professionals could fulfill considering their educational training expertise. Regarding the second question stated above, SEP professionals can guide elite athletes in finding ways in which elite sport can better serve the social, environmental, and economic needs of others. Athletes are seen as role models (Barker et al., 2014; Lindsey & Chapman, 2017 ) and their own behavior can for instance serve as a model for fitness and good health (SDG 3), gender equality, and reduced inequalities (SDG 5, SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), and peace and justice (SDG 16). Various examples of such behaviors can be found, e.g., Andrea Petkovic and Andy Murray who advocate equal pay for female tennis players (New York Times, 2016 ), the football club Forest Green Rovers who pledged to become climate neutral (UN. Climate Change, 2018 ), or NBA basketball players protesting for racial justice (Deng, 2020 ). This shows that there are chances for athletes to contribute to the social, environmental, and economic needs of communities and future generations; SEP professionals can try to transparently facilitate this process, for instance by addressing SD goals in their skills training, and by reflecting on sports-specific learning experiences to promote general life skills (Barker et al., 2014)—as of course, elite sports possess the same potential for education for sustainable development (ESD) as leisure-time physical activity. However, just like it has been stated regarding physical exercise and SD, further sport psychological research in this area is warranted. The evidence stemming from studies with coaches is helpful, but systematic examinations of different ways in which a SEP professional can promote sustainable elite sport are needed to better inform sustainable sport psychological practice.  SD in research The points above have illustrated how practitioners can consider the principles of SD in their work. Yet, it has become clear that much more research is needed to allow practitioners to make well-informed evidence-based choices on how they can promote SD in their work. This demonstrates why the 2030 Agenda has put a clear societal demand on researchers  and sees science as key driver and enabler of SD (Schneider et al., 2019 ; UN. Scientific Advisory Board, 2016 ). Researchers are needed to generate knowledge that helps to tackle the challenges formulated in the 17 SDGs. In addition to paying more attention to SD regarding the discipline's core topics (see points discussed above), researchers in the field of SEP can also contribute to SD by using their discipline-specific knowledge and expertise to contribute to SD research outside their own subject area. Of course, there are other psychological sub-disciplines whose main interest lies in exploring issues related to SD, for instance, environmental psychology. However, when examining publications in other areas, it becomes apparent that the field of SEP offers unique expertise and methods which have the potential to also inform research related to SD. Psychological skills training, for instance, has been thoroughly examined and is widely used in SEP; yet, there are hardly any studies that examine how e.g., imagery can be used to promote cognitions and behavior for sustainable behavior. The few studies which can be found in this field investigated the type of mental images people have of nature and their relationship with cognition and pro-environmental outcomes (Engel, Vaske & Bath, 2021 ; Thomas-Walters, McNulty & Veríssimo, 2020 ); what seems to be missing is the exploration of imagery as a skill to practice a sustainable behavior like it is being done in sport psychology. It could, for instance, be examined whether imagery is a suitable method to minimize one's ecological footprint or to make more sustainable decisions at work by visualizing local and global consequences. This is just one specific example, and there are many more sport and exercise psychological topics that can be linked to sustainable behavior and sustainable behavior change. It would be beneficial if SEP professionals explored these potential links with their research topics. Furthermore, insights from related disciplines, e.g., on sport for development, outdoor education, or intercultural competence through sport education (Puente-Maxera, Méndez-Giménez & Martínez de Ojeda, 2020 ; Prince, 2017 ; Schulenkorf, 2017 ), can be used much more to inform our work. Such inter- and intradisciplinary collaborations require initiative, cooperation, and a widening of one's thematical horizon. It is not a coincidence that these behaviors are also regarded to be part of the set of skills being key to success in the 21st century (Voogt & Pareja Roblin, 2010 ). Another important point, that actually relates to researchers of all disciplines, is to pay more attention to how one's research methods and choices align with the UN's call for SD. Of course, investigated topics can relate to sustainability and the SDGs, but it is also important to reflect on one's own research approach. Some important aspects to consider here are, for instance, gender equality and reduced inequality (SDG 5, SDG 10), partnerships, and good health and well-being for all (SDGs 3, SDG 17); e.g., with regard to heterogeneous sampling, the conception of research questions which consider the needs of all socioeconomic groups, and open science commitment. To act in line with the call for more partnerships and well-being for everybody around the world, it should furthermore be considered whether more international collaborations can lead to more generalizable findings and better knowledge sharing with developing countries. Important contributions have been made in this field (Ryba, Stambulova, Si & Schinke, 2013 ), and most sport and exercise psychological associations try to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (e.g., AASP, 2016 ; FEPSAC, 2018 ); the Association for Applied Sport Psychology even specifically demands diversity in research (AASP, 2016 ). To add authority to these requests, journals could start asking researchers to explicitly comment on how their study relates to aspects of SD. It is obvious that not every single study will be perfectly aligned with the ideas of SD, but a journal sustainability statement could make academics feel more responsible and encouraged to reflect on their work and to relate topics like diversity, equity, and inclusion to their own research. It could contribute to making position statements of our professional organizations more tangible and more colleagues aware of the many links between their work and SD principles; it should, just like this paper, encourage us to act in line with these principles more often.  SD in higher education teaching Teachers/educators who work in higher education, irrespective of their specific discipline, are educating future change agents who will shape the society, the environment, and the economy in the future. It is important to not only teach students to do well in academia but to teach them how to do well as citizens of the world (Herweg et al., 2017 ). Education should not be limited to knowledge and skills important in a specialized area, but it should enable learners to engage in today's and tomorrow's society successfully and responsibly (Herweg et al., 2017 ; Voogt & Pareja Roblin, 2010 ). Thus, this paper wants to encourage the SEP professionals who engage in teaching, whether as a lecturer, a professor, or a supervisor, to address SD in their teaching. By this, the need for education and development in this area (Dohlsten et al., 2020 ) can hopefully be better satisfied. There are different ways in which teachers/educators can incorporate SD and promote ESD4  4 In the ESD literature, two main learning orientations are being discussed: A) An instrumental approach that aims at promoting knowledge, awareness, behavior, and positive values linked to SD, leading towards (more) sustainable behavior. B) An emancipatory approach, aiming at the promotion of more general competencies like critical thinking and reflection on SD (Vare & Scott, 2007 ; Wals, 2011 ). A focus on solely the instrumental approach does not seem beneficial; ideally, both approaches are being adopted.   in their teaching. They can for instance make small changes to the contents of a class, e.g., when in a lecture about team processes the links between SD and skills like cooperation and communication are being highlighted. Teachers/educators can also adjust didactics and learning goals to make classes more student-centered, interactive, and authentic, e.g., by using problem-based learning, real-life cases, or tasks requiring systems thinking. Learning goals can furthermore be complemented by educational goals in line with the ideas of ESD, for instance, affective changes, growth in critical thinking skills or global stewardship (Klaperski, 2021 ; Rieckmann, 2016b ). Ideally, such changes are being implemented with institutional and interdisciplinary support, but even individuals without any further support can already make meaningful adjustments to their courses. A more detailed description of ways to incorporate SD in one's teaching and to promote ESD would exceed the scope of this text, but readers can find further information and very helpful guidance in for instance Herweg et al. (2017) , Klaperski, Zimmermann, Darsley, Ruckelshauß and Herweg. (2021) , and Sterling (2011) . It is very likely that many academics will be hesitant about the suggestions made in the preceding paragraph (Sterling, 2011 ). As it is common to experience high workloads while having only a few resources available in the academic context, this reaction is very comprehensible. However, while it can require some additional investment at first, it is important to realize that the effort will very likely pay off: Not only do students and policies increasingly demand a bigger focus on SD and ESD, but the incorporation of SD into one's teaching can also enrich the curriculum and increase teaching quality (Sterling, 2011 ).   Dealing with the normative dimensions of SD There will surely also be teachers and researchers who are concerned about the call for action formulated in this paper as SD includes a normative compass of what is “good” and “bad.” Academics often hold the opinion that their teaching and research are and should be free of normative values, that it should be purely based on objective evidence and facts. However, it is important to realize that neither teaching nor research is and will ever be value-neutral (Kläy, Zimmermann & Schneider, 2015 ). All evidence scientists gather is socially constructed and embedded in a belief system, like the paradigm of economic growth or the concept of competitive peak performance (Kläy et al., 2015 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ). Many SEP professionals also already work in line with a normative value, namely better health, and wellbeing (which is part of one of the 17 SDGs). Likewise, teaching is a moral profession and never neutral, as “its fundamental purpose is intervention or behavior change” (Hattie, 2009 , p. 254). Therefore, one's social responsibility should be considered as an important value in all academic work. It should not undermine the academic freedom of thinking and a researcher's curiosity but complement it to honor the obligation of one's accountability to society (Schneider et al., 2019 ). It is important to highlight that this needs to be done in a transparent and reflective manner to avoid normative hidden agendas (see Kläy et al. [2015]  for an in-depth discussion). Schneider et al. (2019)  propose four steps to systematically engage with the normative dimensions of the 2030 Agenda: “Unraveling and reflecting on the ethical values involved in sustainability; spelling out what sustainability values guide research; finding common ground on what sustainability means in specific contexts; reflexive clarification of researchers’ own normative and epistemological ground” (p. 1597). Adopting these steps will hopefully make supporters as well as opponents of the ideas put forward by the Agenda 2030 more conscious of their values and the implications their values have on their scientific practices (Schneider et al., 2019 ). Ideally, this leads to fruitful intra- and interdisciplinary discussions instead of conflict.  Outlook This paper summarized the key principles of SD and informed SEP professionals of the SDGs and the concept of education for SD. The text provided different arguments which have hopefully convinced the readers that all SEP professionals should care about SD and that their contributions toward a more sustainable future can make a difference. It would be very helpful if more SEP professionals tried to promote sustainable physical activity and sustainable elite sport performance, and if research, academic teaching, and practice would support each other in the quest to complement the discipline of SEP by this new focus on SD and ESD. The publication of this paper in a key sport and exercise psychological journal is hopefully a sign of the fact that the topic is not an ancillary one but that it becomes a part of the discipline. It is important to emphasize that this paper does not ask anybody to abandon one's research or teaching topics or practical ways of working for a complete and sudden reorientation toward the principles of SD. Instead, as experts in goal setting, SEP professionals should set an orientation toward SD as their goal. I make the appeal to start considering the concept of SD in one's work and to make adjustments or take new steps which are in line with the ideas discussed above whenever possible. This should be encouraged by the creation of incentives (e.g., journals which ask for sustainability statements). All in all, this paper aims at putting the topic of SD on the discipline's agenda and at sparking a discussion. Its goal is not only to provide answers but also to give rise to further questions. Discussions, intra-, and interdisciplinary collaboration, initiative, as well as the acceptance of social responsibility will be needed to enable the SEP community to help tackling societal, ecological, and ecological issues humanity and the planet face today. The creation of a network for “Sport and Exercise Psychologists for Sustainable Development” and a database for relevant publications could be the first step to start addressing the research questions outlined above. Interested colleagues should reach out to the corresponding author if they are interested in following up on these ideas and/or the discussion.   Declaration of Competing Interest None.
