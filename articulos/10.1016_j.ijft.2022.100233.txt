                  The efficiency and power output of photovoltaic (PV) panels are vital to the solar PV plant. Apart from overheating, and natural shading, some geographical locations are more susceptible to objectionable dust accumulation on the surfaces of PV panels. Consequently, specific cleaning techniques are required to mitigate the accumulated dust and restore the plant's efficiency. The most popular PV panel cleaning techniques include natural, manual, automatic, and electrostatic cleaning. Each cleaning technique is associated with both positive and negative impacts. Hence, this paper proposes a methodology that underlines the impact of each cleaning technique and relates it to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their associated targets. The results exhibit the goals related to energy (SDG 7, 9,11, 12, & 13) and water (SDG 6) were the most affected SDGs by choice of cleaning technology and thus needed to be carefully considered before their deployment. This paper then employs a multi-criteria decision-making method Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), to compare these cleaning techniques and find the optimal cleaning method concerning the SDGs. This method prioritizes the alternatives by considering the 18 criteria set and their relative significance to the SDGs.  The TOPSIS technique showed that the manual cleaning technique outperformed the other cleaning techniques and obtained the highest ranking.

The efficiency and power output of photovoltaic (PV) panels are vital to the solar PV plant. Apart from overheating, and natural shading, some geographical locations are more susceptible to objectionable dust accumulation on the surfaces of PV panels. Consequently, specific cleaning techniques are required to mitigate the accumulated dust and restore the plant's efficiency. The most popular PV panel cleaning techniques include natural, manual, automatic, and electrostatic cleaning. Each cleaning technique is associated with both positive and negative impacts. Hence, this paper proposes a methodology that underlines the impact of each cleaning technique and relates it to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their associated targets. The results exhibit the goals related to energy (SDG 7, 9,11, 12, & 13) and water (SDG 6) were the most affected SDGs by choice of cleaning technology and thus needed to be carefully considered before their deployment. This paper then employs a multi-criteria decision-making method Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), to compare these cleaning techniques and find the optimal cleaning method concerning the SDGs. This method prioritizes the alternatives by considering the 18 criteria set and their relative significance to the SDGs.  The TOPSIS technique showed that the manual cleaning technique outperformed the other cleaning techniques and obtained the highest ranking.   Keywords Solar PV  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)  Cleaning techniques  TOPSIS    1 Introduction In 2030, the world will be moving toward ending poverty, hunger, inequality, and climate change by following a United Nations (UN) policy framework for Sustainable Development. The UN policy framework comprises 17 sustainable goals, 169 targets, and 243 indicators. These sustainable goals ensure that world development is sustainable and meets the requirements and needs of the current generations without compromising future ones’ requirements and needs [1 , 2 ]. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) allow for development and innovation to occur without negatively affecting the environment while also providing significant improvement to the quality of life of all living beings [3] . However, to achieve sustainability, three main pillars must be developed and maintained. The three main pillars to achieve sustainability are the economic, social, and environmental dimensions as summarized in Fig. 1  [4]  With exponential yearly population growth, demand for resources similarly increases, and supplying this demand becomes a veritable challenge [5] . However, the SDGs ensure the sustainability of all resources; for example, SDG 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy resources for all fields [6] . SDG 7 is important as the energy demand is increasing at a steady rate of 1.7% per year from 2000 till 2030 [7] . This increase in demand resulted in depriving 1.1 billion individuals of electricity in 2017 [8] . All indicators point to an energy demand that will surpass the amount of energy supplied if the main energy source remains fossil fuels [7 , 9 ]. The ongoing reliance on fossil fuel, a non-renewable energy source, is adversely impacting the environment as it is the main source of climate change and the main contributor of unfortunate occurrences such as natural disasters [10 , 11 ]. The search for a renewable source of energy is in demand, as renewable energy supplies abundant amounts of energy without negatively affecting the environment [7] . This increased demand for a clean source of energy has set the path toward setting renewable energy as the main energy source [12–14] . Most renewable energy sources occur naturally and are virtually free, while fossil fuels are costly to extract, treat and distribute [15–17] . Additionally, renewable energy sources are reliable, cost-effective, and long-lasting [18] . Wind, solar energy, and water are the main natural renewable sources that can provide sustainable energy [15 , 19 ]. Solar energy is considered the most crucial and promising source of renewable and sustainable energy [20] . Solar energy, like many other renewable energy sources, can help match energy supply with increasing demand for energy as it is widely accessible, available, efficient, effective, and non-exhaustible. The source of solar energy is the sun which provides heat and light [18] . Solar energy is essential for food and crop growth, heating purposes, and for powering devices. In addition, it is the most abundant energy source and can be used in various applications. Solar energy plants produce CO2 emissions in small amounts, and these emissions can be mitigated if solar energy plants are built in suitable locations [17] . The location has a serious impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the solar PV panels within the plant and ultimately the solar energy produced. Solar plants located in desert regions face many environmental challenges, including dust deposition, shading, and air pollution which affect the quality of incident radiation. Relative humidity levels in the region will also affect the productivity of a PV panel [21] . Another factor that decreases the PV panel's productivity is the region's ambient temperature. High ambient temperatures will reduce the power and energy output of the PV panels and damage the encapsulations and wires [22] . The number of dust deposits in the region, the physical and chemical dust properties, and the metrological challenges all affect solar energy production. To address these challenges, a proper cleaning technique must be selected to clean the surface of the PV panels and hence fully restore their productivity and efficiency. In some cases, however, dust particles and soiling on the PV panel pose a real challenge to clean, as in many cases cleaning would lead to possible damage to the surface of the PV panel [21] . Also, many cleaning techniques rely on water to clean PV panels, which may lead to inefficient usage of water supply and waste. About 748 million individuals are not being provided with a clean and reliable water supply making water one of the crucial aspects of sustainable development. Water is essential for the health, well-being, and productivity of all living beings. However, it is a limited resource that cannot be replaced; thus, water should be properly consumed and managed to ensure its sustainability [4] . Consuming and managing water in such a way that meets the current and future demands of water leads to water sustainability. Water sustainability will ensure the supply of water for future generations through any set of circumstances such as drought, infrequent rainfall, or climate change, while also maintaining an efficient process of meeting demand and delivering water. Additionally, water sustainability ensures the supply of water relying only on renewable sources of energy to treat and distill water. Desert regions are attractive for solar energy harvesting because of the high solar radiations expected in these regions with few issues related to shading or overcast conditions. On the other hand, desert regions are also known for frequent dust storms stirred up by strong winds and lightweight, fine sand. This is a condition that makes the soiling effect much more profound. The soiling effect refers to the accumulation of particles on the photovoltaic (PV) panel surface [23] . There is also the combined effect of dust deposits, plant products, and birds’ droppings. The amount of dust accumulation and deposition depends on the location the solar plant is built and the location weather conditions [24] . Although this topic is not new, studying it from an SDG's vantage point is essential to provide useful correlations that can be organically embedded in the national and international strategies of countries. This paper presents some of the viable cleaning techniques utilized to restore the full efficiency of PV panels and relates each of the cleaning techniques with the SDGs and their associated targets. These viable cleaning techniques are then compared to each other based on a defined set of criteria through the MCDM TOPSIS method. In addition, this paper aims to analyze and evaluate the contribution of the cleaning techniques with respect to the SDGs. A comprehensive review of cleaning methods was provided and the relation between the SDGs was analyzed. This is followed by applying MCDM to determine the best cleaning method from the SDG perspective. Moreover, a total of 18 criteria were used for the analysis. A total of 12 SDGs were covered namely SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 2: Zero Hunger, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13: Climate Action, SDG 15: Life on Land, and SDG 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal.  2 Research background 2.1 Dust characteristics Dust is made up of suspended materials swarming in the air that are formed from organic or inorganic matter; bacteria and pollen are the sources of organic matter, while smoke from factories or fires, vapor, and sand or particles from the storm are all sources of inorganic matter. Sea and ocean spray can also cause dust particles to form. Soil particles, smoke, or any particulate matter are all considered dust Fields [25] . Dust particles can remain in the air for a long time and are moved from one place to another by the wind. Additionally, dust particles vary in size, shape, concentration, and density. Storms and high wind speeds will affect the intensity of the dust particles [25] . The density of the dust depends on the land the dust was formed on, while the effect of the dust on the land depends on the humidity level, air altitudes, wind deviation, and speed. Hot seasons create dust particles because of the sun radiations that are causing the soil to dry and thus forming dust particles. Additionally, cold seasons and in particular windy climates also can form dust particles [25] . Humidity does not contribute to the formation of dust particles, while on the other hand dry weather causes the accumulation of dust particles [26] . Countries that are located in regions with deserts are more prone to find huge amounts of dust particles [27 , 24 ]. Sand, the level of dryness in the atmosphere, wind speed, and air currents are all indicators of the level of dust intensity [28] . Dust can be found almost everywhere in the air and huge amounts [29] . Dust particles carry pollutants in the air, which can be harmful to the soil, plants, and atmosphere [28] . The accumulation of dust on PV surfaces can cause a reduction in the performance, effectiveness, and efficiency of the PV because the dust will shadow the PV resulting in a huge temperature increase in the PV [30] . Many studies have been conducted on the effects of the accumulation of dust on PV surfaces [28] . Based on a study that was conducted to measure the performance of a PV with accumulated dust and pollutants on its surface, the PV's performance can be reduced by 20%, and this reduction could increase up to 40% [31] . Another study conducted in Spain measured the amount of energy yielded by a PV with accumulated dust on its surface. The study found that the reduction of energy was about 4.4% with frequent rainfall, and without the presence of rain, this percentage could increase up to 20% [32] .  2.2 Cleaning frequency The cleaning frequency is an essential aspect to consider [24] , and it is required especially in the region of the Middle East and North Africa Area (MENA), cleaning a PV panel every one week or two weeks in such regions is recommended by [23] . The cleaning frequency is not the same for all PV panels, it can vary based on specific factors. These factors include the PV system type, the climatic conditions of its region [28]  (wind speed and pattern and dust deposition) [33] , and the region's latitude [32] . Other factors to consider while choosing the optimal cleaning frequency are cost, time interval, water availability, and area size. After determining these factors the cleaning frequency of a PV panel can be determined by [28] . Choosing the optimal cleaning frequency will reduce the operational costs associated with cleaning the PV panel [34] . Additionally, to obtain the optimal cleaning schedule it is recommended to do an economic analysis [35] . A study has been conducted on the development of a novel model which is used to indicate the cleaning frequency of a PV due to the accumulated dust in desert regions. The cleaning frequency was estimated based on the velocity of the dust deposition and the correlation between the power performance of the PV panel and the density of the dust deposition. The novel model estimated the cleaning frequency to be 20 days when the power reduction is 5% and the particle concentration is 100 μg/m3 [36] .   3 Solar PV cleaning methods Climatic and weather conditions impact PVs, depending on the location these weather conditions vary and might severely impact the PV. Snow, severe rainfall, or acid rain are extreme weather conditions that can deteriorate the performance of a PV, other less extreme weather conditions also affect the performance of a PV [37] . Non-availability of proper cleaning and insolation methods can cause significant loss in PV system efficiency. Kazem et al. [38]  reported that the electrical efficiency of the solar panels drops from 16% to 8% if they were not cleaned for 45 days, and after applying appropriate cleaning methods the PV cell will restore its original efficiency. The optimal way to prevent negative environmental impact on solar panels is to apply proper periodic cleaning and mitigation methods, which will ensure high efficiency and productivity of the cells [39] . As seen in Fig. 2  , cleaning methods include natural cleaning, manual cleaning, automated cleaning, preventive cleaning, and electrostatic cleaning. The selection of the cleaning method depends on multiple factors, such as cost, geographical location, equipment efficiency, and resource availability. The following paragraphs present details on the most prominent methods. 3.1 Natural cleaning Natural cleaning is considered the easiest PV cleaning technique, it utilizes rain and wind to naturally clean the PV. It was discovered that when the rain falls the productivity of a PV increases, due to the removal of accumulated dust by the rain [40] . Studies indicate that tremendous amounts of rain can effectively regain the productivity of a PV; additionally, wind can also remove the accumulated dust [41] ; wind moving with high velocity is an effective technique for cleaning the PV from the accumulated dust [42] , while simultaneously decreasing the relative humidity [41] . When the velocity of the wind is low it will add dust particles to the PV surface instead of cleaning it [43] . Wind velocity depends on the installation height, the velocity will increase as the height increases. Rain is considered an effective technique only in regions with frequent and heavy rain fields [33] , in this case, rain will be an efficient and cost-effective technique to wash away the dust on PV panels. On the other hand, in regions where the rain is light and infrequent, relying on the rain will result in deteriorating the performance of the PV, as rain droplets gather air particles and form a thin layer on the surface of the PV [43] . It has been proven that the angle of the placement of the PV can impact the effectiveness of the cleaning techniques. Additionally, the angle can enhance the effectiveness of the natural techniques by utilizing the natural gravitational force, allowing rain and wind to thoroughly clean the PV [33] .  3.2 Manual cleaning Many tools and techniques are utilized to manually clean a PV panel. To effectively clean a PV panel basic tools should be provided, such as extension poles, brushes, water, hose, and cloth. Most of these tools are available everywhere, making manual cleaning of PV panels a feasible alternative to choosing [44] . Using water, detergent, and cloth to clean a PV panel is the most common manual PV panel cleaning technique, this can be utilized when the PV panel is not large, such a technique might scratch the panel, so it was concluded that when performing scrubbing the labor must be careful and delicate [43] ; but when the PV panel is enormous then water jets and then brushing is the most suitable manual technique. Manual cleaning techniques have low negative impacts on the environment and do not require high costs [33] . Manual cleaning is considered the easiest cleaning technique, which utilizes water and labor. Manual cleaning tends to have high costs when the water is inadequate [28] . As the size of the PV panel increases it limits the opportunity to manually clean the panel, as it becomes a task that can only be carried out by more specialized labor, increasing the costs even more [45] .  3.3 Automated cleaning Cleaning techniques usually require labor, water, detergents, and high costs. Many studies have been conducted to search for an alternative cooling technology that does not require labor to reduce costs. Automated cleaning includes water-based robots, water-less robots, automated sprinklers, and other computer-controlled devices. Such alternatives automate the process of cleaning by utilizing computer-controlled mechanical devices, thus lowering the consumption of water and the hiring of manual labor, while still keeping the productivity of the PV as high as possible [33] . Robot cleaners remove the dust accumulated from the PV surface, and thoroughly clean the PV using a brush, water, and a detergent [46] . Nowadays, most PV plants are employing robots in their plants to carry out various tasks, PV panel cleaning is one of the tasks that can be carried out by a robot. Robots can be employed in both large and small plants to clean large and small panels. Robot cleaners use actuators, motors, and gears to clean the panel thoroughly. In regions where the water supply is adequate water-based robots can be utilized to clean the PV panels. Water-based robot cleaners completely rely on water to clean the PV panels; using such robots will ensure a high cleaning efficiency. In hot/arid regions where water supply is inadequate and scarce the usage of waterless robot cleaners is preferred. Waterless robot cleaners do not use water, instead, a dust repellent brush is used to remove the accumulated dust from the PV [45] . A study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of using a motorized cleaning system; two techniques were compared, a motorized cleaning system with a brush and water and a natural cleaning technique using rain and wind. It was shown that the PV which was cleaned by the motorized cleaning system produced more power; but this system increased the operational costs, water usage, and energy consumption [47] . Using robotic cleaning will increase the operational and maintenance costs [33] , while also lowering the consumption of water and energy supply, it can also perform auto inspection without using any labor [45] . Sprinkler systems use water to remove dust from PV panels by spraying water at once in an array of modules. The cleaning intensity for sprinklers increases as the dust particles on the PV panels become more accumulated and disproof sed [48] .  3.4 Electrostatic cleaning Electrostatic cleaning is a new technology that removes high dust accumulation in arid regions. Electrostatic cleaning uses a transparent electro-dynamic screen (EDS) [46] . Other dust removal methods can hurt the solar panel's surfaces such as scratches, mechanical damage, and scars due to direct contact activities such as brushing or applying high water intensity, however, electrostatic cleaning does not possess this disadvantage as it is a non-contact mechanism [49] . This technology uses electrostatic force instead of water to clean PV panels, it does not require labor as it is an automated system. The device that is employed in dust removal from the surface of solar PV is called an electrostatic precipitator (EPS), this device uses the force of electrostatic charge to attract the dust particles to the charged electrodes, for example, the negatively charged electrodes will actuate a negative charge on the dust particles, then the dust particles will be attracted to the positive electrodes and removed from the surface of the PV, as shown in Fig. 3  [50] . The materials for using this system are expensive, so it is not recommended to use it in big plants to clean large PV panel fields. This system has low energy consumption, does not require labor, and does not need consumables [51] . It should increase the effectiveness of PV panels placed in arid regions and deserts. Electrostatic cleaning charges the dust particles to remove them, this can only be accomplished when the humidity is low; thus, limiting the applicability of this system to only dry regions where the humidity is low [45] . Cleaning techniques can also be compared according to their associated costs, applicability/feasibility, suitable geographical location, water consumption, and energy consumption. These factors can be used to facilitate the decision-making process of determining the optimal PV panel cleaning technique. Table 1   presents water consumption, cost per cleanup, suitable geographical location, feasibility/applicability, and energy consumption of each cleaning technique.  3.5 Advantages and disadvantages of cleaning techniques Cleaning techniques possess a set of advantages and disadvantages based on resource consumption, cost, availability, the number of laborers, and the level of difficulty. The cleaning technique could be selected by conducting a careful analysis and comparison of the advantages and disadvantages under specific circumstances. Table 2   lists several advantages and disadvantages of each cleaning technique. Based on Table 2 , the main advantages of natural cleaning are its relatively low costs and low consumption of water, while its major disadvantage is its limited feasibility to only wet and cold regions [24] . The main advantage of manual cleaning is its ability to fully restore the efficiency of the PV panel [15] , on the other hand, it is weighed down by its high costs and water consumption [54] . The primary advantage of automatic cleaning is that it is not labor intensive, but it requires a few highly specialized labor to maintain the automatic and robotic systems [24] . Electrostatic cleaning thoroughly cleans PV panels without consuming or utilizing water [24] , but its feasibility is limited to dry regions [20] .  3.6 New techniques for cleaning PV panels A new way to keep PV panels cleaned is by applying a coating on the surface of the panel, the coating is made of a translucent nano-film that will enable the PV panel to self-clean by repelling dust particles. The coating can either be made up of a super hydrophilicity material or a superhydrophobic material. A superhydrophobic material collects dust particles from water or rain droplets. While a super hydrophilicity material cleans dust by spreading the water or rain droplets throughout the whole panel [45] . Even though many self-cleaning PV coatings are currently available, the effectiveness is still not high because the coatings do not have repellent properties. A study was conducted using three techniques for PV panel cleaning to measure the effectiveness: nano-coating, nano-coating with a mechanical vibrator, and no coating (natural cleaning). Results show that the most effective technique was nano-coating the PV panel surface and using a mechanical vibrator [49] . Another unique panel cleaning technique is using piezoelectric actuators [45] . Moreover, an emerging technique for dust removal is the movable electrodes technique in which the electrodes will remove the dust particles away from the OV surface by rolling over the solar panel in a movement that is similar to a computer scanner [50] . Furthermore, new technology was proposed by Kasem et al. [55]  in which the solar tracking system on the solar panels was attached to a movable platform. The tracking system will move according to the sunset, for instance, at sunset the direction of the solar panel will move from west to east (Azimuth) and the solar panel will increase the tilting angle to an angle higher than 90°. The movement and the vibration will help in removing dust particles from the solar panel surface.   4 SDGs analysis The use of solar photovoltaic panels is increasing with the increase in energy demands and the non-availability of a ceaseless power supply. PV panels can be utilized in a wide variety of applications such as networking instruments, solar heaters, solar lanterns, and coolers [50] . After installing the PV panels on the roof of the buildings or in the required location a cleaning process should be performed periodically, this process is essential because the nonavailability of a proper cleaning method will result in dust particles accumulation which will prevent solar radiation from entering the panels, this will result in reducing the efficiency and productivity of the panels and increasing the batteries’ charging duration [50] . Therefore, the panels should be cleaned and maintained regularly using conventional or novel methods. Cleaning methods include natural cleaning, manual cleaning, automatic cleaning, and electrostatic cleaning. SDGs are a set of 17 goals that aim to ensure a sustainable and better future for all people, economic prosperity, and environmental protection [56] . The concept of sustainability is dated back many centuries, but it has only been recognized recently. This is due to the increasing human pressure on the environment and its resources and the need to compensate for human ecological pressure to preserve life on earth [57] . The SDGs used Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a reference for the goals and targets and improved on them so that they will fit the current needs and practices. However, the SDGs are more integrated than the MDGs which support policy integration across multiple sectors [58] . The SDGs include 17 goals and 169 targets that cover a broad range of world issues, SDGs and targets are directed toward addressing all challenges that are faced by humankind such as poverty, hunger, inequality, and climate issues [59] . These goals and targets are considered a network, in which all the goals and targets are linked to each other [58] . The SDGs can be employed and implemented in a wide variety of applications such as health care applications [60 , 55 ], ocean sustainability [61] , local climate and energy [62] , tourism [63] , animal welfare [64] , and food safety [65] . Identifying and understanding the interactions between the sustainability goals and the relationships between them and human activities will help to develop and prioritize convenient and effective policies to be followed by [61] . Renewable energy is essential to achieving the SDGs. Renewable energy does not only contribute to access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (SDG 7) and climate change actions (SDG 13) but it also significantly impact all the other SDGs in which it helps in reducing poverty and hunger, increasing access to clean water, and preserving life on land and water [8] . There are countless real-life examples of how renewable energy contributed to the achievement of SDGs. For example, in East Africa installing solar arrays by solar renewable plants helped in creating jobs and developing the economy. In addition, in Puerto Rico renewable energy plants worked on re-electrifying the island which provided future disaster resilience for the island [8] . Renewable energy contributes to ending poverty (SDG 1) through direct and indirect employment and taxes paid, and it contributes to zero hunger (SDG 2) through the development of landscapes and the production of food products and selling them at low costs. In addition, renewable energy contributes to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) by implementing a water usage policy that will manage the water usage to ensure its sustainability across the whole plant and it achieve sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) through increasing disaster resilience in vulnerable societies. Moreover, its highly committed to achieving affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) by generating clean energy, electricity, and power. Renewable energy support life on land (SDG 15) by ensuring positive or zero net loss impact on ecosystems by applying mitigation plans and constructing environmental impact assessment. Fig. 4   shows the link between the 17 SDG goals and renewable energy and how renewable energy impacts the SDG goals and targets. This study utilizes literature knowledge to identify and analyze the relationship between the SDG goals and the related targets with the four PV cleaning methods, and how each SDG goal and target is affected by the cleaning method. Additionally, the study investigates the interaction between the SDGs and renewable energy and solar plants and the way they are linked together. Table 3   demonstrates the relationship between the SDGs and renewable solar energy. 4.1 Natural cleaning Natural cleaning is one of the techniques used to clean PV panels to restore the efficiency lost dues to accumulated dust particles on the PV's surface. Natural cleaning is a technique that does not utilize any machines, equipment, tools, or labor to facilitate the process of cleaning PV panels. It is a technique that utilizes natural resources such as rain and wind to clean the PV panels, making it only applicable in regions with frequent rainfall and unapplicable in desert or arid regions. As natural cleaning only utilizes natural resources thus it does not require any investments and has low consumption of water. Water is only utilized when the rain is light, or the wind is moving at extremely low speeds and no dust is removed. In such conditions water might be utilized to facilitate the process of dust removal. As natural cleaning has low consumption of water, the water supply is conserved and protected and the natural heritages are protected (SDG 6, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 15). After cleaning the PV panel, the PV panel will restore its full efficiency and will produce clean energy that can then be distributed (SDG 7). On the other hand, using natural resources to clean PV panels will limit economic growth (SDG 8). Table 4   shows all the SDGs and their related targets, and how each SDG relates to the natural cleaning technique.  4.2 Manual cleaning Manual cleaning is a technique that is utilized to clean the PV panel and remove all the accumulated dust particles on the PV's surface. Manual cleaning requires labor, water, and tools to clean the PV panels thoroughly. Thus, it requires heavy investments for employment and procurement of all the required tools (SDG 8). Manual cleaning is a technique that is applicable and feasible in all regions. It limits poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2), gender inequality (SDG 5), and inequalities (SDG 10). Additionally, manual cleaning will clean the PV panels thoroughly and this will increase the production of clean energy (SDG 7). On the other hand, the high consumption of water will result in an unsustainable usage of water (SDG 6, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 15). Table 5   shows all the SDGs and their related targets, and how each SDG relates to the manual cleaning technique.  4.3 Automatic cleaning Automated cleaning is a cleaning technique that uses a computer-controlled mechanical device to take off the dust particles from the PV panels. Automated cleaning does not require manual labor to carry out the cleaning process thus it does not contribute to ending poverty, ending hunger, good health and well-being, gender equality, and reducing inequalities (SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG3, SDG 5, SDG 10). Automated cleaning includes water-based robots, water-less robots, and automated sprinklers. If water-based devices were employed, then automatic cleaning will increase the consumption of water and it will affect the ability to achieve clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). While if non-water-based devices were used then the consumption of water will be reduced and water resources will be preserved (SDG 12, SDG 11). Procuring automated cleaning devices locally will contribute to the economic growth of the country (SDG 8). Automated cleaning devices such as vacuum suction cleaners are available in UAE, thus purchasing these devices locally is feasible. Table 6   shows all the SDGs and related targets that are affected by automatic cleaning.  4.4 Electrostatic cleaning Electrostatic cleaning is a new technology that removes dust accumulation from PV panels by using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic cleaning does not require a working force. Therefore it is not related to ending poverty, end of hunger, good health and well-being, gender equality, and reducing inequalities (SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG3, SDG 5, SDG 10). As the quality of education increases, people will be able to improve and develop electrostatic cleaning technology, which will make it more efficient and effective (SDG 4). Electrostatic cleaning increases the water use efficiency as does not consume water to clean the PV panels (SDG 6, SDG 12). Moreover, Electrostatic cleaning allows the PV panel to produce energy efficiently, increasing the production of renewable energy, which will contribute to improving the global rate of energy efficiency in the future (SDG 7). Table 7   demonstrates the relationship between SDG goals and targets and electrostatic cleaning.   5 Correlation between the SDGs and PV cleaning methods 5.1 SDG 1: No poverty Utilizing cleaning techniques that will promote the reduction of world poverty is essential. Manual cleaning is a technique that has a positive association with the reduction of world poverty (SDG 1). This reduction is the result of employing labor and providing them with sufficient incomes. Any other technique that does not employ labor in the process of cleaning does not have any determined association with SDG 1.  5.2 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation The United Nations emphasized the importance of water security and included it as the 6th sustainable goal [73] . To ensure the preservation of the water supply a cleaning technique that efficiently consumes water should be employed. Natural cleaning has a positive impact on the consumption of water, as it relies on rainfall and rarely utilizes water. Thus, natural cleaning positively contributes to the preservation of water supply which will facilitate the process of implementing SDG 6. Additionally, electrostatic cleaning is a technique that preserves water supply by relying only on electrical charges to clean. On the other hand, manual cleaning negatively impacts the preservation of the water supply as it requires an abundant supply of water to clean.  5.3 SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy Clean energy supply can further increase depending on the type of cleaning technique chosen. Automatic cleaning, in particular sprinklers, can be frequently utilized to clean the PV panel, restoring the full efficiency of the PV panel and producing more clean energy. Thus, automatic cleaning has a positive association with the production of clean energy (SDG 7). All the other cleaning techniques positively impact the production of clean energy, as all techniques increase the efficiency of the PV panel, increasing the amount of clean energy produced. Table 8   represents a summary of the relationships between the cleaning techniques and the 17 SDGs.  5.4 SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth Economic growth can result from local procurement of goods and services. Techniques that involve equipment, machines, and labor positively impact the region's economic growth. Such techniques are manual cleaning, automatic cleaning, and electrostatic cleaning. All the mentioned techniques require equipment, brushes, systems, and labor (either to carry out the process of the cleaning or to install and maintain the machines) to facilitate the cleaning process.   6 Multi-criteria decision making Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a mature research area that employs mathematical and computational techniques for evaluating a defined number of alternatives based on specific performance criteria. As a result, the MCDM approach extends its knowledge from various areas, such as economics, computer science, engineering, and mathematics. MCDM techniques have been a hot topic of research due to their high capabilities for evaluating several alternatives after a thorough assessment. Fig. 5   demonstrates the various techniques of MCDM and their branches. One of the various MCDM techniques, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), is a well-established technique for assessing different decision challenges in several fields and applications [74] . TOPSIS was first developed by Hwang and Yoon in 1981 to assist decision-makers in selecting the optimal alternative that will maximize the benefits. TOPSIS is a ranking technique that tries to select the alternative with the minimum distance from the Positive Ideal Solution (PIS) and the maximum distance from the Negative Ideal Solution (NIS). The optimal result of any process is to increase the benefits while lowering the costs, while the worst result is to attain the least amount of benefits while maximizing the costs [75] . MCDM TOPSIS has been extensively applied in various applications over the years [76] . For instance, Mousavi-Nasab and Sotoudeh-Anvari (2017) [77]  have reviewed over 100 scientific studies and deduced that TOPSIS and COPRAS are the most suitable techniques for solving the material selection issue. The authors reported that these techniques are highly effective in choosing the optimal alternative and are simple to use. Similarly, MCDM techniques have been effective in studying the hurdles of developing PV energy generation. According to Ali Sadat (2021) [78] , Fuzzy-TOPSIS techniques were employed to find the highest ranking hurdle and solution for developing PV energy in Iran. The MCDM TOPSIS technique is often utilized to compare several alternatives thoroughly. For example, AlMallahi et al. (2022) [79]  carried out a comprehensive comparison between several PV panel cleaning techniques in Dubai. This comparison was carried out by the MCDM TOPSIS technique based on a defined set of criteria. Similar to the former study, this paper employs the MCDM TOPSIS technique to choose the optimal PV panel cleaning technique. Nevertheless, this paper takes the perspective of the SDGs while simultaneously utilizing the MCDM TOPSIS to select the best cleaning technique that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the costs. 6.1 TOPSIS methodology The TOPSIS approach is used to organize the collection of alternatives, analyze, and rank them. The TOPSIS approach is used to solve issues where all decision data is known and represented by crisp integers. This technique will assist decision makers in choosing the optimal technique for solar PV cleaning regarding the SDGs too. Thus, the TOPSIS tool is used to evaluate and choose the best alternative cleaning techniques for PV panels while considering the 18 criteria set. The multi-criteria method has been used to evaluate the best cleaning technique among four alternatives, namely natural cleaning, manual cleaning, automatic cleaning, and electrostatic cleaning. This study aims to understand which among the 4 alternatives is optimal for the SDGs. Experts from the solar industry through a panel discussion helped identify and determine the set of criteria in connection with the SDGs. The four alternatives and criteria selected are defined in Table 9  . Data in this paper was collected from various methods such as reports, academic papers, IRENA, and focused group discussions. This study is divided into several stages:1 Reviewing literature and setting up an expert decision-making team in the solar industry. Defining the problem statement after an extensive literature review.  2 Conducting a panel discussion to identify the set of criteria to apply to the SDGs.  3 Evaluating the set of alternatives most appropriate and comprehensive. Building the criteria's weights using the SAW (simple additive weighting) and MEW (multiplicative exponential weighting) weighting methods. Using TOPSIS to compute alternative scores and rank the examined alternatives.    The TOPSIS MCDM technique was used to determine the best cleaning method based on specific attributes. The four alternatives chosen are the most comprehensive and extensively discussed in the literature. The attributes chosen included several important factors, as shown in Table 9 . The TOPSIS approach considers both positive and negative ideal solutions. As a result, the alternative with the shortest distance from the positive ideal point and the greatest distance from the negative ideal point is chosen. The overall positive ideal solution includes all the best criteria values, whereas the overall negative ideal solution includes all the worst criteria values.  6.2 Mathematical formulations In this section, detailed calculations of the TOPSIS method are presented and applied to find our optimal cleaning technique for solar PV panels, concerning the SDGs. The traditional TOPSIS MCDM approach employs numerically measured weights of criteria and ratings. The criteria and their weights might be expressed using linguistic variables. The first step in solving any multi-criteria problem is to create a decision-making matrix or matrices (individual or group decisions). In such matrices, the values of the criterion for alternatives might be real numbers, intervals, fuzzy integers, or qualitative labels. Alternatives are denoted as  A1 , A2 , and… Am  and C1 , C2 ,… Cn  denotes the criteria used to assess alternative performance. xk ij  is a number or interval data representing the decision maker's rating of alternative Ai about criteria Cj . All equations reported in this work were obtained from [91] . Table 10   illustrates the multi-criteria problem as a matrix in which alternatives are A and criteria are C. Step 1: Create decision matrixes for k-decision makers and assign criterion weights.   X k   = (xk ij ) denotes a decision matrix for k- decision maker or expert. Step 2: Normalize the decision matrix for each decision maker.   Normalization is required to obtain the numerical and comparable input data using a similar scale and to provide a norm or standard to the input data. Each criterion in the decision matrix has a monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing value. Any consequence represented non-numerically should be quantified using the appropriate scaling approach.(1) rkij  =   xkij  ∑ i = 1   m  ( xkij ) 2          Eq. (1)  provides normalization to the desired decision matrix. Step 3. Find the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions for each decision maker.   The optimum positive solution Ak+  has the form for k-decision maker.(2) A k   +  = { r 1 k +   , r 2   k +   , … , r n k +    }  = { ( m a x ( r i j  k  )  |  j ∈ I   )  ,  ( min ( r i j  k  )  |  j ∈ J   )   }       The negative ideal solution Ak−  has the form for k-decision maker.(3) A k   −  = { r 1 k −   , r 2   k   −  , … , r n   k   −   }  = { ( m i n ( r i j    k  )  |  j ∈ I   )  ,  ( m a x ( r i j    k  )  |  j ∈ J   )   }       Step 4. Calculate the separation measures from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution.  Step 5.1. Calculate the separation measures for individual decision maker  For the positive ideal solution Ak  + for each k  decision maker is given as:(4) d i k +   = (  m  ∑ j = 1   w j k  ( r i j  k  − r j k +    )   p   )  1 / p   , i = 1 , 2 , … , m .      For the negative ideal solution Ak  −  for each k  decision maker is given as:(5) d i k −   = (  m  ∑ j = 1   w j k  ( r i j  k  − r j k −    )   p   )  1 / p   , i =  1 , 2 , … , m .     where p  ≥ 1. For p  = 2 we use the Euclidean metric. Step 5.2. Calculate the separation measure for the group.   Where di * +  is denoted as the group measure of the positive ideal solution and di * −  is denoted as the group measure of the negative ideal solution.(6) d i * +   = ∑ k = 1  K  d i k ′     K   and  d i * −   = ∑ k = 1  K  d i k    K       Step 6. Calculate the relative closeness to the positive ideal solution.   The relative closeness of the alternative Ai  to the positive ideal solution is given as:(7) R i *   =  d i * −    / d i * −    +  d i − *       where 0 is ≤ R*i   ≤ 1 and the greater the index value, the better the evaluation of the alternative. Alternatives' distances from the positive and negative ideal solutions are distances between matrices. The coefficient of the relative proximity of each option to the positive ideal solution is used to construct a ranking of alternatives, and optimal cleaning techniques can be identified. Step 7. Rank the preferred order or select the alternative closest to 1.   The descending order of the value of R*I   can now be used to rank the set of alternatives. With these steps provided, we conclude the TOPSIS method. The alternatives are ranked according to their closeness to ideal solutions R*I  (the higher the value, the better the alternative). The alternative with the highest value is the best option.  6.3 Results and discussion of the MCDM After applying TOPSIS and using different weighting methods such as Simple Additive Weighting and Multiplicative exponential weighting (MEW) the rankings were computed. The obtained findings showed that manual cleaning is the optimal cleaning method among the other alternatives. Moreover, this can be supported by the literature, as manual cleaning is widely used in different regions. The chosen criteria considered not only the economic and technical aspects but also social and environmental impacts as the number of people positively affected, and jobs created for manual cleaning. Manual cleaning is beneficial as it employs manpower and helps in achieving the SDGs greater than other options. Table 11   shows the average rank for each alternative among TOPSIS, SAW, and MEW. According to the results, it is shown that the cleaning techniques were ranked from most favored to least favored as manual cleaning, automated cleaning, natural cleaning, and followed by electrostatic cleaning. Manual cleaning was ranked as the most favored cleaning technique due to its positive impacts on the economic, environmental, social, and technical aspects. Even though manual cleaning was top ranked, it still poses negative safety and risk issues to the employees. Especially if the PV panels are large and located in remote regions that are not easily accessible, then it is difficult to employ labor to carry out the cleaning processes. The expenses of transporting employees to the remote location are high and thus in such cases it is recommended to install automatic machines and robots or utilize electrostatic cleaning. Even though manual cleaning is one of the most widely utilized cleaning techniques, it is most suitable to integrate robots and machines to clean large PV panels which may lead to potential safety risks to the employees [92] . Nevertheless, manual cleaning opens new opportunities for the society by creating new jobs and increasing the income of families; thus, reducing poverty and hunger. The comparison between the cleaning techniques was carried out based on both the related SDGs and a defined set of criteria. To further demonstrate the relationships between the related SDGs and the cleaning techniques, the SDGs were ranked according to their relevance to each cleaning technique. Table 12   depicts the rankings of the SDGs based on their relation to each cleaning technique. Then these rankings were better illustrated in Fig. 6   showing that manual cleaning dominated SDGs 1, 2, and 15. While electrostatic cleaning possessed the highest ranking for SDGs 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 17. Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) approach includes the severity of the contrast and the conflict of the decision-making issue structure. A CRITIC number approaching 1 indicates that the contract intensity or standard deviation has been allocated a higher weight. This approach supports decision-makers in determining the best option. On the other hand, the entropy weight method (EWM) is a prominent way of evaluating value dispersion in decision-making. The greater the degree of differentiation, the greater the degree of dispersion. As a result, the index is given more weight. Entropy value based on index dispersion is used to compute the weight of all criteria. The entropy technique is employed because it is accurate in estimating the weight of the feature attribute and is reliable for measuring inputs.  Similarly, Stochastic Dominance (SD) is the partial order of random variables. For instance, one probability distribution over many possibilities may be regarded as superior to another possibility for various decision-makers, the term derives from decision theory and decision analysis. It is based on common preferences for several categories of possible outcomes and their likelihood. As a result, a larger SD number suggests a more likely probability distribution for a particular choice. Moreover, the manual cleaning technique showed dominance in having the maximum CRITIC values overall. Fig. 7  (a), (b), (c), and (d) show TOPSIS, SAW, MEW, and average rank respectively.  6.4 Recommended PV panel cleaning techniques Cleaning techniques are selected based on the natural resources offered by the country. For example, countries with inadequate water supply face major challenges in implementing SDG 6, so they should first consider relying on either natural or electrostatic cleaning. Natural cleaning is utilized if the country experiences frequent rainfall, otherwise, the country should utilize electrostatic cleaning. If automatic cleaning is utilized, then it is recommended to use non-water-based robots to lower the consumption of water. Manual cleaning should be avoided as an abundant supply of water is required. Occasionally some countries have an inadequate supply of water but still rely completely on automatic cleaning and manual cleaning, this is only possible when the country imports all the needed resources. Fig. 8   shows the recommended PV panel cleaning techniques (in order from most favorable to use to least favorable to use) to utilize in case of major water supply shortages. Countries that are facing minor challenges in implementing SDG 6 and have a fair supply of water should clean PV panels utilizing automatic cleaning. Automatic cleaning using non-water-based robots does not utilize water supply and restores the full efficiency of a PV panel effectively. If non-water-based robots are not available within the region, then the country can use electrostatic cleaning without consuming much of its water supply. Natural cleaning can also be utilized if the country experiences frequent rainfall and if none of the previous recommendations were applicable or feasible. If the country has infrequent rainfall and none of the previous techniques were utilized, then manual labor can be utilized but it is the least favorable choice for such countries as huge amounts of water will be utilized. Fig. 9   shows the recommended PV panel cleaning techniques (in order from most favorable to use to least favorable to use) to utilize in case of minor shortages in the water supply. Countries with abundant water supply face no challenges in choosing the optimal cleaning technique to clean PV panels. Additionally, implementing SDG 6 in such countries will ensure the sustainability of the abundant water supply and will reinforce the achievement of efficient and responsible water consumption. Fig. 10   shows the recommended PV panel cleaning techniques (in order from most favorable to use to least favorable to use) to utilize in case of no shortages in the water supply.   7 Conclusion The SDGs are crucial to achieving a better and more sustainable future for the current and the new generations. The UN sustainable goals consist of 17 goals, 169 targets, and 243 indicators that are directed towards achieving good well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental protection. Achieving sustainability depends on identifying and maintaining three pillars, which are economic dimensions, social dimensions, and environmental dimensions. The SDGs can be implemented in a wide range of areas and applications. In this paper, the SDGs were employed to assess the PV panel cleaning techniques. PV panel cleaning techniques, such as manual cleaning, automatic cleaning, electrostatic cleaning, and natural cleaning, are essential due to the dust accumulation on the PV panels which deteriorates the performance and productivity of the PV panel. Several previous studies were conducted to find the optimal PV cleaning technique. However, this paper assesses the impacts of each cleaning technique to the SDGs and then selects the optimal cleaning technique based on the analyzed results and the SDGs. SDGs related to water and energy utilization were the most affected SDGs by the cleaning techniques. The aim of this paper is to assess the relationships between the cleaning techniques and the SDGs, and then elaborate on the findings by applying an MCDM method, TOPSIS. Initially, the TOPSIS method was employed to compare and evaluate the cleaning techniques based on 18 criteria. TOPSIS technique ranked the alternatives from the most favorable to the least favorable alternative. Manual cleaning obtained the highest rank, followed by automatic cleaning, then came natural cleaning, and the lowest ranking was linked to electrostatic cleaning. It is advantageous to have manual cleaning as the highest-ranked PV cleaning technique due to its contribution to job creation and the economy. Then, the TOPSIS method was utilized to find the relationships between the cleaning techniques and the SDGs. The method demonstrated the extent at which each cleaning technique contributed to a achieving each SDG. Future work can be focused on evaluating the cleaning techniques of other mature renewable energy sources, such as hydro power, geothermal, and wind energy. The cleaning techniques can then be compared and evaluated based on the MCDM TOPSIS technique to acquire the optimal technique, maximizing the benefits and minimizing the costs.
