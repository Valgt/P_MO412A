                  This paper examines the challenges in monitoring target 12.3 of United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) under the SDG 2030 17 significant goals. SDG 12 focuses on ensuring production and consumption patterns are sustainable. Target 12.3 aims to reduce food waste by 50% at the retail and consumption stage and food loss at the production stage, including post-harvest losses, by 2030. With the help of SDG reports, an extensive literature review and expert opinions, 14 challenges were selected and hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) was applied. The first phase obtained the inter-relationship between the challenges using interpretive structural modeling (ISM). The second phase included quantification and ranking of the challenges using fuzzy AHP methodology. Probable strategies to overcome these challenges in emerging economies are discussed and ranked using the VIKOR methodology in the third phase, as no single approach can combat all the obstacles. This is the first to examine the challenges and possibilities of monitoring UN SDG target 12.3 in emerging economies like India. The results indicate that data availability, education in sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns, financing of SDG targets and data use are the main obstacles to monitoring and achieving target 12.3.

Lipinski et al. (2013) ; Chen et al. (2013) ; Steinbach et al. (2016) ; Menary et al. (2019) ; Farooque et al. (2019)   C2 Top management commitment (TMC) The narrowing down of interest and lack of support from top management in building sustainable environment is a challenge for SCP. Caldera et al. (2019) ; Menon and Ravi (2021) ; Bastas and Liyanage (2018) ; Sajjad et al. (2015) ; Dubey et al. (2015)   C3 Attitude towards problem (ATP) In emerging economies, the approach to take on the problem is pessimistic which turns out to be a challenge. Expert's Opinion  C4 Weak environmental regulations and enforcement (WERE) The relaxation to the organizations in the policies regarding carbon emissions results in the unsustainable ways of production and the target of SCP patterns will be difficult to achieve. Chan et al. (2018) ; Narayanan et al. (2019); Ray et al. (2019) ; Farooque et al. (2019) ; Sharma et al. (2019) ; Mangla et al. (2017)   C5 Education for SCP (ESCP) Developing economies lacks in educational campaigns, no political agendas regarding sustainability and food issues are being discussed. Aschemann-Witzel et al. (2015) ; Lemaire and Limbourg (2019) ; Glavič (2021) ; Govindan (2018)   C6 Resistance to change (RC) Resisting change in adopting innovation acts as a challenge in initiating developing sustainable environment. Acciaro et al. (2014) ; Khan et al. (2021) ; Ray et al. (2019) ; Morella et al. (2021) ; Ghadge et al. (2020)   C7 Data availability (DA) With the non-availability of data and inappropriate statistical tools, measuring progress of SDGs target is a challenge. Sanga (2011) ; Lipinski et al. (2017) ; Bizikova et al. (2015) ; Corrado et al. (2019) ; Aday and Aday (2020) ; Caro et al. (2018)   C8 Continuous improvement culture (CIC) To achieve sustainable goals, continuous development should be done along with the feedback loop taking suggestions from customers, managers and top officials. Govindan (2018) ; Expert's Opinion  C9 Data Use (DU) The main objective of data generation and developing indicators is to use them practically. As the bottleneck in the case of MDGs were data was only used for global reporting rather than practically using for policymaking. AbouZahr et al. (2007) ; Steinbach et al. (2016) ; Corrado et al. (2019) ; Khouhizadeh et al., (2021); Pearson et al. (2019)   C10 Resources and Technical Capacity (RTC) To focus on sustainable patterns, supply chain need to implement best practices but has limited resource and technical availability. Lipinski et al. (2013) ; Bizikova et al. (2015) ; Karki et al. (2021) ; Govindan and Hasanagic (2018) ; Kumar et al. (2021)   C11 Financing SDGs Targets (FSDG) To update any framework, capital is the first requirement and emerging economies like India lacks in finances which results to be the stumbling block in financing SDG targets. Bizikova et al. (2015) ; David (2018) ; Farooque et al. (2019) ; Zimon et al. (2020) ; Barua (2020) ; Lemaire and Limbourg (2019)   C12 Benchmarking (NB) There is a lack of set of standards and quantification of sustainability standards is difficult as the methods to evaluate sustainability performance is not uniform. Expert's Opinion  C13 Uncertainties about benefits (UAB) For making operations sustainable, new technologies need to be incorporated and with that comes the risk of installing new facilities when the firm's decision-makers are uncertain about the benefits. Farooque et al. (2019) ; Expert's Opinion  C14 Traceability issues (TI) There is a lack of traceable practices in the supply chain which makes it difficult to make processes sustainable. Kumar and Choubey (2021) ; Balaji and Arshinder (2016) ; Pearson et al. (2019) ; Lemaire and Limbourg (2019) ; Sharma et al. (2019)      Table 3 Details of experts.

The practice of reducing the use of virgin materials, optimizing the use of resources and building in-situ recycling treatment plants within the food industry.  Regulatory and environmental policies strategy (S2) This strategy aims at formulating various policies for environmental protection by regulatory bodies and to encourage clean practices within the food industries. Government can assist industries in the form of tax relaxation, subsidies for installing clean practices, rewarding industries based on clean operations.  Financing SDGs target strategy (S3) The separate fund should be floated for financing SDGs target by the regulatory bodies and those funds should be implemented for the progress of targets. This may include technical advancements, providing financial aids to the ones who comes up with novel ideas that may help in fulfilling SDGs target.  Collaboration strategy(S4) This strategy aims at building closed networks within the organizations and also collaborating with the external agencies for special training programs developing extra skillset in the employees. The collaborations of the food industry with the research institutes for the latest solutions to their problems and also networking with the governmental bodies to get aid from them and keep them updated with the progress.  Advertising strategy (S5) This strategy aims at spreading awareness among the customers pointing out the benefits of clean practices and the necessity to save food resources. The government should invest on the promotional activities along with food industries so that their operations should be sustainable and the customers should also understand the importance of resources that are produced and wasted without proper utilization.  Circular proficiencies and skill enhancement strategy (S6) This strategy aims to create an environment for workers to build sustainable and circular competencies such as developing skill set to practically implement circular practices to reduce the environmental degradation.  R&D strategy (S7) The objective of this strategy is to continuously strive for the best technologies thus improving operations and developing innovative ideas to deal with modern problems. This involves setting up in-situ research and development laboratory which continuously look for the resource optimization.     Table 10 Average rating of strategies w.r.t challenges.

SDG 12 focuses on ensuring production and consumption patterns are sustainable. Target 12.3 aims to reduce food waste by 50% at the retail and consumption stage and food loss at the production stage, including post-harvest losses, by 2030. With the help of SDG reports, an extensive literature review and expert opinions, 14 challenges were selected and hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) was applied. The first phase obtained the inter-relationship between the challenges using interpretive structural modeling (ISM). The second phase included quantification and ranking of the challenges using fuzzy AHP methodology. Probable strategies to overcome these challenges in emerging economies are discussed and ranked using the VIKOR methodology in the third phase, as no single approach can combat all the obstacles. This is the first to examine the challenges and possibilities of monitoring UN SDG target 12.3 in emerging economies like India. The results indicate that data availability, education in sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns, financing of SDG targets and data use are the main obstacles to monitoring and achieving target 12.3.

All the UN member states, including multiple stakeholders, participated in the process and consented to the SDGs, with the objective of building sustainable environments (Barbier and Burgess, 2017 ). The 17 SDGs and 169 targets are outlined in the UN's document “Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (UN General Assembly, 2015 ) and in the United Nations sustainable development goals platform (UN-SDGs, 2019 ). SDG 2 aims towards zero hunger by 2030, SDG 12 aims at sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns, and SDG 13 aims at resisting climate change. The SDGs constitute a shared expression of stakeholder needs at a global level that balance three aspects – social, economic and environmental progress – and can be used as an indicator of the primary objective of sustainable development (Fonseca and Carvalho, 2019 ). Six years have already passed since then, and much work remains to be done to reduce the increasing food concerns. SDG target 12.3 aims to reduce food wastage by 50% at the retail and consumption stage, as well as food loss at the production phase (including post-harvest losses) by 2030 by promoting 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle) practices. The world's population is estimated to be around nine billion by 2050, which automatically increases the demand for food. With the increase in demand, food production will increase, resulting in the generation of more food waste. Around 1.3e9 tonnes of food are wasted globally each year, accounting for one-third of total food production (FAO, 2019). Just over a quarter (27%) of food waste occurs at the consumption phase and is avoidable food waste, which means edible parts of food are being discarded (Coudard et al., 2021 ). The global energy footprint of the food system has been approximated to be above 70 EJ (1 EJ = 1018  J) (Usubiaga‐Liaño et al., 2020 ). Food production is responsible for 20%–30% of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming and is a prominent reason for climatic shifts (Abram et al., 2019 ; Binns et al., 2021 ). The goal set in the Paris agreement at COP 2015 was to limit the global temperature rise to below 2°, preferably 1.5° degrees, at the end of the 21st century to reduce environmental risk. According to FAO (2014a) reports, food produced and not eaten accounts for 4.4 G tonnes of CO2  and 8% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. The study states that shifting away from animal-based food (e.g. red meat) towards plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, seeds and nuts would help reduce the sector's carbon footprint (Bechthold et al., 2018 ). Reducing wasted food will automatically reduce use of energy and water resources, as these three are interrelated (Al-Ansari et al., 2015 ). To lower the impact of food waste, sustainability in the supply chain is of great importance (Joshi and Visvanathan, 2019 ). Industrial revolution 4.0 and technological advancements have raised standards worldwide. While this represents overall progress for the world, it also has negative impacts and may potentially be harming the growth of future generations (Stanujkic et al., 2020 ). Globally, India is ranked second after China in the production of fresh fruits and vegetables because of its diverse climate and soil availability, which allows the production of different varieties of fresh produce. This study deals with the fresh produce supply chain, which includes farming, wholesaling, warehousing and retailing, passing through production to the distribution stage and finally to the consumption stage. Natural resources are limited, and the waste generated in the fresh produce supply chain involves the misuse of land, water and energy, which negatively affects the environment (Gokarn and Kuthambalayan, 2017 ). Each phase in the food supply chain emits greenhouse gases, thus polluting the environment, and this continues even after the disposal of food waste in landfills (Gokarn and Choudhary, 2021 ; Porter et al., 2018 ). Food waste reduction is a challenge in the context of fresh produce, which is a market sector negatively affected by the perishable nature of fresh produce, technological limitations, communication gaps between the supply chain partners and mismanagement within the supply chain (Gardas et al., 2018 ). Consumption and production patterns are haphazard, which is resulting in a planetary crisis. Changes in consumption and production patterns will help economic growth, improve human health and reduce harmful environmental impact. From 2017 to 2020, a total of 83 countries, territories and the European Union have shared their progress on SCP patterns, and the registration of 136 policies and 27 activities to implement SCP was carried out in 2020. Still, area-wise data are unavailable, and appropriate policies are needed to improve resource efficiency. Based on the limited data available on the food sector, as of 2016, 14% of food was lost, on average, before reaching the retail market. There is synergy in SDG targets, as reducing food loss may also help in solving problems to meet other targets (e.g., target 1.5, eliminating poverty; target 2.4, aiming towards zero hunger and improving food security; target 3.9, to lead a healthy lifestyle for every age group; and target 6.4 to substantially improve available freshwater (UN-SDGs, 2019 )). This is in line with Stafford-Smith et al. (2017)  and Fonseca et al. (2020) , who argue that there are still open issues regarding SDG performance measurements, operationalization and interlinkages. This study focuses on goal 12 of SDG 2030, which aims to make consumption and production patterns sustainable (see Table 1  ) and has been identified as the goal most associated with trade-offs (Fonseca et al., 2020 ). More specifically, this study focuses on the challenges faced in monitoring the SDG target 12.3 of halving food loss and waste and looking out for possibilities to achieve the target by 2030. After the eight Millennium Development Goals for 2000–2015, seventeen SDGs for 2015–2030 were framed by the UN to extend and build a sustainable framework globally. In the developed nations, much work has been done, but in emerging economies like India, little or no progress can be observed towards the SDG 2030 targets. In the 2021 Global Hunger Index, India ranked 101, slipping from its ranking in the 2020 index of 94 out of 116 countries. India ranks second in producing fresh fruits and vegetables, but 30% is wasted due to inefficiency in operations (Singh et al., 2018 ). To date, there has been a lack of research and data available to track the progress of the SDG 2030 targets. Focusing on target 12.3 of reducing food waste by 50% at the retail and consumer end and reducing food losses at the production phase, including post-harvest losses, the literature reports no study in the developing country context and only limited studies concerning developed nations. There is thus a need to find out the reasons behind the lack of progress seen in the development of SDG 2030 targets in emerging economies like India. This is the first attempt to figure out the challenges that hinder the progress of the SDG target 12.3 in an emerging economy and to address the strategies to overcome those challenges so SDG target 12.3 can be achieved and SCP patterns developed in the context of emerging economies like India. Taking this aim into consideration, the following objectives are framed:• To identify the challenges in monitoring SDG target 12.3 of halving food wastage in emerging economies;  • To identify the inter-relationships among the challenges in monitoring the SDG target 12.3 of SCP patterns;  • To prioritize the challenges that hinder this monitoring;  • To address and rank the opportunities and strategies to achieve the SDG 12 goal by 2030 successfully; and  • To examine the practical and managerial implications of the research study.    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2  presents the literature review on the challenges in monitoring SDG target 12.3. Section 3  presents the MCDM methodology followed by the case study, ranking of challenges and strategies in section 4 . Section 5  presents the discussion of results and Section 6  presents the study's implications. Section 7  presents the conclusion, limitations and future scope of research.  2 Literature review With the worldwide increase in population, demand for food products will to increase; due to food's perishable nature, however, its supply chain is complex and challenging. Monitoring has been an essential tool to ensure the smooth functioning of the food supply (Steinbach et al., 2016 ). Despite knowing the value of data, organizations are behind in managing the actual data set of waste produced throughout the supply chain (Bizikova et al., 2015 ). This failure can be due to a multitude of causes, including traceability issues, lack of infrastructure, complexities emerging practically in the market and lack of capital. Monitoring operational performance is of utmost importance, as it explains process efficiency and the bottlenecks can be remedied. Sustainability is the future, and those industries that are trying to shift towards clean practices, the circular economy and Industry 4.0 will survive in the market (Gupta et al., 2021 ). The 17 SDG 2030 goals were released to encourage this shift towards a culture of sustainability and are of great concern for emerging economies. Liu and Nguyen (2020)  quantified household food waste in Hanoi, Vietnam, and discussed the possible opportunities towards meeting target 12.3 of SDG 2030. They surveyed households and found multiple reasons for waste generation, including over-ordering, deterioration of quality, over-cooked food and large portion sizes. Although 20% of the respondents separated cooking waste for recycling before dumping it directly into the bins, 80% of respondents left it untreated, which is of great concern. Waste generated in rural areas was more significant than in urban areas, for which lack of awareness and technological incapability could be among the reasons. To successfully reduce food waste by 50%, the authors suggested that food policies and practical food waste treatment plants must be implemented. Gambetta et al. (2019)  studied the case of Uruguay, where they considered the financial support required to bring about sustainable development and discussed the various sources from which funds could be collected. The challenges faced in generating separate funds were also studied. Due to the lack of a developed financial sector in emerging economies, the public sector proves to be the primary source of funds, which makes it challenging to achieve SDGs targets. Simsek et al. (2020)  discussed the extra energy required to achieve energy-related SDG targets in Chile by 2030 (including target 12.3). Stanujkic et al. (2020)  took the case of EU countries to assess SDG 2030. They applied the MCDM-based CoCoSo methodology and the Shannon Entropy method. The results showed that Sweden implemented the best sustainable environments and Romania the worst. Lemaire and Limbourg (2019)  presented a literature review on food waste management to achieve the SDG target and discussed the causes of food loss, the challenges faced to solve the issue and the possible solutions to achieve sustainability. Their results indicated that the logistics network needed to be redefined, awareness regarding redistribution is lacking among the consumers and the monitoring of food supply chain issues is lagging. In practice, Indian food industries suffer challenges such as poor logistics networks (Gokarn and Kuthambalayan, 2017 ; Hegde and Madhuri, 2013 ), poor supply and demand forecasting (Hegde and Madhuri, 2013 ), operational breakdowns (Shirani and Demichela, 2015 ; Xiaoping, 2016 ), lack of traceability (Balaji and Arshinder, 2016 ), lack of skilled workers (Diabat et al., 2012 ), lack of data capturing (Kumar et al., 2021 ) and poor management of business roles by the organization (Kharola et al., 2022 ). Past research focusing on quantifying food waste has mainly been done in developed economies (Caldeira et al., 2019 ; De Laurentiis et al., 2018 ; Gasper et al., 2019 ; Redlingshöfer et al., 2017 ; Thyberg and Tonjes, 2016 ). The current study identifies and prioritizes the challenges faced by developing economies in monitoring food waste management to meet SDG target 12.3; the strategies to combat those challenges are also addressed and ranked to ease the burden on decision-makers. To find the critical challenges that hinder the progress of SDG 2030 targets, it is essential to look at the challenges identified in the literature. This research carried out a structured review of the literature as proposed by Tranfield et al. (2003) , Yadav et al. (2020)  and Gupta et al. (2021)  using the following steps used to screen articles appropriate for study:• With the vision of industrial symbiosis, the concept of sustainability gained attention in the 2000s. The SDG targets were released in 2015, so to cover both aspects, the time period chosen was 2000–2021.  • The following keywords were used to select the articles relevant to our study, including: “Sustainable consumption and production patterns”, “Sustainable development goals 2030 targets”, “Food waste management”, Food waste reduction strategies” and “Sustainability”.  • To check the authenticity of the articles, databases such as EBSCO, Science Direct, Emerald, Springer, and various SDG reports from the official website of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) were chosen. The article selection process suggested by Gupta et al. (2019)  was followed. The primary step was to download all the articles from the database in the English language using the keywords mentioned above. Articles in peer-reviewed journals were chosen for the study. Book chapters, conference papers and editorial articles were not included. A total of 95 articles and UN reports on SDG 2030 targets were chosen based on the keywords. The articles were then filtered based on a reading of the title and abstract, which yielded 80 articles. To avoid human judgmental errors, articles were read thoroughly, and a total of 70 articles were used in this study.    Following are the significant challenges that hinder the progress of SDG 2030 goal 12 of SCP patterns and target 12.3 of halving the food waste at the retail and consumption phase (See Table 2  ). 2.1 C1: Fragmented national institutional systems concerning SCP To shift towards novel policies and strategies, different agencies come into the picture. The missing link between the governmental bodies and the educational institutions inhibits the successful application of the SCP patterns. For developing indicators of SCP, substantial support by the regulatory bodies is needed for the institutional building, which is not present. The emerging economies also lack international support, and the solution for the same is treating Earth as one whole planet. Collaborations should be developed beyond geographical boundaries to build the SCP patterns practically. Thus, in developing and implementing SCP indicators, it is essential to recognize the institutional constraints. Reporting on the environment is carried out independently by the countries and even within different institutions due to the decentralized information system. Different agencies utilizing different information systems that increase the cost and reporting cannot be used for cross-sectoral approaches as these are only viable for their use. The learnings from the literature suggest that the integration of models is the priority, and flows at each stage of the supply chain should be interconnected following the forward and reverse flows, thus switching towards the closed-loop supply chain. Adding the concept of circularity in the supply chain may fill the communication gap between the systems (Abbey and Guide, 2017 ). The problem of coordination among the institutional bodies has affected the data sources. The data is available at multiple institutions, but reconciliation from multiple sources is a significant problem. Due to institutional inefficiency, they often miss out on important information and fail to publish it (Chen et al., 2013 ). The international agency developed the National Statistical Plans but failed to implement them practically subsequently. Considering the SCP target, data collection depends on multiple organizations' interests and objectives. Therefore, institutional coordination is inevitable to register the essential information.  2.2 C2: Top management commitment The top management plays a vital role in policymaking, organizing training programs, and upgrading technology. The narrowing of interest and lack of support from the top management in building a sustainable environment is a challenge for sustainable consumption and production patterns. Due to the indifference of the top management, allocation of resources is a problem considering the sustainability aspects (Caldera et al., 2019 ). A company's vision should be clear, and the decision from the experts should be in line with the target without compromising the environmental and social goals (Menon and Ravi, 2021 ). At present, there is a lack of interest observed by the firm's experts in upgrading facilities as it requires a lot of planning and awareness about the new technologies. The top authorities' of different organizations need to develop a better communication mechanism among themselves and the government should help them in achieving sustainability targets.  2.3 C3: Attitude towards problem The challenges exist in the system, but the ways to handle them are inefficient in developing economies. Half of the problem depends upon how the top-level managers approach them. However, in emerging economies, the approach to the problem is pessimistic, which turns out to be a challenge. Solving a problem begins with a positive mindset and trust in the innovation as technology can do wonders if utilized appropriately (expert's opinion). In contrast, a negative attitude towards a challenge can lead to another challenge which is not preferable.  2.4 C4: Weak environmental regulations and enforcement Designing a rigid framework is necessary to make the supply chains sustainable and reduce food wastage. Since food waste has an environmental impact, there is a need to implement robust policies, which is lacking in developing economies like India. The relaxation in the policies to the organizations regarding carbon emission results in unsustainable ways of production, and the target of SCP patterns will be difficult to achieve (Chan et al., 2018 ). The regulatory bodies should take strict action in the production and consumption patterns as the food produced that goes wasted and untreated impacts the environment negatively. Due to fragmented policies, lack of expertise, and weak regulations, novel innovations like CE practices that aim to turn the supply chain sustainable are hard to implement in developing nations. Weak environmental pressure by the regulatory body leads to low awareness among the public regarding the negative impacts of food wastage. Thus, implementing rigid eco-friendly practices and laws is essential to transform SCP patterns.  2.5 C5: Education for SCP For the successful implementation of SCP, the educational program plays a vital role as education is the key to spread awareness and using scientific tools efficiently. It is shocking that despite knowing the consequence of food waste there is a lack of effort in reducing food loss as still it is not seen as a competitive advantage among firms. However, the food produced and not eaten is a loss of limited natural resources. Education for all among food supply chain partners from production to consumption is essential to categorize losses at each phase. They must be aware of the proportion of losses occurring at the particular phase (Parfitt et al., 2010 ). Awareness regarding data labeling, for example, best-before-date, ingredients, price and after-use treatment of the food packages, Etc., may decrease food waste (Aschemann-Witzel et al., 2015 ). SCP and FLW should be included in the education curriculum to bring behavioral changes in the consumption pattern (Lemaire and Limbourg, 2019 ). UNEP 2015 also released guidelines on education regarding sustainable consumption (Glavič, 2021 ). Developing economies lack educational campaigns, and there is no discussion on sustainability and food waste issues. The shift in psychology is required to optimize the use of resources and secure them for the future generations.  2.6 C6: Resistance to change Resisting change in adopting innovation acts as a challenge in developing a sustainable environment. There is a need for up-gradation in policies, tools, and techniques to shift from conventional practices to innovativeness. However, fear of high investment in updating facilities impedes bringing change. The required change in the system can overcome the inefficient process and solve many environmental issues, but many hindrances are blocking sustainability (Acciaro et al., 2014 ). There is a fear of failure and losing wealth as officials are uncertain about the benefits (Khan et al., 2021 ). The food supply chain needs some serious innovation from producing to retailing phase as about 30% of losses occur due to poor handling practices and lack of expertise. Both firms and the government should organize awareness campaigns and training programs to minimize the fear of moving to a new system.  2.7 C7: Data availability The fundamental problem with the monitoring of SDGs is the lack of availability of quality data which was significant in the case of MDGs (Bizikova et al., 2015 ). Over half of the countries not reported to at least 30% of the MDGs indicators (Chen et al., 2013 ), and SDGs are not only complex but are more specifically involved goals, like SCP, whose little data is available from multiple sources. Without any delay, countries should learn from past mistakes and work on new resources to capture, link, and examine new data, explicitly considering the environmental perspective. There is no maintenance of Pollutant Release and Transfer Report (PRTR) systems in which further research needs to be done, especially in developing countries, as it provides essential information. For the novel issues like SCP, quality of data and source of data availability are the major problem. The relevant sources are limited, and there is a lack of consistency in the periodicity of the data constructed (Sanga, 2011 ). Due to the lack of data sources, comparability is an issue for these methodologies, and international standards are essential. With the non-availability of data and inappropriate statistical tools, measuring the progress of SDGs targets is a challenge (Corrado et al., 2019 ).  2.8 C8: Continuous improvement culture To achieve sustainable goals, continuous improvement is needed by closing the chain by a feedback loop, thus taking suggestions from customers, managers, and top officials. The process improvement at each phase results in updating the technology, which demands flexibility and responsiveness in the supply chain (Govindan, 2018 ). There is a lack of continuous improvement in the supply chain, which fails to solve the purpose. Technological advancement demands continuous improvement in processes, a significant problem in developing economies (expert's opinion) .  2.9 C9: Data use The main objective of data generation and developing indicators is to use them practically. The bottleneck in the case of MDGs was that data was only used for global reporting rather than practically using for policymaking (AbouZahr et al., 2007 ). Thus for fulfilling the objective of SCP, efficient statistical tools are to be used for developing policies, producing new indicators for fulfilling the targets and keeping a check on the progress. The interpretation of data is of utmost importance, which can be possible with the help of the organization's expertise and integrated statistical system (Steinbach et al., 2016 ; Corrado et al., 2019 ). The ground report is necessary for developing policies and new indicators for SCP patterns, and appropriately using them is essential.  2.10 C10: Resources and technical capacity The truth is that resources are limited, and funds should be raised for statistical capacity building as the agencies have limited funds for institutional development (Lipinski et al., 2013 ). Installation of the additional resources and technical capabilities is necessary for shifting towards SCP patterns, which requires a high initial investment. For the developing economy, lack of financial resources restricts updating of facilities which is turning out to be a significant constraint (Bizikova et al., 2015 ; Karki et al., 2021 ). For focusing on sustainable patterns, the supply chain needs to implement best practices but has limited expertise and financial support, which turns out to be the stumbling block in focusing on halving food waste by the end of 2030.  2.11 C11: Financing SDGs targets The implementation of the policies or building any framework requires finances. Developing economies like India lack fulfilling necessities such as food, cloth, and shelter. The report provided by United Nations MDG 2014, in 2010, 30% of the world's 1.2 billion poor lived in India (Bizikova et al., 2015 ). Also, according to the World Bank report 2013, 30% of its population was below the $1.9 a day poverty line. SDG's goal for a better world can be possible with the public-private partnership with the private sector playing a significant role in sectors like infrastructure, food security, and climate control (David, 2018 ).  2.12 C12: Benchmarking The food supply chain is complicated, and the product is consumable, rendering it a vulnerable supply chain. The quality of the product depends on time and external conditions. Though there are many food standards and certification schemes available i.e. ISO 22000, FSSC 22000 (Food Safety System Certification), ISO/TS 22002–1:2009, Food manufacturing, ISO/TS 22002–2:2013, Catering, ISO/TS 22002–3:2011, Farming, ISO/TS 22002–4:2013, Food packaging manufacturing, ISO/TS 22002–6:2016, Feed and animal food production, PAS 221:2013, Retail/supermarkets, BAP (Best Aquaculture Practices), BRC Global Standard for Agents and Brokers, BRC Global Standard for Food Safety, BRC Global Standard for Packaging and Packaging Materials, BRC Global Standard for Storage and Distribution, Global GAP (Good Agricultural Practice), IFS Logistics Certification, SQF (Safe Quality Food) but practically these are overlooked in the emerging economies like India as per suggested by the experts' opinion. Thus, there is a lack of standards, and quantification of sustainability standards is difficult as the methods to evaluate sustainability performance are not uniform. There is a need to raise the competitive firm's standard, which automatically puts pressure on the firms to compete. Regulatory bodies and firms should set the quality standards that help achieve sustainability (Experts' opinion).  2.13 C13: Uncertainties about benefits The new technologies are necessary for sustainable operations, which initially demand high financial support and the risk of installing new facilities when decision-makers are uncertain about the benefits. CE serves as an indicator for SCP, but due to the lack of economies of scale with CE, it limits SCM integration (Farooque et al., 2019 ). The firm also resists the change as its conventional operations still yield profit. Due to the lack of competitors with novel technologies, they still prefer the ongoing operations (Experts’ opinion). If this persists, the goal of SCP pattern and sub-indicator halving the food waste is hard to achieve. For this, the government should provide proper training, mock drills, and conferences on the benefits of sustainable growth and its necessity.  2.14 C14: Traceability issues There is a lack of traceable practices in the supply chain, making it challenging to make processes sustainable (Kumar and Choubey, 2021 ). Traceability helps locate the product's quality and condition. Traceability requires updated methodologies like circular economy, block-chain technology, industry 4.0, Etc. to be incorporated into emerging economies. Monitoring sustainable development goals requires incorporating good traceable practices, which is a challenge and needs to be looked at carefully. Poor tracking abilities due to poor information system is one of the reasons causing hindrance in achieving sustainability (Balaji and Arshinder, 2016 ).   3 Methodology This research uses a hybrid MCDM methodology to identify challenges and strategies to meet target 12.3 of the SDG 2030 goal, i.e., halving food wastage by 2030. Initially, a rigorous literature review and a modified Delphi method are applied to identify challenges and strategies, which identifies fourteen challenges and seven strategies. The next phase includes ISM-MICMAC analysis which finds the inter-relationship between the challenges and categorizes them into four quadrants which were further used for FAHP analysis to analyze and determine the relative fuzzy weight of each indicator. For overcoming these challenges in emerging economies, the probable strategies are discussed and ranked using the VIKOR methodology, as no single approach can combat all the challenges. Fig. 1   presents the proposed research methodology used in this research. 3.1 Interpretive structural modeling - MICMAC Interpretive structural modeling helps extract a well-structured relationship among the complex variables based on the expert's opinion while brainstorming sessions (Warfield, 1974 ). Duperrin and Godet (1973)  introduced the MICMAC methodology to determine the dependent and independent factors based on the driving and dependence power obtained from ISM. Many research studies have been carried out to address the issues of a sustainable supply chain. Diabat et al. (2012)  implemented ISM analysis to determine the risk in making the food supply chain sustainable and found mitigation strategies. Govindan et al. (2012)  developed the ISM-MICMAC model to determine relationships between attributes in selecting the best third-party logistics provider. Kumar and Rahman (2017)  incorporated ISM and fuzzy AHP methodology to identify drivers of sustainable supply chain and found interrelationships between the variables. Diabat and Govindan (2011)  implemented ISM-MICMAC to model the drivers of greening the supply chain. Following are the steps involved in implementing ISM methodology:• Develop a structured self-interaction matrix (SSIM) by developing a pairwise relationship between the variables.  • From the SSIM matrix, the reachability matrix is obtained and further checked for transitivity. The transitivity checks lie on the assumption that if variable X is related to Y, variable Y is related to Z, then X must be related to Z.  • After the transitivity check, further partitioning of the reachability matrix is done to different levels.  • The digraph is obtained based on the reachability matrix after removing the transitivity links.  • The digraph is then converted to the ISM model by replacing the nodes into variables statements.  • For the MICMAC analysis, variables are placed among four quadrants based on the respective driving and dependence power which helps in classifying variables into autonomous, dependent, linkage, and driving variables.     3.2 Fuzzy AHP Saaty (1980)  developed the AHP method, which prioritizes the criteria relatively based on its importance in multi-criteria decision-making problems. Though conventional AHP deals with qualitative criteria judged by the experts, it cannot unfold the human judgmental biases and vagueness. It is helpful for the experts to mark the preference of the criteria by linguistic statements in comparison to numerical values. For solving the fuzzy environment problems, this study uses an expansion of the AHP method. Many different approaches are there to calculate fuzziness, and in taking advantage of one over the other, the extent analysis methodology is used for fuzzy AHP as proposed by Chang (1996) . The application of fuzzy AHP or the fuzzy set theory with other MCDM tools is observed in past studies (Wang et al., 2021 ; Jovčić et al., 2019 ; Awasthi et al., 2018 ; Mangla et al., 2015 ; Rezaei and Ortt, 2013 ; Kumar and Rahman, 2017 ). The present study uses the fuzzy-AHP methodology to prioritize the challenges faced in fulfilling the target 12.3 of SDG of 2030. Following are the steps involved in the application of fuzzy-AHP. (Ayhan, 2013 ).Step 1: Develop the Fuzzy-AHP Saaty's scale and linguistic terms (Appendix A , Table A1 ) (Kilincci and Onal, 2011 ).    Following the linguistic terms, the experts use the fuzzy number provided on the right side of the scale. If the expert mark “Challenge 1 is fairly preferable in comparison to Challenge 2,” then it takes the fuzzy triangular value as (4, 5, 6). Conversely, the pairwise comparison of Challenge 2 to Challenge 1 will take the fuzzy triangular value as (1/6, 1/5, 1/4). Equation (1)  depicts the matrix representation for the pairwise comparison.(1) S k  ˜  = [ a ˜  11 m  a ˜  12 m  …  a ˜  1 n  m  a ˜  21 m  a ˜  22 m  … a ˜  2 n  m  … a ˜  i j  m  … a ˜  n 1  m  a ˜  n 2  m  … a ˜  n n  m  ]      Where: a ˜  i j  m     depicts that the m-th expert's preference of i-th criteria over j-th criteria, in the form of fuzzy triangular number. The sign “” demonstrates the triangular number.Step 2: After obtaining the fuzzy pairwise matrix, calculate the fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to ith alternative.   (2) S = ∑ j = 1  n  a ˜  i j    ( ∑ i = 1  n  ∑ j = 1  n  a ˜  i j     )  − 1       Where, Si  depicts the fuzzy synthetic extent.Sxtep 3: Next step is to calculate the degree of possibility (DOP). The two fuzzy numbers are compared so as to get the DOP of one fuzzy number greater than other fuzzy numbers. Suppose we have two fuzzy number M1  (l1 ,m1 ,u1 ) and M2  (l2 ,m2 ,u2 ). The DOP of M2 ≥ M1  is represented as follows:    V (M2 ≥ M1 ) = hgt (M1  ∩ M2 ) = μ (d)(3) = { 1 , i f  m 1  > m 2      0 , i f  l 2  > u 1     l 2  − u 1   ( m 1  − u 1   )  − ( m 2  − l 2   )    , o t h e r w i s e         Where, hgt (M1  ∩ M2 ) denotes the highest intersection point of M1  and M2  and μ (d) is the ordinate of the intersection point.Step 4: After obtaining the DOP, calculate DOP for a convex fuzzy number to be greater than k convex fuzzy number which is given as follows:   (4) V(S ≥ S1 , S2 , S3 , …, Sn ) = min V (S ≥ Si ), i = 1,2,3, …k   (5) d ’   ( A i  )  = min  V ( S i  > S k  )  , = W i ′   , k = 1,2 , … , n     Step 5: Calculate the weight vector W i ′     of the factors by following the above procedure which is represented as below:   (6) ( W ′  = W 1 ′  , W 2 ′  , … , W n ′   )  T      Step 6: Finally after normalization, non-fuzzy weight vector weights are presented as given below:   (7) W’  = (W1 , W2 , …,Wn )T      3.3 VIKOR The methodology of VIKOR developed by Opricovic (1998) is used for compromise ranking and is preferable when having varying criteria. It determines a compromise solution derived from “closeness to ideal solution and joint consent through concessions”. Many research studies incorporated the VIKOR method for ranking alternatives (Prakash and Barua, 2016; Awasthi et al., 2018 ; Gupta et al., 2019 ; Kumar et al., 2022 ). Following are the steps involved in the VIKOR methodology:Step 1: Obtain a pairwise comparison matrix for alternatives w. r.t criteria using linguistic scale (Appendix A , Table A2 ).  Step 2: Based on the ‘y’ experts input, the average matrix is obtained using equation (8) .   (8) X = 1 y  ∑ y = 1  y  X y       Step 3: Calculate the best X i +     and the worst X i −     values of all the criteria, i = 1,2, …,n.   (9) X i +  = Max  ( x i j   )      (10) X i −  = Min  ( x i j   )      Where X i +     depicts the positive ideal solution and X i −     depicts the negative ideal solution for the ith criteria.Step 4 Next step is to calculate Si  and Ri values for a = 1,2, ….m using equations (11) and (12) .(11) S i  = ∑ j = 1  m  W j  [ ( X i +  − X i j  X i −  − X i j   )  ]        (12) R i  = Max j    [ W j  ( X i +  − X i j  X i −  − X i j   )   ]      Where Si  depicts the distance of ath alternative from positive ideal solution and Ri  depicts the distance of ath alternative from negative ideal solution and Wj  denotes the criteria weights obtained from AHP analysis.Step 5: Obtain the values for Qi  by using equation (13) .   (13) Q i  = v  ( S i  − S *   S −  − S *    )  + ( 1 − v  )  ( R i  − R *   R −  − R *    )      Where. S* = mini  Si , S−  = maxi  Si , R* = mini Ri  and R−  = maxi Ri  and v    signifies the weight for the strategy of maximum group utility, and in this study, it is taken as 0.5.Step 6: Based on Qi  values, rank to alternatives are given.  Step 7: A compromise solution is proposed based on minimum Qi  values for which two conditions are checked:    Condition 1: Q (A2 ) – Q (A1 ) ≥ 1 m − 1      Where Q (A1 ) denotes that has got first rank, Q (A2 ) has got second rank and m is the total number of alternatives. Condition 2: Alternative A1  must also be the best ranked by S or/and R.Step 8: Alternative which obtains minimum Qi  value is ranked first.        4 Case Study and Results 4.1 Case company information and experts’ details We approached 23 experts from the food industry and reputed institutes with different operational and educational roles to fulfil the objectives. To examine the root cause of the failure of the SDG 2030 target 12.3, decision-making experts were chosen among the food industries and educational institutions with a minimum experience of 8 years. Ten of them agreed to participate in this research study, resulting in a response rate of approximately 44%. Table 3   presents the background details for the experts.  4.2 Identification of challenges Identifying the criteria is quite challenging in the case of tracing the progress of SDG 2030 goals, as little information is available for emerging economies. These goals go unacknowledged, and six years have already passed since 2015 with little or no observable signs of progress. From an extensive literature review, including the reports published by the UN on SDG 2030 targets and experts’ opinions, 15 challenges that limit the progress of target 12.3 were identified. With the help of industrial and institutional experts, the criteria were further refined and developed. The Delphi method was used for the finalization process, and 14 significant challenges relevant to the context of target 12.3 were ultimately taken up for further study. Table 2  presents the final list of challenges.  4.3 Structural self-interaction matrix To set up a relationship among the factors under study, experts were questioned regarding, for instance, whether variable i  guides variable j  or vice versa. The ISM VAXO scale was used to compare variables with each other to get the responses from the experts presented below:V= Variable i  guides variable j ;  A = Variable j  guides variable i ;  X = Variables i  and j  guide each other;  O= Variables i  and j  are not related.    Based on brainstorming sessions with the experts, the structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) was obtained for the 14 identified challenges (Table 4  ).  4.4 Reachability matrix A reachability matrix was obtained by substituting binary digits 0 and 1 indicating the relationship among the factors in binary form for the V, A, X and O of the SSIM according to the following rules:• The (i,j) entry V in the SSIM leads to (i,j) entry as 1 in the reachability matrix and (j,i) entry as 0;  • The (i,j) entry A in the SSIM leads to (i,j) entry as 0 in the reachability matrix and (j,i) entry as 1;  • The (i,j) entry X in the SSIM leads to (i,j) entry as 0 in the reachability matrix and (j,i) entry as 1;  • The (i,j) entry O in the SSIM leads to (i,j) entry as 0 in the reachability matrix and (j,i) entry as also 0.    The matrix thus obtained is the initial reachability matrix and is presented in Appendix A : Table A3 . The final reachability matrix was obtained by incorporating a transitivity check into the initial reachability matrix (See Table 5  ).  4.5 Partitioning of reachability matrix To achieve the level for each factor, we partitioned the final reachability matrix using the reachability and antecedent sets. The reachability set takes on the factor itself and all other factors that it achieves. The antecedent set takes on the factor itself and all other factors that help to achieve it. For instance, for factor 1 (Table 6  ), the reachability set includes 1, and other factors that can be achieved by 1 are 7, 10, 13 and 14; the antecedent set includes 1, and the other factors that help achieve 1 are 2, 3, 6, 7, 12 and 13. After determining the reachability and antecedent sets, we obtained an intersection set. When the reachability and intersection sets coincide, we get level 1; factors falling under level 1 are excluded, and we iterated the process until we achieved the levels for all the factors. Table 6  shows level partition of reachability matrix; the results of all other iterations are condensed in Appendix A , Table A4 , presenting the levels for each factor.  4.6 Formation of digraph The hierarchical model derives from the final reachability matrix, and the digraph obtained after removing the transitivity yields the final ISM model (Fig. 2  ). Factors 9, 10 and 14 acquired level 1 in the hierarchy, followed by factors 1, 7, and 13 taking second place, and further, all other factors reach the predefined level.  4.7 MICMAC analysis We performed MICMAC analysis to determine the factors’ driving and dependence power. Based on the driving and dependence power, the factors were classified into four quadrants: Quadrant I, which depicts autonomous factors having weak dependence and driving power to disengage from the other factors; Quadrant II, which represents dependent factors having low dependence power and high driving power; Quadrant III, which shows the linkage factors having high dependent power and high driving power (these factors are important in achieving subordinate factors); and Quadrant IV, which depicts the driving factors having low dependence power and high driving power (Fig. 3  ). In the present study, factor lack of attitude towards problem (3), and education for SCP (5) have high driving power and weak dependence power (Quadrant IV). These factors are significant for initiating SCP patterns and monitoring process. Quadrant III includes seven factors: fragmented national institutional systems concerning SCP (1), lack of top management commitment (2), resistance to change (6), data availability (7), lack of continuous improvement culture (8), no benchmarking (12), and uncertainties about benefits (13). These factors are the linkage factors that help to achieve the factors in Quadrant II; these factors are crucial for implementing SCP patterns. Quadrant II includes the factors which are dependent on other factors and have low driving power: data use (9), resources and technical capability (10), and traceability issues (14). Quadrant I contains the factor weak environmental regulations and enforcement (4), and financing SDG target (11), which is disconnected from the system due to its weak dependence and driving power.  4.8 Prioritizing challenges with fuzzy AHP The present study used fuzzy AHP to quantify the results by examining the relative weights of the challenges placed in three stages of developing SCP patterns obtained with the help of ISM MICMAC. In this study, from those 14 challenges, challenge 4 (Environmental regulations and enforcement) is excluded from further evaluation, as it is disconnected from the system due to its weak dependence and driving power. The factors from Quadrant IV are placed in the initiating development of the SCP stage, as these are the driving factors, also challenge 11 is included in this stage as it has favourable driving power and may affect the study as suggested by the experts; the factors from Quadrant III are placed in implementing the SCP phase, as these are the linkage factors and will be helpful in achieving the subordinate factors and implementing SCP patterns; and the factors from Quadrant II are placed at the building stage, as these are the dependent factors and belong to the final stage of developing the SCP framework (see Fig. 4  ), as suggested by Kumar and Rahman (2017) . The following steps were used to evaluate the model, as explained by Shaw et al. (2012).Step 1: Challenges faced in monitoring target 12.3 of SDG 2030 have been determined.  Step 2: Pairwise comparison matrix was formed by the group of experts with the help of Saaty's nine-point scale, and after the brainstorming session, final consensus was reached.  Step 3: Responses recorded by the group of experts were used to obtain the triangular fuzzy number (Appendix A , Table A1 ).  Step 4: Extent analysis method was used to obtain the crisp relative importance weight for the challenges, as proposed by Chang (1996) .Step 4.1: The fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the ith alternative was calculated.

W’  = (d (A1 ), d (A2 ), … d (An ))T   = (1, 0.972, 0.493)T   = (0.406, 0.394, 0.2)       The elementary fuzzy AHP model is presented in Fig. 4 , and the pairwise comparison of challenges is shown in Table 7  . We also calculated the weights of the challenges under the three criteria. Table 8   presents the normalized weight of the criteria and sub-criteria, as well as the global weight by multiplying the weight of the criteria by the sub-criteria.  4.9 Strategies and policies The SDG 2030 goals are framed for a better world and extend the 2015 Millennium Development Goals, but given the state of current ongoing efforts, the possibility of achieving these targets looks bleak. For a long-term goal of 15 years, the initial period is over, and we can observe little or no progress. Challenges have already been discussed regarding the specific target 12.3, halving the food wastage in the retail and consumption phase and minimizing the post-harvest losses. To overcome those challenges, robust strategies and policies need to be framed, which are associated with a complex set of knowledge, skills and intent that would result in successful progress towards the target (see Table 9  ). In the changing environment, updated EFQM 2020-based business models should be introduced, because they integrate multiple stakeholders from business to academia. This would provide the bridge between the purpose and strategy, in line with the UN SDGs and create enduring stakeholder value by focusing on outstanding performance achievement and responding to change and disruption to transform the future through innovation and creativity, as suggested by Fonseca (2022)  and Murthy et al. (2021) . With the help of expert opinions and a literature review, we listed and ranked the strategies (see Table 12 ).  4.10 Strategies ranked using the VIKOR method After uncovering the relationship between the challenges and ranking them based on global weights, the next step was determining the best strategies to combat these challenges using the VIKOR method. No single strategy can overcome the challenges, and implementing a combination of strategies is essential. As above, challenge 4 (weak environmental regulations and enforcement) was an autonomous variable and was excluded from further evaluation. Table A2  in Appendix A  represents the linguistic scale, in accordance to which the experts separately rated all the alternative strategies with regard to the challenges. The average matrix was obtained using equation (8)  after the individual expert ratings (Table 10  ). Further, using equations (9) and (10) , maximum and minimum values were determined for the challenges. Using equations 11–13 , the S, R and Q values were determined, as shown in Table 11   . From all the strategies, the one with the minimum Q value was ranked as the best alternative, along with satisfying two conditions, as discussed in step 7 of the VIKOR methodology. Here, strategy 3 (financing SDG target strategy) obtained the first rank, having the lowest Q value and satisfying both the conditions – that is, Q (S6) − Q (S3) ≥ 1/(7−1), and Q (S3) also obtained the top rank for R and S values, as presented in Table 12 .   5 Discussions of results This research study combined a one-round Delphi-ISM-fuzzy AHP technique focusing on challenges that hinder monitoring of the SDG 2030 target 12.3 for the food supply chain. Initially, we looked at 14 challenges after an extensive literature review and brainstorming sessions followed by the ISM methodology for obtaining the interrelationships between the obstacles, which were then ranked using AHP analysis. The hierarchical ISM model obtained can be split into three different levels: top-level, intermediate level and bottom-level challenges. The bottom-level challenges are recognized as the model's foundation and are likely to impact the other variables. The result showed that ESCP (5), ERE (4), ATP (3) and FSDG (11) are at the bottom of the hierarchy and drive the intermediate challenges RTC (6), TMC (2), BE (12) and CIC (8). Decision makers, regulatory bodies and policymakers should focus on the bottom-level challenges to minimize the intricacies of adopting SCP in the supply chain (Khan et al., 2021 ). The challenges at the upper-level – FNIS (1), DA (7) and UAB (13), TA (14), DA (9), and RTC (10) – are dependent on the challenges below them. All the challenges were classified into four quadrants using MICMAC analysis based on dependence and driving power. The outcome of the MICMAC analysis helped to build the conceptual hierarchical model for developing SCP, and quantification of factors was done using fuzzy AHP methodology. Table 8  shows the category-wise and overall ranking of each challenge. The weights obtained from fuzzy AHP explain the significance of the criteria in creating SCP patterns in developing economies. The initial development of SCP (0.406) has the highest weight as, in the case of developing economies, sustainable environment needs to be established before implementing SCP (0.394) and further increasing sustainability (0.200). Developing an SCP culture in the supply chain is thus the essential first step towards meeting the SDG target by 2030 (David, 2018 ). It is essential to address these challenges for initiating, implementing and developing SCP patterns. Table 8  presents the importance of challenges in each category – that is, in the first category (initiating SCP development), education for SCP (5) is the most crucial challenge and, from the past literature, Adomßent et al. (2014)  agreed that education is the crucial factor for initiating SCP. From the second category (implementing SCP), data availability (7) and, from the third category (building SCP), data use (9) are the most crucial challenges. These results are in line with Kamble et al. (2020) , who argued that a sustainable supply chain is not only about data availability but also about the ease of using that data. Rankings based on global weights showed that education for SCP (0.265) ranked first, while financing SDG target (0.135) ranked second, followed by data use (0.122); data availability (0.092) and continuous improvement culture (0.076) are in fourth and fifth position, respectively. The literature thus supports the results that monitoring SDGs progress can be traced by extracting precise data from the source, thus creating awareness among professionals. The government should also release separate funds for sustainable development (Aday and Aday, 2020 ; Farooque et al., 2019 ; Govindan, 2018 ). All these challenges will affect the Global Hunger Index, as it may lead to data loss, resulting in manipulation. To overcome the identified challenges, strategies were suggested from an extensive literature review and discussion with a set of experts. Ranking of the strategies was done using the VIKOR methodology, which helped to prioritize the strategy to be implemented to combat the challenges of the SDG 2030 (Table 12 ). The results showed that financing the SDG target strategy (S3) holds the first rank to initiate progress towards sustainability, as a huge capital investment is required. The past studies by Kumar et al. (2022)  and Parida et al. (2021)  corroborate these results, as they agreed that sustainable financing is required to achieve SDG targets. The government and firms should thus release separate funds to build a sustainable culture. The circular proficiencies and skill enhancement strategy (S6) holds second rank for updating the supply chains from linear to circular. Circular practices need to be implemented, and a skill enhancement programme needs to be organized to introduce supply chain actors to the technology for introducing a circular economy in the supply chain. As suggested by Fonseca (2022)  and Murthy et al. (2021) , the EFQM 2020 model should be implemented for business excellence through a skill enhancement programme. Apart from this, other strategies also need to be a focus, including a circular technology development strategy, R&D strategy and collaboration strategy, as a mix of strategies will help combat the challenges. A collaborative effort from stakeholders, government and consumers is required to build an SCP environment throughout the food supply chain. Monitoring and implementing SCP patterns will help reduce food waste by 50% by 2030 (Gupta et al., 2020 ). The present study provides a conceptual hierarchical model for developing SCP in the food supply chain in emerging economies like India. Past studies for building SCP patterns either had different criteria or had a different area of specialization than the food supply chain. A broad comparison of important prior studies with the current study is presented in Table 13  .  6 Implications of the study The present study has significant implications for food practitioners, researchers and policymakers. SDG 2030 target 12.3 is framed to reduce food wastage by 50%. In developing nations, challenges to fulfil the objectives differ from those in developed countries. Food industries can consider these challenges to build SCP patterns. We found that education for SCP, financing SDG target, data use, and data availability are significant challenges hindering the progress of SDG 2030 targets. This has several implications. This study determined the critical business approach for sustainability – that is, circular technology, clean practices and waste management. The challenges to monitoring the success of the SDG target 12.3 were examined, and managers can review the obstacles and come out with optimized results with better social, economic and environmental returns. This study also explained the strategy to combat those challenges. This prioritization of challenges will help managers look for strategies for their firms and implement them with some modifications given the real environment in the firm. Most organizations are struggling to measure food waste data accurately. The results of this study will help managers get better data about food waste management and improvise better solutions, such as incorporating 3R practices in their firms. Managers can organize skill enhancement workshops and conferences to upgrade employees’ technical capabilities. To raise food quality standards and reduce the environmental impact, regular quality checks and more sustainable solutions need to be found. Due to the complexities of the food supply chain, the food industry faces numerous challenges in implementing sustainable approaches. However, the extant literature lacks a discussion of SDG targets to be achieved by 2030 globally. This study will thus help researchers identify more challenges and strategies in this domain, increasing the adoption rate of SCP patterns. As suggested by Fonseca (2022)  and Murthy et al. (2021) , novel business models like EFQM 2020 should be incorporated to achieve business excellence. Past studies have shown that emerging economies are falling behind in their progress towards SDG targets, and the future of industries includes innovative approaches like clean practices, the circular economy and industry 4.0, which will help to achieve SDG targets. Thus, policymakers should frame policies to provide incentives to firms, and firms should give priority for government tenders and contracts that practise sustainable approaches. Prioritized ratings of the challenges can be used by regulatory bodies to monitor the success of SDG targets and frame strategies accordingly. Thus, the challenges mentioned in this research will help to determine the preliminary steps to be taken in building policies that are environmentally friendly, economically feasible and industrially sustainable.  7 Conclusion, limitations and recommendations for future research The present study adds to the existing literature by advancing in-depth panel discussions on the challenges and strategies for making consumption and production patterns sustainable. This study prioritized these challenges and discussed the probable strategies to assist the firms in fulfilling the aim of the research. Fourteen main challenges were identified based on the literature and expert opinions. The inter-relationship among these challenges was obtained using ISM MICMAC analysis with the help of expert opinions. The outcome was used to build a conceptual hierarchical model for developing SCP; factors were further prioritized using fuzzy AHP. The results showed that education for SCP, financing SDG targets, data use, and data availability are the main obstacles to monitoring and achieving SDG 2030 target 12.3. The probable strategies were presented with the help of literature support and expert opinions, then ranked with the VIKOR methodology. The results showed that financing SDG targets, circular proficiencies and skill enhancement and R&D strategy were the most important strategies to overcome the identified challenges. Understanding the importance of each criterion within the food supply chain can reduce waste generation at each phase and thus will help in developing SCP patterns in the supply chain. The present study has some limitations. The current work was the first attempt to consider significant challenges to monitoring the progress of SDG 2030 targets in emerging economies like India. The results and the intensities of the factors may vary for developed countries. The challenges found were primarily institutional, and further challenges based on social factors should be identified in future studies. Based on the challenges identified, a conceptual model and optimal strategies were suggested and, future studies could develop more policies and models like the EFQM 2020 novel business model, as suggested by Fonseca (2022)  and Murthy et al. (2021) , to deal with other aspects of the identified challenges. The present study used the MCDM technique to evaluate and rank the challenges; future studies could use structural equation modeling to clarify the relationship between the challenges, as well as testing the framework with large datasets, as the present study used a limited number of experts to reach its conclusions. This study took industries of a particular region, and future studies could take industries from different areas. This initial effort to trace the progress of the SDG 2030 target thus opens up opportunities for future work.  Funding Ministry of Human Resources and Development (MHRD). IIT Roorkee, India .
