                  Blockchain technology, with its peer-to-peer trading feature, influences the management of energy consumption by offering the potential to transform transparency, efficiency, and sustainability within the energy sector. Nonetheless, there is a need to develop analytical decision-making models tailored for managing peer-to-peer energy transactions to improve energy resilience. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to address the research question: How can energy distribution systems be protected via blockchain technology to enhance energy resilience and mitigate vulnerabilities to disruptions? This paper employs a conceptual research model design and a mathematical decision-making model to address the research question by capturing the peer-to-peer trading capability of blockchain technology. The theory of planned behavior provides theoretical explanations for the proposed model. The sample includes longitudinal energy consumption data from 2015 to 2023 in Texas. The findings indicate a significant improvement in energy efficiency along with a considerable decrease in total electricity consumption. Post hoc analysis results reveal that the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average algorithm is effective as a reliable input for the proposed mathematical model. The significant implications are to implement blockchain-based smart grids in which energy systems become more resilient to disruptions, as the peer-to-peer capability enables users to trade energy. The proposed model suggests that energy will be used more efficiently and effectively. This paper contributes to prior works by introducing a mathematical model that captures the trading behavior of energy consumers. Moreover, this paper proposes the SARIMA algorithm to predict energy demand.

Handling editor: Kathleen Aviso Blockchain technology, with its peer-to-peer trading feature, influences the management of energy consumption by offering the potential to transform transparency, efficiency, and sustainability within the energy sector. Nonetheless, there is a need to develop analytical decision-making models tailored for managing peer-to-peer energy transactions to improve energy resilience. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to address the research question: How can energy distribution systems be protected via blockchain technology to enhance energy resilience and mitigate vulnerabilities to disruptions ? This paper employs a conceptual research model design and a mathematical decision-making model to address the research question by capturing the peer-to-peer trading capability of blockchain technology. The theory of planned behavior provides theoretical explanations for the proposed model. The sample includes longitudinal energy consumption data from 2015 to 2023 in Texas. The findings indicate a significant improvement in energy efficiency along with a considerable decrease in total electricity consumption. Post hoc analysis results reveal that the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average algorithm is effective as a reliable input for the proposed mathematical model. The significant implications are to implement blockchain-based smart grids in which energy systems become more resilient to disruptions, as the peer-to-peer capability enables users to trade energy. The proposed model suggests that energy will be used more efficiently and effectively. This paper contributes to prior works by introducing a mathematical model that captures the trading behavior of energy consumers. Moreover, this paper proposes the SARIMA algorithm to predict energy demand.

By offering a decentralized system, blockchain enhances transparency by providing real-time information on energy production and consumption, reducing fraud, and enabling precise billing mechanisms (Abed et al., 2023 ). Blockchain eliminates intermediaries and optimizes resource allocation (Yapa et al., 2021 ). Trading energy requires a decentralized and democratized approach to energy distribution, where consumers can buy and sell excess energy directly to one another, bypassing traditional utility companies (Hajian and Chang, 2022 ). Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading empowers individuals and communities, promoting energy independence and reducing reliance on centralized energy sources (Cárdenas-Álvarez et al., 2022 ). Moreover, trading energy contributes to renewable energy adoption, as consumers are incentivized to generate clean energy for their own use and share surplus energy with others (Tsao and Thanh, 2021 ), which improves energy resilience (Kotilainen, 2019 ). Energy resilience refers to ensuring the uninterrupted availability of energy services (Rosales-Asensio et al., 2023 ). Energy supply disruptions, whether due to extreme weather events or cyberattacks, can have severe consequences (Asgary et al., 2020 ). Energy resilience plays a critical role in mitigating the impact of climate change, facilitating the transition to sustainable energy sources, and protecting against technological vulnerabilities (Jasiūnas et al., 2021 ). Therefore, blockchain technology has received much attention in energy consumption management. The problem is the need for more energy resilience within energy distribution systems. This deficiency creates vulnerability to disruptions, such as extreme weather events or cyberattacks, resulting in power outages. For instance, during a severe Texas storm, energy grids failed, leaving entire communities without power for extended periods. There exists a body of research explaining how blockchain can contribute to enhancing resilience in energy supply chains (e.g., see Ante et al., 2021 ; Hajian and Chang, 2022 ). However, there is still a gap in research that can be filled by developing more analytical decision-making models specifically designed to manage P2P energy trading to enhance energy resilience. Therefore, the research question is: How can energy distribution systems be protected via blockchain technology to enhance energy resilience and mitigate vulnerabilities to disruptions ? This paper addresses the research question by presenting a mathematical decision-making model in which energy consumers can trade their energy. For the applicability and validity of the presented model, we employ energy data from Texas, USA, in numerical examples. 1.1 Contribution Blockchain technology holds significant potential to revolutionize supply chain energy systems. However, we need more research in mathematical decision-making tools that effectively incorporate blockchain technology into energy consumption management. This paper contributes to prior works by introducing a mathematical model that captures the trading behavior of energy consumers. The model maps out buying, selling, and consumption behaviors within the energy market. This study is among the first to delve into the P2P trading capabilities of blockchain technology in the context of energy consumption management. The model can simulate scenarios where residential consumers with solar panels sell excess energy back to the grid or their neighbors, highlighting the transformative potential of blockchain in decentralized energy markets (Sadeghi R. et al., 2022 ). Moreover, this paper evaluates five machine learning algorithms to predict energy demand, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of the model. Examples of these algorithms include the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) algorithm. This predictive analysis is pivotal in optimizing energy distribution and ensuring supply meets the dynamically changing demand. Last but not least, the paper provides a theoretical foundation for consumer behavior within the proposed decision-making model. This is underpinned by the theory of planned behavior, offering a psychological lens to understand why consumers may choose to buy, sell, or conserve energy in certain market conditions. The theory helps explain why a consumer might invest in energy-efficient appliances or sell surplus renewable energy based on attitudes, perceived control, and social norms. The remainder of the paper is as follows. In the next section, a review of related research is outlined. Section 3  proceeds to provide the theoretical framework supporting the model being proposed. Section 4  introduces the mathematical model, and the ensuing results are presented. Finally, Section 5  examines the findings and a post hoc analysis, including five machine learning algorithms. Finally, Section 6  presents a discussion and conclusion.   2 Literature review This section explores prior works on modeling energy resilience and blockchain-based energy trading optimization. 2.1 Modeling energy resilience Previous research has employed various perspectives to examine the concept of energy resilience. A predominant theme in this body of work revolves around deploying diverse strategies to manage electricity consumption in a manner that aligns with market dynamics, thereby fostering active subscriber engagement while preserving the competitive and economic nature of the market. Ghasemieh et al. (2015)  explored energy resilience in the context of housing and energy efficiency, focusing on using renewable energy sources. Meanwhile, Sircar et al. (2013)  delved into energy resilience through the lens of future studies, offering a comprehensive scenario analysis for the year 2050 in the United Kingdom, specifically emphasizing energy and transportation. Furthermore, Sharifi and Yamagata (2016)  thoroughly reviewed energy resilience in urban settings, predominantly drawing from urban studies literature. Li and Ahad (2023)  introduced an optimized methodology for managing demand response in smart grids, leveraging real-time pricing mechanisms. Their method involves establishing an acceptable consumption pattern and energy pricing structure through interactions between consumers and utility providers. Conejo et al. (2010)  outlined an optimization model designed to dynamically adjust the hourly load levels of individual consumers in response to varying electricity prices. The primary objective of this model is to maximize consumer utility while adhering to constraints such as minimum daily energy consumption thresholds, hourly load limits, and ramping constraints. Price uncertainty is effectively addressed through robust optimization techniques. Their model was presented through a linear programming algorithm, which can be seamlessly integrated into the energy management system of households or small businesses. Price elasticity and income elasticity serve as valuable quantitative metrics for assessing the influence of price fluctuations and income disparities on household electricity demand. Notably, residential electricity demand exhibits high price inelasticity (Zhu et al., 2018 ). Recent years have witnessed a surge in research in economics dedicated to residential electricity demand, providing substantial empirical insights for the analysis of electricity demand (Ajitha and Radhika, 2023 ).  2.2 Blockchain-based energy trading optimization Blockchain technology protects information systems by implementing a decentralized design compared to traditional database management systems (Hajian et al., 2023 ). P2P energy trading allows direct energy transactions by incorporating blockchain for transaction security and leveraging smart grids to enhance distribution efficiency (Dorahaki et al., 2021 ). This innovative approach promotes sustainability, energy independence, and a decentralized energy market. Furthermore, an integrated home energy system with built-in storage enhances energy utilization efficiency and contributes to maintaining the stability of the power grid—an essential component for ensuring a sustainable energy future. Moreover, Ghasemnejad et al. (2024)  present a system integrating technology and processes to organize small energy consumers effectively. Dorahaki et al. (2023a,b)  introduced a mathematical model to reduce the overall cost of multi-carrier energy systems. Their model demonstrated a significant decrease in energy costs, highlighting the potential for further exploration of machine-learning approaches as a future research agenda. Blockchain-based energy trading can be broadly categorized into three primary domains: transaction, consensus, and optimization. Within this classification, Wang et al. (2019)  have further categorized optimization into distinct subcategories, including structure optimization, operational cost minimization, optimal social welfare, data protection in storage, and maximization of other benefits. Optimization encompasses a holistic approach to system enhancement, addressing aspects such as structural optimization, cost minimization, data security, and individual benefits maximization, among others. Our study in the second category, “minimizing operational costs.” In this context, Li and Ahad (2023)  employed the geometric mean optimizer (GMO) to optimize demand response programs (DRPs) for consumers equipped with smart programmable meters in a smart grid. Smart grids are electricity networks that use digital technologies, sensors, and software to better match the supply and demand of electricity from various sources, as shown in Fig. 1  . Luo and Liu (2021)  have devised a trading scheme to scrutinize hierarchical integrated energy systems (HIESs) operation. These systems feature a hierarchical structure involving an electricity utility company and a natural gas utility company at the upper level, multiple distributed energy stations (DESs) at the intermediate level, and multiple users at the lower level. Hou et al. (2020)  conducted a comprehensive analysis of the competitiveness of China's distributed energy resources. Subsequently, they examined the collaborative development model of “blockchain technology and distributed energy resources” using a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Aldarajee et al. (2020)  proposed a tri-level framework designed to bolster the resilience of integrated electric power and natural gas networks when confronted with extreme events. Their proposed resilience can be adjusted by modifying the allocation of resources within the framework. In order to enhance effective communication among all stakeholders within the energy ecosystem, there is a growing imperative for a more adaptable and resilient energy distribution network and trading system. Emerging technologies, such as blockchain, have emerged as pivotal solutions that lower the barriers to entry for local retailers in the electricity market. Traditional grid infrastructure demands substantial capital investment and imposes extensive operating and maintenance costs, effectively creating formidable barriers for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate. Blockchain technologies facilitate the coexistence of multiple small-scale power suppliers through a decentralized system, bypassing the need for a single third-party intermediary. Blockchain technology reduces daily operational costs. Furthermore, end-users gain an active role in shaping energy pricing and facilitating settlements in microgrid environments, thereby infusing greater dynamism into these markets (Mengelkamp et al., 2018 ). In prior works, Jiang et al. (2020)  proposed a pricing model based on game theory, considering both seller-buyer interactions and seller competition. Moreover, Umar et al. (2022)  present a P2P energy trading model for microgrids, utilizing blockchain for efficient energy management and cost reduction by integrating renewable energy sources. In addition, Dorahaki et al. (2023a,b)  propose a two-level risk-based optimization approach for energy management. This paper contributes to past works (e.g., Jiang et al., 2020 ; Umar et al., 2022 ) by proposing machine learning algorithms to predict consumption patterns effectively. Xia et al. (2023)  used weekly time series data to consider the relations among blockchain market trends. Furthermore, Antal et al. (2021)  develop a conceptual framework for a decentralized marketplace in energy flexibility without an optimization model for optimization. This paper proposes a mathematical model demonstrating efficient consumer energy trade. We delineate the consumption pattern and use machine learning algorithms to predict energy usage in the mathematical decision-making model. The use of blockchain in the energy sector makes trading and record-keeping safer and more precise (Andoni et al., 2019 ). Previous works explored the importance of blockchain in the energy sector (e.g., see Hajian and Chang, 2022 ; Xu and Wang, 2023 ; Yang et al., 2021 ). Most previous studies have used mathematical optimization models to identify the best solutions that reduce overall consumption costs, e.g., Choobineh et al. (2023) , Chen et al. (2021) , Xu and Wang (2023) , Jiang et al. (2020) , and Hua et al. (2020) . Understanding consumption patterns is vital for shaping effective strategies, as it uncovers consumer behaviors, predicts trends, and guides product and service adaptations to meet market demands. A few studies consider consumption patterns in their research, e.g., Hua et al. (2020) , Tsao et al. (2021) , and Antal et al. (2021) . Hajian and Chang (2022)  presented a theoretical framework for the impact of blockchain-enabled smart contracts on enhancing energy system resilience, which was limited to a mathematical decision-making modeling. Choobineh et al. (2023)  propose a framework for designing a transactive energy market facilitated by blockchain technology, which requires a machine-learning approach to address forecasting. Moreover, Tsao et al. (2021)  address sustainable microgrid design by utilizing blockchain technology for real-time demand response programs, focusing on three key sustainability goals: economic, environmental, and social. Qin et al. (2023)  investigated how blockchain markets and green finance contribute to achieving carbon neutrality in China. Acknowledging the lack of machine learning in previous studies for consumption pattern predictions, our research employs five machine learning algorithms for improving predictive accuracy. Xu and Wang (2023)  introduced a blockchain-based P2P electricity trading platform with a focus on operational efficiency, yet it lacks integration of real-time data and consumption pattern analysis in a decision-making model. Blockchain technology is crucial in enhancing the security and transparency of smart grid systems, enabling trusted and efficient energy transactions (Kumari et al., 2022 ). Kumari et al. (2020)  developed an ARIMA-based model to identify and classify malicious customer activities, followed by a smart contract-based incentive for utilities to counteract these activities, securing the smart grid. Moreover, Tanwar et al. (2020)  investigated the application of a range of machine learning strategies, from support vector machines to clustering and deep learning, to enhance the defense mechanisms of blockchain-based smart applications. In P2P electricity trading, machine learning is critical in forecasting demand and supply, pricing, and ensuring the grid's stability. Machine learning enables smart grids to adapt to real-time changes (Shukla et al., 2024 ). However, this paper presents a mathematical decision-making model to capture selling and purchasing behaviors based on energy consumption in Texas. Moreover, the SARIMA algorithm is presented to predict energy consumption. Table 1   compares the contributions of this paper with prior works.   3 Theoretical background and propositions The theory of planned behavior (TPB) explains how behavior is planned and correlates intention with behavior. A theoretical view of planned behavior is an extension of a theory of reasoned action that assumes intentions are the immediate antecedents of behavior (Ajzen, 1985 ). Rather than focusing on performance, intention refers to the intent to perform a particular behavior (Malik et al., 2024 ). The TPB proposes three predictors for intention: attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1985 ). An individual's attitude toward a behavior is how they evaluate or appraise it, either positively or negatively (Ajzen, 1991 ; Bosnjak et al., 2020 ). Herein, consumers, prosumers, and producers may develop positive attitudes toward joining in direct energy trading due to the perceived benefits such as cost savings, control over energy choices, and sustainability goals (Shahsavar et al., 2021 ; Tiwari et al., 2020 ). Sustainability development calls for efficient usage of energy and well-distributed energy (Sadeghi and Haapala, 2019 ). The second predictor, subjective norm, refers to the beliefs about the expectations and behaviors of others (Ajzen et al., 2011 ). In this paper, the social influence on participants is essential, specifically when sustainability issues matter. Individuals are more likely to adopt this behavior if there is a perceived social expectation or approval for engaging in P2P energy trading. Perceived behavioral control, the last predictor, is the ability to perform the behavior efficiently or ineffectively based on experience and anticipated obstacles (Ajzen, 1991 ). There are various sources and opportunities to increase individual perception of control over their behavior (Madden et al., 1992 ). In this research, the ease of using and understanding blockchain technology and a sense of control over energy choices, pricing adjustments, and the overall trading process can influence participant perception of behavioral control. Moreover, perceived behavior can moderate the relationships between attitude and subjective norms to intention (Ajzen, 2020 ). Herein, a blockchain-based system in a smart grid is a source of behavioral control (e.g., energy consumption) for participants, which influences attitudes and subjective norms in the P2P energy market. 3.1 Peer-to-peer trading and efficient energy consumption A blockchain's P2P attribute refers to the concept that multiple participants can contribute and trade without needing third parties (Rejeb et al., 2021 ). By extending the peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain's capabilities to facilitate energy trading in smart grids, consumers can directly engage in energy trade (Esmat et al., 2021 ). P2P trading is a form of the shared economy (Park and Yong, 2017 ). P2P trading can improve energy efficiency in blockchain-based smart grids through decentralized, transparent, and traceable data sharing in the network. Energy efficiency is defined as reducing energy inputs and having the same output, such as using more energy-efficient motors and earning the same output (Labanca and Bertoldi, 2018 ). Decentralization in energy trading refers to the gradual shift from historically centralized power generation into smaller generators closer to the end-user (Hasankhani et al., 2021 ). Decentralized blockchain-based energy trading allows small-scale consumers and producers to participate in the wholesale energy market, eliminating the middleman and reducing transaction costs (Andoni et al., 2019 ). The participation of various contributors in the energy supply chain is subject to market competition (Diaz-Valdivia and Poblet, 2020 ) and enhances the power autonomy among users. For example, decentralization helps to have dynamic pricing models based on real-time supply and demand. Users can adjust their energy consumption patterns based on pricing signals, promoting more efficient energy use during peak and off-peak periods (Dong et al., 2022 ). However, in traditional energy services, energy inputs are autonomous without considering the conditions of users, decreasing efficient energy consumption. Thus, the decentralization of energy systems has prompted researchers to examine P2P energy trading (Esmat et al., 2021 ) and its effects on energy efficiency. The blockchain-based energy market facilitates transparent participant trading (Wongthongtham et al., 2021 ). Through transparent transactions, participants can observe and hold each other accountable, discouraging user misconduct (Tyma et al., 2022 ). Note that accountability refers to the responsibilities an entity is expected to maintain (Messner, 2009 ). Transparent data from energy trading networks improves control of participant responsibilities for energy consumption. Data availability can enhance energy consumption efficiency by aligning it with the pricing strategies of all involved parties. Likewise, transparency contributes to market competition, encouraging consumers to consume energy efficiently. Smart grids equipped with blockchain enable the traceability of energy (Agung and Handayani, 2022 ). Traceability empowers participants to access accurate information about energy production and consumption points. A green certificate is a tradable commodity that proves that electricity has been generated from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind (Imbault et al., 2017 ; Sadeghi R. & Karki, 2022 ). As the European Union outlines, renewable energy must cover 32% of consumers final energy consumption by 2030 (Capros et al., 2018 ). Traceability allows end users to decide to use renewable energies efficiently and get the green certificate (Thomas et al., 2022 ). Drawing on TPB, decentralization, transparency, and traceability are attributes of the blockchain-based P2P energy market that can improve participant intention to improve energy efficiency. For example, transparent and traceable energy exchange contributes to subjective norms as a factor of intention regarding controlling energy consumption and sustainable energy resources. Last but not least, past studies support the considerable impact of P2P blockchain-based smart grids on energy efficiency (Tsao et al., 2021 ; Tushar et al., 2020 ). Thus.Proposition 1 Peer-to-peer trading capability positively correlates with efficient energy consumption in blockchain-based smart grids .    3.2 Peer-to-peer trading and energy conservation Energy conservation refers to the decision and practice of using less energy (Abrahamse et al., 2005 ). P2P energy trading can contribute to energy conservation through localized energy transmission and smart contracts. Localized P2P trading reduces transmission losses associated with transporting over large distances. For example, the traditional unlocalized electricity market allows consumers to choose any market for their energy, and utilities must pay for transmission losses. However, in local P2P energy trading, energy is purchased from peers, with transmission losses carried by trading pairs (Jiang et al., 2023 ). Therefore, localizing the P2P energy market contributes to energy conservation by minimizing energy loss during transportation. The P2P energy market combined with smart contracts can automate the buying and selling of energy based on real-time supply and demand. A smart contract supports P2P energy trading, i.e., it does not implement the trading process in itself but is a call to action (Kirli et al., 2022 ). Smart contracts are immutable computer codes stored in distributed databases representing an agreement between two parties (Hajian and Chang, 2022 ). The P2P trading smart contract can be employed to assess the real-time monitoring of consumption and production from smart metering infrastructure originating from the smart contracts setup (Mustafa et al., 2019 ). Smart contracts in energy management systems facilitate the coordination of adaptable energy loads and scheduling activities in home electrification. Home electrification refers to switching from fossil fuels to electricity to meet a home's power needs, e.g., heating, cooling, and cooking (Kamalapur & Udaykumar, 2011 ). From the energy producers perspective, smart contracts modify the output of a battery or generator in response to deviations in grid frequency from the usual range. As a result, a smart contract can distribute rewards and penalties automatically according to contract conditions to encourage energy conservation (Kirli et al., 2022 ). P2P energy trading contributes to the united nations sustainable development goal 7 (SDG7) to ensure “affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030. Past studies showed that analytical approaches can contribute to sustainable and resilient goals (Mousavi et al., 2023 ). For instance, P2P solar energy trading among residential energy consumers can potentially enable solar energy uptake, shown in Fig. 2  , regarding energy accessibility, reliability, and sustainability (Adewole et al., 2023 ). The P2P market allows prosumers to provide energy and sell or donate the excess energy generated from renewable sources (Karami and Madlener, 2022 ). The possibility of selling excess energy encourages prosumers to consume less and improve energy conservation efforts. Prior studies examine the P2P trading effects on energy conservation (Fernandez et al., 2023 ). Therefore.Proposition 2 Peer-to-peer trading capability positively correlates with energy conservation .     4 Methodology This section includes the proposed mathematical decision-making model, which captures P2P capabilities among energy consumers. The applicability of the model is demonstrated using Texas data in USA. Moreover, the proposed model is compared with the classical model. 4.1 Data Our model's applicability was demonstrated using data from grid systems across the U.S. This data covers the electricity usage in Texas from June 2015 until November 2023. This information was obtained from the energy information administration (EIA), a federal agency in the United States (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023 ). Table 2   includes parameters used in the model in which the consumer's minimum consumption, denoted as C i , h , d , m  min    , is based on the lowest consumption recorded over the past eight years. The maximum consumption C i , h , d , m  max    , is set at 1.1 times the highest consumption observed in the same period. For the energy price, denoted as P h , d , m  P G C     , we have fixed it at $0.1. The prices for buying, P i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y     , and selling, P i , i ′  , h , d , m  s e l l      energy is established at $0.11 and $0.13, respectively. Moreover, the model incorporates a region-specific consumption coefficient, μ i , h , d , m     , which are set at 2 to reflect regional consumption patterns accurately. We also included Texas's power generation capacity, represented as G h , d , m     , which is 100 M.  4.2 The propsoed mathematical model for blockchain-based energy systems Notations used in the proposed model are as follows.  Indices  d    Index for consumption day d ∈ D   ,  h    Index for consumption hour h ∈ H   ,  i    Index for customer i   ,  where i ∈ I   ,  m    Index for consumption month m ∈ M   ,  Parameters  C i , h , d , m  min     Minimal consumption of consumer i    at hour h   ,  day d   , month m   ,  C i , h , d , m  max     Maximum consumption of energy consumer i    at hour h   ,  day d   , month m   ,  G h , d , m      Power generation capacity at hour h   ,  day d   , and month m   ,  P i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y      Buying price of energy of consumer i    from consumer i ′     at hour h   , day d   , and month m   , where i ≠ i ′    ,  P h , d , m  P G C      Energy price from the power generation company at hour h   ,  day d   , and month m   ,  P i , i ′  , h , d , m  s e l l      Selling price of energy of consumer i    to consumer i ′     at hour h   , day d   , and month m   , where i ≠ i ′    ,  μ i , h , d , m      Coefficient of region consumption capacity for consumer i    at hour h   , day d   , and month m   ,  Decision Variables  X i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y      Energy purchased by consumer i    from consumer i ′     at hour h   , day d   , and month m   , where i ≠ i ′    ,  X i , i ′  , h , d , m  s e l l      Energy sold by consumer i    to consumer i ′     at hour h   , day d   , and month m   , where i ≠ i ′    ,  X i , h , d , m  c o n s u m e      Energy consumed by consumer i    at hour h   , day d   , and month m   .  Y i , i ′       Equals 1, if supplier i    sells to supplier i ′     (X i , i ′  , h , d , m  s e l l   ≥ 0   ) and 0 otherwise,  Z i , i  ′      Equals 1, if supplier i ′     buys from supplier i    (X i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y   ≥ 0   ) and 0 otherwise,       The proposed model captures energy consumption systems with characteristics explained as follows. All users have blockchain-based metering devices, enabling secure and transparent energy usage and transaction recording. The power generation infrastructure caters to a diverse consumer base, reflecting a broad spectrum of energy demands and usage patterns. The power generation entity possesses a defined capacity for energy production, which is a critical factor in meeting the varying demand scales of consumers. The model considers a multitude of energy consumers, each characterized by a minimum and maximum consumption threshold. These thresholds define the lower and upper bounds of energy usage for individual consumers. Consumers are endowed with the flexibility to engage in P2P energy trading. This includes each consumer's capability to purchase energy from and sell energy to other consumers or the power generation company. Consumers can sell an amount of energy exceeding their maximum consumption limit to other consumers, facilitating an efficient distribution of surplus energy. The energy pricing model is dynamic and varies according to different periods, including hourly, daily, and monthly rates. This temporal pricing variation is designed to reflect energy demand and supply fluctuations. The model categorizes 'periods' into distinct segments – hours, days, and months – to accommodate and analyze temporal energy consumption and trading variations. All energy consumers purchase is assumed to be utilized entirely, with no residual or wasted energy. The power generation entity operates within a specified production capacity, a pivotal parameter in the model's energy supply and demand dynamics assessment. These assumptions provide a comprehensive foundation for the proposed model, ensuring a nuanced understanding of the dynamics in blockchain-based energy systems, especially concerning consumer behavior, energy trading, and pricing mechanisms. Moreover, constraints capture the research model. The energy consumption system explained above is as follows. Minimize the total cost of energy consumption and trading:(1) Min : ∑ i ∈ I   ∑ h ∈ H   ∑ d ∈ D   ∑ m ∈ M   ( X i , h , d , m  c o n s u m e    P h , d , m  P G C    )      + ∑ i ∈ I   ∑ i ′  ∈ I   ∑ h ∈ H   ∑ d ∈ D   ∑ m ∈ M   ( X i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y   P i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y   − X i , i ′  , h , d , m  s e l l   P i , i ′  , h , d , m  s e l l    )            Subject to.

(6) , M    is a sufficiently large number. These constraints ensure that if there's no trading relationship between two suppliers (i.e., Y i , i ′    = 0    or Z i , i  ′   = 0   ), then the quantity traded must be zero. If there is a trading relationship, then the quantity traded can be any value up to M   . While overall consumption per user: X i , h , d , m  c o n s u m e   + ∑ i ′  ∈ I   X i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y     , the amount of sold energy to customer i    by customer i ′     is equal to the amount of energy bought by customer i    from customer i ′    , which is(8) X i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y   = X i ′  , i , h , d , m  s e l l    ∀ i , i ′  ∈ I , h ∈ H , d ∈ D , m ∈ M     (9) Y i , i ′    = Z i , i ′     ∀ i , i ′  ∈ I      A user can either be a seller or a buyer, but not both simultaneously.(10) Y i , i ′    + Z i ′  , i   ≤ 1  ∀ i , i ′  ∈ I      Ensure that the total power generation does not exceed the capacity:(11) ∑ i ∈ I   ∑ h ∈ H   ∑ d ∈ D   ∑ m ∈ M   ( X i , h , d , m  c o n s u m e   + ∑ i ′  ∈ I   X i , i ′  , h , d , m  b u y    )  ≤ G h , d , m     ∀ h ∈ H , d ∈ D , m ∈ M     (12) Y i , i ′    , Z i ′  , i   , X i , h , d , m  b u y   , X  i , h , d , m  c o n s u m e   , X  i , h , d , m   s e l l   ≥ 0 , ∀ i , i ′  ∈ I , h ∈ H , d ∈ D , m ∈ M        5 Results To show the efficiency of our model where blockchain is considered, we compare the presented model with the classical model (without P2P capability) in the energy sector. We used the PyOpt library, a Python-based optimization modeling language, to solve and optimize the mathematical model. Table 3   demonstrates the results, including the actual demand. Fig. 3   shows that the proposed model has a lower energy cost compared with the traditional model in 11 numerical examples. We have used the electricity demand for Texas state for the past eight years. The findings show significant improvement in consumption with the implementation of the suggested model (t-value = 2.38, p-value = 0.01, df  = 20). The proposed model shows a significant decrease in total electricity consumption, which supports both propositions. Fig. 4   presents a detailed representation of P2P transactions within the electricity sector, illustrating the intricate network of buy and sell interactions among six customers. In the energy sector, buying and selling electricity is fundamental to its operational integrity and economic viability. These transactions ensure market efficiency by effectively allocating energy where it is needed most. 5.1 Post hoc analysis Machine learning algorithms demonstrate a robust capacity to process complex, nonlinear data connections, adaptively respond to different scenarios, and provide accurate predictive outcomes (Goodfellow et al., 2016 ). Electricity consumption is influenced by a variety of factors, including climatic changes, economic trends, consumer usage patterns, and advancements in electrical technologies. Together, these elements shape the demand and consumption of electrical energy in residential and industrial sectors (Zahedi et al., 2022 ). The increase in smart grids and internet of things (IoT) devices has led to a considerable increase in the volume of real-time data generated. Predicting energy demand is an influential factor in energy management. Machine learning has shown high effectiveness in energy demand forecasting. Machine learning algorithms, e.g., the SARIMA algorithm, demonstrate forecasting abilities in time series data (Chaturvedi et al., 2022 ). Machine learning algorithms demonstrate flexibility to shift energy consumption trends in a time where trends are continually shifting due to unpredicted changes in the usage of renewable energy, electric vehicles, and various devices. Accurate energy consumption prediction is vital for the optimal management of distribution and storage processes, leading to significant reductions in waste and overall costs in the energy sector. As the energy sector moves towards more renewable sources, precise demand forecasting becomes critical in achieving a balanced and efficient power grid, particularly in the electricity industry (Rangel-Martinez et al., 2021 ). This paper proposes the SARIMA algorithm in machine learning to forecast energy demand as an input to the proposed mathematical decision-making model. The SARIMA algorithm is compared with four other algorithms: regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), neural network, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). In the following section, we compare these algorithms to identify the most suitable method for demand forecasting, a process crucial in the decision-making aspects of energy management. 5.1.1 Regression The success of regression analysis depends on the model's precise configuration and assumptions. However, regression often needs to improve in addressing nonlinear relationships, a crucial limitation in complex systems. Furthermore, regression analysis requires large datasets for reliable predictions and is particularly sensitive to outliers, which can notably distort outcomes.  5.1.2 K-nearest neighbor algorithm The KNN algorithm, known for its non-parametric nature, has demonstrated significant capabilities in processing time-series data (Martínez et al., 2019 ). Its key strength lies in eliminating a separate training phase, using the entire dataset for ‘training’ during the prediction phase, leading to rapid model development (Bishop, 2006 ). However, the normalization of features is a prerequisite in KNN. The optimal K value, five herein, is critical for the algorithm's effectiveness, but its performance can be limited in high-dimensional data scenarios. The proficiency of KNN in time-series forecasting is enhanced during seasonal periods, as it can quickly adapt to seasonal variations, which is an essential factor in industries like retail or energy, where understanding seasonal trends and usage is vital.  5.1.3 Neural networks algorithm Neural networks represent a class of learning algorithms inspired by the human brain's structure and functionality. In the neural network's design, each layer was sequentially composed of 10, 8, and 1 neurons. This algorithm can be employed for various tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering. The neural networks can handle numerous inputs simultaneously, operating their parallel processing strengths. Neural networks manage intricate, nonlinear data tasks and provide effective learning and prediction, rendering them ideal for predictive analytics (Gambella et al., 2021 ). Despite their capabilities, neural networks face limitations, such as the need for extensive training data and computational resources.  5.1.4 ARIMA algorithm ARIMA algorithm is a machine learning algorithm for forecasting time series data such as electricity consumption, primarily due to its capacity to recognize trends and seasonal patterns in data (Sadeghi et al., 2023 ). This characteristic makes it suitable for short-term forecasting where these factors are predominant. The algorithm also allows for systematically identifying and estimating parameters using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (Luzia et al., 2023 ). The ARIMA algorithm is suitable for linear relationships and less effective for data with complex, nonlinear patterns. It assumes a consistent variance (homoscedasticity) over time, which may not always be present in time series data (González Grandón et al., 2024 ). Transforming data to meet the ARIMA algorithm's stationarity requirement can be complex for some datasets. Furthermore, the ARIMA algorithm struggles with missing data points and depends on extensive historical data for reliable forecasting. Our chosen configuration for the ARIMA algorithm, with parameters p = 1, d = 1, q = 1, was determined after examining autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.  5.1.5 SARIMA algorithm The last algorithm, the SARIMA algorithm, is an extension of the ARIMA algorithm. The SARIMA and ARIMA algorithms are particularly advantageous for analyzing datasets with our characteristics, marked by seasonal fluctuations, trends, and cycles in the energy sector (Chaturvedi et al., 2022 ). The augmented dickey-fuller (ADF) statistic is −8.066, indicating that the series is stationary. The configuration was p = 1, d = 1, q = 1 for the non-seasonal part and P = 1, D = 1, Q = 1, s = 24 for the seasonal component. This setup means that the algorithm included one autoregressive term, one differencing term, and one moving average term, both for the regular and seasonal parts, with a seasonal period of 24 h.  5.1.6 Comparison results In our research, we operated the algorithms through Python using Texas data, which is available on www.GitHub.com/Russellpr/JCLP2024 . In our research, we entered data on electricity consumption times and subsequently measured the electricity demand. Table 4   shows these results side by side. Table 4  highlights that the SARIMA algorithm is better at accurately predicting energy usage. It has a higher R-squared score, meaning it explains energy usage changes well. SARIMA algorithm also has the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), indicating it is precise with minimal errors.    6 Discussion and conclusion This paper addresses the research question regarding protecting energy distribution systems to decrease the probability of disruption and increase energy resilience. This paper focuses on the solutions for energy resilience in a blockchain-based P2P energy trading market. In the energy sector, blockchain is a promising technology that could be used for various services and applications (Hajian and Chang, 2022 ). In a blockchain-based P2P network, different nodes (e.g., consumer, producer, prosumer) can participate in trading freely without the authorization of third parties. Transparent energy trading in blockchain-based smart grids makes nodes aware of each other's activities and situations, specifically for energy consumption and price. The traceability attribute of blockchain in smart grids helps participants be informed of the source of energy production, encouraging the promotion of renewable energy resources (Agung and Handayani, 2022 ). Thus, blockchain-based P2P trading networks improve efficient energy consumption through decentralized dynamic pricing, transparency in consumption, and use of renewable energies – Proposition 1. In addition, smart contracts in blockchain-based P2P energy supply can automatically execute agreements between parties. Smart contracts, according to contract conditions, can monitor energy production and consumption (Mustafa et al., 2019 ). Likewise, in a P2P energy network, prosumers can produce electricity from renewable energy (e.g., solar panels) and then consume and sell excessive energy. Thus, the P2P energy market contributes to energy conservation by selling produced energy and controlling energy consumption – Proposition 2. This, the integration of blockchain into the P2P energy trading market, improves energy resilience through efficient energy consumption and energy conservation. The proposed mathematical decision-making model captures P2P trading capabilities by which energy consumers can efficiently use the energy. In other words, this paper introduces blockchain technology to develop a novel mathematical framework for analyzing energy market behaviors, specifically focusing on P2P transactions in a blockchain-based energy system. This paper highlights the critical role of blockchain integration in effectively managing energy consumption and uses machine learning algorithms, including the SARIMA algorithm, to achieve precise energy demand forecasts, which is the primary input of the decision-making models. This paper applies the theory of planned behavior to provide theoretical support for analyzing consumer choices regarding energy conservation and trading. The results show a notable enhancement in energy efficiency accompanied by a substantial reduction in overall electricity usage. Post hoc analysis demonstrates that the SARIMA algorithm is a reliable input for the suggested mathematical model. 6.1 Managerial and theoretical implications Industrial organizations are diligently working towards finding solutions to reduce energy costs. 50% of the industries surveyed can adopt energy management systems to reduce costs (Porter et al., 2021 ). The proposed model's ability to balance the grid load helps to reduce the risk of blackouts in industries and avoid the wasteful use of energy. The proposed model contributes to a decrease in overall energy costs, leading to a shift towards a more sustainable and economical way of using electricity in industry. Due to the increasing concerns over cyber and physical attacks on the power grid, along with the need to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, resilience is becoming increasingly important (Das et al., 2020 ). Resilient smart grid solutions are growing significantly. For example, in November 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy allocated $3.9 billion to modernize the electric grid, ensuring reliable power amidst intensifying climate impacts (Grid Deployment Office, 2023 ). The focus extends to developing integrated solutions connecting grid communication systems and operations to enhance resilience, diminish power outages, and mitigate threats. This paper calls for action on the issue of resilience in energy smart grids using blockchain technology. Blockchain in the P2P energy market provides a reliable network for the exchange of energy among various parties. The reliability of the P2P energy network is rooted in blockchain's attributes, e.g., elimination of the need for third parties, smart contracts capability, and transparency. Prior research examined the positive effects of blockchain in smart grids (e.g., Guo et al., 2022 ; Musleh et al., 2019 ). However, our research contributes to employing a blockchain-based energy market with the goal of energy resilience. This paper examines energy's reliability in a network in two mathematical and theoretical concepts. P2P trading in the blockchain's energy market improves energy efficiency and conservation. Modeling energy resilience enhances the accuracy of decision-making for parties regarding energy consumption and selling excess energy. Thus, our recommended approach for managing the smart grid is prioritizing blockchain-based P2P trading for resilient energy trading. Renewable and green energy technologies are transforming the global energy landscape, offering sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels by capturing the power of the sun, wind, water, and bioenergy (Gawusu et al., 2022 ). These technologies mitigate environmental pollution and promise a more resilient and decentralized energy system (Yunzhao, 2022 ). Powerledger, an Australian company, develops software that allows clients to trade energy locally, connecting consumers and producers directly. Entrance, from the Netherlands, introduces a pioneering platform for P2P electricity trading, facilitating direct exchanges between energy producers and consumers to boost market efficiency and sustainability. Another suggestion is the theoretical implication of this study. In line with the TPB, this paper suggested that the engagement of participants (e.g., prosumer, consumer, producer) in energy conservation and energy efficiency relied on their intentions. Precedents of intention are attitudes, normative beliefs, and control beliefs. In this study, we proposed that participants intention to conserve more energy and consume energy efficiently depends on their attitudes toward energy-sharing benefits, normative beliefs about sharing economies and sustainability goals, and the use of blockchain for P2P trading as a valuable resource. It follows that all antecedents of intention are prepared for behavior.  6.2 Limitation and future research This paper investigates a P2P trading model to enhance resilience in blockchain-based smart grids. This research follows the ways to resilient energy trading in smart grids considering sustainability issues. The two introduced propositions of this research align with the SDG7. However, further investigation can examine the concepts of carbon tax and quota and their effects on energy conservation and efficient energy consumption. A carbon tax is levied on the production, distribution, or use of carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil, and gas and other activities that generate greenhouse gas emissions (Hua et al., 2022 ). A carbon quota sets a limit or cap on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that a particular industry, sector, or country can release over a specified period (Shi et al., 2023 ). However, more research is needed specifically when energy resilience in smart grids is a subject. This paper draws on the theory of planned behavior as a theoretical support for the two propositions. However, future studies can focus on other theories to explain consumer and producer behaviors, such as rational behavior and behavioral economics theory. Moreover, this paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting blockchain as an information system to support P2P energy trading in smart grids. Further studies can examine the combination of blockchain with other technological tools, e.g., IoT, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI).
