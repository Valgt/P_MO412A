                  Background
                  Food waste management (FWM) has gained much attention over the past few years in industries, research institutions, and national and international organizations due to its significant potential to produce valuable products and control environmental pollution. Finding the sustainable approaches to utilize these waste materials is a current focus of many researchers.
               
                  Scope and approach
                  This review aims to explore the potential of cereal-based husks from 5 major cereal grains (wheat, rice, corn, barley, and millet) to achieve goals 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and 12 (responsible consumption and production) of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) set out by the united nations to make the world more healthy and developed with minimum environmental pollution.
               
                  Key findings and conclusion
                  Cereal-based husks can be utilized to make adsorbents to remove heavy metals, dyes, antibiotics, pesticides, and petrol contaminants from wastewater. These husks can be utilized to produce clean and affordable energy alternatives such as biogas (methane), organic bio-oil, biodiesel, and bioethanol. Moreover, the biopolymeric matrices of these husks can be efficiently used to make bioplastics, biocomposite films, biodegradable foams, and packaging paper for food and other industries.

Table 1        Cereal-based husks Techniques/methods used Preparation of biosorbent/adsorbent Pollutants removed Cleaning remarks Overall findings References   WH  Adsorption of RB 19 and RB 195 dyes by using WH adsorbent The WHs were cleaned, dried, and ground into powder form. To extract the pigments, powdered material was soaked in HNO3 , then washed, dried, and weighed again before being stored in a desiccator until needed. The adsorbent was produced from pretreated WHs. RB 19 and RB 195 dyes WH is one of the substances that can be utilized in the elimination of RB 19 and RB 195 from wastewater because it is readily available and suitable for the production of adsorbent from it. Initial RB 19 and RB 195 concentrations, contact time, temperature, and pH all affect the adsorption of RB 19 and RR 195 by WH adsorbents.

Background Food waste management (FWM) has gained much attention over the past few years in industries, research institutions, and national and international organizations due to its significant potential to produce valuable products and control environmental pollution. Finding the sustainable approaches to utilize these waste materials is a current focus of many researchers.  Scope and approach This review aims to explore the potential of cereal-based husks from 5 major cereal grains (wheat, rice, corn, barley, and millet) to achieve goals 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and 12 (responsible consumption and production) of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) set out by the united nations to make the world more healthy and developed with minimum environmental pollution.  Key findings and conclusion Cereal-based husks can be utilized to make adsorbents to remove heavy metals, dyes, antibiotics, pesticides, and petrol contaminants from wastewater. These husks can be utilized to produce clean and affordable energy alternatives such as biogas (methane), organic bio-oil, biodiesel, and bioethanol. Moreover, the biopolymeric matrices of these husks can be efficiently used to make bioplastics, biocomposite films, biodegradable foams, and packaging paper for food and other industries.

A significant amount of food waste is discarded from food industries along their production, processing, and supply chain (Caldeira et al., 2019 ) which contributes significantly to environmental pollution, economic inequality, and climate change (FAO, 2019 ). Massive research efforts have been directed in recent years to find out the sustainable approaches to utilize food waste products to recover energy in the form of biofuels, bioconversion of food waste into marketable products, and reduce environmental pollution using food waste ingredients (Bilal et al., 2018 ). The presence of heavy metals in water is a critical issue as it can cause severe toxicity in living organisms leading to serious illnesses. Due to the presence of toxic heavy metals in the water streams, water resources are under stress all over the world. The food chain is also badly affected due to the occurrence of heavy metals in water (Khalil et al., 2020 ). Dyes and colors eliminated from textile industries in the form of textile wastewater get mixed with our aquatic freshwater and affects aquatic life. These dyes also pass through the entire food chain as seafood is a good source of nutrition (Kheddo et al., 2020 ). Antibiotics are a threat to our ecosystem because of their relatively stable structure, complex biological activity, and resistance to biodegradation. Contamination of water with antibiotics transforms antibiotic resistance genes and produces composite pollutants by the combination of antibiotics with other pollutants present in wastewater that are very hazardous to the health of living organisms (Yang et al., 2020 ). Similarly, organophosphorus pesticides penetrates deep into the soil and pollute the groundwater due to their high water solubility (Raju et al., 2019 ). Exposure to these pesticides for a long time in high doses can cause chromosomal aberrations, carcinogenic effects, and hypoimmunity (Sinha & Banda, 2018 ). Food waste is also a source of renewable energy with a significant potential to produce biofuels for heat, transportation, and electricity. Biofuels produced from food waste materials like biogas, biodiesel, and bioethanol lead to a reduction in harmful nitrogen and sulfur oxides and are thus beneficial to the climate. The production of environmentally friendly and cleaner fuels as an alternative to the available fossil fuels is a much-needed solution to meet the high energy demand sustainably (Popp et al., 2021 ). Plastic materials have vast use for packaging because of their resistance to mechanical and environmental factors, flexibility, excellent printability, and low cost. But these plastic materials have detrimental effects on the environment as they degrade over the decades and release harmful chemicals which can deteriorate the quality of food. Hence, it is safer to use biodegradable materials for packaging purposes as compared to plastics while considering environmental and health concerns (Horodytska et al., 2018 ). Previous investigations have revealed numerous possibilities for utilization of food waste products such as the formulation of fertilizers, composts (Ahmad et al., 2022 ; Ahouangninou et al., 2022 ; Hayat et al., 2022 ), and animal feed (Fazili et al., 2021 ; Ismael et al., 2022 ; Zaki et al., 2021 ), development of functional foods and nutraceuticals (Lavelli, 2021 ), preparation of biodegradable packaging (Aouat et al., 2021 ; Hammajam et al., 2019 ; Mittal et al., 2020 ; Sirichalarmkul and Kaewpirom, 2021 ; Tan et al., 2022 ), production of biofuels (S. B. Tiwari et al., 2021 ; Embong et al., 2021 ; Shankar et al., 2019 ; AZ et al., 2021 ), and treatment of wastewater (Habiba et al., 2022 ; Dan et al., 2021 ; Sanka et al., 2020 ; Akhayere et al., 2020 ; Prajapati et al., 2022 ). Cereal-based husks are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Wheat husk (WH) contains 36% of cellulose, 18% of hemicellulose, and 16% of lignin (Santos et al., 2019 ). Rice husk (RH) is composed of 35% cellulose, 25% hemicellulose, and 20% lignin (Tiwari et al., 2022 ). Corn husk (CH), barley husk (BH), and millet husk (MH) also have cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin as their main constituents (Chen et al., 2023 ; Fortunati et al., 2016 ; Gairola et al., 2022 ). Cereal-based husks are separated as waste in cereal processing industries when cereal grains are cleaned, dehulled, and milled into various cereal flours. These byproducts are produced as a waste of cereal processing industries in about 70–80 million tons worldwide every year (Chen et al., 2023 ). This review describes the utilization of cereal-based husks like WH, RH, CH, BH, and MH to make adsorbents for the removal of Hg, Pb, Cd, Cr, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and other heavy metals, dyes like reactive blue (RB), methylene blue (MB), basic red (BR), basic blue (BB), crystal violet (CV) and tartrazine, antibiotics like ciprofloxacin (CIP), beta-lactam amoxicillin, and beta-lactam cefixime, pesticides like 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D), and other petrol contaminants from the wastewater. The production of biogas, biodiesel, bioethanol, and manufacturing of bioplastics, biodegradable films, packaging paper, and biodegradable foams from cereal-based husks are also described in detail with an aim of effective cereal waste management. The European Union (EU) Directive 2018/851/EC imposed a hierarchical approach to the management of waste materials discarded from various industries. According to which recovery, re-use, disposal, recycling, or prevention of waste from accumulation should be described from top to bottom in detail by adopting a waste hierarchy approach (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2018 ). In numerous papers published on the topic of waste management, the products that are fit for human consumption are separated by a dotted line from those products that are unfit for human consumption. In some studies, economically viable byproducts are separated from uneconomical ones. Some researchers also categorized the byproducts into various categories based on their best place of utilization i.e. food fortificant or biopreservative, animal feed, fertilizers, non-food products, and biofuels, etc. (Lavelli, 2021 ). In this paper, the source of cereal-based husks and their sustainable utilization is described by adopting a simple waste hierarchy approach as shown in Fig. 1  .  2 Treatment of wastewater Goal 6 of SDGs focuses on clean water and sanitation. Water is a vital component of our environment without it, life becomes impossible. So there is a great need to conserve water resources and make them free from harmful contaminants. Sustainable approaches to treat industrial wastewater by the utilization of cereal-based husks are discussed below in detail. 2.1 Removal of heavy metals Amen et al. (2020)  performed research on the adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions like Cd+2  and Pb+2  from wastewater by using biochar made from RH, corncob, and wheat straw. The characterization of biochar revealed that it had mixed redox as well as inert surface functional groups that proved helpful in decomposing the contaminants in wastewater because they can donate and accept electrons and form linkages with the chemical pollutants present in the wastewater. The biochar made from RH, corncob, and wheat straw showed an amorphous structure with very less abnormalities, hygroscopic with exceptional thermal stability even maintaining its significant weight at a temperature of 700 °C, and showed 94.73%, 93.68%, and 95.78% adsorption of Cd+2  and 96.41%, 95.38%, and 96.92% adsorption of Pb+2  from the wastewater. In another study, Panigrahi and Narayanan (2020)  transformed WHs into an activated carbon after soaking the ground form of WHs in 30% of H3 PO4 (WHs were converted into activated charcoal by a process of pyrolysis) and examined the adsorption of Cr, As, Pb, and Hg by using that activated carbon from the wastewater of textile industry. For batch tests, 10 g of WHs was used for 200 mL of textile effluent and the pH of the samples was adjusted from 4.5 to 7.5. The results showed that the concentration of As was reduced from 0.034 to 0.024 mg/L, the concentration of Hg was reduced from 3.86 to 1.32 mg/L, the concentration of Pb was reduced from 0.018 to 0.016 mg/L while the concentration of Cr remained same at pH 7.5. Sanka et al. (2020)  produced biochar after pyrolysis of CHs and RHs at 500, 600, and 700 °C of temperatures and employed that biochar for the removal of heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater. An atomic adsorption spectrophotometer was used to measure the initial metal ion concentrations in the wastewater and the residual levels after the application of biochar. Carbonization of RHs at 600 °C showed the best removal efficiencies for Pb (>90%), Fe (90%), and Cr (65%) while the carbonization of CHs at 600 °C produced the poorest removal efficiencies for Pb (slightly >35%) and Cr (only 20%). Rice husk biochar (RHB) showed a better capability of removing heavy metals from wastewater as compared to corn husk biochar (CHB). Gheitasi et al. (2022)  produced thiol magnetic activated carbon adsorbent from beer BHs after magnetizing the activated carbon with Fe3 O4  by using dual stage activation process and employed that adsorbent to remove Hg (II) ions from the wastewater. The results showed that about 99.44% of the Hg (II) ions were removed from the wastewater by 0.4 g/L of adsorbent dosage at pH 6 and a contact time of 60 min under optimum conditions. In another study, Prajapati et al. (2022)  used great millet husk (GMH) to synthesize adsorbents by thermal and chemical modification of the GMH and examined the removal of Cr (VI) from synthetic wastewater. In a chemical modification of the GMH, concentrated H2 SO4  was used to treat raw GMH which increased its porosity and heterogeneity on the surface. The results showed that the maximum removal of Cr (VI) was 16 mg/g with thermally treated GMH (TT-GMH) at pH 1, the adsorbent dosage of 4 g/L, 25 ° C temperature, 150 revolutions per minute (RPM) shaking speed, and contact time of 150 min while the maximum removal of Cr (VI) was 22.21 mg/g with chemically treated GMH (CT-GMH) at pH 2 and contact time of 120 min. CT-GMH showed more Cr (VI) removal efficiency as compared to the TT-GMH.  2.2 Removal of dyes Vasu et al. (2020)  used WH as a biosorption medium for the removal of dyes especially RB 19 and RB 195 from the textile wastewater. Spectrophotometer was used to analyze the dyes colorimetrically present in the wastewater. The results showed that 68% removal of RB 19 and 70% removal of RB 195 were obtained at a contact time of 90 min with adsorbent made from WH. Heng et al. (2021)  synthesized silica (SiO2) and carbon dots (CDs) from RHs and produced CD/SiO2 composite by impregnating the CDs on SiO2 through a hydrothermal synthesis reaction. Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were developed by using a series of CD/SiO2 composites and employed for the removal of dyes from wastewater. CD/SiO2 additive enhanced the membrane properties, negative surface charge, pore distribution, pore size, and hydrophilicity of the UF membranes. As a result, 50.54% of dye removal was obtained with 2.5 wt% of CD/SiO2  membrane as compared to the 14.52% with the pure membrane (CD/SiO2). In another study, Quansah et al. (2020)  thermally treated RHs and produced an adsorbent to remove cationic dyes like CV and MB from wastewater. The results showed that the thermally treated RHs at 75 °C had higher adsorption capacity as compared to those RHs that were treated at higher temperatures ranging from 300 to 700 °C. The adsorption capacity for CV was 25.46 mg/g and 24.48 mg/g for MB according to the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption capacity was increased by increasing the pH from 4 to 10. Garamon (2019)  prepared low-cost adsorbents by activation and carbonization of BHs and RHs, used them in aqueous solutions, and examined the adsorption of Brilliant Green dye on activated carbon produced by a chemical activation process. The adsorption capacity of both BHs and RHs was increased by activation and carbonization because it increased the carbon pores responsible for the adsorption of dyes. The results showed that activated barley husk (AC-BH) removed 90% and activated rice husk (AC-RH) removed 94% of Brilliant Green dye from aqueous solutions while the adsorbents prepared without activation and carbonization showed low adsorption capacity. In another study, Musa et al. (2022)  carried out the grafting process for MHs by using Ceric ammonium nitrate and Acrylonitrile as initiators and used grafted MH to synthesize poly-amidoxime ligand for the adsorption of Congo red dye from aqueous solutions. The results showed that the synthesized poly-amidoxime ligand removed 94.89% of Congo red dye at an adsorbent dosage of 0.3 g for 60 mg/L of initial concentration of dye and contact time of 45 min.  2.3 Removal of antibiotics, pesticides, and related compounds Habiba et al. (2022)  used a simple intercalation approach and prepared a wheat husk biochar (WHB) loaded with cinnamic acid (CA) to remove hazardous organic pollutants from aqueous solutions. Batch experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study the removal mechanisms of MB and CIP by employing WHB modified with CA (WHC/CA). The results showed that 96.52% of MB and 94.03% of CIP were removed by using WHC/CA. In another study, Franco et al. (2021)  used husks of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum ), modified them by treating them with H2 SO4 , and examined their adsorption capacity to remove a herbicide 2,4-D from aqueous solutions. The results showed that 45% of 2,4-D was removed by using modified husks of buckwheat. Okoya et al. (2020)  prepared RHB as an adsorbent and evaluated its performance to remove chlorpyrifos from pesticide-polluted water. The performance of RHB to remove chlorpyrifos was also compared with the performance of commercial activated carbon (CAC). The adsorption efficiency of RHB to adsorb chlorpyrifos from polluted water was assessed by batch adsorption studies. The results showed that RHB removed 94.5% of chlorpyrifos while CAC removed 93.7% removal of chlorpyrifos. RHB performed more efficiently than CAC to remove chlorpyrifos from pesticide-polluted water. Bhatti, Mahmood, et al. (2020a)  used BHs as cellulosic biomass, and produced biocomposites by using polypyrrole (PPY), polyaniline (PANI), and sodium alginate with BH (NaAlg/BH) and examined the performance of that biocomposites to remove 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) from aqueous media. The results showed that by using 0.05 g of composite dose, maximum sorption of 2,4-DCP ranged from 7.55 to 24.57 mg/g from 25 mg/L initial concentration of 2,4-DCP at 30 °C temperature, contact time of 120 min and pH range from 7 to 10. The utilization of cereal-based husks for the treatment of wastewater is discussed in detail in Table 1   and Fig. 2  .   3 Biofuels Goal 7 of the SDGs focuses on affordable and clean energy. The fossil fuels used in automobiles for transportation purposes emit harmful oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, hydrocarbons, and other harmful chemicals in the fresh air that are very toxic to our health. Biofuels are a possible solution to this life-threatening problem. The production of biofuels from cereal-based husks is discussed below in detail. 3.1 Biogas Sun et al. (2019)  examined the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of WHs before and after pretreatment with liquid digestate (LD) soaking. The yield of methane gas was increased by 91% from 68 mL/g VS (yield of biogas in terms of volatile solids) to 130.0 mL/g VS with the use of LD soaking pretreatment. LD pretreatment was successful in improving the anaerobic digestion of WHs.Syafrudin et al. (2020)  utilized RH waste and studied the impact of changes in the grind size of RH particles on the production of biogas during liquid anaerobic digestion (L-AD). The production of biogas is computed and expressed as ml/grTS. The grinding size of 10 mesh gave 54.95 mL/grTS, 18 mesh gave 44.86 mL/grTS, 35 mesh gave 58.13 mL/grTS, and 60 mesh gave 72.14 mL/grTS of biogas. In another study, Olugbemide et al. (2020)  studied the production of biogas from RHs by using 1, 3, and 5% concentrations of NaOH, HCl, and C2 H5 OH at 100–120 °C for 60 min. The ethanol-pretreated sample showed the highest production of biogas at 100 °C, followed by NaOH and HCl pretreated samples. The biogas yields for pretreated samples with HCl, NaOH, and C2 H5 OH were 32.26, 60.89, and 67.32 mL/gVS respectively at 100 °C. Murali et al. (2019)  produced biogas from CHs and Azolla (feedstocks) and studied the performance of that biogas in a compression ignition (CI) diesel engine. The exhaust gas emissions were also studied in the same research. The results showed that the ignition latency of the CI engine became shortened when biogas produced from CHs and Azolla was burnt in it. The exhaust gas emitted from the CI engine showed lower smoke and hydrocarbons as compared to petroleum fuels.  3.2 Biodiesel Santos et al. (2019)  used thermo-catalytic reforming (TCR) technology to convert WHs into fuels in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot-scale reactor. Out of 100 wt% of the feedstock, the amount of bio-oil produced was 5.8%, gas was 29.6%, char was 21.7%, aqueous phase liquids were 32.8%, and the remaining 10.1% were losses during the process. The bio-oil obtained from the WH waste had a 29.9 mg KOH/g value of total acid number (TAN) and a 145.2 cSt value of viscosity. It was suggested to blend the bio-oil obtained from the WH waste with fossil crude oil to use as a direct engine fuel. In another study, Hazmi et al. (2021)  utilized RHB to produce a bifunctional magnetic nano-catalyst that was further doped with 20% of KOH and 5% of Ni2 O (RCH/K2O-20%/Ni-5%) by using impregnation procedures and evaluated the catalytic ability of the nano-catalyst formed by transesterifying the used cooking oil. The parameters including the amount of nano-catalyst and methanol oil were optimized in a 12:1 ratio and biodiesel was produced through a transesterification reaction at 65 °C and 2 h of reaction time. The catalyst was reused for up to 5 reaction cycles, with the last cycles yielding 70% of biodiesel. The results showed that the RHB can be used to produce magnetic nano-catalysts to enhance the yield of biodiesels and for purification and separation procedures. Panithasan et al. (2020)  performed research by forming the blend of Jatropha biodiesel with RH nanoparticles and evaluated the performance of that blend in a single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine. The exhaust gas emitted from the diesel engine was also evaluated after the burning of the blended biodiesel. The results showed that a 0.2% addition of RH particles to 20% of the Jatropha methyl ester-diesel blend improved the combustion properties, and performance characteristics and lowered the exhaust emissions of harmful gases to the environment. The hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by 23.7%, carbon monoxide (CO) was reduced by 18.3%, and smoke opacity was reduced by 21.4%.  3.3 Bioethanol Tiwari et al. (2022)  synthesized bioethanol from RHs that are lignocellulosic and considered an inexpensive agricultural waste by using Klebsiella oxytoca  ATCC 13182 (American type culture collection) bacterial strain and also analyzed the effect of different pretreatment strategies applied during the process. The results revealed that the production of bioethanol was 32.61 ± 0.45 g/L after 48–72 h of incubation at pH 7 and 36 °C of temperature. Out of all the biological and acid pretreatment strategies applied during the process, the addition of Aspergillus niger  enhanced the production of bioethanol up to1.47 folds (47.98 ± 1.25 g/L). In another study, Montipó et al. (2019)  separated the liquid and solid fractions of uncatalyzed steam-exploded RH slurry, and hydrolyzed the liquor efficiently by using an enzymatic complex obtained from S1M29 strain of Penicillium echinulatum  (fungi) and NRRL B-30929 strain of Lactobacillus buchneri  (bacteria), and subjected it to the saccharification and fermentation processes by using CAT-1 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  to produce bioethanol. As a result, 19.17 g/L of ethanol and 12.69 g/L of lactic acid were produced. Shankar et al. (2019)  utilized husks of corn, peanut, and coffee cherry in a low-cost saccharification process in which lignocellulolytic enzymes produced by Sphingobacterium sp. Ksn was used to produce ethanol. The husks were pretreated with NaOH and H2 SO4  before the enzymatic hydrolysis. CH was found to be an optimal substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis to produce fermentable sugars. Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and Candida tropicalis  were used separately as well as in a co-culture for the fermentation of the hydrolysate that was produced by the enzymatic breakdown of steam-treated husks. The maximum amount of ethanol produced using an enzyme-based hydrolysate of steam-treated CH taken as the substrate was 20.61, 5.81, and 18.21 g/L, whereas 20.66 and 5.85 g/L were obtained after 72 h of fermentation from the corresponding immobilized yeast cells. The production of biofuels from cereal-based husks is described in detail in Table 2  . The commercial and environmental benefits of biofuels are described in Fig. 3  .   4 Biodegradable packaging Goal 9 of the SDGs focuses on industry, innovation, and infrastructure and goal 12 focuses on responsible consumption and production. In industries, plastics are frequently used for packaging their goods. The extensive use of plastics results in great stress on our soil because of its low biodegradability and difficulty in its recycling. Bioplastics made from natural resources can be used for packaging industrial products. So the production of bioplastics and biodegradable materials by utilizing food waste products for packaging purposes is a responsible production and the replacement of traditional plastics with bioplastics is a great innovation. The production of bioplastics, biodegradable films, packaging paper, and biodegradable foams for packaging purposes is discussed below in detail. 4.1 Bioplastics and bio-composite films Environmentally friendly materials known as bioplastics have become increasingly important for reducing the amount of conventional plastics-related pollution in the world. Karaca et al. (2022)  studied the simultaneous extraction of crystal biogenic silica and cellulose fiber from the RHs to develop composite bioplastic films that were based on cellulose and reinforced with silica for use in packaging applications. The developed bioplastic sheets showed better tensile strength and their biodegradability in soil ranged from 25.5% to 55.7% when observed after 21 days. The above-observed range of biodegradability is much greater as compared to conventional plastic materials. In another study, Datta et al. (2019)  functionalized the extracted nano-silica RH by its interaction with hydrophobic low-density polyethylene, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. The insertion of this surface-modified hydrophobic nano-silica (contact angle = 97°) into its matrix improved the mechanical and optical properties of low-density polyethylene and starch-blended biodegradable films as compared to pure nano-silica blended films of the same composition. The formed homogenized blend showed a tear strength of 155.5 N/mm and tensile strength of 10.03 MPa as per mechanical and microstructure testing. By increasing the amount of RH-based nano-silica, the degradation rate of the films was also improved. Choque-Quispe et al. (2022)  developed an edible film using activated cellulose nanocrystals produced from CHs, glycerin, and potato starch. 4 film formulations containing 0.0–0.12% of cellulose nanocrystals, 2.6–4.4% of potato starch, and 3.0–4.2% of glycerin were produced by the thermoforming process at 60 °C. The cellulose nanocrystals based on CHs enhanced the mechanical and thermal properties of the films. Z. Chen et al. (2023)  used deep eutectic solvent (DES) treatment after mild alkaline treatment supported by sonication to fractionate the lignocellulosic components in CH. The fractionated cellulose diffused steadily in water and nano-sheets were prepared after the process of ball-milling. The combination of nano-cellulose and nano-hemicellulose showed a strong synergistic reinforcing effect and gas barrier properties. The produced nanosheets showed 2.2 times higher tensile strength and 1.7 times more breakage elongation in comparison with virgin alginate film. Zhang et al. (2022)  developed CH-based plastic after the delignification of CHs. The developed CH-based plastic showed Young's modulus of 7.8 GPa, mechanical strength of 118 MPa, and 86% light transmittance which revealed its potential to replace conventional and non-biodegradable plastics. In another study, Mittal et al. (2020)  demonstrated the potential of composite sheets composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/starch and cellulose based on BH as a packaging material. To cross-link the PVA/starch matrix with urea formaldehyde, BH was grafted using palmitic acid in the presence of redox initiators. By the addition of grafted BH to a cross-linked PVA/starch matrix, the mechanical and water barrier properties of the films were improved. The films produced also showed an increase in their biodegradation rate. Gairola et al. (2022)  obtained fiber from barnyard millet husks (BMH) and finger millet husks (FMH) and evaluated their physical, chemical, and morphological characteristics. After fiber characterization, composites were produced by using an injection molding technique. The results revealed that FMH-reinforced composites showed stronger mechanical properties as compared to BMH-reinforced composites while BMH-reinforced composites showed higher flame resistance and thermal stability. It had been suggested to use both husks to produce thermoplastic composites. In another study, Sivamurugan et al. (2022)  obtained biosilica particles from FMH, and high-toughness epoxy composites were produced for packaging purposes by the addition of FMH-based biosilica particles and coconut rachilla fiber. The results indicated that the addition of FMH-based biosilica particles enhanced the flexural strength, tensile strength, impact strength, and hardness of the epoxy composites. The preparation of biodegradable films from cereal-based husks is described in Table 3  . The common methods and techniques involved in the preparation of biodegradable films are described in Fig. 4  .  4.2 Packaging paper Bhardwaj et al. (2022)  utilized CH and sugarcane bagasse (SB) taken in varying amounts as lignocellulosic materials, produced packaging paper through soda pulping, and enhanced their functionalities through emulsion coatings of chitosan and beeswax-chitosan. The results showed that chitosan coating improved the barrier properties of packaging paper against moisture, water vapors, and air by up to 85% and beeswax-chitosan coated papers showed longer absorbancy time as compared to the untreated samples. In another study, Kärkönen et al. (2022)  examined the BHs and oat hulls for their chemical makeup, fiber length, and mycotoxin levels to reveal their potential to make packaging paper and paperboard. BHs and oat hulls were refined by using a disc refiner to produce fibrillation and laboratory sheets were produced by mixing BHs, oat hulls, and softwood pulp. The results showed that the paper produced by the addition of BHs and oat hulls had good tensile strength and fulfilled the same quality requirements as that of commercial paper available in the market.  4.3 Biodegradable foams Sun et al. (2023)  produced an environmentally friendly foam composite by utilizing the RHs and maleic hydride grafted polylactic acid (MAH-g -PLA) as biodegradable ingredients. The foam composite showed a bending strength of 28.85 MPa and tensile strength of 6.99 MPa with good thermal stability. The chemical grafting between cellulose and PLA results in a denser structure of the foam composite and improved its mechanical, thermal, and water resistance properties. Spada et al. (2020)  used 20%, 40%, and 60% of RH proportions to make foams for the storage of cherry tomatoes by using a thermopressing technique and compared them with those foams that were produced from only starch (without RH proportions). The results revealed that the foams produced by the addition of 40 and 60% of RH proportions absorb less water and the formulation made with 60% RH proportion showed higher flexural strength and lower water absorption capacity (WAC), making it suitable for storage of cherry tomatoes. In another study, Phiriyawirut et al. (2021)  used CH as a reinforcement material to produce tapioca starch laminated composite foams from polybutylene succinate (PBS) and glyoxal crosslink-tapioca starch by using a compression molding technique. The results showed that crosslinked tapioca starch laminar composite foams had the maximum water resistance properties and impact strength with 3% PBS-coated CH.   5 Conclusion and recommendations Now it is a great need of the present day to adopt some sustainable approaches so that while making overall progress in the world, the level of environmental pollution can be also minimized efficiently. The biopolymeric matrices of cereal-based husks including WH, RH, CH, BH, and MH made them suitable for the preparation of adsorbants capable of removing heavy metals such as Cd, Cu, Cr, Co, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Hg, dyes such as reactive blue (RB 19 &RB 195), basic red (BR09 & BB41), methylene blue (MB), Congo red, crystal violet (CV), and tartrazine, pesticides like 2,4-D, antibiotics such as CIP, beta-lactam amoxicillin, and beta-lactam cefixime, and petrol contaminants from industrial wastewater. These husks can also be biotransformed into valuable products like biogas, biodiesel, and bioethanol as safe fuels for both our transportation and the environment. The biofuels produced from cereal-based husks burn smoothly in the combustible engines of automobiles and the exhaust gases emitted from automobiles after burning these biofuels are free from harmful oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. The cellulose, starch, fibers, nano-silica, nanocrystals, and other such useful constituents of these husks can efficiently be used to make bioplastics, biodegradable films, biodegradable foams, and packaging paper for various industries, especially the food industry. In the end, it is highly recommended to utilize food waste products as cheap sources for the treatment of industrial wastewater to remove harmful chemical pollutants before discharging it to freshwater streams, pay attention to producing biofuels for our transportation and bioplastics for our packaging purposes.
