About 20% of worldwide cardiovascular disease deaths occur in India;2   therefore, Ke and colleagues' report3   of new findings on the trends in cardiovascular disease deaths in India over a period of 15 years is particularly important. Ke and colleagues have used data from the Sample Registration System, in which samples of 2·4 million households have been selected from the 1991 and 2001 censuses and their inhabitants followed-up in two periods (2001–03 and 2004–14) to measure mortality and ascertain probable causes of death with verbal autopsy. The authors extrapolated the observed rates of cardiovascular disease death in the entire Indian population up to 2015. They found a significant increase in ischaemic heart disease related deaths in India from 2000 to 2015. During that period, the age-standardised mortality rate for ischaemic heart disease in India increased from rates similar to that of the UK and USA to more than double these rates. By contrast, overall age-standardised mortality rates for stroke followed a similar decrease to that seen in the UK and USA, although stroke mortality rates in India were three times higher. Interestingly, in a subset of northeastern states, where the population is of a different ethnic mix (mainly Sino-Tibetan), mortality rates for stroke were higher than in other states, and were increasing rather than decreasing. The differing experiences of rural and urban populations have important implications for other low-income and middle-income countries, although the data are hard to interpret at this stage. Age-standardised mortality for ischaemic heart disease decreased marginally in urban areas, but increased substantially in rural areas. An age-period cohort analysis found that younger people (born in the late 1970s) had a higher risk of death from ischaemic heart disease than previous cohorts of the same age, suggesting that ischaemic heart disease mortality in India will increase further in the next decades. As with many low-income and middle-income countries, most deaths in India occur at home without official records. The data in Ke and colleagues' paper are derived from verbal autopsies, whereby interviewers collected structured information from the household where the death occurred and at least two physicians determined the probable cause of death. With all its limitations considered, verbal autopsy remains the best tool to establish possible cause of death when death certificates are unreliable, and has enabled many important analyses such as this one. WHO has created a standardised verbal autopsy questionnaire4   suitable for initiatives with automated algorithms that determine probabilities of causes of death, avoiding biased and inconsistent criteria set by doctors and enabling fast processing of large numbers of verbal autopsies.5   The pattern of cardiovascular deaths described by Ke and colleagues3   differs markedly from that seen in sub-Saharan Africa, where stroke is a more frequent cause of death than is ischaemic heart disease.6   This disparity raises important questions and highlights the need for a greater understanding of why these variations occur. Africa and India have a high prevalence of many cardiovascular risk factors associated with ischaemic heart disease and stroke in high-income countries, such as tobacco use, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. These factors might be differently associated with cardiovascular disease in Indian and African populations, or other unidentified factors might exist. Establishment of risk factor scores for cardiovascular disease in low-income and middle-income countries would help to unravel this issue, but development of such scores requires large cohorts and long follow-up to have a sufficient number of cardiovascular disease deaths. Although new cohorts have been created in Africa7   and Asia8,9   to explore these associations and establish new risk factor scores, they are relatively small: this area requires increased funding. The findings described by Ke and colleagues indicate that Sustainable Development Goal 3 of halving cardiovascular deaths by 2030 is unlikely to be achieved. The finding from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 that ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of death in men and women supports this suggestion.10   These deaths could increase unless a new effort is implemented to better understand the risk factors and improve the diagnosis, treatment, and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in low-income and middle-income countries. We declare no competing interests.
