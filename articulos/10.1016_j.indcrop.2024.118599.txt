Through a thorough analysis of recent research and technological breakthroughs, the study underscores the multifaceted opportunities for bio-based industries, creating new market avenues for bio-based products and promoting efficient resource utilization. Additionally, the review highlights the importance of sustainable practices in the jute industry, emphasizing the need for eco-friendly production methods and waste management strategies. By maximizing the potential of jute sticks through innovative processes and technologies, not only can valuable products be created, but environmental benefits can also be realized. Overall, the shift towards a cradle-to-cradle economy with a focus on bio-based materials presents a promising pathway towards a more sustainable and resource-efficient future.   Keywords Jute stick  Valorisation  Value-added product  Cradle-to-cradle economy   Data Availability The authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used.   1 Introduction Jute stands as an important bast fibre, holding the second position after cotton in the textile industry and various other sectors (Singh et al., 2019 ). The jute plant is famous for its fibres obtained from the self-pollinated herbaceous species of the genus Corchorous , belonging to the Tiliaceae  family (currently desegregated into the Malvaceae family). It plays a vital role as a commodity for millions of households, supporting their daily earnings (Pandey, Ghosh, and Day, 1995 ). India leads the world in jute production, followed by Bangladesh, China, Nepal, and Thailand, collectively contributing to approximately 98 % of the global jute output. According to the International Jute Study Group (IJSG), India alone accounts for around 3 million tonnes annually in jute production (FAOSTAT, 2016 ) because of its versatile applications in a wide range of industries, including the production of daily-use gunny bags, carpet making, decorative items and similar other products. Importantly, these applications are not limited to these examples, indicating the diverse and expanding uses of jute in various sectors. Jute fibre after processing leaves behind remnants such as sticks, leaves, stubbles, and roots providing a promising avenue for enriching soil biomass. According to a study conducted by Singh (2017) , jute cultivation contributes an average biomass ranging from 0.97 to 2.8 tonnes per hectare annually. This suggests that the entire jute plant could serve as raw material for various industries based on its chemical and physical properties. However, the major chunk of this leftover is the jute stick, composed of lignocellulosic biomolecules. These sticks are obtained post-processing of the fibre and represent a weight proportion approximately 2.5 times that of the jute fibre extracted during the processing of raw jute-plant feedstock (Baheti and Militky, 2016; Matin et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, they generate an annual byproducts reaching around 7 million tonnes indicating the abundance of availability of potential feedstock biomass (Suman et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2019 ) Jute sticks are been traditionally integrated into diverse applications, serving as a fundamental resource in cottage industries and handicrafts, where their fibrous nature is harnessed for weaving baskets and mats. In rural households, these sticks find utility as a readily available and relatively sustainable source of fuel for cooking (Jagadale et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, their role extends to agriculture, where jute sticks are employed as organic mulch, aiding in moisture retention, weed suppression, and soil enhancement. The multifaceted conventional uses of jute sticks underscore their cultural, economic and environmental significance, emphasizing the need to balance traditional practices with contemporary sustainability efforts. However, these traditional practices are linked to several environmental, economic, and social issues. In conventional practices, these sticks were frequently thrown or burned in open fields, resulting in air pollution from the discharge of toxic gases and particulate matter, contributing to poor air quality that can be harmful to both human and animal health (Roy et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, inappropriate jute stick disposal also leads to soil damage and decreased agricultural yield as when jute sticks are burned, vital organic matter and nutrients are lost, harming soil fertility and land health overall. In terms of economy, conventional jute stick disposal represents a squandered opportunity for value addition and income production. Moreover, investigating efficient and sustainable utilization methods for this abundant biomass resource could contribute to the development of eco-friendly practices, such as bioenergy production, composite materials or other value-added applications, thereby addressing both waste management challenges and promoting a more circular and sustainable economy. Hence, the primary objective of this review article is to offer a current and comprehensive overview of the technologies utilized for the valorisation of jute waste to produce biofuels, biomaterials, biosorbents, and other value-added components. Throughout this study, the review emphasizes the importance and relevance of the bio-refinery concept in the context of environmental considerations. Additionally, it seeks to study the advantages, drawbacks, and challenges inherent in each technique, accompanied by an assessment of the process parameters influencing the efficiency of bio-product generation. Also, the importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in jute stick waste study in analysing the most efficient ways to recycling or reusing has been briefly mentioned in the section. Thus, the present article concentrates on utilizing the jute stick and the entire strategy has been classified into various valorisation processes utilizing jute sticks and problems encountered during the implementation of these technologies on a larger scale.  2 Characterisation of jute stick and problems associated with conventional use Jute sticks exhibit characteristics such as extremely lightweight, pale yellow and light coloration with few branches, a hollow interior, and a solid bottom. These sticks typically weigh between 65 and 90 kg m−3 , with a specific gravity ranging from 0.2 to 0.25. They are primarily obtained only form the cultivated species of Corchorous  i.e. C. olitorius  and C. capsularis  as the other species such as C. trilocularis, C. pseudo-olitorius, C. aestuans, C. fascicularis, C. tridens, C. trilocularis, C. fascicularis,  and C. pseudo-olitorius  are bushy, shorter in size and mostly found as weeds in natural vegetation (Kundu, 1956; Choudhary et al., 2017 ). Thus, the commercial availability of jute sticks primarily depends only on the cultivated species. The chemical composition of the sticks predominantly consists of approximately 40.8–47.1 % cellulose, 23.0–23.6 % hemicellulose, 22.2–23.5 % lignin, fat, wax and other component 1.7–2.4 % (Fig. 1) (Roy et al., 2022 ; Banerjee et al., 1985 ; Sur and Amin, 2010 ). This composition opens up a wide scope of applications, including charring of jute sticks, pulp and paper production, chemical manufacturing and biofuel production (Jagadale et al., 2023 ). Several jute research laboratories are trying to explore ways to utilize these agricultural residues. Various products manufacturing appears to be feasible both in small and large-scale industries with these biomass valorisations.   In view of these issues, there is an urgent need to replace the traditional use of jute sticks with more sustainable and innovative techniques. Developing efficient ways for jute stick management, such as recycling, composting, or using them for biomass energy, can not only reduce pollution and improve soil fertility but also open up economic opportunities while promoting healthier and more resilient communities. The versatility of this biomass presents numerous applications, depending on the end products derived from various pretreatment and hydrolysis processes, as discussed in the subsequent section.  3 Valorisation of jute wastes Jute stick valorisation has considerable potential for both sustainable resource use and economic expansion. Additionally, it provides a chance to reduce environmental pollution, trash generation, and landfill burden. It simultaneously offers opportunities for the development of novel goods, environmental friendly materials, and renewable energy sources. Jute stick valorisation can unlock a range of high-value outputs by harnessing contemporary scientific methodologies, such as biorefinery principles, biochemical processing, and creative material engineering. 3.1 Pulp and paper production The process of breaking down wood and non-wood materials into individual fibres through the use of mechanical, chemical or a combination of both treatments is referred to as the pulping process. The global demand for pulp and paper products has exhibited a consistent upward trend throughout time, mostly driven by forces such as population growth, urbanization, economic advancement, as well as the expanding packaging sector and increasing literacy rates. In response to increasing awareness of climate change and the imperative for sustainable development, organizations such as the Environmental Paper Network (EPA), Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI), Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Government of India, and others are actively striving to implement suitable measures to advance the paper industry with stringent regulations and sustainability objectives (Chauhan and Meena., 2021; Hetemäki et al., 2013 ). This has additionally influenced the dynamics of demand by compelling the pulp and paper industry to embrace more environmentally friendly practices and allocate resources towards renewable energy sources. The utilization of jute sticks for pulp and paper production has emerged as an important valorisation strategy contributing to waste reduction, sustainable resource management, and the development of eco-friendly paper products (Rahman et al., 2016 ). However, specific process details and the quality of the final paper depend on various factors, including the pulping methods employed and the intended use of the paper product. The production of pulp and paper from jute sticks entails removing fibrous material from the woody components of the jute plant and converting it into paper goods. Based on the literature study, the biorefinery concept fits well with the production of dissolving pulp, where the lignocellulosic jute sticks are separated into cellulose pulp and hemicelluloses through mechanical and chemical methods (Saeed et al., 2012 ). These cellulosic pulp can further be utilized for biofuel production and various other products. Mechanical pulping involves grinding or refining the sticks to mechanically separate the fibres whereas chemical pulping involves treating the sticks with chemicals to dissolve or weaken the lignin and other non-fibrous components, allowing for easier fibre separation. In a study performed by Sanyal et al. (1981) , the soda pulping and chemo-mechanical processing of jute sticks was analysed to obtain the pulp yield of 44 %-80 % and 76 %-81 % respectively. In another study conducted by Islam and Sarkanen (1993) , the pulp was manufactured from jute sticks using the soda-anthraquinone (AQ) process, employing alkali charge levels of 16%, 18 %, and 22 %, along with AQ concentrations of 0.05 % and 0.1 % in the raw material. The pulp produced under a 16 % alkali charge with 0.05 % AQ demonstrated satisfactory yield and strength. The addition of AQ not only increased the pulp yield from 38 % to 48 % but also decreased the processing time from 3 h to 1 h. The anthraquinone played a vital role as a catalyst in the kraft pulping process that facilitated efficient delignification, reduced chemical consumption, enhanced energy efficiency, and improved pulp quality. In contrast to jute fibres, jute sticks necessitate more rigorous processing conditions owing to their elevated lignin content and a reduced syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio. The molar ratio of syringaldehyde to guaiacyl was observed to be 2.0 for jute fibres and 1.4 for lignins derived from sticks (Rahman et al., 2016 ; Islam and sarkanen, 1993 ). Conversely, a lower S/G ratio of pulp results in more resistance toward delignification. This affects the bleaching process and also necessitates more extensive treatments to achieve desired brightness levels. In such cases, the addition of catalysts such as anthraquinone (AQ) and ABTS (2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) can indeed be considered efficient delignification enhancers in various pulping processes. Jute sticks of different varieties were also considered for pulping to obtain maximum yield, but the result showed no significant difference. In a study conducted by Rahman et al. (2016)  jute varieties such as Shabuj Pat (CVL-1) from Corchorus capsularis;  BJRI Tossa Pat 4 (O-72) and BJRI Tossa Pat 5 (O-795) from Corchorus olitorius  when evaluated showed pulp yield nearly the same of approximately 44 % at kappa number of 15 in soda-anthraquinone process. Some studies were performed where the jute sticks were mixed with other raw materials to increase the pulp yield. In a study performed by Ghosh (1983) , the pulping was performed using the mixture of rice straw by chemi –mechanical and kraft process to obtain an enhanced yield of 70–78 % with folding endurance of 20–480 and breaking length of 2330–6550 m. Mixture of soda-impregnated jute sticks and jute caddies gave a pulp yield of 68–77 % with folding endurance of 6–75 and a breaking length of 3000–6260 m through the mechanical pulping process. The above discussion leads to the conclusion that jute sticks demand a higher chemical or mechanical charge compared to jute fibre for effective delignification in the production of bleachable grade pulp. Since, these pulps also serve as sustainable raw materials for the manufacturing of various products such as cellulose derivatives and nano-/micro-cellulose, serving as alternatives to petroleum-based materials, ensuring the highest pulp quality becomes a crucial step in this process. In order to achieve the unique characteristics, including high purity, consistent molecular-weight distribution, and cellulose's reactivity and susceptibility to chemicals, certain biological processes (microbial and enzymatic action) can be applied in combination with single or multiple pre-treatment processes (ultrasonication, microwave-assisted delignification, swelling procedures, auto hydrolysis) etc. for improving the yield. Similarly, a combination of several lignocellulosic substrates with jute sticks can also be explored widely to increase the mechanical strength and pulp yield making the process economically beneficial.  3.2 Jute waste used as a source of cellulose Cellulose is a polydispersed linear biopolymer made of (1,4)-D-glucose which is as wide as 0.05 nm and form microfibril through regular and irregular hydrogen bondings. These microfibrils are enclosed together with hemicelluloses and lignin by chemical bonding to form a complex lignocellu9losic biomass (Rong et al., 2001 ). Due to its various application, environmental benefits and capacity to adjust to changing market trends, cellulose production has seen a sharp increase in demand in India and around the world. Over several decades, cellulose, derived from wood and plant fibres, has served as a versatile resource for energy, building materials, paper, textiles, and clothing with 7.5 × 1010  tonnes of cellulose produced globally per year (Jayanthi et al., 2024 ). Its enduring application is evident in numerous industries, that showcase the continued relevance of natural cellulose-based materials in contemporary times. As mentioned earlier in Section 2 , the cellulosic content of jute is approximately 45 %, making it a suitable candidate for the extraction of various forms of cellulose after the removal of non-lignocellulosic components. Producing cellulose from jute sticks involves several key steps. Initially, jute sticks are collected and cleaned to remove impurities. Next, they undergo delignification, where lignin and other non-cellulosic components are removed using chemical or enzymatic methods. The delignified jute sticks are then pulped to separate the cellulose fibres, followed by bleaching to further purify the fibres. After washing and drying, the purified cellulose fibres are ready for further processing into various products, such as paper, textiles, and composites. Each step in the process is essential for obtaining high-quality cellulose from jute sticks, contributing to the versatility and utility of this natural resource. The production of cellulose from jute sticks involves several critical stages. Initially, jute sticks are subjected to a cleaning process to remove impurities followed by delignification, using either chemical or enzymatic methods. After delignification, the jute sticks are pulped to isolate the cellulose fibres, which are then further purified through bleaching. Each stage of this process is essential for obtaining high-quality cellulose from jute sticks, underscoring the versatility and usefulness of this natural resource. Dissolving pulp plays an eco-friendly source for producing cellulose derivatives and regenerated cellulose from jute stick waste (Saeed et al., 2012 ). The hydroxyl group (-OH) of cellulose can completely or partially react in the chemical reaction with various reagents to form cellulose derivatives with several unique and beneficial features such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), cellulose acetate, viscose rayon, microcrystalline cellulose, nanofibres and nanocrystals, ethyl cellulose (EC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). These derivatives further can be utilized in various sectors including medical, cosmetics, washing powders, food additives etc (Hossain et al., 2021 ; Ria et al., 2022).  Table 1  provides a consolidated overview of studies conducted on extracting cellulose derivatives from jute sticks. In another work performed by Ahmed et al. (2023) , MCC was isolated from the jute stick to produce Na-CMC-based hydrogel (Na-CMCH) and microcrystalline cellulose-based hydrogel (MCCH). These hydrogels were made following the chemical treatment process and further the hydrogels were used for the removal of methylene blue dye. The data highlights that major works are been performed on the extraction of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and also, the extraction process predominantly relies on chemical approaches, reflecting a prevalent emphasis on chemical methods for cellulose extraction from jute sticks (Day et al., 2007 ). Since cellulose-based materials can be used as biodegradable and environmentally beneficial substitutes for synthetic polymers, they are in line with the growing customer demand for environmentally responsible products. Thus, developments in cellulose processing technologies can spawn creative uses such cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose-based composites, which can draw more interest from the construction, automotive, and electronics industries. This pattern is anticipated to continue as industries look for ecologically friendly and sustainable options, which will further fuel the expansion of the cellulose market globally.  3.3 Jute sticks as a source of bioethanol production The cellulosic composition (as mentioned in Section 1 ) enriches jute sticks as a favourable feedstock for bioethanol production (Pratik Satya and Ratikanta Maiti, 2013 ; Kar and Singh., 2023 ). As countries strive to decrease their carbon footprint and dependence on fossil fuels, the demand for sustainable alternatives like jute-based bioethanol is expected to continue growing. This trend underscores the pivotal role that jute sticks could play in addressing both environmental concerns and energy demands within the global bioethanol market. Transportation biofuels, such as bioethanol, significantly contribute to ensuring a nation's energy and economic stability, representing 65 % of the overall global biofuels production (Sherpa et al., 2022 ). The National Biofuel Policy of 2020 places a strong emphasis on the use of lignocellulosic biomass or municipal/agricultural waste for the production of bioethanol. Various processes are employed for the pre-treatment of jute sticks to loosen the non-cellulosic components, further enhancing the efficiency of saccharification and fermentation processes. In an investigation, Singh et al. (2020)  analysed the bioethanol production from jute sticks by using several chemical and physical pretreatments (alkali, ammonia fibre expansion, acid and steam) followed by enzymatic saccharification and fermentation. The alkali pre-treated substrate (2 % NaOH) exhibited a remarkably elevated level of reducing sugar production (19.51 g/L) following 72 hours of hydrolysis, surpassing the output from other pretreated biomass. Using the thermotolerant yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae JRC6, the subsequent fermentation of the liberated reducing sugars produced 7.55 g/L of ethanol over a 72-hour fermentation period with a fermentation efficiency of 77.73 %. Another study performed by Jagadale et al., (2023)  demonstrated pre-treatment like densification, drying and torrefaction processes to improve the problem related to biomass utilizations such as limiting grindability, high moisture content, low energy yield, low bulk density, low calorific value, and hydrophilic nature of biomass. They further optimized the process parameters i.e., residence time (20–60 min) and temperature (200–300°C) using response surface methodology to obtain the maximum yield of 94.03 % and higher heating value (HHV) of 19.32 MJ/kg at 250 °C with the residence time of 40 min. Sharma et al. (2023a)  also worked on the alkali pre-treatment (2.47 %) of jute stick biomass to obtain the delignification of 80.42 % for 5.9 h at 55.8 °C. They obtained the maximum saccharification of 76.48 % by hydrolysing 6.9 % (w/v) of biomass with an enzyme concentration of 49.52 FPU/g substrate at 51.05 °C for 74.46 h. In a study conducted by Suman et al. (2022)  who worked on laccase produced by Trametes maxima with Hydroxybenzotriazole as mediators to enhance the degradation of lignin component by 21.8 % of jute stick biomass for enhancing the saccarification of reducing sugar yield by 19.5 %. Therefore, utilizing catalysts such as hydroxybenzotriazole, AQ and ABTS in the process not only enhances the overall efficiency of biomass conversion but also reduces the energy and resource demands linked to delignification and saccharification processes. These investigations also implicate the limited studies on jute stick processing through a complete biocatalyst-based process with limited use of chemicals to make the process sustainable and cost-effective. Additionally, incorporating system biology, multi-omics methods, and lignocellulosic biotechnology into biorefinery processes can be explored to significantly lower the costs and problems related to large-scale biofuel production.  3.4 Jute stick in waste water treatment Jute sticks have garnered attention for their potential in wastewater treatment, both in India and globally. These fibrous remnants of jute plants possess remarkable adsorption properties due to their porous structure and high cellulose content. As research continues to unveil their potential, the demand for jute sticks in wastewater treatment is expected to rise, contributing to cleaner waterways and a healthier environment (Nipa et al., 2019 ). Novel approaches to convert jute sticks into productive materials have been extensively explored. Jute stick powder (JSP) provides a fascinating way to clean wastewater that is generated worldwide due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. This industrial process contaminates the freshwater by discharging wastewater containing heavy metals, dyes, organic pollutants, pesticides, and microbes. To make this water usable, pollutants and undesired components must be removed or reduced. Many studies have explored JSPs to remove heavy metals or dyes from water because of their excellent properties.   4 Removal of heavy metals Increasing heavy metal contamination due to diverse industrial activities, mining operations, and improper waste disposal practices are causing several threats to the ecosystem. Notably, hazardous heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic pose significant threats due to their non-biodegradable and carcinogenic nature. Following release into the environment, these metals tend to accumulate in soil and water bodies, subsequently entering the food chain. The pervasive nature of heavy metal contamination has profound and far-reaching consequences on ecosystems and public health (Aziz et al., 2019; Malik et al., 2017; Kashem et al., 2019 ). Therefore, effective treatment methods are needed to remove or reduce heavy metal concentrations in water sources. Various technologies have been employed for the remediation of wastewater or drinking water contaminated with heavy metals. Among these methods, adsorption has emerged as the most efficient and commonly employed technique for the removal of heavy metals demonstrating high effectiveness even at lower concentrations at lower expenses. In recent times, JSP has exhibited significant potential in environmental remediation. The use of JSP to remove heavy metals in various studies has been shown in Table 1 .  In a study, JSP has been utilized as a biosorbent to remove Pb (II) ions from an aqueous solution.  Table 2  indicates the effect of pH, concentrations of metal ions, dosages of the adsorbent, and duration of agitation affecting biosorption behaviour. The research demonstrated the involvement of spontaneous ion-exchange and complexation processes in the adsorption mechanism. Even after three rounds of reuse, the JSP maintained its adsorptive effectiveness during the repeated adsorption-desorption cycles (Alam and Uddin, 2019 ). The ability of JSP to absorb chromium (III) from a synthetic wastewater solution was also investigated. To examine the impact of various laboratory conditions, a series of batch tests were carried out at various pH values, adsorbent dosages, and initial chromium concentrations. Maximum chromium removal capacities with JSP biosorbant were observed at 84.34 % with a corresponding equilibrium uptake of 8.4 mg/g from 50 mg/L of synthetic metal solution in 1 hour of contact time at pH 6.0 and 28 °C with continuous stirring at 180 rpm. The percent sorption of the biomass exhibited an increase with prolonged contact times, reduced pH levels, and elevated adsorbent dosages. Conversely, it decreased with higher concentrations of metal ions. During the initial stages, particularly within the first 5–30 minutes, the removal rate of Cr (III) ions from the aqueous solution by JSP was observed to be rapid. Equilibrium was reached within approximately 40 minutes. (Uddin et al., 2018 ). In another study, a batch approach was employed to eliminate cadmium (II) from aqueous solutions utilizing JSP. The batch tests were conducted to optimize factors, including metal concentration, solution pH, adsorbent quantity, contact time, and agitation speed, which were determined to be 4.5, 0.5 g/100 ML, 1 hour, and 180 rpm, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity reached 10.003 mg g−1 , demonstrating favourable adsorption at a pH of 4.5 (Alam et al., 2020 ). In a novel approach, a magnetic bioadsorbent based JSP (MB-JSP) was examined to determine the adsorption capacity of chromium (VI) from aqueous solution. It was synthesised via the in -situ co-precipitation method using Fe2+  and Fe3+  solutions within a wide pH range of 1–2. This magnetic bioadsorbent demonstrated excellent performance in the removal of Cr (VI). Both the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model provided consistent support for the removal of Cr (VI) by MB-JSP. The maximum Cr (VI) adsorption capacity of MB-JSP was determined to be 47.125 mg/g. From the findings, it was concluded that the removal of Cr (VI) ions was performed via ion exchange and the attraction between the opposing charges of various functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent (Rhaman et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, the effectiveness of JSP as a biosorbent was evaluated for the simultaneous removal of a mixture of three detrimental metals—Pb(II), Cr(III), and Cd(II) ions—from wastewater. JSP exhibited a biosorption efficiency exceeding 90 % for all investigated metal ions in the multiple-metal system. The result indicated that at a constant adsorbent dose (0.5 g), the concentrations of the three ions influenced their unadsorbed presence in the solution, attributed to the saturation of binding sites. It was observed that as the concentrations of the three ions increased, more of them were left unadsorbed in solution (Uddin et al., 2020 ). This study provides valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of simultaneous processing for the removal of multiple contaminants, showcasing the potential of JSP as a versatile biosorbent for environmental remediation purposes.  5 Removal of dyes Global industrial data depicts the utilization of more than 10,000 different colours and dyes (Iqbal and Ashiq, 2007 ), with an estimated dye loss of 1–15 % during the dying process (Senthilkumaar et al., 2005 ). Even in very low quantities, dyes in water are clearly evident and unappealing. Coloured wastewater containing dyes when released into environmental water bodies are highly toxic effluents and long-term exposure to these dyes in aquatic environments can intermittently lead to environmental contamination and the subsequent endangerment of the food chain, posing risks to human health too. Thus, it is imperative to adequately treat wastewater to remove colours before its release into water sources ( Chen et al., 2019 ) . Among the numerous procedures that have been investigated ( Table 3 ) to remove dyes, jute sticks have produced encouraging outcomes. For example, JSP was employed as a viable and cost-effective adsorbent for removing methylene blue (MB), an organic dye, from an aqueous solution by batch adsorption technique. The experiments were conducted under standard laboratory conditions, specifically at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Nipa et al., 2019 ). A thorough investigation was conducted to assess the impact of four key variables —solution pH, adsorbent dosage, starting dye concentration, and time— on Methylene Blue (MB) removal using a jute stick. The optimal conditions, determined through response surface methodology (RSM), were found to be 10.27 for solution pH, 5 g/L for adsorbent dosage, 200 mg/L for starting dye concentration, and 66.06 minutes for the maximum dye elimination of 99.43 %. Regeneration was achieved with H2 SO4  (0.1 M), and after three cycles of recycling, the MB elimination decreased to 23.6 % (Ghosh et al., 2019 ). JSP was also used for the adsorptive removal of two dyes, congo red and rhodamine B. To investigate the adsorption phenomenon, physicochemical parameters such as dye concentration, solution pH, temperature, and contact duration were varied. Both dyes exhibit favourable adsorption around pH 7.0, while temperature showed no substantial effect on adsorption. The adsorption of the dye on JSP was attributed to weak electrostatic interaction between the dye molecules and the solid surface. For congo red and rhodamine B, the maximal adsorption capacity was determined to be 35.7 and 87.7 mg/g of biomass, respectively. In the case of Rhodamine B, the adsorption process demonstrated a reasonable fit to both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. However, for Congo red, only the Langmuir model was found to be applicable to describe the adsorption behaviour (Panda et al., 2009 ). In another study, JSP was pretreated to enhance its effectiveness in adsorbing dye from raw textile effluent. Various pretreatment techniques were applied, including gamma radiation treatment, alkali treatment, ammonia treatment, steam treatment, and CaCl2  treatment and the adsorbing performance was examined for two synthetic dye solutions, namely Blue FCL and Red RL dye. Among these treatments, gamma-irradiated JSP at 500 Krad exhibited the highest dye uptake capability for Red RL dye. On the other hand, steam-treated JSP demonstrated the highest uptake for Blue FCL dye. Subsequently, the gamma-irradiated and steam-treated JSP showed potential results in adsorbing dye from raw textile effluent and in partial reduction of BOD5 , COD load and TOC (Parvin et al., 2017 ).  To enhance the efficacy of JSP, various polymers are recently been synthesized using JSP. In a recent novel study, a polymeric mixed matrix membrane (MMM) was synthesized by incorporation of Corchorus  stick powder (CSP) in a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) matrix for the removal of crystal violet from an aqueous solution. By altering the CSP content (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt %), three distinct polymers were created (Das and Bhattacharjee, 2022 ). Among these, the polymer with 1 wt % CSP content showed the highest dye rejection percentage. In a separate study, a novel amine cross-linked magnetic biopolymer based on JSP (AMB-JSP) was applied as an adsorbent to remove methylene blue (MeB) from an aqueous solution. The maximum MeB removals with AMB-JSP were observed as 85.71 % at pH 8.0. The thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption procedure was endothermic and thus spontaneous in nature. This study suggests that the magnetic bioadsorbent (AMB-JSP) could be effectively applied for the removal of Methylene Blue (MeB) dye from aqueous solutions (Rhaman et al., 2022 ). 5.1 Jute sticks utilized as charcoal production Jute fibre and stick, both are employed as raw materials for biochar production by the researchers because of their high carbon content. The potential annual production of charcoal from only jute sticks is approximately 756,000 tonnes with a diverse range of applications, including environmental protection, water purification, various industrial uses, insulation in construction, medical applications, and more (Ghorai et al., 2020 ). The versatility of charcoal in various industry makes it a valuable commodity for both economic and environmental reasons globally. The techniques widely employed for the production of jute-derived carbonaceous compounds is mainly through pyrolysis. The precursor material and the preparation techniques utilised show a significant impact on the characteristics of the carbonaceous materials produced that also results in a biochar with diverse properties (Aziz et al., 2020 ). The systematic pyrolysis of biomass produces an extremely carbonaceous, charcoal-like product. Low-temperature pyrolysis (between 300 and 500 °C) was shown to increase the formation of biochar and carbon concentration. In contrast, using high-temperature pyrolysis (over 500 °C) has been associated with lower biochar yield while increasing surface area, improving its capacity to adsorb various chemicals (Manyà, 2012 ). In a different investigation, the charcoal yield between temperatures of 250 °C and 300 °C was approximately 45 % which further decreased by 8 % at 500 °C, and a further drop in yield was observed with temperatures exceeding 500 °C. Subsequent to the production of the carbonaceous product, activated carbon is formed through pyrolysis with CaCl2  at 700 °C, as indicated by the findings of Sarkar and Ahmed (2022) . In order to improve the yield percentage, a multi-step carbonization approach is further proposed for both pretreated and untreated charcoal by Sarkar and Wang, (2020) . This method involves dividing the carbonization process into several stages, each characterized by specific heating rates and durations tailored to the breakdown temperatures of functional groups present in the jute stick. The aim is to optimize the yield while addressing the inefficiencies observed at high temperatures (> 400 °C) in a single-stage process. The limitation of the single-stage carbonization method lies in its reduced efficiency at elevated temperatures (> 350 °C), making large-scale production economically unviable. The findings from the investigation carried out by Alam et al. (2022)  directed a favourable indication towards increased charcoal yield through the implementation of a multi-step approach. The process involved a three-step carbonization process, each involving distinct heating rates and temperature ranges for the pre-treated samples. The treatment indicated that salt impregnated with pre-hydrolyzed jute stick charcoal resulted in approximately 51 % yield and 93 % fixed carbon, while salt impregnated with charcoal produced a 39 % yield and 95 % fixed carbon, as revealed by the findings of the proximate analysis. Both of these values were notably higher than the amount of charcoal generated through a one-stage carbonization method supporting the beneficial impact of multiple-step carbonization. Furthermore, the incorporation of pre-hydrolysis and salt impregnation, either individually or in combination, can provide high-quality charcoal with substantial yields even during a one-stage carbonization process (Alam et al., 2023 ). In a different study, the effect of varying pyrolysis temperatures on the yield of biochar was examined. This study depicted that pyrolysis rates of heating (10, 20, 30 and 40 °C/min) are also one of the important factors that may affect how biomass is further modified to produce a variety of products. The output of biochar and bio-oil appears to decrease as the heating rate rises, from 19.8 % to 16.7 % and 52.89–47.21 %, respectively. Furthermore, the generation of non-condensable gas went up from 18.65 % to 23.68 % at the same range of temperatures studied (Sarkar and Wang, 2020 ). They further performed a kinetic study using two different methods i.e., Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Ozawa–Flynn–Wall (OFW) to obtain the distinct kinetic parameters and their effect on the biochar yield. The experimental results demonstrated that the heating rates exerted a notable influence on the TG curve point, along with the maximum Tm peaks and the decomposition rate of the jute stick biomass. Precisely, variations in heating rates led to shifts in both the peak of TG and the lowest point of the Derivative Thermogravimetry (DTG) curves towards the maximum temperature. The mean activation energy values were determined to be 139.21 kJ/mol and 135.99 kJ/mol according to the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) models, respectively. Along with other applications including the removal of heavy metals and wastewater treatment, jute-derived charcoal is also commonly utilised for energy storage.  Fig. 2  below depicts the outline of the different applications of jute-derived carbon on various waste remediations and energy storage. 5.1.1 Energy storage Energy-related issues forced scientists and researchers to explore new materials that might be applied to energy harvesting and storage technologies. One of the most crucial elements of energy production, transmission, and distribution is storage. The next issue that has to be solved to move towards a larger penetration of renewable energy in the grid is efficient and affordable energy storage in the form of electrochemical, electrical, and hydrogen energy. Devices for electrochemical energy storage have the potential to significantly advance the exploration of sustainable energy. Nanocellulose emerges as a highly promising nanomaterial in the realm of advanced electrochemical energy storage. Given the rapid pace of modern societal development, the escalating need for energy presents a significant challenge, one that is expected to persist into the future. Consequently, there has been substantial focus on the development of sustainable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective energy storage solutions. Electrochemical energy storage devices, including batteries and supercapacitors, have demonstrated remarkable potential in powering various applications such as hybrid electric vehicles, portable electronics, and large-scale energy storage systems (Chen et al., 2018 ). A notable advancement in electrochemistry involves creating solid ionic conductors tailored with optical, mechanical, and electrical properties specifically suited for real-world applications. Solid electrolytes have emerged as promising options for sophisticated electrochemical uses (Shah et al., 2021a ). A high-performance gel polymer electrolyte was derived from environmentally friendly natural lignocellulose for use in lithium-ion batteries (Ren et al., 2020 ). Cellulose is, a linear chain molecular structure composed of continuous glucose units and numerous surface hydroxyl groups, which can undergo chemical modifications to facilitate ion conduction at room temperature, making it suitable for use as an ion-conducting electrolyte (Ye et al., 2023 ). Similarly, hemicellulose and lignin also play crucial roles in the development of solid electrolytes for electrochemical applications. Additionally, jute can serve as an effective and environmentally friendly source in the development of solid electrolytes. Jute sticks and fibres are sustainable, non-toxic green solid supports capable of economically separating or adsorbing nanomaterials from the reaction system (Shah et al., 2021b ). Supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries obtained from the jute stick is mentioned in section 4.3, whereas hydrogen storage and other applications are mentioned below.  5.1.2 Hydrogen storage Hydrogen is seen as a potential energy carrier due to its high energy density per mass, and its utilisation with no greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen energy can be generated using renewable energy sources and is also capable of being stored in huge quantities for extended periods. Among all the emerging technologies, the idea of carbon-based nanomaterials in storing hydrogen appears to be favourable, particularly carbon nanotubes (CNTs), activated carbons and carbon particle systems. Hydrogen has been stored using a variety of methods in its solid, gaseous and liquid phases. The poor storage capacity, inherent flammability, susceptibility to leakage, high cost of the precursors, short life-cycle, and thermodynamics of hydrogen storage via various mediums continue to be major obstacles. Porous AC derived from biomass is frequently employed to address these challenges. After undergoing thermal and chemical treatment, jute sticks can also serve as a hydrogen storage medium. Until now, only a limited number of studies, such as the one conducted by Ramesh et al. (2017) , have explored the use of jute fibres for producing jute-derived activated carbon (JDAC), recognizing it as an ideal material for hydrogen storage. Researchers are currently investigating different methodologies, including solid-state materials, metal hydrides, and chemical storage systems, in order to address these challenges and make progress in the field of hydrogen storage technology. Despite the advancements made so far, additional investigation is required to formulate cost-effective and scalable strategies that can facilitate the extensive implementation of hydrogen as an environmental friendly energy carrier. Given the lignocellulosic composition of jute sticks, there is potential for future exploration of this avenue for the storage of hydrogen gas.  5.1.3 Other application Jute charcoal can also be effectively utilized in wastewater treatment due to its adsorption and filtration properties. Here are some potential applications of jute charcoal in wastewater treatment: Adsorption of contaminants:  Jute charcoal, characterized by its high surface area and porosity, serves as an outstanding adsorbent for diverse contaminants in wastewater, including heavy metals, organic pollutants, dyes, and nutrients like phosphates and nitrates. The porous architecture of jute charcoal enables effective trapping and removal of these pollutants from water through adsorption processes. Some examples of jute as an efficient contaminant removal are as follows. In a study conducted by Asadullah et al. (2010) , jute stick-derived charcoal was examined for its effectiveness in removing brilliant green dye from aqueous solutions. Activated carbons were prepared from jute sticks through a combination of physical activation using steam and chemical activation with ZnCl2 . The results indicated that dye adsorption was significantly higher on chemically activated charcoal (480 mg/g) compared to steam-activated charcoal (182 mg/g). In another study, methylene blue dye was effectively adsorbed with the efficiency of 37.89 mg/g when jute stick powder was employed as a probable cost-effective adsorbent (Nipa et al., 2019 ), whereas 198.86 mg/g adsorption was obtained in case of an experiment conducted by Ghosh et al. (2019) . Aziz et al. (2019)  reported a carboxylated jute stick activated carbon (JSAC) for the active removal of Pb 2+  removal. They were able to successfully remove 99.8 % of Pb 2+  in 15 minutes of the interaction time with an adsorption capacity of > 25.0 mg Pb2+ /g of JSAC-COO− . Additionally, the adsorption studies on Remazol Red (RR) dye on jute stick char were performed to obtain a dye removal rate of 93.12 % at an optimum pH of 1, with an equilibrium time of 120 min and adsorbent dose of 0.6 g (Uddin et al., 2024 ).  5.1.4 Heavy metal removal The unique surface properties of jute charcoal enable the selective adsorption of heavy metals present in wastewater such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. Through its adsorption capacity, jute charcoal contributes to lowering the concentration of these toxic elements to a permissible level. A remarkable example is the removal of Pb2+  ions from water using a low-cost adsorbent. Carboxylated activated carbon derived from jute sticks has been attempted in this process, achieving impressive results with up to 99.8 % removal within a mere 1-hour timeframe (Chowdhury et al., 2022 ).  5.1.5 Pathogen removal The porous structure of jute charcoal possesses the potential to physically trap and immobilize certain pathogens like bacteria and viruses. While jute charcoal is not a replacement for disinfection processes, it can contribute to overall pathogen removal. Silver and carbon, as the common nanoparticles studied for the past years, have been discovered to have wide applications in electronics, medicine, water as a disinfectant, air pollution, and as an antibacterial agent (Saxena et al., 2010 ). In a study conducted by Sherly Arputha Kiruba et al. (2015) , the green synthesis of a biocidal silver-activated charcoal nanocomposite for water disinfection revealed significant findings. The researchers synthesized and applied the produced silver-activated charcoal (Ag-AC) nanocomposite in the fabrication of antimicrobial water filtration columns. The jute-derived antimicrobials from activated char loaded with silver nanocomposite, followed by chemical precipitation exhibited excellent antimicrobial functionality towards gram-negative and positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Staphylococcus aureus . This enhanced antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the activated carbon enhancing the antibacterial properties of the silver nanoparticles. These findings lead to the conclusion that the extremely porous nature and diverse active functional groups of jute-derived char may be crucial for antimicrobials and wastewater treatment applications (Devi et al., 2019 ).  5.1.6 Agricultural application Certainly, due to its high carbon content and nutrient-rich qualities, jute charcoal can be effectively repurposed as a soil amendment after its application in wastewater treatment. This approach not only enhances the sustainability of its usage but also contributes to a circular and environmental friendly utilization of the material.   5.2 Jute stick-based nanocomposites Nanocomposites derived from jute sticks offer a pioneering avenue within sustainable material engineering. The demand for agro waste-based nanocomposites has been steadily increasing in India and worldwide due to their eco-friendly nature, cost-effectiveness and high strength-to-weight ratio (Shahinur et al., 2022 ). Utilising jute sticks as the foundation for nanocomposite synthesis not only addresses waste management but also capitalizes on renewable resources, mitigating the ecological footprint linked with conventional synthetic composites. The carbon content from high levels of hollocellulose and lignin content of jute stick provides the good potential to be used as nanomaterials such as nanocellulose, nanocarbon preparation and nano-lignins. The benefit of such materials could be further extended to a wide range of applications in almost all industries such as biomedical, wastewater treatment, electronics and electrical industry, solar cells, construction, cosmetic, filtration membranes, paper, energy, packaging, building materials, textiles and bioethanol etc. Furthermore, lignin and hemicellulose, which may be extracted from jute sticks, may be used as a reductant or stabilizer to prepare other nanomaterials (Shah et al., 2021b ). The unique properties of these nanomaterials such as high strength, biodegradability, and low cost make them attractive for use in various products. With further research and development, jute stick nanomaterials could revolutionize the way we approach sustainability and innovation in diverse industrial sectors. In a recent investigation, the preparation of submicron/nano carbon derived from jute sticks was explored for its potential as an anticorrosive agent. The process involved advanced methodologies including pyrolysis and high-energy ball milling. The resulting submicron/nano jute carbon was thoroughly characterized and subsequently incorporated into the formulation of high-performance anticorrosive epoxy coatings (Basha et al., 2021 ). Numerous other studies focused on the utilization of jute sticks-based nanoparticles specific to the usage in different sectors is mentioned throughout various sections of this review, highlighting the multifaceted approaches on valorisation. In addition to serving as a direct carbon source for nanomaterial synthesis, jute sticks are employed as a growth substrate for nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the functionality and efficacy of the resulting material. This unique application of jute sticks in nanomaterial synthesis showcases the versatility and eco-friendly nature of this natural resource. In an approach, a green and hydrothermal processing of jute stick was performed to obtain zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoflakes. The jute stick extract was used as growth substrate to produce the ZnO nanomaterials functioning as stabilizing and reducing agents while also boosting the antibacterial activities. Further, the photocatalytic efficacy of the prepared nanofibers (NFs) against methylene blue dye under UV light exposure and their antibacterial properties against E. coli pathogens were studied (Nayem et al., 2022 ). In another study aimed at selectively detecting nitrite (NO2− ) ions, researchers developed a nanocomposite comprising evenly dispersed gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with poly[2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (PMTC) reinforced on jute stick carbon (JC) (designated as AuNPs-PMTC-JC). This fabrication resulted in enhanced hydrophilicity of the submicron/nano jute carbon (JC) and the formation of stable AuNPs within the aqueous dispersion (Sultana et al., 2023 ) Furthermore, Shaikh (2019)  investigated a dip catalyst composed of Pd nanoparticles supported on the inherent surface structure of jute sticks. This catalyst demonstrated remarkable transfer hydrogenation activity under mild conditions in aqueous environments. The naturally occurring cellulosic surface facilitated favourable interactions for the Pd nanoparticles. This Dip catalyst was effectively utilized for the chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of olefins quinoline and several other N-heteroarenes in water, exhibiting outstanding conversion rates and exceptional tolerance towards various organic functional groups using tetrahydroxydiboron THDB. Thus, jute-stick materials (including JNC, nano-lignin, and nanocarbon) can be considered a useful class of futuristic materials due to their physicochemical features. However, despite the abundant availability and remarkable characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass, the extraction of nanocellulose remains a significant challenge. This process typically involves complex pre-treatment strategies, often prolonged and utilizing toxic chemicals, leading to toxic effluent generation. Addressing these challenges requires scientific research to bridge the gap between lab-scale processes and industrial production, ensuring the feasibility of the final materials for market introduction. Furthermore, developments such as the use of hierarchical porous nanocarbon derived from jute sticks, distinguished by a varied distribution of micropores to mesopores, could be considered significant advances in future. By modifying the experimental setup to yield more high-value products, it is expected that additional research on these materials will lead to discoveries in the domains of energy storage, sensors, catalysis, filtration etc.  5.3 Supercapacitor and novel electrode development from recycled jute The rising global energy demand and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have underscored the importance of creating sustainable energy storage solutions. While conventional options like lithium-ion batteries have made progress, concerns persist about resource depletion, high production costs, and complex disposal. To address these issues, researchers are focusing on environmental friendly materials for energy storage advancement. One promising approach is utilizing electrodes from jute stick waste (Shah et al., 2021a ). Despite jute's common use in textiles and packaging, its leftover stick waste, a byproduct of fibre extraction, holds untapped potential for energy storage. Converting this waste into storage electrodes presents an appealing alternative due to its abundance, renewability, and latent benefits. By refining this material through advanced processes, scientists envision creating electrodes that can rival existing technologies, providing a greener and economically viable path for energy storage. This not only addresses waste concerns but also opens doors to efficient and cost-effective energy storage, crucial for transitioning to renewable energy sources. While the arguments above offer a clear rationale, a key question remains: what electrode materials can be derived from jute stick waste? Graphitic carbon, known for its versatility and conductivity, finds uses in energy storage, electronics, and catalysis due to its excellent electrical and thermal properties. Its high electrical conductivity, thermal resilience, and customizable surface chemistry make it ideal for various energy storage technologies like supercapacitors and rapid-charging batteries (Li et al., 2020; Nanaji et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Jute emerges as an ideal source for graphitic carbon because of its high carbon content, where controlled carbonization of residual jute can create graphitic carbon frameworks, addressing waste issues and promoting a circular economy. The jute sticks -derived graphitic carbon boasts unique attributes due to its inherent properties such as a porous structure that provides improved ion diffusion and electrochemical performance that is majorly an issue in the case of commercial carbon sources (Chen et al., 2013, 2020; Shah et al., 2021a ). This graphitic carbon further stands out as a preferred choice for energy storage electrodes due to its unique combination of physical, electrical, and chemical traits that align well with efficient energy storage needs. There are several approached for the processing of jute waste to derive the graphitic carbons. These approaches typically comprise thermal treatments, physical and chemical modifications, or a combination of both techniques followed by catalytic pyrolysis/graphitization, hydrothermal carbonization etc. (Zhang et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ). Thermal methods such as pyrolysis or carbonization involve subjecting jute waste to high temperatures in an inert atmosphere. This process leads to the decomposition of organic components and the creation of carbonaceous materials with graphitic structures. Alternatively, chemical methods may include treatments with acids, bases, or oxidizing agents to eliminate impurities and induce structural alterations in the jute waste. Subsequently, heat treatments lead to the formation of graphitic carbon structures. Recent energy-related product development from graphitic carbon sources utilizing jute sticks as a precursor has been presented in  Table 4 . These approaches offer versatility and enable control over the properties of the resulting graphitic carbons, rendering them suitable for various applications, such as energy storage, catalysis, and environmental remediation. Several studies have indicated the influence of carbonization temperature on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Specific surface area (BET SSA) and yield percentage, revealing that activation temperature played a substantial role in determining the SSA and yield percentage of the resulting activated carbon (Hasan et al., 2011 ). High-temperature carbonization, also referred to as pyrolysis as discussed in the above section represents the prevalent technique for the fabrication of biomass-derived carbon materials and has been used for the production of graphitic carbon (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2024 ). Compared with the physical activation method, high-temperature pyrolysis and the chemical activation method have the advantages of a short reaction time, controllable reaction, high specific surface area, and porosity of the prepared activated carbon, but also have some defects, such as the corrosive nature of the activator, the subsequent need for acid washing for removal, and the cumbersome steps. Till date, no works have been reported so far that have employed the physical activation strategies on jute stick waste. Hence, an entire avenue remains unexplored as this method offers several advantages, including reduced equipment corrosion and environmental friendliness. This can reduce the baseline cost of production of graphitic carbon further reducing the cost of energy storage devices that is enormously increasing in today’s scenario.  5.4 Chemical manufacturing from jute waste and by-products Jute, known for its versatility and eco-friendliness, has long been valued for its role in textiles and packaging materials. However, recent advancements have revealed the untapped potential of jute waste as a valuable feedstock for chemical production. The concept of deriving chemicals from jute waste embodies the principles of circular economy and resource efficiency. By harnessing the various components of jute stick waste, including cellulose, lignin, and other bio-based materials, innovative processes can transform this seemingly overlooked waste into a valuable source of raw materials for diverse chemical applications. From cellulose extraction leading to bioplastics and biofuels to lignin valorisation resulting in adhesives and speciality chemicals, the possibilities are vast. Thus, there is a great chance to concentrate on using jute waste for the production of chemicals in areas like Southeast Asian countries, where jute cultivation is widespread. This strategy offers economic growth and sustainable alternative for certain chemicals to both domestic and international markets. Some of the chemicals extracted from the jute stick are presented below: 5.4.1 Oxalic acid Oxalic acid, an essential organic molecule, is employed as a mordant in the dyeing and printing of fabrics, cleaning of leather, as an ingredient in metal polish, removing rust from iron pipes etc. Both the alkali fusion and nitric acid oxidation methods could produce oxalic acid from jute sticks in a respectable yield. In an experiment conducted by Mathew et al. (1984) , the latter procedure was followed to obtain vanadium as an ideal catalyst for the production of oxalic acid with greater purity. It has also been shown that cuttings, root cuttings, gunny cuttings, thread wastes, and feshwa may all be used to make oxalic acid using the nitric acid procedure (Mathew et al., 1984 ). During the nitric acid process, these materials produced about 58 % of the oxalic acid, and they successfully recovered about 80 % of the processing chemicals. The bench-scale techno-economic evaluation of the nitric acid method suggests that it could be commercially viable. The production of oxalic acid in the alkali fusion process was found utmost (50–55 %) with a NaOH/KOH ratio of 4:1 (in a CO2 -free environment). At a 95 % concentration of HNO3 , the nitric acid fusion process produced oxalic acid from 66 % of cellulose, 64 % of hemicelluloses, and 52 % of lignin. The oxalic acid produced using the alkali fusion method was 82 % pure, while from nitric acid fusion, 95 % pure oxalic acid was produced, suggesting the better efficiency of the nitric acid oxidation process.  5.4.2 Furfural Furfural is a well-known solvent and an intermediary in the manufacture of nylon and pharmaceuticals. It is manufactured commercially using bran, maize cobs, oat hulls, etc. Jute stick is richer in pentosans (20.79 %), which theoretically equates to 12.15 % of recoverable furfural than the majority of other raw materials used to make furfural, with the exception of oat hulls and corncobs. According to reports, utilizing sulfuric acid for the breakdown of jute sticks, more than eighty percent of the theoretical amount of furfural may be produced under ideal circumstances. It is possible to recycle used acid for future use (Khundkar and Islam, 1960 ). By acidic hydrolysis with the use of hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid, furfural may be produced from jute stick chips (Mathew et al., 1984 ). Furfural was produced using a 12 % solution of HCl by distillation at ambient pressure with an 11 % yield. Alternately, furfural was produced with a 10 % yield by steam-distilling jute sticks in a 15 % sulfuric acid solution at air pressure. Only catalytic quantities (1–2 %) of sulfuric acid solution were required to produce furfural when the procedure was carried out under pressure. (Rahman et al., 2022 )  5.4.3 Lignin-based chemicals Lignin, a component of jute and other plant materials, can be extracted and processed into valuable products like lignin-based adhesives, resins, and other materials used in industries such as construction and manufacturing. To make lignin phenol-formaldehyde resins, a lignin-based adhesive, soda lignin was extracted from wasted soda liquor of jute stick pulp. Jute stick particle boards were prepared using the adhesives. It was discovered that jute stick soda lignin may substitute up to 50 % of the phenol in phenol formaldehyde resin. This research was done to demonstrate how inexpensive lignin may take the place of expensive phenol in phenol-formaldehyde resin (Roy et al., 1989 ) In a finding performed by Singh et al., (2020)  high-value platform chemicals, including vanillin, coniferyl alcohol, naphthol, ferulic acid, and catechol, were discovered when lignin was extracted from the alkali wash of processed jute biomass and was analyzed for the presence of lignin monomers using LC-MS. Mota et al., (2016)  have reviewed the recovery of high-value monomeric compounds from the dissociation of lignin in aqueous solutions by liquid-liquid extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, distillation, crystallization, membrane separation, and adsorption. This will facilitate the efficient valorisation of jute biomass for the biorefinery approach.   5.5 Jute waste utilized for mushroom cultivation Apart from its conventional applications in fibre production (Ganguly et al., 2004 ) and the utilization of jute sticks in various industries, there exists an intriguing alternative use for jute residues. Given their richness in cellulose, these residues present an opportunity for cultivating high-value, protein-rich foods, such as mushrooms. This innovative application taps into the cellulose content of jute residues as an ideal substrate for mushroom cultivation. Mushrooms, being adept at breaking down cellulose, can thrive on the nutrient-rich matrix provided by jute residues. This not only offers a sustainable method for recycling jute by-products but also opens up avenues for diversifying agricultural practices and promoting the production of nutritious and protein-packed food sources. Thus, the utilization of jute residues for mushroom cultivation not only aligns with eco-friendly waste management but also contributes to the sustainable production of valuable food resources (Jayaseelan et al., 2024 ). Mushrooms are edible fungi with highly nutritious fruiting bodies thus, they are termed as super foods because of their rich nutritional profile and excellent medicinal properties (Feeney et al., 2014 ). Some of the commonly consumed edible mushrooms across the globe are Agaricus bisporus  (Button mushroom), Lentinus edodes  (shiitake mushroom), Pleurotus  sp. (oyster mushroom), and Flammulina velutipes  (enoki mushroom) (Ho et al., 2020 ). A remarkable attribute of mushrooms are their saprophytic nature, they are capable of growing on any lignocellulosic substrate with a significant amount of organic matter like cellulose and hemicellulose. Mushrooms have the ability to utilise the complex lignocellulosic material by delignifying it through the various ligninolytic enzymes they secrete extracellularly. The delignifying enzymes make the sugars (cellulose and hemicellulose) available for the mushroom to consume for growth and fruiting body production. The health benefits and the ability to cultivate mushrooms out of the low-value lignocellulosic substrate have paved an exclusive space for mushrooms in the food market. The annual mushroom market size is about 50.3 billion USD in 2021–2022 and it is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.7 % in the next ten years globally and at a growth rate of 4.3 % in India (Raman et al., 2018 ) Thus, the lignocellulosic component of jute sticks can potentially be used as substrates for mushroom cultivation. Only scarce work has been reported in this field. Using Jute residues as a substrate for the cultivation of mushrooms like Volvariella volvacea  (paddy straw mushroom), Pleurotus ostreatus ( Oyster mushroom) and P.sajor-caju  have been reported. The attempt of Basak et al. (1996)  points out that among the jute by-products(Jute leaves, jute stick, and jute cuttings) jute cuttings (lower portion of jute stick) gave the best results for the growth of P.sajor-caju  in terms of yield and biological efficiency of 278 g/kg of the substrate and 54.6 % respectively. It was also observed that the jute leaves did not aid in the fruiting body production. To improve the yield and biological efficiency different scientists have attempted to make a combination of Jute resides with other traditional lignocellulosic substrates like rice straw, cotton waste, wheat bran and rice bran as supplements for the growth. A maximum result was observed from the combination of 25 % Jute stick + 75 % cotton waste substrate in the yield of Volvariella volvacea  with 1995 g/kg (Sindhu and Khan, 2002 ). For P. sajor –caju  the maximum yield was observed when Rice straw + Jute stick (1:1) was used (Basak et al., 1996 ). It was observed that the digested jute stick has elevated performance when given as substrate for mushroom cultivation in combination with other substrates like rice straw. From the reports of Banik and Nandi, (2004) , the performance of Rice straw + Jute cuttings bio manure (1:1) gave a maximum of 1200 g/kg of yield with elevated protein content of 33.84 g/100 g and biological efficiency of 120 % with P.sajor-caju.  A consolidated review on jute by-products as a substrate for mushroom cultivation for different mushrooms is given in  Table 5 . The jute by-products for mushroom cultivation still remain unexplored and have a huge scope for researchers to provide a useful solution in converting low-value jute residues into a high-value super food.   6 Challenges in jute waste management The challenges associated with managing jute waste encompass multifaceted aspects that require attention to develop effective and sustainable strategies. The abundance and diversity of waste generated during fibre production present significant hurdles in formulating efficient management and utilization plans. Moreover, utilizing these jute sticks for pulp, chemicals, and polymers, crucial for sustainable alternatives to petrochemicals, faces constraints such as high energy requirements, complex degradation pathways, presence of contaminants, and socio-cultural perceptions (Gontard et al., 2018 ). Despite these challenges, avenues like bio-based material production and enzyme utilization during processing show promise in enhancing economic value generation. Another challenge lies in the limitations of existing technologies for converting agricultural waste into valuable products. Technological feasibility, infrastructural deficiencies and capital requirements, hinder comprehensive adoption and expansion (Bhat et al., 2022 ). In the future, there will be a shift towards employing more efficient and precise biotechnological methods to extract high-value bioproducts from agricultural waste. Integrated nano- and biotechnological techniques are preferred for industrial waste valorisation due to their low energy requirements and cost-effectiveness. Consequently, intensive research, technology dissemination, and collaborative efforts across industrial, academic, and policy sectors are essential to drive tailored innovations addressing these issues. Integrating waste management into economic frameworks presents obstacles, especially with financial burdens for small-scale farmers and rural populations (Tippayawong et al., 2020 ). By offering simple access to recycling facilities, farmers and rural communities may dispose of their waste in an eco-friendly way more readily. This not only aids in diminishing pollution and safeguarding the local ecosystem but also opens up avenues for producing revenue by selling recyclable items. By incorporating waste management into economic structures, small-scale farmers and rural communities can aid in environmental sustainability and economic growth.  7 Role of artificial intelligence and machine learning for jute stick valorization Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a fundamental pillar in nearly every field of research and engineering. Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, utilizes probabilistic and statistical techniques to analyse past experiences and experimental data in order to identify potential solutions. Natural fibres serve as a viable substitute for synthetic fibres such as carbon and glass fibre. Previously, the majority of studies focused on employing an experimental approach to ascertain the characteristics of natural fibres. The study on hybrid fibres, waste valorisation, and ML approach for forecasting mechanical properties was found to be inadequately addressed. However, the advancements in ML have made it easier for biorefinery communities to embrace digitization, hence facilitating the growth of a circular bioeconomy (Sharma et al., 2023b; Tsui et al., 2023 b). AI and ML technologies can open up new avenues for sustainable utilization and resource optimization. Through advanced data analytics and predictive modeling, AI and ML algorithms can analyze various parameters associated with jute waste such as composition, quality, and potential applications. These technologies can enable efficient sorting and classification of jute waste based on specific criteria, facilitating recycling, upcycling and repurposing efforts. Additionally, the incorporation of both tests and computer simulations can decrease the expenses and duration required for material characterization (Chen and Gu. 2019 ). The exponential increase in computational power and the development of more precise codes can also facilitate the application of high-performance computational methods in determining optimal experimental conditions for synthesizing material properties. These calculations produce vast quantities of data, which can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms (Pattnaik et al., 2021, Elango et al., 2020 ) Thus, the future scope of AI and ML in jute waste evaluation is promising, with ongoing research and development focused on enhancing efficiency, scalability, and environmental sustainability. By integrating these advanced technologies into existing waste management practices, the jute industry can achieve significant advancements in sustainability, circularity and resource efficiency, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and resilient future. Furthermore, the role of AI and ML in improving waste management processes will allow for targeted solutions to be implemented and the formation of novel value added products utilizing the waste. Overall, the integration of AI and ML in jute waste evaluation holds immense potential for revolutionizing the industry and paving the way for a greener and more sustainable future.  8 Conclusion Produced annually on a massive scale, jute sticks demand a reconsideration aligning with the principles of a circular economy. Consequently, achieving sustainable growth necessitates the adoption of a cradle-to-cradle approach that focuses on recycling and transforming these bio wastes without causing harm or depletion of natural resources. Jute sticks, for instance, can undergo fundamental transformations via physical, chemical, or biological methods, resulting in a diverse array of end-use products and materials explored in this review. This not only ensures economic upwelling and effective waste management but also mitigates the environmental impact of jute waste. It is also essential to note that the various valorisation process streams explored in this context are rapidly evolving, and their market is subject to constant change based on the processing techniques, time and cost of the process. In addition, the valorisation becomes specific to the requirements and treatment methods, with the markets for the valorised products adapting to these specificities. Accordingly, this review focuses on the conversion methods of the jute stick to various products starting from the traditional approach of pulp and paper production from jute stick to various novel processes including the bioenergy sector, cellulose and chemical production to environmental remediation, energy storage material like supercapacitor, battery material processing and mushroom production utilizing this natural resource. However, many of these studies are still in the early stages and require thorough analysis of both technical and socio-ecological aspects, including costs, toxicity, energy balance, environmental emissions, and biodegradability issues. This comprehensive approach is also essential for advancing the capabilities of local producers to generate income by utilizing and selling jute sticks. Moreover, the amalgamation of AI-ML studies will add on a promising avenue to improve the optimization of processes focused on anticipating the optimal output based on jute stick processing. By integrating AI-ML advancements into ongoing research and development efforts, customized waste management methods will be developed that will help in troubleshooting the problem faced during transition of waste valorization from laboratory-scale to industrial-scale applications, resulting in cost advantage and maximum output. Future research is undoubtedly needed to facilitate widespread applications, involving rigorous quality control and modern techniques to maximize the targeted product while ensuring the consistent final properties of the converted materials, all achieved with minimal input and striving for maximum returns. Thus, this approach is pivotal for the sustainable and effective utilization of jute sticks across various industries and sectors.
