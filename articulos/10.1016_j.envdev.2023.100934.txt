                  The importance of Green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has rarely been argued. To the best of the author's knowledge, no attempt has been made to investigate the influence of GSCM practices on SDGs, particularly in the mining sector of a developing country like Jordan. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to examine the influence of five main GSCM practices on SDGs related to the environment and community aspects. A structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data from Jordanian mining firms, and 362 responses were analyzed. The study model was tested using a partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The results demonstrate that all GSCM practices except green purchasing and investment recovery have a positive impact on community practices, and all practices except green purchasing have a positive impact on environmental practices. This study adds to a growing body of literature questioning the role of GSCM to the SDGs. Furthermore, policymakers in the mining sector will have a better understanding of the most influential GSCM practices that will assist them in attaining the SDGs.

The impact of green supply chain management practices on sustainable development goals: The case of mining sector in Jordan Luay Jum'a Project administration Conceptualization Methodology Software Data curation Writing – original draft Visualization Investigation Software Validation Writing – review & editing  Department of Logistics Sciences, Business School, German Jordanian University, Amman, 11180, Jordan Department of Logistics Sciences Business School German Jordanian University Amman 11180 Jordan  Department of Logistics Sciences, Business School, German Jordanian University, Amman, 11180, Jordan      The importance of Green supply chain management (GSCM) practices in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has rarely been argued. To the best of the author's knowledge, no attempt has been made to investigate the influence of GSCM practices on SDGs, particularly in the mining sector of a developing country like Jordan. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to examine the influence of five main GSCM practices on SDGs related to the environment and community aspects. A structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data from Jordanian mining firms, and 362 responses were analyzed. The study model was tested using a partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The results demonstrate that all GSCM practices except green purchasing and investment recovery have a positive impact on community practices, and all practices except green purchasing have a positive impact on environmental practices. This study adds to a growing body of literature questioning the role of GSCM to the SDGs. Furthermore, policymakers in the mining sector will have a better understanding of the most influential GSCM practices that will assist them in attaining the SDGs.

Economists stated that Jordan's GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021 implies that the national economy has begun to recover from the pandemic's ramifications. According to the department of statistics, the extractive industries sector grew at a rapid rate of 5.4% (Jordan Times, 2021 ). Mining contributed 3.78 percent of GDP by 2021 (Trading Economics, 2021 ), but when combined with its related manufactured items (e.g., fertilizers), it might contribute up to 9 percent (Al Rawashdeh et al., 2016 ). The importance of environmentally and socially sustainable practices and activities is being emphasized all over the world (Muduli et al., 2021 ). The term sustainable development refers to the desire to make growth sustainable in the sense that it meets present demands without risking the ability of future generations to meet their own (Robert et al., 2005 ; Jum'a et al., 2021 ). Sustainable development is now a must, and policymakers should strongly consider collaborating with the private sector to develop policies that benefit and conserve the environment (Muduli and Barve, 2015 ). Sustainable development ideas today are more relevant than they were two decades ago, because they now extend beyond purely environmental, fiscal, and social growth issues, affecting people's very survival (Kumi et al., 2014 ). The value of sustainable development can be seen in the fact that the United Nations has issued a new plan, known as the sustainable development goals (SDGs), for all countries to follow until 2030 (Zubair and Khan, 2019 ). Jordan is ranked 72nd in the world and sixth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in SDGs index report. Jordan continues to confront significant challenges in achieving numerous SDGs (United Nations, 2021 ). The SDGs established a framework for all nations' long-term development that prioritized economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental conservation (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). There are 17 SDGs that were established by the United Nations to provide a comprehensive mechanism for planning and guiding government policy, as well as involving the public in sustainability (Bain et al., 2019 ). Because of their importance in global prosperity and human well-being, achieving SDGs has become one of the world's most important goals (Ilyas et al., 2020 ). For example, in Jordan APC Company was accused of major labor abuses against its employees by a local Jordanian voluntary organization. According to the story, there has been discrimination against company workers with regard to pay and promotions, which has a negative impact on working conditions. Moreover, the company utilized union-busting strategies to reduce the area and restrict freedom of association. Additionally, according to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, 2020 , the company has been intimidating and threatening workers' representatives in an effort to stop them from engaging in union activities. However, in order to improve communication and cooperation between the APC Company and the union and to resolve any potential future disputes through the use of labor law provisions, the APC and the Union of Mining Workers came to an agreement. The General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions presided over the signing of the contract (Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, 2020 ). Recently, Lafarge, an industrial cement company, had to close the Alfuhais cement facility in Jordan because of environmental infractions, including CO2 emissions and dust discharge that polluted the air. Additionally, after losing a case filed by the neighborhood's residents in a Jordanian court, the company was compelled to pay JOD 45 million in financial compensation to the residents of the area. Lafarge Jordan was forced to lay off 200 employees as a result of mounting losses in order to maintain operations in Jordan (Yosef et al., 2023 ). These examples highlight the need to investigate GSCM measures in addition to SDG practices for the mining industry that are related to the community and the environment (Muduli and Barve, 2015 ; Muduli et al., 2020 ; Yosef et al., 2023 ). As can be observed there are adverse consequences that affect mining companies as a result of failing to comply with SDGs relating to the environment and community. These unfavorable consequences might have an impact on the company by compelling it to provide financial compensation to the impacted people, damaging the firm's reputation, leading to decreased product sales as well as the company's market share. As a result, firms in this sector are keen to make an attempt to be considerate of the environment. Therefore, they are concerned with transforming their operations green in order to lessen their negative effects on the community and the environment, even though this may necessitate financial investment. This can be accomplished by integrating GSCM with related community and environmental SDGs in order to mitigate the harm that could result from noncompliance with sustainability. Therefore, environmental scientists and activists contend that the sustainability of the world environment is declining and that large-scale disasters and temperature changes are signs of the global warming phenomena (Zubair and Khan, 2019 ; Muduli et al., 2021 ). Environmental issues including resource scarcity, deforestation, global warming, and a loss of biological diversity cause the ecological equilibrium to deteriorate (Çankaya and Sezen, 2019 ). Accordingly, the environmental issues as well as government globalization strategies, have compelled many industrial companies to move toward unique activities that aid in the incorporation of sustainability (Mathivathanan et al., 2018 ; Sharma et al., 2022 ). To attain sustainability many organizations around the world have implemented green supply chain management (GSCM) activities to improve their competitiveness in the global market over the last decade (Dubey et al., 2017 ; Jum'a et al., 2022 ). GSCM activities increase economic efficiency and corporate productivity while reducing environmental effects (Khan and Qianli, 2017 ). Therefore, GSCM has arisen as a pragmatic strategy for enhancing the environmental value of operations and goods in compliance with regulatory requirements (Hsu and Hu, 2008 ; Muduli et al., 2021 ). GSCM activities have become important and one of the most effective sustainability practices among professionals, academics, NGOs, and businesses as a result of increasing global environmental consciousness (Habib et al., 2021 ). Accordingly, GSCM has received a lot of interest in the industry over the last three decades. GSCM practices can be defined as green activities that range from product design to procurement, manufacturing, shipping, and product recovery, with the goal of reducing, reusing, and recycling assets and energy to lessen environmental effects (Habib et al., 2020 ; Masudin et al., 2018 ; Muduli et al., 2020 ). Various measurements have been discovered in the prior study as GSCM practice. Internal environmental management, eco-design, green procurement, consumer compliance with environmental concerns, and investment recovery were all investigated as GSCM activities by Zhu et al. (2007) . Many businesses today prioritize sustainability goals and partake in GSCM practices such as eco-design, organic procurement, recycling, and re-manufacturing (Al-Sheyadi et al., 2019 ). Despite the increased attention paid to GSCM practices, the number of studies examining the impact of green initiatives on sustainability and SDGs remains limited Alawneh et al. (2018) ; Centobelli et al. (2020) ; Chams and García-Blandón (2019) ; Green et al. (2019) ; Ilyas et al. (2020) ; Jawaad and Zafar (2020) ; Khoshnava et al. (2019) ; Zubair and Khan (2019) . Furthermore, the majority of studies looked at the impact of GSCM on environmental practices and performance; however, this study looks at the impact of GSCM practices on the environment and community practices that are connected with UN SDGs. Another aspect worth noting is that this study concentrated on one of the industrial sectors, the mining sector, in the context of a developing country. This is a crucial point to consider because mining practices in Jordan differ from those in developed countries. As a result, this paper fills the gap in the literature and highlights the need for further research in this topic, particularly in Jordan's mining sector. Therefore, this study tried to find the answer to the following questions.• What is the impact of GSCM on environment practices related to SDGs in the mining sector in Jordan?  • What is the impact of GSCM on community practices related to SDGs in the mining sector in Jordan?  • What are GSCM practices need to be improved in the mining sector in Jordan?    Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the impact of GSCM practices on SDGs where GSCM activities include internal environmental management, eco-design, green buying, customer collaboration, and investment recovery (Sahoo and Vijayvargy, 2021 ). Then, as proposed by Ilyas et al. (2020) , the influence of GSCM practices on the environment and community SDGs was examined. This paper is organized into several parts. First, a review of related literature is conducted, followed by the formulation of hypotheses and the development of a conceptual model. The research methodologies are next evaluated, including sampling, data collection, study measurement, and data interpretation procedures. The study's discussion section gives a simple review of current observations and their application to prior studies. A conclusion is reached at the end of the study, followed by managerial implications and study limitations.  2 Literature review 2.1 Significance of mining sector & GSCM practices The mining and extraction sub-sector is recognized as one of Jordan's most important strategic sectors. It also makes a significant contribution to the employment of Jordanians and other nationalities. Furthermore, extraction is regarded as one of the country's key exports, in addition to meeting the raw material needs of the local market (Jordan Investment Commission, 2017 ). Jordan was considered as a major provider of bromine, phosphate rock and phosphate-based fertilizers, and potash to the rest of the globe. It was one of the top ten producers of bromine, phosphate rock, and potash in the world. It also manufactured small amounts of calcium carbonate, cement, clay, crude oil, iron and steel, kaolin, limestone, natural gas, pozzolanic materials, refined petroleum products, silica sand, and zeolites, primarily for domestic use (Jordan Investment Commission, 2017 ). While mining sector is significant to the economy of the country, concerns about environmental sustainability in the industry have been extensively addressed in the last few decades throughout GSCM. GSCM which integrates environmental philosophy, supply chain management, and operational practices, can be described as a company's various coordinated attempts to reduce its influence on the daily environment over a product's entire life cycle, including sourcing and selection, design process, manufacturing, finished product delivery, and end-of-life product administration (Perotti et al., 2012 ; Alkalha et al., 2022 ; Jum'a et al., 2022 ). It also can be referred to as a "collection of managerial practices that syndicates environmental issues with SCM to ensure environmental obedience and support the environmental competence of the entire supply chain" (Chu et al., 2017 ). There are several perspectives on how to determine which dimensions must be considered when using GSCM. Internal environmental management, green sourcing, client relationship management, and eco-design are some of the technical and organizational business techniques that Lee et al. (2012)  claim should be used in GSCM practices. According to the study of Green et al. (2012) , GSCM practices should include internal environmental protection, green information exchange systems, green sourcing, eco-design, and investment recovery. In the same context of GSCM practices, Sahoo and Vijayvargy (2020)  used Zhu et al. (2013) 's definition that proposes five practices classified into two groups. The internal GSCM practices include internal environmental management (IEM) and eco-design (ED), which can be applied and handled by a single manufacturer and the external GSCM practices include green purchasing (GP), consumer cooperation (CC), and investment recovery (IR), which includes collaboration with supply chain partners. As a consequence, we also considered that IEM, GP, CC, ED, and IR should be included in GSCM practices in this study. IEM is a term used to describe GSCM programs in activities that include top-level decisions, middle-level assistance for effective execution, and cross-departmental coordination (Vanalle et al., 2017 ; Muduli et al., 2020 ). IEM "refers to a company's creation of its environmental management sustainability measures and goals to ensure environmental protection (Green et al., 2012 ). The firm manager is the driving force behind developing plans and priorities to implement green policies, standardizing processes to reduce risk, and developing an evaluation framework to track environmental impacts (Vijayvargy et al., 2017 ). GP focuses on collaborating with manufacturers to produce environmentally friendly products (Sahoo and Vijayvargy, 2020 ). GP's goal is to make sure that purchased goods and resources follow the buying firm's environmental goals, such as eliminating waste sources, promoting recycling, reuse, and resource replacement (Habib et al., 2020 ). CC activities include customer service and sustainability training for environmentally friendly designs, green manufacturing, and green packaging (Sahoo and Vijayvargy, 2020 ). Customers are the primary motivator for supplier firms to embrace and enforce GSCM practices (Muduli and Barve, 2015 ; Susanty et al., 2019 ). The term ED is the process of designing and developing an environmentally sustainable product to reduce the environmental effects by product lifespan review (Al-Ghwayeen and Abdallah, 2018 ). The financial gain for a business derived from the disposal of surplus resources, scrap, and used materials, as well as excess capital goods resulting from equipment replacement are referred to as "recovery of investment" (Zhu et al., 2007 ).  2.2 Difference in mining practices between developed and developing countries Mining practices differ in a variety of ways between developed and developing countries. Some of the most significant variations including regulations, technology, investment, and the magnitude of mining practices impact on environment and community. Mining activities are subject to more challenging regulations in developed countries than in developing countries. This is because of a number of issues taken into consideration, such as the need to protect worker health and safety and the environment (Dashwood, 2014 ; Wang & Song, 2021 ; Sharma et al., 2022 ). As for the technology, the access to more sophisticated and advanced mining technologies is more common in developed countries than in developing countries. Therefore, mining activities may move towards being more efficient and friendly to the environment (Cuervo-Cazurra and Genc, 2008 ; Ruiz-del-Solar et al., 2016 ; Ba and Jacquet, 2022 ). Moreover, developed countries often draw more capital into the mining industry than developing nations. This is caused by a variety of elements, such as the financial position, the political stability of the country, and the perceived amount of risk put in the investment (Cuervo-Cazurra and Genc, 2008 ; Campbell, 2012 ; Nasih et al., 2019 ). Finally, GSCM mining practices can have a huge negative impact on society and the environment in both wealthy and poor nations. However, because of a number of circumstances, such as a lack of infrastructure, resources, and awareness of the possible effects, the impact is frequently greater in developing countries since there are not much compliance to social and environment standards as much as developed countries (Frederiksen, 2019 ). Overall, when compared to mining processes and GSCM practices in developing countries, developed countries mining practices are more regulated, technologically advanced, and attract more investment. However, when compared to developing countries, the implementation of these practices has a smaller impact in developing countries.  2.3 SDGs The definition of sustainable development originated historically in the sense of environmental issues, as shown by the term's first appearance in the World Charter for Nature (Hák et al., 2016 ). Sustainable development was defined as the "ability to make development sustainable in such a way that it meets current needs without jeopardizing future generations' ability to meet their own needs (WCED, 1987 )." For the purposes of this study, sustainable development is described as a process of transforming natural resources without destroying them in such a manner that future generations may continue to use them for development, such as contributing to economic, social, and environmental cohesion (Cohen, 2017 ). Sustainable development reduces the risks that businesses confront, but it also has the potential to reduce the effect on the environment and society (Yu et al., 2020 ). Sustainable development encompasses several objectives that come together to form the three pillars (3Ps), or environmental, economic, and social pillars (Khoshnava et al., 2019 ). The convergence and maximization of the 3Ps aims would result in long-term development and make sustainability easier to achieve (Adams, 2006 ; Yosef et al., 2023 ). The 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which was accepted by all UN countries in 2015, is a vision for stability and people's well-being and the world now and in the future. It is a strategy for people and the environment that focuses on environmental challenges and degradation caused by human activities (McCrone et al., 2017 ). This 2030 agenda for sustainable development is based on the millennium development goals (MDGs), but it supports a new era of global sustainable development, particularly with the commitment to address global development challenges and create conditions that allow developing countries to play a key role in global development (Yu et al., 2020 ). The SDGs went into force in January 2016 (Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ). The agenda's relevant materials currently include 17 goals, 169 targets, and 303 indicators. Goals 1–6 draw on the MDGs' central agenda, while goals 7–17 explore new territory (UNSD, 2014 ). In brief, the SDGs' main goal aims to promote a new vision and create the foundation for a plan to eradicate poverty without putting substantial strain on the world's life support systems (Assembly, 2015 ). It embodies the global plan for social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and economic progress (Khoshnava et al., 2019 ). The SDGs outlined in this report are based on environmental and community practices (Ilyas et al., 2020 ). Environmental practices refer to the environmental sustainability pillar where community practices refer to the social sustainability pillar. Environmental practices are activities carried out by businesses to reduce the environmental effect of their operations, goods, and services (Uhlaner et al., 2012 ). Managers, stockholders, and workers should be informed about the importance of environmental practices to attain SDGs. Khoshnava et al. (2019)  in his study, observed goals that reflect environmental dimensions of sustainability, and they are as follows: “SDGEn1 (Sustainable cities & communities), SDGEn2 (Responsible consumption & production), SDGEn3 (Climate Action), SDGEn4 (Life below water), and SDGEn5 (Life above water) (Life on land)”. On the other hand, as community practice reflects the social dimension of sustainability so we may call it sustainable communities. Places where people desire to live and work, today and in the future, is how sustainable communities are described (Dempsey et al., 2011 ). They meet the diverse needs of present and future residents, are environmentally conscious, and contribute to a high standard of living. “SDGSo1 (Quality Education), SDGSo2 (Gender Equality), SDGSo3 (Reduce Inequalities), SDGSo4 (Peace, Justice, & strong institutions), and SDGSo5 (Partnership for the goals)” indicated by Khoshnava et al. (2019) , are the goals that define the social sustainability dimension of SDGs. Because of their importance in global growth and human well-being, achieving SDGs has become one of the world's most important goals (Ilyas et al., 2020 ).  2.4 GSCM practices towards environment practices of SDGs GSCM practices namely IEM, GP, CC, ED, and IR all ensure environment practice within the organization. Internal environmental management involves environmental practices such as upper- and mid-level management support, inter-departmental collaboration for environmental initiatives, and the development of an environmental management system (Zhu et al., 2005 ; Muduli et al., 2020 ). Several studies such as De Giovanni and Vinzi (2012)  and Zhu and Sarkis (2004) , have indicated that internal approaches of green supply chain management are favourably connected with environmental performance. Thus, it ensures the environmental practices of SDGs. Green purchasing strives to guarantee that acquired items and materials satisfy the buying firm's environmental objectives, such as decreasing waste sources, boosting recycling, reusing (Habib et al., 2020 ). Customer participation allows businesses to better respond to consumers' GSCM concerns and to collaborate on sustainable product creation and used product recycling (Li et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, it may improve a company's image by sharing green expertise with partners and offering technical assistance and training support, which might lead to new commercial prospects (Luthra et al., 2016 ). Eco-design defines that manufacturers must design goods that use the least amount of materials and resources, allow for the reuse, recycling, and recovery of core materials and components, as well as the elimination or reduction of toxic materials throughout the production process (Sahoo and Vijayvargy, 2020 ). Many researchers regard eco-design as a GSCM practice that considers environmental factors from product conception to usage and eventually disposal (Vanalle et al., 2017 ; Zhu et al., 2007 ; Yosef et al., 2023 ). As the designers' focus will be on lowering the design's environmental effect, eco-friendly design and a concentration on investment recovery will have a direct and beneficial impact on environmental performance. Luthra et al. (2015)  stated in their study that business operations and strategic posture have a considerable impact on environmental and sustainability practices. As a result, managers should first support green practices, which can then boost SDGs. As a result of the preceding discussion, the following hypotheses are formulated.Hypothesis H1 Internal environmental management positively influences environment practices  Hypothesis H2 Green purchasing positively influences environment practices  Hypothesis H3 Cooperation with customers positively influences environment practices  Hypothesis H4 Eco-design positively influences environment practices  Hypothesis H5 Investment recovery positively influences environment practices.    2.5 GSCM practices towards community practices of SDGs GSCM approaches have become vital and one of the most successful sustainability methods among practitioners, scholars, and companies as a result of increased worldwide environmental consciousness (Lin et al., 2019 ). The reason for promoting GSCM practices is because they have a considerable impact on sustainable management and environmental performance (Çankaya and Sezen, 2019 ). Green supply chains guarantee that all of a company's productive resources are utilized in a sustainable manner (Bhool and Narwal, 2013 ; Yosef et al., 2023 ). GSCM seeks to improve the social performance of the supply chain of the enterprises (Wang and Dai, 2018 ). Das (2018)  stated that social performance is reflected in bettering community employment and business prospects. The implementation of GSCM or the use of environmentally friendly and less polluting manufacturing processes has a substantial beneficial impact on the social indices of employees, community, and society (Jabbour and de Sousa Jabbour, 2016 ). As Cervellon and Wernerfelt (2012)  point out that communities are becoming more environmentally conscious, and members are eager to share knowledge about green manufacturing, supply chain practices, distribution, and recycling techniques, and re-use of resources. So, before focusing on environmental consequences, industries must encourage green practices. Managers that are interested in achieving high performance in the areas of the environment, society, and community must restructure their approaches concerning the environment. Top managers participate in green practices initially, according to a few studies, such as Sarvaiya et al. (2018) , Burki et al. (2019) , and Ankaya & Sezen (2019), which then affect environmental and community activities. Ilyas et al. (2020)  found in their study that top management support has a strong effect on GSCM, environment, and community-based SDGs. As a result of the above discussion, the following hypotheses have been proposed.Hypothesis H6 Internal environmental management positively influences community practices  Hypothesis H7 Green purchasing positively influences community practices  Hypothesis H8 Cooperation with customers positively influences community practices  Hypothesis H9 Eco-design positively influences community practices  Hypothesis H10 Investment recovery positively influences community practices    2.6 Conceptual framework As can be seen, the mining industry faces multiple social and environmental concerns, and there is a rising need to analyze its sustainability practices. However, there is a lack of studies addressing GSCM practices in this sector in relation to the SDGs, especially in developing countries like Jordan. Therefore, based on the aforementioned discussion, the following conceptual framework has been proposed as shown in Fig. 1  .   3 Methodology 3.1 Sampling process and data collection This study applies a primary data collection approach to collect data from Jordanian mining firms, which were the target population of the research. Convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling approach that can help with inferences about the population (Malhotra, 2010 ), was utilized and the data were analyzed using a quantitative approach. A structured questionnaire was distributed online among employees working in different management roles of the mining firms in Jordan. To determine the sample size of the study, the guidelines proposed by Hair et al. (2019) , who recommended using a larger sample size such as 200 or more, were followed. A total of 362 responses were received during the data collection phase from June to September 2021.  3.2 Developing the measurement instrument All the measurement items used in this study were adopted from past studies where the items were found to be valid and reliable as shown in Table 1  . The items related to the sub-components of GSCM including IEM, GP, CC, ED, and IR were adopted from Sahoo and Vijayvargy (2021) . The items related to the sub-components of SDGs including environment practices and community practices were adopted from Ilyas et al. (2020) . The questionnaire was divided into two parts where demographic variables were included first followed by the measurement items of the study variables. The GSCM practices were measured using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (no consideration) to 5 (actively practicing). Finally, SDGs practices were measured using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).   4 Results This section included an analysis of the survey data (n = 362) using a statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25 and SmartPLS version 3. The analyses included descriptive analysis, multicollinearity detection, convergent and discriminant validity assessment through measurement model analysis and hypothesis testing through structural model analysis. 4.1 Descriptive statistics As illustrated in Table 2  , Preliminary data analysis was performed with descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and standard error. The results showed that eco-design had the highest mean score (M = 4.1860, SD = 1.04017). On the other hand, green purchasing had the lowest mean score (M = 2.2193, SD = 0.94875).  4.2 Assessment of multicollinearity High collinearity among the independent constructs may affect the results obtained from the structural model analysis. The common ways such as variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance values were utilized to identify such problem. As recommended by Hair et al. (2019) , the minimum and maximum threshold level of tolerance and VIF are 0.10 and 5 respectively. Table 3   demonstrated that the data of the study had no such multicollinearity.  4.3 Structural equation modelling and hypothesis testing The measurement model was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis by observing that all the measurement items loaded on their respective latent variables and all the latent variables met the acceptable threshold levels on factor loadings, Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability, average variance extracted (AVE). The results in Table 4   showed that all the values of factor loadings, Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability were above the recommended threshold level (>0.70) suggested by Hair et al. (2019) . Finally, the values of AVE were also above 0.50 and thus, adequate measurement model validity and reliability have been established for further analyses. Fornell-Larcker criterion was used to see whether the constructs had discriminant validity and were not similar to each other. As shown in Table 5  , the diagonal elements represented the square root of AVE where the other elements represented the correlation coefficients among the constructs. Results suggested the presence of discriminant validity as the correlation among the constructs were less than the square root of the AVE of the constructs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ). Structural model analysis showed results of hypothesis testing and the significance of the relationship among the latent constructs. The bootstrapping was run with a subsample of 1000 to estimate the model parameters (Ringle et al., 2015 ). As shown in Fig. 2  , the r square values showed that all the GSCM practices explained 36.4% and 39.9% variation in community practices and environment practices respectively. Table 6   illustrated path coefficients (β), t statistics and p values obtained from the structural model. The results demonstrated that all the GSCM practices except green purchasing and investment recovery significantly and positively influenced community practices. Moreover, all the GSCM practices except green purchasing significantly and positively influenced environment practices. Thus, there was enough evidence to support the hypotheses H1, H3, H4, H5, H6, H8 and H9. Among all the path coefficients, eco-design had the largest effects on community practices (β = 0.295) and environment practices (β = 0.298).   5 Discussion The study aims to examine the influence of green supply chain management practices on two aspects of SDGs namely environment and community aspects. Past studies also worked on the interrelationship between GSCM and SDGs (Ilyas et al., 2020 ), however, they did not look at a specific relationship between each practice of GSCM and SDGs. Therefore, this study reveals the results regarding the effects of each practice of GSCM and significant practices that drive SDGs. This study shows that not all practices of GSCM are equally important for achieving SDGs. Environment practices are positively influenced by all the GSCM practices except green purchasing. Moreover, community practices are positively influenced by all the GSCM practices except green purchasing and investment recovery. Fig. 3   shows the most significant practices of GSCM that improve the environment and community practices of SDGs in the mining sector. As shown in Fig. 3 , eco-design has the highest effect on environment practice (beta = 0.298) followed by internal environmental management (beta = 0.226), cooperation with customers (beta = 0.192) and investment recovery (beta = 0.119). However, green purchasing does not have any significant influence on environment practices (beta = −0.045). Moreover, eco-design has the highest effect on community practice (beta = 0.295), on the other hand, green purchasing has the lowest effect on community practice (beta = 0.033) which is also insignificant. The other effects are internal environmental management (beta = 0.250) followed by cooperation with customers (beta = 0.162) and an insignificant effect of investment recovery (beta = 0.075). As indicated in Fig. 4  , since they have low mean scores in this study, Jordanian firms in the mining sector should prioritize improving the following GSCM practices, including green purchasing and investment recovery. A second priority for GSCM practices is customer cooperation and internal environment management, as the mean scores of respondents indicated acceptable implementation in the mining sector. Finally, firms in Jordan must maintain and, if feasible, raise the degree of implementation for eco-design aspects, as the mean score indicates a high level of implementation. The results of the study are consistent with the past studies as well. Ilyas et al. (2020)  found that GSCM had both significant direct and partial mediating effects on the environment and community practices of SDGs. The significant and positive contribution of water and energy efficiency in green buildings was also found to assist in achieving SDGs in Jordan (Alawneh et al., 2018 ). Centobelli et al. (2020)  noted that important roles are played by several policies related to the adoption of innovative technologies and green practices to help supply chain and companies attain SDGs. Studies also proposed that attaining SDGs require the development of innovative economic practices and policies such as the green economy (Khoshnava et al., 2019 ). Several benefits such as grey economy, human well-being, and social equity, reduction of environmental and ecological risks can be driven by implementing sustainable development along with a green economy (Khoshnava et al., 2019 ). Previous studies also identified the link between different environment-friendly and green initiatives (e.g., green human resources management) for the fulfilment of SDGs (Chams and García-Blandón, 2019 ; Zubair and Khan, 2019 ). This study will guide the practitioners regarding the relative importance of each item within the study variables. The results indicate that three practices such as internal environmental management, cooperation with customers and eco-design influence both environment and community practice. The results showed that total quality environmental management in “internal environmental management” explains the highest variation (factor loading = 0.929) compared to other measurement items. It suggests that quality management practices that comprise environmental issues should be given priority to successfully implement internal environmental management programs in the organization. In the “cooperation with customers” construct, the issue to cooperate with customers for green packaging, explains the highest variation (factor loading = 0.976). The highest variation (factor loading = 0.950) in the construct “eco-design” is explained by the issue of design of products for reduced consumption of material/energy. Besides, investment recovery only affects the environment aspect of SDGs where the sale of scrap and used materials (factor loading = 0.972) should be given priorities to recover the investment sufficiently. The results also show that green purchasing does not affect any of the aspects of SDGs. The issue of second-tier supplier environmentally friendly practice evaluation in “green purchasing” explains the highest variation (factor loading = 0.933) compared to other measurement items. The results suggest that evaluation of environmentally friendly practice with suppliers who are not immediate to the firms is also important for ensuring green purchasing. Finally, the issue of consulting stakeholders for environment-related decisions in “environment practices” (factor loading = 0.933) and the issue of favoring local suppliers in the “community practices” (factor loading = 0.944) had the largest factor loadings. Managers should prioritize consulting with stakeholders (e.g. employees, suppliers, clients, creditors, etc.) for environment-related decisions. Managers also need to favor local suppliers for addressing sustainability in the community in the mining sector.  6 Conclusion This study concludes that the three most important principles of GSCM including internal environmental management, cooperation with customers and eco-design sufficiently improve the performance of companies to attain both the environment and community goals of SDGs in the mining sector. However, green purchasing is not found to significantly contribute to both the environment and community goals of SDGs. Finally, investment recovery is important for environment goals but not for community goals. This study has both theoretical and practical implications. First of all, this study provides empirical support on the relationship between GSCM practices and two aspects of SDGs such as environment and community practices in the mining sector. Second, the study can be utilized in other contexts such as in other industries and counties to see similarities and disparities with the current research findings. Third, the findings of the study will assist the practitioners in prioritizing GSCM practices while implementing SDGs. Eco-design had the largest effect on environment practices followed by internal environmental management, cooperation with customers and investment recovery. Besides, community practices are mostly influenced by eco-design followed by internal environmental management, and cooperation with customers. This suggests that eco-design is the most significant practice of GSCM that improve both environment and community practices. On the other hand, green purchasing is a less important GSCM practice for both environment and community practices. Managers, thus, should make priorities among the practices of GSCM for an effective and efficient decision regarding SDGs implementation. Forth, under the eco-design dimension which is the most significant practice found in this study, the design of products for reduced consumption of material/energy is the item with the highest factor loading. The findings suggest that managers should be careful about material/energy consumption which a crucial issue and should be addressed by the supply chain managers to ensure eco-design practices. Finally, there are other goals of sustainable development which are not addressed in the present study. Thus, further studies need to be undertaken to investigate the relationship between GSCM practices and other SDGs. Despite these contributions, this study has some limitations. First of all, non-probability sampling was followed while collecting the data and thus, future studies should apply probability sampling techniques to improve the generalizability of the statistical findings. Second, this study is limited to the Jordan mining context. Similar studies can be applied in different countries to get comparable findings among various countries. Moreover, future studies may focus on behavioral factors associated with GCSM adoption that can improve its implementation. Finally, this study did not incorporate any moderator or mediator variables within the model, therefore, further studies with moderator or mediator variables should be undertaken in future for deepening the understanding of the current study.
