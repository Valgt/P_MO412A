                  Sustainable farming on ever-shrinking agricultural land and declining water resources for the growing human population is one of the greatest environmental and food security challenges of the 21st century. Conventional, age-old organic farming practices alone, and foods based on costly cellular agriculture, do not have the potential to be upscaled to meet the food supply challenges for feeding large populations. Additionally, agricultural practices relying on chemical inputs have a well-documented detrimental impact on human health and the environment. As the available farming methods have reached their productivity limits, new approaches to agriculture, combining friendly, age-old farming practices with modern technologies that exclude chemical interventions, are necessary to address the food production challenges. Growing genetically modified (GM) crops without chemical inputs can allow agricultural intensification with reduced adverse health and environmental impacts. Additionally, integrating high-value pleiotropic genes in their genetic improvement coupled with the use of modern agricultural technologies, like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), will further improve productivity. Such ‘organic-GM’ crops will offer consumers healthy, agrochemical-free GM produce. We believe these agricultural practices will lead to the beginning of a potentially new chemical-free GM agricultural revolution in the era of Agriculture 4.0 and help meet the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, given the advancement in the genome editing (GE) toolbox, we ought to develop a new category of ‘trait-reversible GM crops’ to avert the fears of those who believe in ecological damage by GM crops. Thus, in this article, we advocate farming with no or minimal chemical use by combining chemical-free organic farming with the existing biofortified and multiple stress tolerant GM crops, while focusing on the development of novel ‘biofertilizer-responsive GE crops’ and ‘trait-reversible GE crops’ for the future.

AFB    Fig. 1 The available food options and their main characteristics; Animal-based nutrition is not sustainable as, among other things, it harms the environment due to air, water and soil pollution, causes competition for pastureland, and adversely affects biodiversity. Microbial-based nutrition cannot meet the growing nutritional demands owing to limited production and less public acceptance. Plant-based nutrition, while helping in the sequestration of greenhouse gases and providing fodder for animals, is a more affordable and primary source of human nutrition and a contributor to the food industry.  Fig. 1   Fig. 2 Key traditional and modern genetic modification/improvement methods: Genetic modification has traditionally been done by selective crossbreeding methods, while the modern methods involve transgenesis, mutagenesis, and genome editing using Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) with their associated protein ‘Cas’.  Fig. 2   Fig. 3 A schematic depiction of the major farming options under soil-plant-weather continuum from 19th  to 21st  century: The 19th-century subsistence farming, though environment-friendly due to organic manures and biological control, had lower productivity due to increased diseases, pests and abiotic stresses. The 20th-century conventional farming, though highly productive due to chemical-based fertilizers, pesticides, and fertilizer-responsive high-yielding crop varieties, was detrimental to the environment and human health. The 21st-century Agrochemical-free GM farming shall have to integrate organic agricultural inputs with genome-engineered crops to ensure nutritional security and environmental sustainability under the adverse climate-change imposed challenges. It may be possible to develop ‘trait-reversible genome-modified crops’ using genome engineering, enabling such crop varieties to be restored back to the exact same genetic state as in wild-type before the modification.

Conventional, age-old organic farming practices alone, and foods based on costly cellular agriculture, do not have the potential to be upscaled to meet the food supply challenges for feeding large populations. Additionally, agricultural practices relying on chemical inputs have a well-documented detrimental impact on human health and the environment. As the available farming methods have reached their productivity limits, new approaches to agriculture, combining friendly, age-old farming practices with modern technologies that exclude chemical interventions, are necessary to address the food production challenges. Growing genetically modified (GM) crops without chemical inputs can allow agricultural intensification with reduced adverse health and environmental impacts. Additionally, integrating high-value pleiotropic genes in their genetic improvement coupled with the use of modern agricultural technologies, like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), will further improve productivity. Such ‘organic-GM’ crops will offer consumers healthy, agrochemical-free GM produce. We believe these agricultural practices will lead to the beginning of a potentially new chemical-free GM agricultural revolution in the era of Agriculture 4.0 and help meet the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, given the advancement in the genome editing (GE) toolbox, we ought to develop a new category of ‘trait-reversible GM crops’ to avert the fears of those who believe in ecological damage by GM crops. Thus, in this article, we advocate farming with no or minimal chemical use by combining chemical-free organic farming with the existing biofortified and multiple stress tolerant GM crops, while focusing on the development of novel ‘biofertilizer-responsive GE crops’ and ‘trait-reversible GE crops’ for the future.

Historically, there were limited landraces or heirloom varieties that farmers cultivated, and later ‘artificial’ crossing was done by plant breeders to create thousands of plant varieties suited for high-input agriculture during and after the green revolution. However, with the advent of newer present-day challenges of growing human population, declining agricultural land and water resources, and climate change, these varieties are unlikely to be sustainable in the long run (for example, see (Firbank et al., 2018 ). Currently, the key sources of food are plant- and animal-based – both being the constituent components of a fragile food production and supply system. Several alternative food sources have been explored ( Fig. 1 ). For example, towards the middle of the 20th century, the food industry started developing biotechnological techniques to produce varied food items under controlled conditions (  Table 1 )  (Mojsov, 2016 ). Many such products are based on algal extracts like Chlorella  health drinks (Chlorella  growth factor), Dunaliella  carotenoid-enriched oily extracts (capsules), and Spirulina  liquid CO2  extracts (antioxidant capsules) (Pulz and Gross, 2004 ). Carotenoids from algae gained commercial importance for food applications globally, even though their production is not yet cost-effective compared to synthetic ones (Ambati et al., 2019 ). As extract or processed in food products, Spirulina  supports the digestive tract function as it helps maintain healthy intestinal bacteria (Pulz and Gross, 2004 ). Microorganisms are considered candidates for food and feed due to their ability to use inexpensive feedstocks as carbon and energy sources for protein production and increase biomass rapidly (Tusé and Miller, 1984 ). Microalgae (e.g. chlorella), cyanobacteria (e.g. spirulina) and microfungus (e.g. Fusarium venenatum ) have been studied extensively for microbial food production, while microbial cultures are used for enriching food items (e.g. Rhizopus oligosporus  is used to ferment soya bean ‘Temph’, Aspergillus oryzae  to saccharify rice for making alcoholic beverage ‘Sake’, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae  is vital for winemaking, baking, and brewing) (Ritala et al., 2017 ). However, microorganisms have not developed into a significant food alternative due to their high nucleic acid content, slower digestibility, tedious purification processes to eliminate undesirable odours, and compounds having allergic reactions. Securing approval from agencies like the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for food-grade microorganisms certified for safe human consumption is another major challenge for acceptance of microbial foods (Choi et al., 2022 ). Manufacturing food biotechnologically (such as animal proteins and plant cells) has also been piloted successfully, but the progress in this ‘cellular agriculture’ is slow. Other alternative foods, such as genetically enhanced algae (Pulz and Gross, 2004 ) have not shown promise either. Additionally, because product-specific attitude, sensory appeal and health orientation significantly influence the consumers’ choice of food (Chekima et al., 2017 ), and the cost of production, such alternative foods are likely to remain niche. More importantly, none of the above food production methods has the capacity to be upscaled to the levels required to feed large populations; therefore, such products are unlikely to replace the conventional food sources for the foreseeable future. Genetic engineering allows the introduction of desirable traits in plants; for example, improved yield, climate resilience, better nutrient use efficiency, disease resistance, enhanced nutritive and medicinal value (Abdallah et al., 2015; Husaini and Xu, 2016a, b; Husaini, 2010; Husaini and Abdin, 2008; Husaini et al., 2012; Husaini, 2010; Lucca et al., 2001; Wani et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2000; Zafar et al., 2020 ). Additionally, genetic technologies, such as CRISPR, can help improve plant metabolic profile by accumulating anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, pharmacological, anti-carcinogenic, anti-allergic, and therapeutic metabolites, bringing considerable health benefits (Jiang and Doudna, 2017 ). Thus, this toolbox of genetic engineering technologies has immense potential for improving global food and nutritional security in a sustainable manner (Ma et al., 2015; Mahas and Mahfouz, 2018; Pyott et al., 2016; Roca Paixao et al., 2019 ), contributing to the vision the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ( Table 2 ). Here, we suggest combining organic farming practices and GM crops (assisted with modern tools such as robotics, nanotechnology and AI) (De Clercq et al., 2018; Group, 2019; Husaini, 2021, 2022; Husaini and Khurshid, 2021; Husaini et al., 2018; Jouanjean, 2019; Rose and Chilvers, 2018; Trendov et al., 2019 ) to create an opportunity for harnessing the benefits of a potentially new, agrochemical-free, GM agricultural revolution in the era of Agriculture 4.0 – a ‘ greener’ green agricultural revolution. 1.1 Global food security and the United Nations sustainable development goals At a high-level conference on World Food Security in June 2008, convened by FAO, IFAD, WFP and CGIAR, 181 countries adopted a declaration that “It is essential to address the question of how to increase the resilience of present food production systems to challenges posed by climate change” (Husaini and Tuteja, 2013 ). Linked to this are the UN SDGs. The UN 2030 Agenda for SDGs represents a common framework of international cooperation to promote sustainable development. One of these (SDG-2) is to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”. It is of central importance to the entire SDG agenda, as it aims to promote healthy and sustainable diets, ensure global food security, and is intrinsically related to the environment, economy and society (Food, 2016 ). FAO's report in 2020 accepts that hunger and child malnutrition is a threat, that “the world is not on track to achieve the global nutrition targets and Zero Hunger, and that the situation could deteriorate if we do not act immediately boldly” (FAO and UNICEF). Climate change is another major challenge (SDG-13) influencing agriculture production systems worldwide, adversely affecting crop growth, yield and quality. Unfortunately, the current food consumption patterns impose additional hidden costs related to health (SDG-3) and climate change (SDG-13) (FAO and UNICEF). According to FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO by 2030, health costs associated with mortality and diet-related non-communicable diseases could exceed USD 1.3 trillion per annum, while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions shall be approximately USD 1.7 trillion per annum (FAO et al, 2020 ). Based on a meta-analysis 70 % of the studies on the impact of climate change have shown a decline in crop yields by the 2030 s, with half of them projecting a reduction between 10 % and 50 % (Challinor et al., 2014 ). The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC, 2021 ) shows the worsening of acute food insecurity as the number of people in crisis (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) reached a five-year high in 2020. Weather extremes were the primary drivers of the acute food insecurity situation for almost 34 million people in 25 countries in 2019, while in 2020, economic shocks (including COVID-19) became the primary driver of the food crisis with over 40.5 million people in crisis (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) in 17 countries (GRFC, 2021 ). The significance of these declarations, reports and goals became evident during the recent COVID-19 pandemic and regional military and political conflicts, which have impacted the socio-economic fabric of almost all societies, creating immense food production and supply challenges, particularly in developing societies. A future pandemic of a similar or a higher magnitude to COVID-19, or another geo-/socio-political or environmental calamity are not improbable and can hit both food production and supply chains even harder. Furthermore, the socio-economic impacts of pandemics and environmental events can quickly undo many of the development efforts made to reach the targets set for the UN’s SDGs and by other global organizations (such as (FAO and UNICEF), further underscoring the need to develop resilient and high-yielding agricultural systems, sustainable during socio/geo-political, medical, and environmental calamities.   2 Chem-driven versus bio-driven farming Managing plant nutrients at optimum levels is vital for sustainable crop production. It is now well-established that chemical-intensive farming is unsustainable as it has resulted in substantial ecological imbalance, as well as harming biodiversity, insect populations and human health (Gilliom, 2007; Husaini and Tuteja, 2013; Sharma and Singhvi, 2017; Udeigwe et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Thus, enhancing crop production without environmental damage is a major challenge in the 21st century (Huws et al., 2018 ). Synthetic fertilizers have been used extensively to increase crop production from arable land over the past several decades (Wang and Li, 2019 ). While chemical fertilizers can help increase crop production, they are expensive and also harm the environment: they deteriorate soil fertility by causing an imbalance in the soil nutrients and reducing its water-holding capacity (Nosheen et al., 2021 ). Nano-nutrition is another recent development in the field of nanotechnology in which nano-sized nutrients are provided for sustainable agriculture (Husaini and Khurshid, 2021 ). Special nanomaterials serve as a source of macro- and micro-nutrients and act as carriers to improve crop productivity (Elemike et al., 2019 ). Recent progress in the successful use of nano-fertilizers is very encouraging (Ditta and Arshad, 2016 ). However, an overemphasis on nanotechnology in agricultural activities can cause many unintended irreversible problems like environmental and unintended health safety issues (Zulfiqar et al., 2019 ). Nanomaterial phytotoxicity is a cause of concern as it varies with plant species, characteristics of nanomaterials and their dosages (Ma et al., 2010 ). Nanomaterials are very reactive because of their minute size and enhanced surface area and are a safety concern for those working in manufacturing units and farm workers who may become exposed (Yan and Chen, 2019 ). Thus, despite its enormous potential, this technology does have many disadvantages. Biofertilizers – substances containing microbial cultures to enhance the supply of nutrients to plants – are a promising alternative to hazardous chemical fertilizers. Biofertilizers are eco-friendly, non-toxic, and help maintain soil structure and biodiversity (Itelima et al., 2018 ). Biofertilizers constitute microbial inoculants and their organic products, which improve the growth and yield of the crops by 10–40 % (Husaini et al., 2022 ). These microbial inoculants colonize the plant rhizosphere and promote its growth (Agrahari et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2015 ). In addition to improving soil fertility and nutrient status, these protect the plants from pests and diseases, including one of the most destructive plant pathogens, Fusarium  sp (Matsubara and Husaini, 2016; Shabir et al., 2020 ). Hence, biofertilizers are a promising alternative to hazardous chemical fertilizers for sustainable agriculture and global food security (Husaini, 2021 ). Knowledge about soil properties, field environment, and host specificity of strains is mandatory for successfully producing and applying biofertilizers and biopesticides. Advances in metagenomics, pan-genomics, biotechnology, microbial taxonomy, and nanotechnology have significantly helped in producing better biofertilizers and biopesticides with multiple functionalities. The increasing demand for biofertilizers and biopesticides indicates a significant shift towards an eco-friendly and sustainable agriculture system (Husaini, 2014; Husaini, 2021 ). However, despite having clear advantages, further research efforts are needed to: identify soil-and plant specific strains; standardize biofertilizer and biopesticide compositions which are crop and trait specific; improve the existing strains using biotechnological methods (Carbú et al., 2016; Husaini et al., 2012 ); and further develop physical, chemical and enzymatic indicators of soil quality and health indices, which could be used to quantify and compare the impact of agrochemical-based GM crops with organically grown GM crops. Recently, the European Union enacted new regulations which are based on the latest scientific knowledge about the ecology and biology of each microorganism, which would help ease their use in plant protection. These rules align with the European Green Deal and will contribute to the Farm to Fork strategy for sustainable food production, processing and consumption. 2.1 Cultivating artificially bred crops by organic methods - prospects and limitations The current model of agricultural intensification based on agrochemical inputs, large monocultures, and landscape homogenisation has successfully increased yields (Tscharntke et al., 2021 ). However, it has caused a considerable decline in global biodiversity and is harmful to human and animal health, and the environment (Bavec and Bavec, 2015 ). Therefore, these ‘conventional agricultural practices’ are not sustainable in the long run, leading to a strong voice favouring organic farming. Organic agriculture is a form of farming that uses natural resources and strategies like biofertilizers (largely relying on animal manure), biological pest control, and crop rotation (Singh, 2021 ). It differs from traditional agriculture by excluding the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and growth regulators in crop production (Soni et al., 2022 ). Nevertheless, in its current form that uses traditional, artificially bred crops, organic farming has several limitations and inadequacies and cannot feed the growing global population using the same land resources. For example, while certified organic farming is claimed as an alternative to conventional farming (Bergström and Kirchmann, 2016 ), it can lead to considerable yield losses, making food production inefficient on the same land space (Meemken and Qaim, 2018 ). Additionally, widespread adoption of organic farming would cause net increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to lower crop production per unit land, and hence the need to divert forest land to meet food demand. Also, the reliance of organic farming on animal manure is a huge constraint on its sustainability. Organic farming uses artificially bred high-yielding varieties, most of which have already reached yield plateaus. Thus, the bigger question is whether organic farming can be viable if the whole population of 8 billion people opt for organic food. Dr Borlaug, a Nobel Laureate (1970) and considered the father of Green Revolution, answered this question when he said, “organic agriculture can only possibly feed four billion people, I don’t see two billion  (now almost 4 billion) willing to disappear ”. A recent report on organic agriculture clearly shows that consumption and sales of organic products are mainly limited to the wealthy and affluent markets in the US and Europe (Willer, 2021 ). So, it seems that organic farming is getting pushed as an enterprise by the willingness of the rich to pay more and the profit motive of the farmers. Thus, despite the hype about organic products, they have remained a niche market. Perspectives have shifted over the past two decades. The pressing food and environmental challenges offer the prospect of exploring novel ideas, which should drive policymakers to prioritize health and environment over shortsighted economic benefits. Despite the limitations of organic farming, there is no doubt that avoiding the use of chemicals in agriculture brings health and environmental benefits, and that certified organic agriculture can stop biodiversity losses and enrich local species in comparison with conventional, agrochemical-based farming (Tuck et al., 2014 ). It is these beneficial characteristics of organic farming, which can be harnessed in combination with those of high-yielding GM crops to increase productivity without severely damaging the environment and human health.   3 Cultivating GM varieties on agrochemical inputs – pros and cons In principle, genetic modification or engineering means changing the genetic material of an organism by artificial means ( Fig. 2 ). Humans have carried out genetic improvement using methods, such as selective and crossbreeding, for thousands of years to obtain crops with desirable traits and higher yields, de facto  making these crops ‘GM’. Moreover, nature also uses genetic modification via processes such as point mutations, transposition, and gene transfer to select plants (and other organisms) with greater fitness in an ecosystem, forming the basis of adaptation and evolution. Modern methods of genetic modification include DNA engineering using transgenesis (inter- or intra-specific gene transfer/insertion), genome editing using, for example, CRISPR, ZFN and TALEN, and site-directed or non-specific mutagenesis (Du et al., 2016; Husaini, 2010; 2011; Shi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021 ). However, not all genetic modifications are equal when it comes to public perception and lawmaking. For example, the so-called ‘upgraded’ crops developed by BASF under the trade name ‘Clearfield’ are not considered GM, even when a phenotypically identical herbicide-tolerance trait is classified as GM (Morris, 2007a; 2007b; Weidner et al., 2022 ). These crops are considered safe and effective despite gene flow to wild species (de Avila et al., 2021 ); such a gene flow is a component of the natural evolutionary process. While traditional genetic improvement by selective and crossbreeding receives almost no resistance from the public, crops improved using modern genetic modification methods are generally disapproved, largely due to decades long unfavorable propaganda. However, for the purpose of this discussion, we will refer ‘GM crops’ only to those crops that have been defined so as per the Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (OJ L 268, 18.10.2003, p. 1–23). Modern genetic engineering techniques allow us to insert genes (transgenes) into a recipient plant genome from related or unrelated plants, bacteria, viruses, fungi, animals, and even those that have been artificially synthesized (Husaini et al., 2010 ). This advancement has helped overcome sexual and interspecific incompatibility, which make plant breeding by conventional approaches improbable (Husaini et al., 2011 ). Genetic engineering is the fastest-adopted crop improvement technology of modern times (ISAAA, 2019 ). Between 1996 and 2019, the global area of GM crops increased ∼112-fold, involving nearly 17 million farmers in 29 countries. The cultivation of transgenic crops has significantly increased global agricultural productivity; for example, crop yields have increased by 22 %, leading to an estimated 68 % increase in profit for farmers (Klümper and Qaim, 2014 ). Furthermore, high-value pleiotropic genes can help immensely in developing biofortified crops with resistance against multiple stresses so that the challenges of the 21st century are adequately overcome (Husaini, 2022 ). Genetic engineering has led to the production of crop varieties with significantly reduced undesirable environmental footprints (Husaini and Tuteja, 2013 ). For example, from 1996 to 2016, there was an estimated 92.1 and 288 million kg reduction in insecticides used in GM maize and cotton, respectively (Brookes and Barfoot, 2018 ); GM rice and canola require less nitrogen fertilizer as they can fix nitrogen more efficiently, reduce NO2  emissions, which has almost 300x global warming potential than CO2  (Stern et al., 2010 ). According to recent updates (Brookes and Barfoot, 2020 ), the adoption of GM insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant technology has decreased pesticide application by 775.4 million kg (8.3 %), thereby reducing the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) by 18.5 %. This technology has helped reduce fuel consumption on farms, which corresponds to the equivalent of removing ∼15.27 million cars globally. The key impact of GM herbicide-tolerant technology is an aggregate reduction in both the quantity of herbicides used and the associated field EIQ values, indicating net improvements to the environment. While GM crops are amenable to resource conservation technologies, reducing N2 O and CO2  emissions, they still demand the use of fertilizers and other agrochemicals. One example of the use of agrochemicals in GM crops is glyphosate, which is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide. Glyphosate is used on glyphosate-tolerant GM crops, such as soybean. There are several concerns regarding the use of glyphosate in GM agriculture, and many countries have already imposed a ban on its commercial use (Alcántara-de la Cruz et al., 2021; Bøhn and Millstone, 2019; Kudsk and Mathiassen, 2020 ). However, despite the absence of GM glyphosate-resistant crops in the EU, glyphosate is widely used in the EU to eliminate both annual and perennial weeds (Duke et al., 2018 ). Depending upon the time of the spray, glyphosate, and its main breakdown product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), can accumulate in the plants and enter the food chain. For example, the amount of glyphosate entering the food chain can be as high as 9 g/tonne of soybean (Bøhn and Millstone, 2019 ). Thus, while cultivating glyphosate-tolerant GM crops effectively saves labour costs, as they encourage no-tillage conservation farming, preventing soil erosion and loss of nutrients (Kudsk and Mathiassen 2019), these beneficial features are largely offset by their potential adverse effect on human health, primarily due to the use of polyethyloxylated tallow amine (POE-T) surfactants admixed with glyphosate (Kudsk and Mathiassen, 2020 ). Apart from unwanted harmful effects on human health, environment, microbial populations and biodiversity, and the pollution caused by agrochemical-intensive agriculture, inappropriate handling and the subsequent pesticide poisoning alone account for approximately 0.3 million deaths per annum globally (Sabarwal et al., 2018 ). Therefore, modernizing GM agriculture by introducing environment-friendly technologies and avoiding the use of synthetic agrochemicals appears to be the way forward in the 21st century. 3.1 Cultivating agrochemical-free GM crops – moving towards the UN SDGs in the era of Agriculture 4.0 Technological ﬁxes, incremental changes and transformative policies are needed to significantly change food production and to develop alternative farming approaches (Husaini and Khurshid, 2021; Husaini and Sohail, 2023 ). A resilient, high-value sustainable food-production model based on agrochemical-free GM crops, suitable for present and future generations, must be developed as a commercially viable substitute for agrochemical-driven agriculture (Bøhn and Millstone, 2019; Kudsk and Mathiassen, 2020 ). The means through which GM Insecticide Resistant technology has influenced the environment from 1996 to 2021 is through decreased insecticide use. This is strongly evident in the case of cotton, which was traditionally subjected to intensive insecticide treatment regimens against cotton bollworms. In maize, the insecticide use savings are lesser compared to cotton. The fuel savings owing to fewer spray runs in GM Insecticide Resistant maize and cotton, and the switching from conventional tillage to reduced tillage or no-tillage farming systems enabled by GM Herbicide Tolerant crops have resulted in permanent savings in CO2  emissions. In 2018, this reduced 2456 million kg of CO2  emission and decreased fuel use by 920 million liters. The extensive adoption of GM Herbicide Tolerant crops in North and South Americas improved weed control and reduced the need to plough soil and seed-bed preparation for weed control. This also reduced tractor fuel consumption for tillage and reduced soil erosion cut. Additionally, more carbon remains in the soil, leading to lower GHG emissions. Owing to this, it is estimated that 5606 million kg of soil carbon was sequestered in 2018, and 20581 million kg of CO2  was prevented from getting released into the global atmosphere. From 1996–2018, the reduction in fuel use is estimated as 34172 million kg of CO2  and 12799 million litres of reduced fuel use. This is equal to taking 22.65 million cars off the road for a year (Brookes and Barfoot, 2020 ). The above discussion demonstrates that both organic farming methods and GM crops have their advantages and limitations, but neither alone has the capacity to meet the future food demands without severe environmental damage. Here, we propose aggregating advantageous features of organic farming and GM crops to develop farming with no or minimal chemical use (Table 2 ). We also propose incorporating other modern farming technologies into ‘organic GM farming’, such as AI-assisted robotics, to enhance farming efficiency (Husaini and Sohail, 2023 ); for example, those developed for operations like weeding, eliminating the need for herbicide sprays. There have already been attempts to making weed control herbicide-free: Mexico, a major agricultural economy, is seeking to make weed control more mechanical and less dependent on herbicides (Alcántara-de la Cruz et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, as metagenomics has advanced and plant-microbe interactions have been found to be immensely useful in understanding plant health (Levy et al., 2018; Schenk et al., 2012 ), we also propose the development of biofertilizer-responsive GM or GE crops. We can harness microbial strains for mutualistic associations beneficial to these biofertilizer-responsive GM / GE crops, many of which would be based on host-microbe selective interactions governed by chemotaxis signaling and quorum sensing (Cregger et al., 2021; Wille et al., 2019 ). These GM / GE crops would be biofertilizer-responsive and suitable for chemical-free agriculture, unlike the earlier chemical fertilizer responsive varieties of green revolution. There is a considerable potential of developing such GM crop varieties by expressing genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis for enhanced plant defense, and also, genes that can promote beneficial microbial associations in the rhizosphere. These crop varieties would have better associations with microbes by secreting root exudates such as volatile organic compounds, organic enzymes, siderophores, small secreted proteins, and terpenes (Halverson and Stacey, 1986; Middleton et al., 2021 ). Such crops will require less intensive assistance than conventional organic crops, and, therefore, have better productivity with significantly reduced environmental impact. Using agrochemical-free farming practices and new-age genome-edited crops (such as via CRISPR/Cas genome editing of high-value pleiotropic genes) with improved genetic and phenotypic traits offers a sustainable way to produce food with minimal environmental cost – central to the UN SDGs. Recently, in India – another major agricultural economy - the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change gave environmental clearance to GM mustard DMH-11, and the Indian Council for Agricultural Research declared it vital for bringing self-sufficiency in edible oil in India (icar.org.in; devdiscourse.com). In the case of Bt cotton approval in India, state and cultivator interests prevailed over the precautionary logic; however, in the case of Bt brinjal (aubergine), the politics of risk dominated the question of agro-economics. According to one opinion (Herring, 2015 ), this shows the inherent vulnerability of science to politics. Despite reassurances from reputed scientific bodies and Nobel Laureates, perhaps for the first time in the history of any scientific controversy, these attempts were more or less ineffective at countering the fear campaign (Husaini and Sohail, 2018 ). Unlike agriculture, the pharma industry faces no such problem despite using the same genetic modification techniques. Thus, technical advances alone are unlikely to tackle the food and environmental crises. Political willingness to give the food and environment emergency a priority over short-term political and economic interests is critical to futuristic farming approaches.   4 The consumer’s right of choice – a future perspective Non-organic food labels include foods obtained from both agrochemical-driven agriculture and genetically engineered crops. Under the current regulations, GM food can neither be labelled organic nor can the GM content be used in certified organic products. So, when it comes to buying food, consumers have two choices: buy the food produced by conventional methods (agrochemical-driven plus GM) or buy more expensive and relatively infrequently available organic food. Amidst the debate about the currently offered choice between ‘organic versus conventional’ and ‘GM versus non-GM’ crops, we propose that the consumer is given a third choice to buy GM produce that has been grown using organic methods, free from agrochemical inputs, which is currently absent ( Fig. 3 ). For this, we need to create opportunities to move towards such sustainable and futuristic farming options (Table 2 ), and engineer crops with improved phenotypes to substitute the use of agrochemicals. The formulation of effective policies needs multiple iterations between theory and practice, be these related to UN SDG targets, or the pathway each country chooses to follow based on region-specific challenges and demands. The ruling of 25th July 2018 by the Court of Justice of the European Union on organisms developed through novel genomic techniques and the news reports of farmers in India planting Bt brinjal illegally have generated a debate. A recent article declared “that there is an urgent need for a thorough, comprehensive review of the EU regulatory frameworks for GMOs that takes into account advances in knowledge and experience as well as consistency with international law” (van der Meer et al., 2021 ). We need a more acceptable food label, such as ‘agrochemical-free GM produce’ that, besides being environment-friendly and sustainable, persuades farmers to grow GM crops without agrochemical inputs. Furthermore, given the currently available genome modification and editing toolbox, it should now be possible to develop ‘trait reversible GM crops’ for food producers and consumers who fear ecological damage by GM crops. Of particular interest for this should be newly developed drug-inducible CRISPR/Cas systems like Tet-On/Off system, Cre-dependent system, chemically induced proximity system, and destabilizing domain-mediated protein degradation systems (Shaw et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2019 ). This inducible system will have both the transgene/cisgene as well as an inducible genetic system to precisely inactivate or knockout the transgene/cisgene when required, simply by exposing it to the inducer molecule. Indeed, we need to understand the public’s willingness to purchase chemical-free GM produce and legislate to create new food labelling. This can be achieved by presenting concrete scientific evidence of the benefits of GM produce to the public, quashing the decades-long negative propaganda, and the lobbying of lawmakers. Only then we will be able to harness the benefits of a potentially new ‘agrochemical-free GM agricultural revolution’. Undoubtedly, such farming practices will increase productivity, they will also reduce land and air pollution, providing a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.  5 Compliance with ethical standards • Ethics approval and consent to participate: Not applicable  • Consent to publication: All authors have given consent to the publication  • Funding: The authors did not receive support from any organization for the submitted work  • Code availability: Not applicable  • Research involving human participants and/or animals: Not applicable  • Informed consent: Not applicable  • Conflict of interest: There are no competing interests to declare  • Author contributions: AMH and MS together conceived the idea, designed, and wrote the manuscript and finalized it together and approved it for publication     CRediT authorship contribution statement Amjad M.
