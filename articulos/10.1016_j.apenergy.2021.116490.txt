                  The Green Economy Progress measurement methodology is used to construct a multidimensional composite index, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-9 Progress Index, which measures the progress of countries in meeting the industry-related targets of SDG-9. The index differs from performance indicies in that it focuses on changes over time rather than levels of performance at points in time. Another feature of this index is that it shows the progress of countries in relation to their targets, which differ from country to country. The index is based on five indicators for the three industry-related targets of SDG-9, those where sufficient data are available: manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product, MVA per capita, manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit of MVA, and the proportion of medium and high-tech industry in MVA. Application of the SDG-9 Progress Index shows that out of 124 countries, 58 progressed towards their targets over the period 2000–2016 while 66 regressed away from them. No correspondence is found between the country rankings identified with the SDG-9 Progress Index and those identified with three performance indicies using the same or relatively similar CO2 indicators for index construction but different methodologies. An examination of the weighting specifications in the SDG-9 Progress Index for the CO 2 emission intensity indicator shows that improvements in this indicator for six out of the ten most progressive countries have the greatest potential among the five indicators for improving their rankings.

The Green Economy Progress measurement methodology is used to construct a multidimensional composite index, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-9 Progress Index, which measures the progress of countries in meeting the industry-related targets of SDG-9. The index differs from performance indicies in that it focuses on changes over time rather than levels of performance at points in time. Another feature of this index is that it shows the progress of countries in relation to their targets, which differ from country to country. The index is based on five indicators for the three industry-related targets of SDG-9, those where sufficient data are available: manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product, MVA per capita, manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment, carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions per unit of MVA, and the proportion of medium and high-tech industry in MVA. Application of the SDG-9 Progress Index shows that out of 124 countries, 58 progressed towards their targets over the period 2000–2016 while 66 regressed away from them. No correspondence is found between the country rankings identified with the SDG-9 Progress Index and those identified with three performance indicies using the same or relatively similar CO2  indicators for index construction but different methodologies. An examination of the weighting specifications in the SDG-9 Progress Index for the CO 2  emission intensity indicator shows that improvements in this indicator for six out of the ten most progressive countries have the greatest potential among the five indicators for improving their rankings.   Keywords Sustainable development goal-9  Industry  Composite progress index  Carbon-dioxide emission intensity    1 Introduction With the adoption in 2015 of Resolution 70/1, 'Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development' (2030 Agenda for short), the United Nations General Assembly put economic development on the global development agenda. At the core of the 2030 Agenda are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) intended to transform the world over the next 15 years [1] . The targets and indicators associated with the goals are the basis for global monitoring of progress in meeting the goals. The 17 SDGs replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000. The eight, time-bound goals and their 18 targets focused primarily on mitigating the consequences of extreme poverty in developing countries; progress in meeting them was monitored using 60 indicators [2] . In contrast, the SDGs are more comprehensive in scope, addressing not only poverty reduction, but also protection of the environment (including carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emission intensity), decent work for workers, and improvements in living conditions for communities. They are also applicable to both developed and developing countries. As a result, the SDGs have 169 targets, and progress in meeting these targets is measured by a global indicator framework consisting of an expanding list of 231 indicators [3] . Obviously, all the SDG goals interact, but five of the 17 address more specifically the nexus between industrial development and environmental concerns, whereas the other goals address social, political, and agricultural development as well as the conservation of natural capital. Goal 9 (“Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”) sees industry (herein defined as manufacturing) as the primary engine not only for job creation and economic growth but also for technology transfer, investment flows, and skills development. Industry is also central in contributing to Goal 6 (“Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”), Goal 7 (“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”), Goal 8 (“Decent Work and Economic Growth”) and Goal 12 (“Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”) [4] . Monitoring and evaluating the achievements of countries in meeting SDGs are both a challenge and an opportunity for the stakeholders involved in implementing the 2030 Agenda. Performance and progress composite indicies are two potential options for assisting them in measuring the multidimensionality of sustainable development achievements. A performance index benchmarks the relative position of countries at a specific point in time. Examples of applications of this type of index are the Human Sustainable Development index [5]  and the recently published SDG-9 performance index [6] . The latter simultaneously measures where countries are in the industrialization process and where they are in meeting employment and CO2  emission intensity targets. Conversely, a progress index measures the relative effort of countries over time in meeting SDG targets. It is an alternative perspective to a performance index because it measures changes towards a target rather than a level of performance. Examples of applications of this type of index are the Green Economy Progress (GEP) index [7]  and the recently published Inclusive Green Energy Index of Progress [8] . These progress indicies measure progress relative to reference values (targets and thresholds) that are uniquely calculated based on the initial situation of each country. In other words, progress measurement is a ratio between the desired and actual changes. The setting of reference values for policy goals and distinguishing between positive and negative indicators results in a ranking of country achievements that are uniquely different from those based on country rankings by performance indicies. This article is the first global application of the GEP methodology to assess progress in meeting industry-related SDG-9 targets. The proposed SDG-9 progress index (SDG-9Pro) permits cross-country comparisons of progress based on five of the seven industry-related SDG-9 indicators. These industry-related indicators collectively capture the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable industrial development. The inclusion of CO2  emission intensity as the environmental indicator shows its relative importance among the five industry-related indicators in measuring progress towards sustainable industrial development. The unique value addition of the methodology is its ability to identify policy priorities for governments and stakeholders. It shows, among other things, how those countries making the least progress can accelerate their progress towards meeting SDG-9 targets. The remainder of the article consists of seven additional sections. Section 2  is a review of relevant composite indicies for SDG targets. Section 3  identifies industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators for which there are sufficient data to construct a progress index. Section 4  describes the GEP methodology used for constructing the SDG-9Pro index. Section 5  presents the progress ranking for all countries. Section 6  shows the ranking implications for alternative combinations of indicators and weights in the SDG-9 Pro index. Section 7  compares SDG-9Pro country rankings with the rankings of three composite performance indicies. Section 8  describes potential policy recommendations for accelerating progress for a selected number of countries. Section 9  concludes the article.  2 Review of potential composite indicies for industry-related SDG-9 targets A recent review of SDG indicies described in the literature supports our overall finding that there have been only limited efforts to use composite indicies to measure country progress in meeting SDG targets and no efforts at all to construct a progress index for industry-relevant SDG-9 targets [2] . The closest effort is an SDG-9 performance index, which incorporates five industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators, but it is constructed using performance rather than a progress methodology to assess achievements in meeting SDG-9 targets [6] . The review below describes the limited number of articles/reports that, in varying degrees, benchmark global progress in meeting SDGs and in particular SDG-9 targets. The United Nations Environment Programme has constructed a measurement framework that estimates the progress in achieving the transition to an inclusive green economy at the national and global levels. The measurement framework includes a composite index, the GEP index, as well as a “dashboard” of indicators [7] . The GEP index captures characteristics of the green economy by including multidimensional indicators, such as measures that capture the link between health and the environment. It aggregates 13 multidimensional indicators to measure the progress of 105 countries with respect to their own targets and tracks the sustainability of that progress between two points in time, 2004 and 2014. The top-ranked countries with the highest average progress in order of rank across all 13 indicators are Bulgaria, Uganda, Slovenia, Hungary, and Ireland; the countries with the lowest average progress are Mongolia, Uganda, Uruguay, Albania, and Viet Nam. Despite its name, none of the 13 indicators or sub-indicators in the GEP index are industry-relevant economic, social (employment), or environmental indicators [8] . More recently, the GEP methodology has been used to construct an index for measuring country progress in meeting SDG-7 energy targets [8] . The World Economic Forum has constructed an Inclusive Development Index (IDI) [9] . It is designed as an alternative to GDP because it is said to reflect more closely the criteria by which people evaluate their country's progress. The IDI index has three pillars, growth and development, inclusion and intergenerational equity, and sustainability. Under each pillar, there are four key national performance indications. It includes an overall IDI score and a five-year trend for each country. The 2016 ranking of 103 countries is topped by Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Denmark, whereas Mozambique, Lesotho, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Egypt rank last. The IDI does not include sector-specific data (for instance, manufacturing) and only one SDG indicator, carbon intensity per unit of GDP (but not carbon intensity per unit of MVA, which is the relevant indicator in SDG-9). Moll de Alba and Todorov have constructed a Green Industrial Performance Index [10] . They use a list of green products and services based on both energy conservation and environmental goals to identify green MVA and employment as a share of total MVA and employment as well as green exports as a share of total exports. They take data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) to estimate CO2  emissions from manufacturing. Their three-dimensional indicators consist of the capacity to produce and export green manufactures (green MVA per capita and green exports per capita), the importance of green manufacturing (share of green MVA in total MVA and share of green manufactured exports in total exports), and the social and environmental aspects of green manufacturing (share of green manufacturing employment in total manufacturing employment and CO2  emissions from manufacturing per unit of MVA). The 2014 ranking of 107 countries is topped by Denmark, Taiwan Province of China, Germany, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, whereas Albania, Eritrea, Turkmenistan, Haiti, and Iraq rank last. While the index is an industry-related index, it includes only one of the seven SDG-9 industry-relevant indicators, namely CO2  emissions per unit of MVA. Sachs et al . have constructed an SDG Index and Dashboard [11] . The SDG Index is based on 88 SDG-related indicators (although they differ significantly from the indicators used in Agenda 2030) with additional indicators for OECD countries. The authors compute the SDG Index by first estimating scores for each SDG using the arithmetic mean of the indicators they have assigned to that goal and then averaging across all 17 SDGs to obtain an SDG Index score. The global SDG Index score and the scores by goal can be interpreted as the percentage of achievement toward targets. The difference between 100 and a country's score is, therefore, the distance in percentage to SDG targets. The 2017 ranking of 156 countries is topped by Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and France, whereas the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Yemen rank last. The SDG Index excludes those indicators where quantitative thresholds are not applicable to all countries. For this reason, none of the industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators are among the 88 indicators in the SDG index. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has constructed for the first time, and on an experimental basis, a CO2 -Adjusted Competitive Industrial Performance (CO2 -Adjusted CIP) Index as a complement to its Competitive Industrial Performance Index which it has been publishing since 2002 [12] . The CO2 -Adjusted CIP index builds on the three dimensions of the CIP by adding CO2  emission data from IEA. The 2016 ranking of 123 countries is topped by Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Japan, and Italy, whereas Haiti, Nepal Yemen, Iraq, and Ethiopia rank last. The index has no indicator for manufacturing employment and has the same limitation as all other indicies reviewed as it uses only CO2  emission intensity to represent the multiple negative environmental effects of industrialization. Lin et al . have constructed an Inclusive Sustainable Transformation (IST) Index that has tracked countries over a period of 15 years [13] . This index distinguishes itself from other indicies that track the structural characteristics of an economy by ensuring that the comparisons among countries account for differences in their level of development. They expand the country coverage to 198 countries by using multiple imputation techniques. The index includes 27 indicators, of which four are identical to industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators. The 2015 ranking of 198 countries, which covers the period 2000–2015, is topped by Switzerland, Germany, Czechia, Slovakia, and Slovenia, whereas Yemen, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Syria rank last. Only the CO2  indicator differs from the industry-relevant SDG-9 indicator in that it is CO2  emission intensity per 2011 purchasing-price-parity of GDP. Biggeri et al . (2019) have constructed an Integrated Sustainable Development Index for the same time period (2017) and the same countries (156 countries) as Sachs et al . [2] . The authors acknowledge the contribution of Sachs et al . but correctly state that the SDG Index has the well-known problem of an arithmetic mean (perfect substitution between dimensions). They propose an adjusted Integrated Sustainable Development Index (I-SID) that is based on the Multidimensional Synthesis of Indicators (MSI), which considers trade-offs and synergies between goals and targets across all three dimensions of sustainable development. This approach provides an allowance for dimension’s heterogeneity while avoiding the geometric mean collapsing to zero (if there is a value with zero) or approaching zero. If there is a zero score for any dimension, the MSI approach does not create any problems. They compare their ranking of countries with rankings based on both arithmetic and geometric means and find crucial differences in the ranking of countries. The 2018 ranking of the 156 countries is topped by Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and France, whereas the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Democratic Republic, Madagascar, and Yemen rank last [2] . Since the I-SID index uses the same data as Sachs et al ., it does not include industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators. Jin, Hui, et al. (2020) have constructed a 'National Sustainable Development Index (NSDI)' following the entropy method as a modification of the Human Development Index (HDI). The entropy method calculates the weight of each indicator following the basic idea of information theory. Weight estimated following the method is a comparative rate of indicator's changes in a composite index, while the comparative level of indicator needs to be defined by the standardization of the data. Thus, the objective method of entropy considers the information load, which decreases human subjectivity to the evaluation. In such a context, the NSDI is relatively complete and reliable for measuring countries' progress toward sustainable development, which works as a make-up of the gap of the existing indices. The Index covers 163 countries, 12 indicators from the economic, social, and resource, and environmental dimensions. The index includes per capita CO2  emissions and employment from services, but no indicator is found specifically related to industry. Australia, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, and Canada rank among the top five, and Bahrain, Kuwait, Mozambique, Niger, and Cote d'Ivoire ranking the bottom five in the Index [14] . Puertas and Bermúdez (2020) developed a 'global SDG Progress Index' (GSPI) by examining several combinations for constructing a performance index following the performance methodology. The selected index of 17 SDGs including industry related SDG 9 considers the countries' population, geography, and wealth while determining the weight c zoefficient. Therefore, it provides incentives to both developed and developing countries for better improvement and visibility, thus contributing to global progress. A threshold is determined to define the scale of progress in relation to the SDG 2030 goals. As a result, the findings show how progress is consistent with the need to meet SDGs by 2030. They find that developing countries are lagging in achieving SDGs by 2030. However, this index has limitations; for example, it provides equal weight to each 17 SDGs, which means a high performance on one indicator may be undermined by a low performance on another indicator [15] . There is hardly any composite index found which is exclusively build for evaluating the progress of countries on SDG 9 except Kynclova et al . They have constructed an SDG-9 Performance Index that tracks countries between 2000 and 2016 [6] . The SDG-9 Index measures the performance that countries make toward meeting five of the industry-relevant indicators for SDG-9, namely, MVA as a proportion of GDP, per capita MVA, manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment, CO2  emissions per unit of MVA, and the proportion of medium and high-tech industry MVA in total MVA. Sufficient data are not yet available for the two remaining indicators, proportion of small-scale industries in MVA, and proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit. This performance (as distinct from progress) index is constructed as a geometric mean using equal weight for each indicator. The 2016 ranking for 124 countries is topped by Ireland, Germany, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, and Japan, whereas Iraq, Cambodia, Niger, Yemen, and Eritrea rank last [6] . SDG-9Per is the only one of the reviewed indicies that uses the five industry-relevant SDG-9 indicators for which there are available data. We reviewed ten potentially relevant indices for assessing the performance of countries in meeting SDG 9 industry-relevant targets. Three of indices do not include a CO2  emission indicator. Another four include CO2  emissions as an indicator but not measured as manufacturing CO2  emission intensity. The remaining three include a CO2  emission intensity indicator as specified in the SDGs.  3 SDG-9 industry-related indicators and their data sources 3.1 Indicator options and data availability SDG-9 has seven industry-related indicators that measure progress of countries towards sustainable industrial development (Table 1  ). These are manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (MVAgdp), MVA per capita (MVApc), manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment (EMPsh) , proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added (SSIva), proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit (SSIfin), CO2  emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA (CO2 mva), and proportion of medium–high and high-tech manufacturing value added in total value added (MHTmva). There are sufficient data for five indicators. There are insufficient and infrequently reported data for the other two indicators, SSIva and SSIfin. Nor are the two indicators for target 9.5, which calls for enhancing scientific research and upgrading the technological capabilities of industrial sectors, included because they refer to the economy as a whole and the available data cannot be disaggregated by sectors, in our case manufacturing. Data for indicators MVAgdp and MVApc are available from UNIDO [16]  and United Nations Statistics Division [17] , all monetary values are reported in constant 2010 USD. Data for the indicator EMPsh are available from the International Labour Organization (ILO) [18]  and UNIDO's Industrial Statistics Database (INDSTAT) [19] . ILO data include both formal and informal manufacturing and total employment for 188 countries for the period 2000–2016, whereas UNIDO data include only formal manufacturing employment. ILO data are therefore used in this article's analysis because they are more comprehensive, and the manufacturing and total employment are similarly derived from household surveys. Data for the indicator CO2 mva combines CO2  emissions from total fuel combustion taken from IEA [20]  with MVA data from UNIDO [16] . IEA reports CO2  emission data from total fuel combustion for 140 countries. The IEA data do not include CO2  process emissions (mainly those from cement production). Data for the indicator MHTmva are available from UNIDO INDSTAT for approximately 150 countries [19] . The data are essential for determining value added shifts in economic activity from low-tech to medium and high-tech industry in total MVA. UNIDO INDSTAT is the only global database with information about manufacturing sub-sectors. Data for the indicator SSIva are not yet available for most developing countries for the period 2000–2016. However some data can be retrieved from UNIDO INDSTAT [19] . With respect to data for the indicator SSIfin, data for small-scale industries (5 to 19 employees) have been reported at irregular intervals (between five and ten years) during the period 2000–2016 by the World Bank [21] .   4 Sustainable development goal 9 (SDG-9) progress index: Methodological construction and computation The SDG-9Progress index, or SDG-9Pro index, is based on the GEP methodology that combines several individual indicators [22] . Progress in the indicators is first calculated, and then the different levels of progress are combined to give the composite SDG-9Pro index. 4.1 Targets and thresholds Indicators can be of two types: “good” and “bad”. Progress in the case of a single indicator corresponds to the ratio of the actual and desired increments (in the case of “good” indicators) or reductions (in the case of “bad” indicators) and can be formulated as follows:(1) Progress = p good   ( y  1  , y  0  )   s good   ( y  ∗   , y  0  )    = dy  d y  ∗     = y  1  - y  0   y  ∗   - y  0       p bad   ( y  1  , y  0  )   s bad   ( y  ∗   , y  0  )    = d ( - y )  d ( - y  ∗   )   = y  0  - y  1   y  0  - y  ∗                 In Eq. (1) , y0  (2000 in our analysis) is the initial value of the indicator and y  1    (2016 in our analysis) is the final value of the indicator. For each indicator, its initial and final values are known. Progress is measured relative to the reference value or targets. Targets and thresholds are calculated for determining progress with Eq. (1)  above. Targets (y*) are formulated for each country by calculating the target rate λ   (“good” indicator) or β   (“bad” indicator). The target rate (change ratio) λ  represents the ratio between the final (y1 ) and initial (y0 ) values for each indicator for the 90th percentile of the distribution for “good” indicators. The target for a country is calculated by multiplying its initial value with the λ, which is 10 percent of the best performing countries. For example, a country should achieve a target that is based on an increase in the initial year 2000 that is at least as great as the one achieved by the 10 percent best-performing countries. Similarly, the target rate (change ratio) β   represents the ratio between the final (y1 ) and initial (y0 ) value for each indicator for the 10th percentile of the distribution for “bad” indicators. The target for a country is set to achieve a reduction as great as the reduction of the 10 percent best-performing countries. In other words, a country should have as a target reduction (y*) that is as big as the one achieved by the 10 percent best-performing countries. Thresholds (t) temper targets by introducing minimal values that countries should never go below in the case of “good” indicators, and maximal values that countries should never go above in the case of “bad” indicators. Thresholds are planetary boundaries common to all countries or all countries in an economic development group. They are determined either by internationally accepted scientific sources, such as the threshold limit for air pollution indicators [22] , or they are empirically derived. For example, there is no scientific evidence for determining an appropriate value for the indicator MVAgdp. In such cases, thresholds are determined empirically in the same way used for some of the 13 indicators in the GEP index [7] . For “good” indicators, the threshold is set at the 25th percentile of the distribution in the initial year, and for “bad” indicators, it is set at the 75th percentile in the initial year. Hence, countries should not go below or achieve less than the point that is achieved by the bottom 25 percent of countries for “good” indicators in the initial year. Conversely, no country should go above or increase more than the top 75 percent of countries for “bad” indicators in the initial year. Hence, for “good” indicators, a target is expressed by y* =λy0  with λ > 1. This is applicable if λy0  > t. In other words, a country's target should be above the threshold. If a country's target is below the threshold after multiplying its initial year value withλ  , then its target value should be the common threshold (planetary boundary), y*= t. Similarly, for “bad” indicators, a target is expressed as y* =β y   0,  with β   < 1. This is applicable if the β y   0  < t. In other words, a country's target should be below the threshold. If a country's target remains above the threshold after multiplying the initial year value with β  , then its target value shouldbe at the common threshold (planetary boundary), y* = t. Thresholds play an essential role in determining targets in the GEP methodology byapplying equation (2) to determine that y* =λy0  > t or at least y*= t, and y*=β y   0  < t or at most y *= t.y  ∗   = max t , λ y  0    , λ > 1  ( " g o o d " )      (2)  y  ∗   = min t , β y  0    , β < 1  ( " b a d " )       This shows that a country should be on the right side of the threshold. In other words, the target should be the minimum threshold of the distribution. For example, the initial target value for the employment indicator EMPsh for Cambodia is 8.08, which is calculated by multiplying λ  (1.16) with its initial year (2000) value (6.96). However, the planetary value (threshold) for employment for all countries, which includes Cambodia, is 8.29. As countries should not fall below the threshold value for progress, the final target for Cambodia is set at 8.92 (following the equation above) rather than the initial target value of 8.08.  4.2 Constructing progress Once the target is formulated, the progress or improvement rate of countries on each of the indicators is obtained by following the formula below:(3) Progress  i n  a n  i n d i c a t o r = dy  d y  ∗     = y  1  - y  0   m a x t , λ y  0    - y  0    ,   λ > 1    d ( - y )  d ( - y  ∗   )   = y  0  - y  1   y  0  - m i n t , β y  0      ,   β < 1             In Eq. (3) , the index can also be negative. For “good” indicators, if the final value is lower than the initial value, progress is negative. For “bad” indicators, on the other hand, if the final value is higher than the initial value, progress is negative. The index takes on a value above or below 1, depending on whether actual progress is above or below the target [7] .  4.3 Weighting system As there are several indicators within the composite SDG-9Pro index, a weighting scheme is required to calculate the index correctly. There are two steps in weighting the indicators. The first step is to develop each single indicator's weight (“weight 1″), and the second step is to develop weights among the indicators (”weight 2″).Step 1: Initial position relative to the threshold per indicator    For each indicator, weight 1 (π ^  j  )    is set as the ratio between the initial value and threshold, as shown in Eq. (4) . For “good” indicators, the smallery j  0   , the larger the weight. For “bad” indicators, the largery j  0   , the larger the weight.(4) π ^  j  = t j  y j 0   ,  i f  j ∈ G   y j 0  t j   ,  i f  j ∈ B         This means that if a country is in a disadvantaged condition in the initial year, it receives a higher weight compared to other countries that are in better positions. This identifies indicators where a country is worse off than other countries. For example, weight 1 of manufacturing employment indicator EMPsh for China is 0.43, while weight 1 of the same indicator for the Kyrgyz Republic is 1.40; this shows that the Kyrgyz Republic is relatively worse off on the employment indicator in the initial year (2000) than China.Step 2: Relative progress among indicators    The second step is to normalize (or re-weight) the π ̂  j   .to obtain the weights πj   which determines the relative progress for one indicator vis-à-vis the others. Normalized weights are then defined as follows:(5) π j  = π j  ^  ∑ j ∈ J   π j  ^    , ∑ j ∈ J   π j  = 1      Therefore, weight 2 (πj  ) indicates the importance of any one indicator relative to the others. The final index is constructed through the aggregation of individual indicators by using Eq. (6)  below:(6) S D G 9 P r o   I n d e x = ∑ j ∈ G   π j  dy j  dy j ∗   + ∑ j ∈ B   π j  d ( - y  j  )  d ( - y  j ∗  )      where j refers to an indicator, G  is the set of “good” indicators, and B is the set of “bad” indicators [7] .   5 SDG-9 progress index findings 5.1 Global analysis The SDG-9Pro index is calculated in the manner described above for 124 countries for which data are available for this analysis. The results show that between 2000 and 2016, 58 countries (47 percent) progressed towards the SDG-9 targets, while the remaining 66 countries (53 percent) regressed away from these targets. The final rankings of all countries are listed in Annex 1, and the geographical distribution of the 124 countries is displayed in Fig. 1  : the greater the progress on SDG-9Pro, the darker the green color, with those countries with the least progress being shown in yellow. Fig. 2   illustrates the distributional characteristics and overall pattern of the SDG scores in SDG-9Pro. A narrow majority of the countries (63) fall within the inter-quartile range of the plot. Bangladesh and Myanmar show the greatest progress passing the upper whisker of the box plot. On the other hand, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China exceeds the lower whisker of the box plot. All 124 countries fall into one of the four development groups defined by UNIDO [23] : 43 falls into the group of industrialized countries (INDs), 37 into the group of emerging industrialized economies (EIEs), 30 into the group of other developing economies (DEVs) and 14 into the group of least developed countries (LDCs). Of the 58 countries that progressed between 2000 and 2016, 9 are in the LDC group, 19 are in the DEV group, 20 are in the EIE group, and 10 are in the IND group. Comparing these numbers to the total number of countries making up each group, the LDC group has the highest percentage of countries which have made progress in SDG-9Pro (9 out of 14 countries; 64 percent) followed closely by the DEV group (19 out of 30 countries; 63 percent). The third-highest percentage is found in the EIE group (20 out of 37 countries; 54 percent), and the lowest percentage is found in the IND group (10 out of 43 countries; 23 percent). Conversely, out of 66 countries that regressed between 2000 and 2016, the highest percentage of countries is found in the IND group (33 out of 43 countries; 77 percent) followed by countries in the EIE group (17 out of 30 countries; 46 percent). The third-lowest percentage of countries is found in the DEV group (11 out of 30 countries; 37 percent) followed closely by the LDC group (5 out of 14 countries; 36 percent). A grouping of the top 15 ranked countries (those with the highest positive score) and of the bottom 15 ranked countries (those with the greatest negative score) is in line with the percentage groupings in the previous paragraph (Table 2  ). Among the top 15, only two countries are classified as INDs, six as EIEs, three countries as DEVs, and three as LDCs. Among the bottom 15, the majority are classified as INDs (11 out of 15 countries). There are only two countries classified as EIEs, one as a DEV, and one as an LDC.  5.2 Development groups and country rankings We next turn to an examination of country progress on the five indicators. Fig. 3   shows the distribution of normalized scores by the four development groups, both the SDG-9Pro score as well as the individual scores for the five indicators. For the overall SDG-9Pro score, INDs made the least progress, with more than 75 percent of the countries in this group regressing while over 50 percent of the countries in the other three groups progressed. For the indicator MVAgdp, the median value for DEVs, EIEs, and INDs are all negative, while for LDCs, it is positive. This implies that over 50 percent of countries in the LDC group progressed, while more than half of the countries in the other three development groups regressed. For the indicator MVApc, more than 75 percent of countries in DEV and EIE groups progressed; China made the greatest progress with a score of 1.86. For EMPsh, INDs performed worst among the four development groups because only one country (Czechia) in that group has a positive score, while all other IND countries have negative values. For CO2 mva, over 50 percent of countries in the LDCs group have negative values, while more than half of the countries in the other three groups have positive values. One country in the IND group (Bahrain), has an extremely negative score of −15.4. For the indicator MHTmva, LDCs as a group regressed more when compared with the other three groups. Niger in that group regressed more than any other country; Kuwait in the IND group made the greatest progress with a score of 2.73. We also examine the differences in progress indicators for the five most progressing countries and the five most regressing countries (Fig. 4  ). These radar charts are useful for visualizing those dimensions of development where countries are making the most and least progress. Most importantly, the charts show the need to look closely at the individual indicators in a composite index because some indicators for progressing countries are negative, while some indicators for regressing countries are positive. The left-side radar chart shows the top five most progressive countries. Although Bangladesh and Myanmar show overall progress, they show negative progress for the indicator MHTmva. Similarly, Bangladesh and Viet Nam show overall progress but are regressing on reducing the indicator CO2 mva. The right-side radar chart shows the five countries that are regressing away from their targets. Although Luxembourg and Israel show overall regression, they show positive progress for increasing the indicator MVApc. Similarly, Luxembourg and Canada show overall regression, but they show positive progress for reducing the indicator CO2 mva. Another way to compare country progress, or lack of it, is to examine the actual values for 2000 and 2016 and the associated targets for a given parameter. Table 3   shows these values for one indicator, MVAgdp. For the top five countries that progressed, their 2016 MVAgdp values are greater than their country-specific targets set based on the threshold value common to all countries, initial value, and changes between y1  and y0  in Section 4.1). Similarly, for the five countries that failed to meet their targets, their 2016 MVAgdp values are less than their country-specific targets which are determined based on the initial year value and the common threshold.   6 Sensitivity tests for alternative formulation of indicators and weights in the system of thresholds We test alternative formulations for the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable industrial development to ascertain the robustness of country rankings by SDG-9Pro compared with indicators selected by the United Nations Inter-Agency Expert Group [4] . The three variants are total MVA rather than MVA as a percentage of GDP, total manufacturing employment rather than manufacturing employment as a percentage of total employment, and total CO2  emissions rather than CO2  emission intensity. We wish to explore if alternative formulations of indicators have a significant impact on country rankings by SDG-9Pro and the relative impact of these three alternative formulations on country rankings. In addition, we test the impact of changing threshold values on the number of countries progressing and regressing on the SDG-9Pro index compared to the baseline case. 6.1 Sensitivity Test 1: Total CO2  emissions instead of CO2  emission intensity A potential indicator variant for CO2  emission intensity is total CO2  emissions [20] . At the global level, CO2  emission intensity of the manufacturing sector declined in 91 of the 124 countries (73 percent) and increased in the other 33 countries (27 percent), whereas total CO2  emissions from the manufacturing sector declined in 54 of the countries (44 percent) and increased in the other 70 (56 percent). This change in the formulation of the CO2  emission variable to total emissions reveals that fewer countries have been successful in total emission reduction. Within the top 15 ranked countries in the baseline SDG-9Pro index, six are INDs, five are EIEs, three are DEVs, and one is an LDC. Revising the formulation of the CO2  indicator from CO2 mva to total CO2  emissions from the manufacturing sector results in 52 rather than 58 progressing countries (Table 4  ). Conversely, more countries regress, increasing from 66 to 72 countries. The number of progressing INDs increases, whereas the number of progressing DEVs and EIEs declines, and the number of progressing LDCs remains the same. However, for nine of the top 15 countries there is no significant change in the baseline and variant versions of SDG-9Pro. There are four rather than two INDs, four rather than three DEVs four rather than six EIEs and three rather than four LDCs.  6.2 Sensitivity Test 2: Total MVA instead of MVAgdp A potential indicator variant for the share of MVAgdp is total MVA [15] . At the global level, the share of MVAgdp decreased in 79 countries (63 percent) and increased in 46 countries (37 percent), whereas total MVA increased in 111 countries (89 percent) and decreased in 14 countries (11 percent). Using total MVA as an indicator increases the number of countries with positive gains. Revising the formulation of the MVA indicator from MVAgdp to total MVA leads to no change in the total number of countries progressing and regressing compared to the total number progressing and regressing in the baseline. Within the progressing group, the number of INDs increases, and the number of EIEs decreases; the other two groups are almost identical. Within the regressing group, the number of INDs decreases while the number of EIEs increases; the other two groupings are almost identical.  6.3 Sensitivity Test 3: Total manufacturing employment instead of EMPsh A potential variant for EMPsh is total manufacturing employment [17] . At the global level, EMPsh decreased in 89 countries (72 percent) and increased in 35 countries (28 percent) whereas the total number of employees in manufacturing decreased in 50 countries (42 percent) and increased in 75 countries (60 percent). Using total manufacturing employment as an indicator significantly increases the number of countries with gains in total manufacturing employment. Revising the formulation of the employment variable from EMPsh to total employment leads to a significant change in the total number of countries progressing and regressing compared to the total number of progressing and regressing countries in the baseline. In this variant, 73 percent of the countries progress compared to 52 percent in the CO2  variant and 57 percent in the MVA variant. This means that a greater number of countries progress using the total manufacturing employment variant compared to the CO2  and MVA variants. The employment variant results in an increase in the number of progressing INDs, EIE, and DEVs. Moreover, this variant results in an increase in the number of INDs in the top and bottom 15 ranked countries. A comparison of these tests shows that variants in CO2  and MVA selected here do not radically alter the number of progressing and regressing countries. Only the change in the employment variant has a significant impact on the number of progressing and regressing countries.  6.4 Sensitivity Test 4: different thresholds Here we formulate thresholds with a different specification than in the case of the baseline index. In the baseline index, we set as the threshold value the 25th percentile for “good” indicators and 75th percentile for “bad” indicators. Under this test, we change the threshold value to the 75th percentile for “good” indicators and the 25th percentile for “bad” indicators. It means that a country should not go below 75 percent (above 25 percent) of the countries. This specification enhances the threshold reference point for all countries across all variables; at the same time, it gives a higher weight to those variables in which countries comparatively speaking are performing poorly. As a result of this change in the threshold criteria, 72 countries progress compared to the baseline case of 58 countries, and only 52 countries regress compared to the baseline case of 66 countries. Among the progressing countries, the greatest change is an increase in DEVs from 19 to 29, while among the regressing countries the greatest change is a decrease in EIEs from 17 to 10. Out of top 15 progressing countries, there are now nine rather six EIEs, five rather two INDs, but only one rather than four LDCs; there are no DEVs in the top 15 countries.   7 Comparison of the SDG-9 progress index with three other SDG related indicies with CO2  emissions This section contrasts SDG-9Pro rankings with those for SDG-9Per [6] , IST [13] , and the CO2 -Adjusted CIP [12] . It compares the SDG-9Pro with SDG-9Per because it uses exactly the same data for index construction as does SDG-9Pro, with IST because IST has four identical SDG-9 indicators and an alternative indicator for CO2  emissions (intensity estimated based on GDP rather than MVA), and with CO2 -Adjusted CIP because the latter includes four of the five SDG-9 indicators considered here (it has no employment data). We use a linear regression method to see the association of SDG-9Pro with the three indicies. As we anticipated, there is no association between SDG-9Pro and the other three indicies (regression coefficient: −0.05) because the progress methodology used here focuses on the measurement of changes, whereas the performance methodology of the other three focuses on levels. The R2  between SDG-9Pro and SDG-9Per is 0.015, between SDG-9Pro and IST is 0.020, and between SDG-9Pro and CO2 -Adjusted CIP is 0.094. However, as reported by [6] , there is a strong association and a similar non-linear relationship between the SDG-9Per, IST, and CO2 -Adjusted CIP. A possible explanation for this association may be the methodological similarities of the three indicies. A comparison of the 15 top- and bottom-ranked countries between the SDG-9Pro and the other three shows the differences between SDG-9Pro and the three performance indicators and the similarity among the three performance indicies (Table 5  ). Within the15 top-ranked countries in SDG-9Pro, there are only two INDs, whereas most of the 15top-ranked countries in the other three indicies are INDs (Annex 2 for a list of countries). The two INDs in SDG-9Pro, Slovakia, and Czechia, are also in the 15 top-ranked countries in SDG-9Per and IST but not in CO2 -Adjusted CIP. Within the 15 bottom- ranked countries in SDG-9Pro, there are 11 INDs, whereas there are none in SDG-9Per and CO2 -Adjusted CIP and three in IST. There are no countries in common between the15 bottom-ranked countries in SDG-9Pro and the 15 bottom-ranked countries in the three performance indicies.  8 Policy making with the SDG-9 progress index Through its weighting mechanism, the GEP measurement methodology used here has an unique capacity to identify policy arenas needing the most attention. The ranking information shows where each country stands in terms of overall progress towards meeting SDG-9 industry-related targets. In addition to the overall ranking, the double weighting technique for individual indicators, which combined make up the basis for the overall progress score, can be used for two interventions depending on the priorities and interests of policymakers. Weight 1( π ^  j  )    (Step 1 in Section 4.3) is based on the initial position of a country on a particular indicator compared to a common threshold value for all countries and the relative progress achieved among countries for that indicator. Weight 2 (π j   ) (Step 2 in Section 4.3 ) compares the relative importance among indicators for a single country. These weights allow governments both to compare progress on SDG-9 indicators with that of countries with similar levels of economic development as well as to establish policies for indicators that should be of the highest concern. The policy implications of the double weighting system can be seen by looking at the weights estimated for two highly progressive countries with similar income level, Slovakia and Poland, for two indicators, MVAgdp and CO2 mva (Table 6  ). In the case of the indicator MVAgdp, the higher weight 1 for Poland as compared to Slovakia means that Poland is lagging behind Slovakia in the initial year (2000) and that any improvement in MVAgdp which Poland is able to make will count as greater progress than an improvement made by Slovakia. The reverse situation holds for the indicator CO2 mva. The higher weight 1 for Slovakia (1.27) as compared to Poland (1.04) means that a reduction in Slovakia's CO2 mva indicator will count as greater progress than a reduction made by Poland. Weight 2 takes into consideration the relative importance of progress among indicators for each country. In this case, Slovakia experiences greater problems with CO2 mva than MVAgdp (indicated by the higher weight of 0.44 compared to 0.28), indicating that progress on CO2 mva is of greater priority than progress on MVAgdp. Similarly, progress on CO2 mva is of higher relative priority for Poland (0.36) than MVAgdp (0.30). Weight 2 indicators for the ten top-ranked countries illustrate the potential for identifying indicators that have the most potential for increasing progress in meeting SDG-9 targets (Fig. 5  ). The higher weight 2 for CO2 mva identifies this indicator as a higher relative priority for accelerating progress for six out of the ten countries (Bulgaria, China, Czechia, Poland, Slovakia, and Viet Nam). Alternatively, policymakers need to consider the indicator with the second highest weight. Similarly, the higher weight 2 for MVApc in two countries (Bangladesh and Myanmar) suggests that policymakers assign higher priority to this indicator to accelerate progress. Alternatively, policymakers need to consider policy interventions with the second-highest weight. For Bangladesh, the second-highest weight 2 is for EMPsh, and for Myanmar, the second-highest weight 2 is for CO2 mva.  9 Conclusions T he The SDG-9 Progress Index (SDG-9Pro) integrates five different industry-related indicators into an informative multidimensional index that shows the relative progress of countries in meeting three industry-related targets SDG-9 targets. There are sufficient data to show the progress of 124 over the period 2000–2016. In aggregate, 58 countries progressed towards and 66 countries regressed away from their targets. Less Developed Countries and Developing Countries performed better than Emerging Industrialized Economies and significantly better than Industrialized countries. The five countries that progressed the most are Bangladesh, Myanmar, Slovakia, Viet Nam and Poland, and five countries that regressed the most are China (Hong Kong), Luxembourg, Singapore, Canada and Israel. The four sensitivity tests for indicator formulation and progress methodology thresholds can change the number of progressing and regressing countries. When using the indicator “total manufacturing employment” as a variant for the indicator “share of manufacturing employment in total employment” there are significant changes in the ranking of countries. This variant increases the number of progressing countries and changes their distribution among development groups. However, the variant indicators used for the indicators “CO2  emissions per unit of Manufacturing Value Added (MVA)” and “share of MVA in Gross Domestic Product” do not substantially alter the number of progressing and regressing countries. The sensitivity test that varies the thresholds used in the progress methodology finds surprisingly that a more stringent specification of thresholds increases the number of progressing countries. Unsurprisingly, no correspondence is found between the SDG-9 Progress Index and three performance indicies (SDG-9 Performance Index, Inclusive Sustainable Transformation Index, and CO2 -Adjusted Competitive Industrial Performance Index) that include a CO2  emission indicator because the progress methodology focuses on changes over time whereas the performance methodology focuses on levels at a point in time. Within the 15 top-ranked countries in the SDG-9 Progress Index, Emerging Industrialized Economies and Least Developed Countries predominate, whereas in the 15 top-ranked countries in the three performance indicies, Industrialized Countries overwhelming predominate. Only two Industrialized Countries (Czechia and Slovakia) are in both the 15 top-ranked countries of the SDG-9Progress Index as well as the SDG-9 Performance Index and the Inclusive and Sustainable Transformation Index. Within the 15 bottom-ranked countries in the SDG-9Progress Index, most are Industrialized Economies, whereas there are none to hardly any in the 15 bottom-ranked countries of the three performance indicies. Industrialized Economies dominate SDG-9Per rankings, a mix of Developing Economies and Emerging Industrialized Economies dominate Inclusive Sustainable Transformation Index rankings, and Developing Economies dominate CO2 -Adjusted CIP rankings. There are no countries in common between the 15 bottom-ranked countries in the SDG-9Progress Index and the three performance indicies. The indicator weighting system in SDG-9 Progress Index can be used to identify those indicators which have the most potential to improve a country's overall progress in meeting three industry-related SDG-9 targets. Weight 1 identifies the relative importance of indicators to improve a country's ranking vis-à-vis another country as illustrated by comparing Manufacturing Value Added in Gross Domestic Product and CO2  emission intensity for Poland and Slovakia. Poland vis-à-vis Slovakia would make greater progress by focusing on the former whereas Slovakia would make greater progress by focusing on the latter. Weight 2 identifies which among the five indicators have the greater potential to accelerate a country's progress towards the targets of SDG-9 as illustrated by Poland and Slovakia. Both countries need to assign higher priority to reducing CO2  emissions compared to increasing Manufacturing Value Added in Gross Domestic Product to accelerate their progress. Weight 2 also shows that reductions in CO2  emission intensity in six out of the ten most progressive countries has the greatest potential among the five indicators to further improve their rankings in the SDG-9Pro index. Improvements in Manufacturing Value Added per capita have the greatest potential in two of the most progressive countries to improve their rankings and meet SDG 9 targets. Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and proportion of medium and high-tech industry value added in total value added are the important indicators for two remaining countries out of the ten most progressive countries. In summary, the SDG-9Pro index generates country rankings and policy advice that offer an alternative perspective to those provided by performance indicies. However, if governments use the information generated by SDG-9Pro, they first need to ensure that rankings and policy advise are not significantly affected by alternative specifications of indicators and thresholds.
