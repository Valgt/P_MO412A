It is the basic step leading to public participation and access to judgement (A1).  The right of access to environmental information and sustainable development is related to human rights and environmental protection 3 The main objective of the SDGs, like the right of access to environmental information, is primarily to access and disseminate environmental information in order to protect the environment and the human rights that depend on it (EE2).  The right of access to environmental information enables the achievement of the SDGs 18 Yes, I think so. Access to environmental information is also necessary for the achievement of SDGs. There is a close connection between the two as they relate to life (L1).     Table 3 Suggestions for actions that will ensure the access to environmental information.  Table 3     Theme Category Frequency Sample Opinion   Suggestions for actions that will ensure the access to environmental ınformation Notify the organisation of the ıntended use of environmental ınformation 1 It should be made clear to the relevant organisation what will be done with the requested information, and the organisation providing the information should emphasize how the information can be used and the legal responsibilities related to its use (EE3).  Development of a civil society 1 The strengthening of a civil society means that monitoring mechanisms and decision-makers are independent (L5).  Effective use of technology 3 A structure that can benefit from the blessings of developing technology without interruption should be urgently implemented (EE2).  Improvement of data quality 1 Actions for improving the data quality, effectively monitoring and evaluating data, using technology and technological transfers, training workers, increasing the transparency of activities, and raising awareness of conditions should be undertaken (FE).

Observance of community benefit 1 It is necessary to be open and clear, to be able to answer all questions of the public, to observe the public interest and to ensure that the whole process is transparent (A2).  Practices in the European Union (EU) should be taken as an example 4 National and local governments, just like international governments such as the European Union, need to set a goal of being more transparent and making uninterrupted use of the blessings of developing technology and urgently realise it (EE2).  Practices under the Right to Information Law should be regulated 1 Ensuring the effectiveness of the implementation of the Right to Information Law and other relevant regulations is necessary (L4).  Reporting obligations should be ıntroduced 1 Reporting obligations should be introduced. Activities for raising awareness of the right should be carried out to monitor reports in the society (L3).  Sensitivity of ınstitutions to access to environmental ınformation 1 The sensitivity of individuals and institutions holding public power over this issue is attributed only to the individual efforts of idealistic managers and employees, and there is a lack of institutional and sustainable principles related to the issue (L3).  Social awareness should be ensured 5 Projects and training should be organised to increase civilian oversight (L3).  Public service announcements should be developed 1 There should be compulsory courses on the issue in schools and universities. There should be more public service announcements about it, and environmental cases should be shared transparently with the public without information being distorted (L1).

It is the basic step for public participation and access to judicial action (A1).  Ensuring community awareness 5 As an environmental engineer, I can say that they are intertwined. All over the world, we should not live with a focus on consumption; the production of goods should be carried out with minimal air, water and soil pollution; and we should clear the way for the next generations to have clean energy. We need to plan so that the next generation can live in an environment that is clean and of good quality. This is their right. We should all be responsible for this (EE1).  Making conscious decisions 2 Access to information by people and societies promotes sustainability and influences more informed decision-making (FE).  Citizens having a voice 3 Participation is a very important principle in terms of sustainable environmental law. It enables the public to have a say in the decisions made about the environment in which they live (A3).  Ensures policy making 4 Through access to environmental information, public awareness can be raised and the way for society to take positive actions can be paved. In this framework, public authorities can be pressured to achieve SDGs, or they can actively contribute through civil initiatives (L3).  Citizen support and participation 5 Access to information will have a positive impact in terms of ensuring participation and control (A1).  Ensuring controllability of solutions 5 I think that the principle of transparency will actually have a positive effect on the right of access (the supervision of the administration is also ensured) (EE1).

Legislative deficiencies 3 There are deficiencies in terms of legislation, implementation and access (NE).  Negligence, ıntention and carelessness 1 Negligence, intention and carelessness can be minimised by having access (EE1).  Economic concerns override environmental benefits 2 I don't find the access to be very successful because of the predominance of economic benefits and voter anxiety. These thoughts should be left behind; the big picture should be looked at; and the future should be considered (L1).  Official data are not available 3 Official data must be accessible, especially in the virtual environment, or must be made available upon request (A1).  Lack of transparency 10 I think that the demand for access to information is high but the rate of information acquisition is insufficient. In our country, the institutional structure and regulations are sufficient but institutional reluctance to share information is great (EE3).  Individual ınitiatives ınstead of corporate responsibility 1 The sensitivity of individuals and institutions holding public power over this issue is attributed only to the individual efforts of idealistic managers and employees, and there is a lack of institutional and sustainable principles (H3).  Low level of social awareness 2 Since the mechanisms for participation are at the public level and not at the level where the citizens can use them, they do not lead to results. This is why participation is not realised. In a place where even the access to information is restricted, we cannot go beyond this fact and talk about further levels of participation. People may not even know that there is such a right as the access to information (NE).     Table 6 Turkey's achievement of sustainable development goals.

Keynotes Aarhus Convention  Right of access to information  Sustainable development goals   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction The Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Committee on Environmental Policy of the Economic Commission for Europe was convened under the title “Environment for Europe,” and it opened for signature the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Rose-Ackerman and Halpaap, 2002 ; Mason, 2010 ). Since the meeting that opened the Convention for signature was held in Aarhus, Denmark, the Convention has become known as the Aarhus Convention. The Convention became effective on 30 October 2001 (Bell, 2004 ; Reid, 2004 ; Morgera, 2005 ; MacDonald and Makuch, 2006 ; Etinski, 2013 ; Oliver, 2013 ; Vanhala, 2013 ; Wolf, 2013 ; Nowak and De Baere, 2016 ; Sommermann, 2017 ; Berny, 2018 ; Krämer, 2018 ; Počuča et al., 2018 ; Samvel, 2020 ). The Convention is the first binding international instrument that has attempted to address citizens’ environmental rights issues comprehensively and specifically (Jendroska, 2005 ). It applies to more than 40 states in Europe and Central Asia and sets minimum standards for public participation in environmental matters (Ebbesson, 2011 ). The link between the protection of human rights and the protection of the environment was first recognised in the Aarhus Convention (Lavrysen, 2010 ; Ryall, 2023 ). The Aarhus Convention consists of 22 articles, an annex, and an arbitration section. The purpose of the Convention is explained in Article 1. The parties to the Convention are to ensure that the public has access to information on environmental issues, ensure that the public can participate in decision-making processes for environmental issues, and guarantee the right to apply to the judiciary to resolve environmental issues (Medarova and Antypas, 2006 ; Delreux, 2009 ; Pallemaerts, 2009 ; Zakharchenko, 2009 ; Lanceiro, 2011 ; Szegedi, 2014 ; Cenevska, 2015 ; Ryall, 2019 ; Hadjiyianni, 2021 ; Lee, 2023 ). In order to exercise a right, individuals must be able to have a say in the administrative actions that affect that right. It is not possible to obtain the expected benefit from that right without participation in administrative activities. The Aarhus Convention was actually enacted to ensure that participation would be possible. Access to accurate information about a certain right and what it provides, the opportunity to intervene in the content of that right with the participation of the public, and easy access to fair judgement when obstacles arise in the exercise of the right are indispensable tools for the full exercise of the right in question. These stipulations apply to the right to environmental protection, as well as other rights. According to the Aarhus Convention, public authorities must make environmental information available to third parties. The Convention also guarantees access to the judiciary, which serves as a guarantee for access to environmental information and public participation in environmental decisions. It is also considered a guarantee for the prevention of violations of national environmental laws (Güneş, 2010 ; Kılıç, 2012 ). The most important international instrument guaranteeing the right of access to information on environmental issues is the Aarhus Convention (Aydın-Coşkun, 2002 ). The first topic of the Convention is access to information. This access has an impact in many areas, including environmental education and efforts to raise awareness about environmental issues (Toth, 2010 ). The Convention recognises the right of access to information at the following points. Public authorities shall, when requested, guarantee, within the framework of national legislation, the provision of such information in response to a request for environmental information, including copies of the actual documents containing environmental information.1  1 Aarhus Sözleşmesi md. 4/1.   However, it should be noted that the obligation of public authorities to provide information is not absolute. If a public authority does not have the requested information, it will of course refuse the request.2  2 Aarhus Sözleşmesi md. 4/3.   In addition, the obligation to provide information may be avoided if confidentiality is prescribed, international relations or interests will be damaged, the right to a fair trial will be jeopardised, commercial or industrial information will be jeopardised, intellectual property rights will be adversely affected, or breeding areas for rare species will be endangered.3  3 Aarhus Sözleşmesi md. 4/4.   On the other hand, public authorities may interpret these situations that prevent the right to information in a restrictive manner by considering the public interest (Aydın-Coşkun, 2002 ). In 2014, following a decision taken at the Rio+20 Conference and after a year of work by the intergovernmental Open Working Group, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) were shaped (Griggs et al., 2014 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Pogge and Sengupta, 2015 ). In 2015, world leaders, under the auspices of the United Nations (UN), identified 3 main challenges facing people around the world and 17 goals for addressing the challenges (Sachs, 2015 ; Stewart, 2015 ; Bhaduri et al., 2016 ; Costanza et al., 2016 ; Fukuda-Parr, 2016 ; Gupta and Vegelin, 2016 ; Barbier and Burgess, 2017 ; Dugarova and Gülasan, 2017 ; Owens, 2017 ; Allen et al., 2018 ; Marmot and Bell, 2018 ; Swain, 2018 ; Bain et al., 2019 ; Katila et al., 2019 ; Leal Filho et al., 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ; Fonseca et al., 2020 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ; Chankseliani and McCowan, 2021 ; Biermann et al., 2022 ). One goal is to ensure the continuity of development for present and future generations (Halisçelik and Soytaş, 2019 ; Bali-Swain and Yang-Wallentin, 2020 ). Turkey is expected to achieve these goals by 2030. The three problems identified were ending extreme poverty, combating inequality and injustice, and correcting climate change. The UN SDGs are to end poverty; end hunger; promote good health and a good quality of life; provide quality education; ensure gender equality; provide clean water and sanitation, accessible and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure; reduce inequalities; and ensure sustainable cities and communities, responsible production and consumption, climate action, life in water, life on land, peace, justice, and strong institutions and partnerships for the cause (Anon Anonim a, 2023 ; Anonim b, 2023 ). Six of these goals are directly related to the environment: accessible and clean energy, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, climate action, life in water, and life on land. The main purpose of the study is to reveal the relationship between sustainable development goals and the right to access information, which is the first pillar of the Aarhus Convention. This is because sustainable development goals determine the future perspective of countries, especially in terms of the environment. However, it is not enough just to set goals. There is also a need for tools that monitor and question the steps to be taken in line with this goal. It will be questioned whether the Aarhus Convention can stand out as an instrument that will put forward this mechanism of monitoring and questioning. Ultimately, the analysis in this study will provide policy makers and practitioners with data to show the main shortcomings and good points on the subject.a. 1.1 Clean water and sanitation The main objective is to ensure accessible water and wastewater services for all and sustainable water management. The six subobjectives envisaged for the realisation of this objective are.- Universal and equal access to safe and accessible drinking water for all by 2030,  - Equal access to adequate sanitation and sanitation for all and the end of defecation in public places, paying special attention to the needs of women, girls and people in vulnerable situations by 2030,  - Good water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, minimising the release of harmful chemicals and substances, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and increasing recycling and safe reuse globally by 2030,  - Substantially increased water use efficiency in all sectors and a sustainable freshwater supply to address water scarcity and significantly reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity by 2030,  - Integrated water resources management at all levels through cross-border co-operation where appropriate by 2030,o Increased international cooperation and capacity-building support for developing countries in their water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, such as water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies by 2030, and  o Support for and strengthening of the participation of local communities in the development of water and sanitation management (Anonim b, 2023 ).       According to the Global Burden of Disease studies, between 1990 and 2017, the worst deterioration of water quality was in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania (86% increase in the parameters measured), North Africa and the Middle East (58% increase), and South Asia (56% increase) (Stanaway et al., 2019 ; Tortajada, 2020 ). In developed countries, water quality has also improved in general, but pollutants have multiplied and diversified, putting pressure on governments and utilities to improve treatment processes for both drinking water and wastewater (Damania et al., 2019 ; Tortajada, 2020 ). For Turkey, there is no problem in terms of some of these topics. Some practices such as recycling and water treatment are being implemented in Turkey, but they need to be improved. For example, Istanbul, the most populous city in Turkey, has 90 wastewater treatment plants, the first of which was established in 1988. These treat over 6 million m3  of water per day.4  4 https://iski.istanbul/kurumsal/iski-tesisleri/atik-su-aritma-tesisleri/ .   Kocaeli province, which has the highest number of industrial facilities in Turkey, over 82 million m3  of water was recycled between 2015 and 2021. This water was used as process water in the industry, field washing and green area irrigation in the wastewater treatment plant, process water in the sludge dewatering unit in the wastewater treatment plant and irrigation of green areas.5  5 https://www.isu.gov.tr/icerik/detay.aspx?Id=329 .    1.2 Sustainable cities and communities The aim is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. These are the goals:- By 2030, ensure that everyone has access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and that slums have been upgraded,  - By 2030, ensure that everyone has access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems, with particular attention to vulnerable people, women, children, persons with disabilities and the elderly, by improving road safety, in particular by improving public transport systems,  - By 2030, inclusive and sustainable urbanisation in all countries and a strengthened capacity to plan and manage participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlements,  - Increased efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritages,  - By 2030, the significant reduction of direct economic losses to the global gross domestic product and a substantial reduction in deaths and the number of people affected by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and vulnerable,  - By 2030, a reduction in the negative environmental impact of cities per capita, with special attention to air quality and municipal waste management and other waste management,  - Universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible green spaces and public spaces by 2030, in particular for women, children, older people and people with disabilities,o The promotion of positive economic, social, and environmental linkages between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by the strengthening of national and regional developmental planning,  o The development and implementation of holistic disaster risk management at all levels in line with the Sendai Framework Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction of 2015–2030, and  o The supporting of the least developed countries to construct sustainable and durable buildings using local materials through the provision of financial and technical assistance (Anonim b, 2023 ).       Five sub-headings are needed to realise the Sustainable Cities and Communities goal, one of the sustainable development goals. These are; renewable and green energy, energy efficiency, air quality, environment monitoring and water quality monitoring (Ismagiloiva et al., 2019 ). The concept of smart cities includes specially modified infrastructure of distributed energy, mainly in the form of electricity. The power system provides the basic functionality to many important assets of cities such as telecom networks, wireless sensor network, water distribution, waste management, mobility, road routing, public healthcare, information facilities and others. Power system operation should be optimized to be smart and environmentally friendly (Aamir et al., 2014 ; Ismagiloiva et al., 2019 ). Today, electricity generation is increasingly based on renewable sources. A range of opportunities for energy efficiency in buildings, transportation and industries will save energy by switching from inefficient fossil fuel technologies to more efficient electricity technologies. Energy efficiency plays an important role not only in mitigating global climate change, but also in improving the security of energy supply, business competitiveness and social welfare (Bigano et al., 2011 ; Allcott and Greenstone, 2017 ; Martins et al., 2021 ). Airborne pollution is one of the most prevalent causes of diseases, fatal or otherwise, faced by the developed world. Going by the statistics compiled and released by the World Heath Organization (WHO), around 4.6 Million deaths around the world are caused by diseases directly precipitated by air pollution, such as, Asthma, Bronchitis, Emphysema, Respiratory allergies, and other cardiac conditions, to name a few. Not only diseases and disorders, but air pollution also leads to the degradation of the quality of living around the world, especially in urban areas (Kodali et al., 2017 ). Therefore, environmental monitoring has a very important place especially in terms of monitoring air pollution in cities. Air pollution is another major threat to cities. The World Health Organization cites air pollution as one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five (Martínez-España et al., 2018 ; Ismagiloiva et al., 2019 ). In smart cities, measures to prevent air pollution and reduce existing pollution will be of particular importance. Safe drinking water is the most important resource for life, but maintaining water quality in crowded cities is a challenge. Cities today face challenges such as outdated water infrastructure, expensive maintenance costs, new pollutants and increasing water demand due to rising population levels. As a result, cities need an effective water management system (Hrudey et al., 2011 ; Hou et al., 2013 ; Polenghi-Gross et al., 2014 ; Ismagiloiva et al., 2019 ).  1.3 Life in water The aim is to protect and sustainably utilise the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The following goals will help realise this goal:- By 2025, the prevention and significant reduction of all forms of marine pollution, including water pollution from marine litter and food waste dumping, particularly from land-based activities,  - The addressing and minimising of the impacts of ocean acidification through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels,  - By 2030, increased economic benefits for small island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism,o Increased scientific knowledge, an increased research capacity, and the transfer of marine technology to improve ocean health and enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, particularly small island developing states and least developed countries, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on Marine Technology Transfer,  o Ensured access to marine resources and markets for small-scale fishers, and  o As stated in paragraph 158 of “The Future We Want, a Declaration of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio (2012),” the enhanced conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources will be achieved by ensuring the application of international law, as set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which establishes a legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources (Anonim b, 2023 ).       As mentioned above, the primary goal is to prevent new pollution in the seas as soon as possible and to reduce existing pollution by 2025. In doing so, scientific cooperation is important. Especially underdeveloped countries and developing countries should be supported in these steps. In addition, while protecting the seas until 2030, it is aimed to provide economic increase from sea-dependent activities such as fishing and tourism in underdeveloped countries and developing countries. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the framework legislation that emerged from the Rio Conference and envisages the protection of oceans and related areas, will be supported by international law enforcement. In other words, the aim is both to ensure the sustainability of aquatic life and to derive economic benefits from it.  1.4 Terrestrial life The aim is to protect, improve and support the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, ensure sustainable forest management, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and prevent the loss of biodiversity. To realise this objective, the following steps will be taken:- By 2030, combat desertification; restore degraded lands, including areas affected by desertification, drought and floods; and strive to create a land degradation‒neutral world,  - Promote the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits derived from the utilisation of genetic resources, on which international agreement has been reached, and encourage access to such resources,o Mobilise and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems,  o Mobilise resources from all sources to finance sustainable forest management at all levels and provide adequate incentives for developing countries to develop such management, including conservation and reforestation, and  o Provide the global support needed for efforts to combat illegal hunting and trafficking of protected species, including by building the capacity of local people to have sustainable livelihoods (Anonim b, 2023 ).        1.5 Climate action The aim is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. The goals are to.- Strengthen the resilience for and adaptive capacity for climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries,  - Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and plans,  - Improve education about, raise awareness of and increase the human and institutional capacity to address climate change mitigation, adaptation and early warning, ando Support mechanisms to increase the capacity for effective climate change‒related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing states, with a focus on women, youth, local communities and marginalised groups (Anonim b, 2023 ).        1.6 Accessible and clean energy In order to realise this objective, the aim is to provide everyone with access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy. To realise this, the following steps will be taken:- Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030,  - Significantly increase the share of renewable energy in global energy resources by 2030,  - Double the global rate of energy efficiency progress by 2030,o Enhance international co-operation and promote the investment in the energy infrastructure and clean energy technology to facilitate access to clean energy research and technologies, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technology by 2030, and  o By 2030, developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries, need to expand their infrastructures and improve their technologies to provide modern and sustainable energy services to all within the framework of their support programmes (Anonim b, 2023 ).         2 Method and materials The MAXQDA 24 analysis method, which is a qualitative analysis method, was applied in the study. For this purpose, 15 experts in Turkey were interviewed, and the results were analyzed by this method. The interviewees consisted of three environmental engineers, five lawyers working on the issue, one agricultural engineer, one person working in an NGO on the issue, one forest engineer, three academician on the issue and one doctor. Table 1   provides information about the participants in the study. The NGO employee worked for one of the most important NGOs in Turkey. The following questions were asked of the respondents in the survey.1. Do you have an expertise and/or academic interest in the topic of the article? Can you explain?  2. Are you aware of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?  3. What does the concept of right of access to environmental ınformation mean to you?  4. Do you think that the right of access to environmental ınformation has a link to the realisation of the SDGs? How? Can you explain?  5. Which of the SDGs is the right to access to environmental ınformation directly related to?  6. Do you think that the right of access to environmental ınformation has a positive effect on the realisation of the SDGs? Can you explain in which aspects?  7. Do you think that access to environmental information can be easily realised in legal and institutional terms? Do you find its implementation sufficient in our country?  8. If it is not sufficient, can you explain in which aspects the right of access to environmental ınformation is lacking?  9. What are your suggestions for the effectiveness of access to environmental information in the realisation of the SDGs?  10. To what extent do you find Turkey successful in realizing the SDGs related to the environment? What are your suggestions, if any?     3 Results The first finding of the study was related to the value of access to environmental information. In the tables below, the theme, categories of this theme, and the frequency of the answers given are presented in general. In addition, the most striking answer related to each category is also included in the table as an example. As seen in Table 2  , a significant number of respondents emphasized that the right to access environmental information is valuable as it can help people take action to protect environmental conditions and implement changes where necessary. People need to be aware that they have the right to access environmental information. Another point emphasized is that the right to access environmental information and sustainable development are directly related to improving human rights and environmental protections. The right to access to environmental information is also valuable as it will enable the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. In the survey, the majority of respondents indicated that the right to access to information is an important control tool and therefore facilitates the achievement of the goals. As can be seen in Table 3  , the suggestions for action to ensure access to environmental information cover many topics in many areas. It is clear that the participants have different suggestions. When some of the responses are analyzed, it is seen that the issue of the right to access to information is not fully established in the society. For example, although the international Aarhus Convention already guarantees this right, it was stated that this right should be guaranteed by international conventions. In another response, it was stated that although it is included in the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, it should be included in the Constitution. In other words, the society is not aware that such a right is guaranteed by both international conventions and the Constitution. The other most common views on this right were the need for institutions to share information, the need to raise public awareness and the need to take the practices in the EU as an example. The fourth issue was the impact of the right to access environmental information on achieving the SDGs. As can be seen in Table 4  , the most common responses were social awareness, citizen support and participation, and auditability of solutions. In other words, social awareness, participation and auditability of solutions will be effective in achieving the SDGs in terms of the right to access to environmental information. In Table 5  , the theme of problems in access to environmental information emerges. It was revealed that the biggest problem for the participants was the lack of transparency. Other problems identified are lack of access to official data, inadequacy of legislation and low public awareness on the issue. When Turkey's achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals is analyzed in Table 6  , it is seen that the participants think that Turkey is very insufficient in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  4 Conclusion Sustainable development goals, as the name suggests, aim for countries to develop while taking actions that respect nature and human welfare for future generations. When the development goals are analyzed, it is seen that some goals are more related to the environment than others. Accessible and clean energy, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, climate action, life in water and life on land are directly related to the environment. The Sustainable Development Goals clearly set out the steps that need to be taken to achieve them. However, analysis of the survey data reveals that the extent to which Turkey is willing to achieve these goals is questionable. The first set of data relates to the value of access to environmental information. A significant number of respondents felt that it would be public awareness that would unlock this value. Another important point is that respondents concluded that the right to access environmental information and sustainable development are directly related to human rights and nature protection. Another dimension of the analysis is related to solution suggestions for the difficulties in accessing environmental information. Many suggestions emerged here, but the importance of social awareness was particularly emphasized. In the previous section, it can be seen that even experts on the subject lack knowledge in terms of national and international legislation. In other words, even experts may lack awareness. In fact, a paradox emerges here. While the participants complain about the lack of social awareness, it has been revealed that they themselves have deficiencies in terms of the content of the right to access to information. Another suggestion was the need for organisations to share information. In fact, institutions in Turkey share the requested information in accordance with the country's legislation. However, this sharing does not always yield the desired results. The information provided may be very limited or narrow in scope. Another important comment is that EU practices should be taken as an example. Turkey is a candidate country for EU membership and is harmonizing its legislation with EU standards. In this respect, it would make sense to take EU practices as an example in information sharing. In addition, practices that emphasize transparency not only within the EU but also outside the EU can be taken into consideration. The analysis gathered information on the impact of the right to access environmental information on achieving the SDGs. Three approaches came to the fore here. In order for this right to have an impact on the SDGs, participants think that public awareness needs to be raised. As mentioned earlier, without public awareness of the goals and the rights that affect them, it is impossible to achieve the desired goals. Another relevant outcome is citizen support and participation. Governments are, of course, goal and policy makers. But without the active support of citizens, targets cannot be achieved. When citizens have easy access to environmental information, they will be able to monitor what the government is or is not doing in terms of the SDGs. Thus, problems arising from differences in the practices of administrators will disappear. Another aspect of the analysis is the problems in access to environmental information. The biggest problem here seems to be the lack of transparency. In other words, although there is a right of access to information and an administrative department provides the requested information, there are concerns about the reliability of this information. Again, inadequate access to official data and inadequate legislation come to the fore. In Turkey, although the right of access to information is enshrined in both the Constitution and a special law, the mechanism to control access is not at the desired level. To address these concerns, the administration needs to be more willing to provide information that does not involve national security and trade secrets. The final issue addressed and analyzed in the expert interviews was Turkey's commitment to achieving the SDGs. Turkey was seen as insufficient in this respect. Participants stated that Turkey has taken very important steps in this regard, but these steps are insufficient and need to be improved. The SDGs are designed to ensure the well-being of present and future generations, and Turkey has taken important steps by adopting them. However, there are still problems in fully achieving the goals. Limited public awareness is seen as the most important problem in achieving the goals. Unless public awareness is raised, the right to access information will not be able to fully function as a control mechanism. Achieving sustainable development goals is in the interest of States, their citizens and future generations. However, it should be constantly monitored which steps have been taken or not taken to realise these goals. Citizens are the ones who will do this monitoring in the healthiest way. Therefore, informing citizens about the right of access to information, making them aware of their rights and ensuring continuous monitoring by using this right will facilitate the achievement of sustainable development goals.
