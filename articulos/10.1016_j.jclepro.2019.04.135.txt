                  Poverty remains one of the long-term chronic dilemmas facing the sustainable development of human society during the 21st century. The spatiotemporal dynamics of poor regions, particularly in developing countries, is crucial for realizing fundamental sustainable development goals (SDGs). For decades, many scholars have sought to accurately measure, identify and alleviate poverty at different geographical scales. However, reliable data about the estimation of poverty remain scarce for developing countries, hindering efforts to accurately identify poverty. This paper utilizes the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) sensor nighttime light imagery to identify poor counties in China from 1992 to 2013. Using 16 statistical and spatial features extracted from this nighttime light imagery and using 96 poor counties and 96 nonpoor counties from 2010 as the classification sample, we describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties based on a random forests approach. Our study finds that the number of poor counties is decreasing in a fluctuating pattern and that contiguous poverty-stricken areas are becoming fragmented. The reduction in poor counties exhibits a manner of moving horizontally from the eastern regions to the central and western parts of China, while the number of poor counties in the central and western regions has decreased around the central cities or areas. The Aihui-Tengchong Line is not the dividing line in the distribution of poor counties in China, which means that China's poor can also be found in areas with relatively high population density. Together, the findings reveal that the key to reducing regional poverty is the development of regional economies and the implementation of national macro policies. This paper provides references for formulating antipoverty strategies for each county and offers new insights into poverty estimation and regional sustainable development for other developing countries.

School of Resource and Environmental Sciences Wuhan University 430079 China       Poverty remains one of the long-term chronic dilemmas facing the sustainable development of human society during the 21st century. The spatiotemporal dynamics of poor regions, particularly in developing countries, is crucial for realizing fundamental sustainable development goals (SDGs). For decades, many scholars have sought to accurately measure, identify and alleviate poverty at different geographical scales. However, reliable data about the estimation of poverty remain scarce for developing countries, hindering efforts to accurately identify poverty. This paper utilizes the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) sensor nighttime light imagery to identify poor counties in China from 1992 to 2013. Using 16 statistical and spatial features extracted from this nighttime light imagery and using 96 poor counties and 96 nonpoor counties from 2010 as the classification sample, we describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties based on a random forests approach. Our study finds that the number of poor counties is decreasing in a fluctuating pattern and that contiguous poverty-stricken areas are becoming fragmented. The reduction in poor counties exhibits a manner of moving horizontally from the eastern regions to the central and western parts of China, while the number of poor counties in the central and western regions has decreased around the central cities or areas. The Aihui-Tengchong Line is not the dividing line in the distribution of poor counties in China, which means that China's poor can also be found in areas with relatively high population density. Together, the findings reveal that the key to reducing regional poverty is the development of regional economies and the implementation of national macro policies. This paper provides references for formulating antipoverty strategies for each county and offers new insights into poverty estimation and regional sustainable development for other developing countries.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords DMSP/OLS nighttime light imagery  Poverty  Random forests  Spatiotemporal dynamics  Sustainable development  China    1 Introduction Poverty, which is a chronic dilemma hindering human civilization and development in the 21st century, is the foremost obstacle to achieving sustainable development (Padda and Hameed, 2018 ). According to the World Development Indicators of the World Bank, in 2006, approximately 2.6 billion people were living in poverty. Poor areas are primarily rural regions that are characterized by a lack of adequate food, water, clothing, housing, sanitation and medical services and are often isolated geographical locations with insufficient public infrastructure and services due to harsh ecological environments (Cao et al., 2016 ; Hjorth, 2003 ). Widely noted aspects of poverty include lower literacy rates, shorter life spans, higher infant mortality, higher social conflicts and higher risk of mortality by noncommunicable diseases (e.g., cancer and cardiovascular diseases) (Elvidge et al., 2009a ). Poverty is also associated with the sustainable development of society, the environment and natural resources. Eliminating poverty is an essential task and a realistic objective worldwide, particularly for developing countries. More specifically, the first SDG is to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” by 2030 by reducing at least by half the proportion of persons of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions, ensuring that all men and women have equal rights to economic resources and significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, and building the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations. China, which is the world's largest developing country, has been undergoing rapid economic development (Lo and Wang, 2018 ). The first millennium goal of halving world poverty before 2015 depends heavily on the reduction of poverty in China (Almås et al., 2014 ). However, poverty remains a serious issue for China's modernization, and new features of poverty have appeared in China. Poverty eradication is still the top priority of the Chinese government (Cheng et al., 2018 ); therefore, accurate geographical assessment and identification of regional poverty are urgent for the government and policy makers, whose efforts to alleviate regional poverty require reliable socioeconomic information. The premise of poverty reduction is to accurately identify poor areas and investigate spatiotemporal poverty dynamics and policy effectiveness (Amis and Rakodi, 1995 ). Traditionally, the primary data source for poverty assessment is census or household surveys collected by local governments or national organizations. Although the quality and quantity of economic data have improved in recent years for developing countries (Jean et al., 2016 ), a lack of reliable data remains a major obstacle to sustainable development. Poverty-related data, in particular, are typically scarce and sparse in coverage. In addition, poverty research has come to involve multidimensional assessment that considers different dimensions of poverty and therefore requires more accurate indicators (Yu et al., 2017 ). The substantial monetary cost, time and effort required to perform a census or survey means that developing countries can only conduct them periodically (e.g., censuses typically follow ten-year cycles, while surveys address shorter periods) (Njuguna and McSharry, 2017 ). Different calibers of data sources hamper efforts to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of poverty. The current method of estimating poverty is based on survey data (Klemens et al., 2015 ). In addition, not all countries or organizations conduct periodical surveys in depth (Elvidge et al., 2007 ). Scholars have demonstrated that household surveys are systematically unreliable and biased (Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin, 2014 ). The limitations of traditional data sources challenge geographical poverty identification and assessment in developing countries. Remote sensing data, particularly nighttime light imagery, represent one of the few globally repeatable, objective and consistent sources of observations and have been utilized in studies to quantify socioeconomic, urbanization and energy-related variables and their correlation with human activity (Bunte et al., 2018 ; Cao et al., 2014 ; Keola et al., 2015 ; Levin and Duke, 2012 ; Liu et al., 2012 ; Shao et al., 2018 ). Most related studies provide evidence that nighttime light data correspond well to gross domestic product (GDP), energy and electric power consumption, demographic information and anthropogenic gas emission (Huang et al., 2014 ). Many scholars have demonstrated that poverty, as a phenomenon closely related to human activity, can be investigated using nighttime light data (Almås et al., 2014 ; Elvidge et al., 2007 ; Jean et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2012 ; Yu et al., 2017 ). Poverty is the state of being unable to meet one's basic needs. Nighttime light data are essentially measurements of a standard of electrification. Electrification not only extends the daytime but also improves access to healthcare, food, shelter, education and safety (Smith and Wills, 2018 ). Consequently, while nighttime light is only one element related to poverty, there are many reasons why nighttime light can serve as an accurate and useful proxy for analysis at the regional, county, provincial or national scales. However, the cited studies also include statistical data and thus cannot avoid the influence of such data on their poverty research. Against this backdrop, using 16 statistical and spatial features extracted from nighttime light imagery and 96 poor counties and 96 nonpoor counties in 2010 as a training set, we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties in China from 1992 to 2013. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2  describes the data source and processing and introduces the method. Section 3  describes the spatiotemporal dynamics of China's poor counties. The discussion and conclusions are provided in Section 4 .  2 Data and methods 2.1 Data source and processing The study area includes 2554 counties of 31 provinces (except Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) across China. To assist the reader in understanding the location of these provinces and counties in China, Fig. 1   provides a map of administrative divisions at the county and provincial levels. The administrative boundaries data used in this study are provided by the National Geomatics Center of China (NGCC), with a scale of 1:4000000. Nighttime light imagery from 1992 to 2013 was generated by satellites from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), which belongs to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The imagery was downloaded from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) (http://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/download.html ). The data (Stable Lights) range from 0 to 63 at a resolution of 30 × 30 arcseconds, with occasional sources of noise (e.g., lightning, clouds, firelights and burning gas) already eliminated. There are six DMSP satellites (F10, F12, F14, F15, F16 and F18), which have provided annual products for more than 22 years. The global radiance calibrated nighttime light (RCNL) data for 2006 were downloaded from NOAA/NGDC and do not include saturated pixels. Differences in satellite orbits and sensor degradation cause imagery products to be incompatible across different years. It is necessary to intercalibrate and correct geometric errors in nighttime light images to ensure the consistency of different data sources (Elvidge et al., 2009b ; Zhao et al., 2015 ). Another constraint that limits the reliability and accuracy of applications using DMSP/OLS data is pixel saturation. An approach for calibrating and desaturating time-series imagery data developed by Shi et al. (2016)  is employed to reduce the discrepancies. The approach intercalibrates the data using the modified invariant region (MIR) method, which involves two aspects. This paper first reduces the saturation effect through four steps: 1) select Japan as an invariant region, 2) extract the Japan RCNL data as the reference image, 3) construct a model using the nighttime light imagery and the 2006 RCNL data for Japan, and 4) intercalibrate the global data using the model resulting from the third step. The second aspect of this paper is to correct the discontinuity effect through the following two steps: 1) intra-annual composition of the data is accomplished using the mean of the two satellites for the same year; 2) interannual correction confirms the pixel value by comparing the data between adjacent years. By applying this approach, we obtain the intercalibrated imagery data from 1992 to 2013.  2.2 Identification of poor counties Nighttime light imagery is available at the global scale and contains abundant information that could be related to human activity. Unfortunately, it is challenging to extract meaningful insights from data at such a scale, and scholars tend to focus on investigating relationships between simple statistical characteristics of nighttime light data and variables related to human activity. Recent applications of ensemble learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, boosting) to large-scale image data sets have received increasing interest and resulted in marked improvements in classification; in particular, these techniques are generally accurate and robust in supervised learning regimes (Jean et al., 2016 ). Therefore, we utilize random forests (RF) as implemented in the “RandomForest” package in R 3.4.2 statistical software to predict poverty probability at the county level in China from 1992 to 2013 based on 16 statistical and spatial features extracted from nighttime light imagery. RF is an ensemble of individual tree predictors and consists of a number of trees, with each tree grown using a form of randomization; the method was developed by Breiman (2001)  to improve the classification and regression trees (CART) method by employing combinations of decision trees (Mutanga et al., 2012 ; Shi and Horvath, 2006 ; Hu et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ). In the RF classifier, each tree contributes with a single vote to the assignation of the most frequent class to the input data set (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012b ). RF uses random subsets of input features in the division of every node, by which the generalization error can be reduced. Additionally, bagging or bootstrap aggregating is used to make the trees grow from different training data subsets to increase the trees’ diversity (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012a ). In this study, the following two parameters must be optimized: “mtry” denotes the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split, and “ntree” denotes the number of trees grown based on the bootstrap sample of the observations. The measure of feature importance is the total Gini decrease in node impurities from splitting the variable, averaged over all trees. Higher values of the mean decrease indicate features that are more important to the classification. In particular, RF has displayed excellent performance in analyses of complex remote sensing data sets and exhibited many desirable properties, such as robustness against overfitting the training data and high accuracy (Stumpf and Kerle, 2011 ). Table 1   provides a description of feature variables, including statistical and spatial features of the nighttime light imagery. The variable selection refers to previous research on statistical and spatial correspondence of nighttime light data reflecting human-related activities. For the random forests parameters, to find mtry and ntree values that can better predict poverty probability at the county level, we construct random forests with 1–16 feature variables and choose the model with the lowest error rate to determine the value of “mtry”, which is 5. The value 5000 is chosen as the “ntree” value for the trees when the error rate of the model is relatively stabilized. As the flowchart in Fig. 2   shows, the selection of a training set is crucial to determining the accuracy of the classification in this paper. For classification, the accuracy of results will vary among different training sets, and even display extreme difference. Therefore, in the process of training set selection, one should not only ensure the accuracy, representativeness, and typicality of the training data but also adjust and optimize the training set through quality evaluation before classification. In this paper, poor counties are chosen from the 14 concentrated poverty-stricken areas designated by the Chinese government in 2010 based on poverty-related indicators (e.g., gross domestic product per capita); nonpoor counties are extracted from other counties identified as nonpoor counties by the government. All the samples of the training set are scattered across different areas. The average 10-fold cross-validation (CV) accuracy of the training set is used as the basis for the selection of the training set in the process of training set adjustment and optimization. That is, the training set with higher accuracy is selected. In this paper, 96 poor counties and 96 nonpoor counties in 2010 with higher CV accuracy (0.7917) are selected as the training set for classification. In addition, the framework that classified poor counties using the RF model derived in 2010 can indicate the relatively spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties. The classification results can be presented in binary form or in terms of probability. The latter can reveal the poverty level and details of each county. Specifically, the closer that the probability value is to 1, the greater the probability that the county is a poor county. Therefore, in this paper, poverty classification proceeds by predicting poverty probability at the county level, and then, a threshold is selected as the cut-off between poor counties and nonpoor counties. To a certain extent, the threshold selection can have significant effects on model accuracy and the predicted prevalence of each class. This paper refers to the threshold selection methods of Freeman and Moisen (2008)  and analyzes the classification and actual circumstances. Counties whose poverty probability exceeds 0.6 are identified as poor counties. To ensure the consistency of county boundaries through all years, we perform boundary fine-tuning of counties in the 14 concentrated poverty-stricken areas. Finally, 672 counties are selected as the comparative sample of poor counties. Accuracy is assessed by calculating the coincidence rate in space between the identification results and the 2010 government designation. On the premise that better identification results can be obtained for 2010, we use the RF model derived for 2010 to predict poverty probability at the county level of all the nighttime light images from 1992 to 2013 and to investigate the relative spatiotemporal patterns of poor counties in China.  2.3 Spatiotemporal dynamics of poverty probability quantification at the county level In this paper, we employ Global Moran's I and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties. Global Moran's I (Eq. (1) ) quantifies the spatial dependency and ranges from −1 to 1 (Li et al., 2017 ; Su et al., 2019 ; Moran, 1948 ). In addition, the value of 1 represents an absolute positive spatial autocorrelation, the value of 0 represents a random distribution pattern, and the value of −1 suggests a chessboard distribution. For the LISA analysis, there are four types (high-high, low-low, high-low, low-high), which are used to describe the spatial clusters and outliers across space (Anselin, 1995 ; Wan and Su, 2017 ).(1) Moran'  I = n ∑ i = 1  n   ∑ j = 1  n   w  i j   ( y  i   − y ¯   )  ( y  j   − y ¯   )    ∑ i = 1  n   ∑ j = 1  n   w  i j   ∑ i = 1  n   ( y  i   − y ¯   )  2            Where n  is the number of counties, y i   is an observation on poverty probability at the county level, and y ¯     is the mean of the value of the variable y . In addition, w ij   is an element from the spatial symmetric weight matrix.   3 Results 3.1 Poor counties in China from 1992 to 2013 The poverty probability at the county level in 2010 is obtained and compared with the 14 concentrated poverty-stricken areas designated by the Chinese government. Based on our results, 491 poor counties (i.e., with a poverty probability greater than 0.6) are included in the 14 concentrated poverty-stricken areas (672 poor counties), representing 73.1% of the counties found following our classification. It can be noted that the research framework proposed in this paper can obtain better prediction results. The spatiotemporal patterns of the poverty probability at the county level in China from 1992 to 2013 obtained using this classification model are shown in Fig. 3  . As shown in the figure, there are evident characteristics and dynamics in the spatial distribution of poor counties over time. Poor counties are found in Southwest China, Northwest China, Central China and parts of other regions that are mountainous and hilly, such as the Tibetan Plateau, Yungui Plateau, Southeast Hills, Qilian and Helan. In addition, it is obvious that the poor counties of China are contiguous in distribution. The poor counties in China have been decreasing over a period of more than 20 years of economic development. The number of poor counties in Northeast China, North China and South China has decreased faster than the number of poor counties in other regions, and the number of poor counties in the Xinjiang and Sichuan-Chongqing regions has also significantly decreased. In terms of the spatial distribution of the poor counties becoming nonpoor counties, poor counties that are adjacent to nonpoor counties are more easily transformed into nonpoor counties, particularly in areas of urban agglomeration. The distribution of poor counties is contiguous, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of contiguous poverty-stricken areas from 1992 to 2013 are evident in China. The boundary change of contiguous poverty-stricken areas indicates that the spatial distribution of poverty-stricken areas tends to be complicated and displays obvious regional characteristics. With respect to Northeast China, the boundary change in the poverty-stricken areas is highly related to the terrain features; that is, the counties distributed in the plain are more conducive to poverty alleviation than counties with other terrain. The eastern boundary of the contiguous poverty-stricken areas has moved towards western China and become more complex in the fluctuation over time. In the interior regions of the contiguous poverty-stricken areas, certain developed cities or regions are exerting radiation influence on surrounding counties to promote poverty reduction. In addition, the internal fragmentation of the contiguous poverty-stricken areas is intensifying. Furthermore, a degree of progress has been achieved in poverty alleviation in western China.  3.2 Spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties Fig. 4   shows the Global Moran's I of poverty probability at the county level from 1992 to 2013. The results reveal a strong spatial autocorrelation of the poverty probability among counties in China; all the values are over 0.7. In addition, the changes in value fluctuation are relatively small, which indicates that the distribution of poor counties and nonpoor counties in China has been highly related to the spatial distribution for many years. The relatively small changes in value fluctuation also indicate that the counties with similar development levels have prominent spatial agglomerations. The LISA maps for 1992 to 2013 have similar distribution characteristics; therefore, this paper uses 2010 as an example to investigate the local autocorrelation of the poverty probability at the county level (Fig. 5  ). The figure shows that the high-high clusters are primarily located in Southwest China, Central China and Northwest China. East China, Southern China and Northeastern part of China are identified as low-low clusters. These results indicate that relatively poor and nonpoor counties have obvious regional distribution features.   4 Discussion and conclusions 4.1 Poverty measurement Poverty, which a worldwide problem and foremost barrier to achieving sustainable development, is a complex phenomenon that includes many dimensions, involving society, economy and environment. Most poverty studies have relied on statistical/survey data from the government or other organizations. To an extent, the authenticity, effectiveness and timeliness of poverty-related research are limited by the shortcomings of statistical/survey data, which indicates the difficulty of identifying regional poverty with accuracy and of studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of poverty regions. Recent research relating poverty and nighttime light imagery reveals that image data offer substantial potential for mining poverty-related information and monitoring poverty dynamics at an adjustable level. RF, a classification algorithm, has achieved generally accurate and robust results in supervised learning regimes. Considering the spatial distribution of China's poor, in this paper, we use RF to identify poor counties from nighttime light imagery based on 16 statistical and spatial features extracted from images and investigate spatiotemporal poverty patterns from 1992 to 2013. Due to the lack of national time-series data for poor counties, all the training samples of the different years used the 2010 samples. Therefore, our results provide an approximate description of the variation of poor counties in China over the past 20 years and identify the regions that were impoverished in these years. As an exploratory study, our research represents the first attempt to estimate poverty only using nighttime light imagery. We consider that our results can effectively reflect the poverty dynamics. We hope that our research can serve as a reference for future researchers and facilitate more accurately targeted antipoverty strategies. The designation of 14 concentrated poverty-stricken areas by the Chinese government in 2010 is based on statistical data on poverty-related indicators from 2007 to 2009. A total of 520, 538, 572, 504, 501, and 512 poor counties (i.e., whose poverty probability exceeded 0.6) in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively, are included within the 14 concentrated poverty-stricken areas, accounting for 77.4%, 80.1%, 85.1%, 75.0% 74.6%, and 76.2%, respectively, of the counties found using the random forests approach. The remaining unidentified counties are distributed in Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Guizhou and Shaanxi provinces, which are developing rapidly. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that the counties of these provinces have eradicated poverty. In addition, the integrality of the concentrated poverty-stricken areas is considered in the designation process. Therefore, using the results regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties, targeted regional antipoverty programs can be directly oriented at poor regions for more sustainable and effective poverty alleviation. In fact, the optimal RF model for classifying poor counties might also change over time. Thus, the model used to classify poor counties using an RF model derived from 2010 would affect the identification of poor counties. However, it can be verified from evidence that the 2010 RF model selected exerts little influence on the classification result. From the perspective of the nature of poverty and the development of poor regions, poor counties are agglomerative and long-term, which means that recently emerging poor counties have actually been impoverished for many years, indicating the reliability and accuracy of the training set for other years. On the other hand, the accuracy of the 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 outcomes demonstrate that the RF model can obtain favorable results. In particular, to a great extent, the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties that have been in poverty or that are areas of change from 1992 to 2013 are identical to China's current situation. These results indicate that the RF model and training set selected in this paper are effective in identifying poor counties, thus establishing a basis for future investigation of the causes of regional poverty and for reasonable and targeted sustainable development suggestions.  4.2 Spatiotemporal dynamics of poverty Poor counties present obvious spatiotemporal dynamics across China from 1992 to 2013. The number of poor counties fluctuates but overall decreases over time. The results reveal that nonpoor counties are mainly distributed in eastern China, while the poor counties are mainly located in the southwestern, northwestern, central and southern parts of China, which are generally mountainous regions, plateaus and hilly regions with relatively poor inhabitants who suffer from more disadvantages in transport, infrastructure and opportunities related to education, social, and financial capital. This finding indicates that geographical barriers and resource endowments hinder or limit regional development. From the perspective of the spatial distribution, the reduction of poor counties exhibits a manner of moving horizontally from the eastern to the central and western parts of China, while poor counties in the central and western regions have decreased around central cities or regions. When poor and nonpoor counties are adjacent, there are often frequent changes between poverty and nonpoverty status, and this conversion in central and western regions is more prominent. This phenomenon might result from incommensurability in regional development, volatility in poverty reduction, complexity in the geographical environment and changes in uncontrollable factors, increasing the fluctuation between poor and nonpoor counties. These findings are in accordance with the development of laws and the existing circumstances of the regions, indicating that the classification in this paper is a valid description of the dynamics and distributions of poor counties in China over time. In addition, our findings indicate that the results for the poor counties identified in this paper can provide reliable time-series data for future research on the linkages and mechanisms between poverty and environment, resources, society, and regional sustainable development. Subject to the influence of many factors, nighttime light imagery necessarily fluctuates to a certain extent. Thus, the results must be considered with certain reservations. However, counties can be basically identified as being in a state of poverty if they remain in the same category for many years. To investigate the dynamics of different poverty alleviation stages and the impacts of phased policies on the distribution of poor counties in China (Fig. 6  ), we further analyze the location of the counties that have been in a state of poverty at every stage. The results present the spatiotemporal changes of poor counties in different stages of poverty alleviation. Figs. 3 , Figs. 5  and 6  reveal that the counties that are experiencing poverty alleviation are mainly distributed in northeastern, northern, eastern, southern, and central China as well as in Sichuan and Chongqing. Compared with counties in the first stage (focusing on poor counties and poverty reduction through development projects), counties experiencing poverty alleviation in the second stage (focusing on poor villages and poverty reduction through development projects) and in the third stage (taking targeted measures to help people lift themselves out of poverty) are generally located in the northeastern, central, eastern and southeastern parts of China. These findings reveal that the key to achieving regional poverty reduction is the development of the regional economy and the implementation of national macrolevel policies. The success of regional economic development and national policy implementation might be why contiguous poverty-stricken areas are becoming fragmented and the number of poor counties in megaregions designated by the Chinese government is decreasing. The change in circumstances of poor counties in different stages of poverty alleviation, particularly for certain counties that are returning to poverty, it is the key to establishing the causes of unsustainable regional development.  4.3 Applications A total of 552 counties (i.e., with a poverty probability over 0.6) are identified as poor counties from 1992 to 2013 in China. These counties are mainly located in the mountainous provinces of Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia and Chongqing. The Aihui-Tengchong Line is an important demarcation line for population density. It also represents the dividing line for the urbanization level and gross domestic product. Fig. 7   indicates that the Aihui-Tengchong Line is not the dividing line in the distribution of poor counties in China; this finding means that China's poor people are also distributed in areas with relatively high population density. There are poor counties located on both sides of the Aihui-Tengchong Line; there are more poor counties distributed across the western region, and at the eastern extension of the line, the poor counties are mainly concentrated in the southwestern part of the region. That is, the distribution of poor counties is impacted by geographical and other factors, whereby geographical factors play a leading role. In addition, the distribution of nonpoor counties is highly consistent with the distribution of the megaregions in the spatial distribution. In particular, the number of poor counties around a megaregion decreases from the center of the megaregion to the periphery. These findings would reveal more useful and interesting characteristics if we performed additional analysis using data for different aspects and made comparisons between different years.  4.4 Implications for sustainability practices Poverty represents the denial of the most fundamental opportunities and options for human sustainable development (Roca-Puig, 2019 ). Poverty eradication, sustainable development, environmental pollution reduction, and ecological fragility improvement are China's ongoing strategic goals and top priorities of the Chinese government. The complex linkages between poverty and other goals have been discussed by many scholars from different perspectives. Jin et al. (2018)  stated that reducing CO2  emissions would affect employment and further influence social poverty. Rodriguez-Oreggia et al. (2013)  found that disasters increase poverty and decrease human development in terms of capacity and assets. Li et al. (2019)  revealed that certain multidimensional poverty counties are exposed to a higher concentration of PM2.5 . In addition, in the areas characterized by a fragile environment, drought, cold, deficient resources and disadvantages in transport and infrastructure are prone to low resource utilization efficiency and environment destruction and likely to fall into a vicious circle-like development dilemma of “fragile ecology – poverty – environment destruction – more fragile ecology” (Cheng et al., 2019 ). Yang and Liu (2018)  partially validated the concept of an “environment – health – poverty trap”. It can be noted that poverty is not only inextricably related to social and economic development but also complexly linked with the environment and ecology. In addition, poverty represents one of the largest obstacles to the realization of sustainable development. It is likely for these reasons that the 552 counties identified as poor counties from 1992 to 2013 are mainly found in mountainous regions with fragile ecologies, that the characteristics of poor counties decrease over time, and that certain poor counties are distributed in the more developed megaregions. Therefore, to promote sustainable development and poverty reduction in China, socioeconomic policies must focus on sustaining basic dimensions of human society over time: environmental protection, resources utilization, ecological restoration, and economic growth. In line with this discussion, the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties can reveal the leading factors and mechanisms of poverty to a great extent and can also be used to objectively monitor poverty reduction and sustainable development. As global-scale data, nighttime light imagery can be used to investigate poverty in other regions, particularly in regions for which statistical/survey data are scare. The accuracy of the classification described in this paper and the objective facts of China's poverty demonstrate the validity of our research framework. Monitoring poverty using this framework in other regions could contribute significantly to achieving the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2015. In addition, our results will enrich related research and provide a reference for future studies.  4.5 Limitations and prospects This study demonstrates that existing nighttime light imagery can be used to identify with fair accuracy the spatial distribution of poor counties across China from 1992 to 2013. Notably, we describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of poor counties, and we calibrate and validate the efficiency and applicability of our results. In contrast to recent studies that rely on census and commercial data sets, our approach only uses publicly available data and is costless to scale across countries over time. This study sheds light on county poverty and the practice of targeted poverty alleviation in China. Our development of a new research framework to estimate poverty in China adds to the knowledge on poverty measurement and can be applied in other developing countries. However, several issues remain open to question. First, nighttime light imagery involves a degree of uncertainty. Second, restricted by reference data sets, we can only compare the results of certain years. Last, only a small number of common fields are applied in estimating the applicability of the results. Future studies should focus on using additional data sets to examine regional poverty factors (e.g., society, human capital, environment, ecology, climate change) over time to further investigate poverty's effects and to design targeted antipoverty programs.
