                  Public participation is crucial for policy-making and can contribute to strengthening democracies and decision-making. Public participation can help to address sustainability challenges and plays a key role in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the SDGs are policy concepts, there has been limited research conducted on how the public perceives the SDGs. Public participation in scientific research has been carried out through citizen science (CS). This paper analyzes the public's perception of the SDGs through CS and how the public can participate in their implementation. The paper uses the OSDG community platform, a citizen science platform with >2000 participants, to analyze public perception of the SDGs. A set of 40,062 excerpts of text (v2023-01-01), a topic modeling and agreement scores by using CorTexT Manager software, was analyzed. The results show that some SDGs, e.g. health (SDG3) or life below water (SDG14), have higher levels of agreement from the public, whilst for other SDGs the public disagree on their perception, (e.g. zero hunger). The paper shows that issues affecting citizens' daily lives (e.g. in People related goals) tend to have a higher level of agreement among volunteers, while economic issues and directives have greater discrepancies. The results provide an overview of the differences in public perception on the SDGs and their implementation. The misperceptions regarding the SDGs should be reduced to achieve a better implementation, improve public participation, and help policy-making processes.

Editor: Damia Barcelo Public participation is crucial for policy-making and can contribute to strengthening democracies and decision-making. Public participation can help to address sustainability challenges and plays a key role in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the SDGs are policy concepts, there has been limited research conducted on how the public perceives the SDGs. Public participation in scientific research has been carried out through citizen science (CS). This paper analyzes the public's perception of the SDGs through CS and how the public can participate in their implementation. The paper uses the OSDG community platform, a citizen science platform with >2000 participants, to analyze public perception of the SDGs. A set of 40,062 excerpts of text (v2023-01-01), a topic modeling and agreement scores by using CorTexT Manager software, was analyzed. The results show that some SDGs, e.g. health (SDG3) or life below water (SDG14), have higher levels of agreement from the public, whilst for other SDGs the public disagree on their perception, (e.g. zero hunger). The paper shows that issues affecting citizens' daily lives (e.g. in People related goals) tend to have a higher level of agreement among volunteers, while economic issues and directives have greater discrepancies. The results provide an overview of the differences in public perception on the SDGs and their implementation. The misperceptions regarding the SDGs should be reduced to achieve a better implementation, improve public participation, and help policy-making processes.

One of the most recent efforts for sustainability is the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for SD agreed upon by 193 member states. The Agenda set out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets, which cover a range of global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, and peace (United Nations, 2015 ). The 17 SDGs can be grouped in five dimensions or ‘5Ps’ of the 2030 Agenda as an intertwined framework: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership (United Nations, 2015 ). Public participation is important for policy-making (Garmendia and Stagl, 2010 ; Heimans, 2002 ), since it affects policy behaviour especially when the issue is seen as relevant to society (Burstein, 2003 ; Castles, 1994 ). Public participation can contribute to strengthening democracies and decision-making (Marzuki, 2015 ; Renn et al., 1993 ). Public participation was highlighted in the Brundtlandt Report (WCED, 1987 ), Agenda 21 (United Nations Division for Sustainable Development, 1992 ), the United Nations (UN) consultations and discussions with multiple stakeholders in the Post-2015 Agenda process (Fukuda-Parr, 2019 ), and as a key factor to achieve the SDGs (Fritz, 2019 ). Public participation provides the following benefits for sustainability (O'Faircheallaigh, 2010 ): sharing information, involving the community at an early stage of decision making, taking community aspiration into consideration, giving the community the ability to influence the outcome of decision making, access to local knowledge, broadening the range of solutions considered, avoiding costly litigation, strengthening the democratic fabric of society, acting as a vehicle for individual and community empowerment, and promoting individual and social learning. Governments must ensure that the public is reasonably well-informed in order to achieve an effective participation for sustainability (United Nations Division for Sustainable Development, 1992 ). For this, communication flows that facilitate contributing to joint action are required (Garmendia and Stagl, 2010 ), as well as an understanding the public's views on future sustainability priorities (Carpenter et al., 2018 ). Public's perception can play a vital role as opinions on a particular topic could help stimulate public debate (information on people's priorities) and understand the underlying causes and mindsets that lead to a lack of progress towards the SDGs (Dhillon et al., 2017 ; Takeuchi, 2015 ). Public participation in scientific research has been carried out through citizen science (CS), which is an approach related to the general public engagement in the scientific knowledge production in which the citizens participate in different ways (e.g. intellectual, knowledge, tools or resources) (Socientize Project - Citizen Science Projects, 2013 ). CS can help address global issues (e.g. biodiversity loss, climate change) and has been increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for addressing some of the challenges set out by the SDGs (Fritz, 2019 ). However, research on CS and the SDGs is still limited, e.g. Bain et al., 2019 . The objective of this paper is to analyze the public's perception of the SDGs through CS and how the public can better participate in their implementation. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2  discusses CS and their contribution to the SDGs; Section 3  presents the methods used; Section 4  provides the results; Section 5  offers the discussions; and Section 6  presents the conclusions.  2 Literature review CS is an approach aimed at engaging the general public in the scientific knowledge production in which the citizens participate in different ways (e.g. intellectual, knowledge, tools, and resources) (Socientize Project - Citizen Science Projects, 2013 ). There are two predominant CS perspectives: 1) emphasizing its role in enhancing scientific knowledge production (“productivity view”) through expanded data collection; and, 2) highlighting its capacity to bridge the gap between science and society (“democratization view”), which facilitates active public participation and incorporating diverse local knowledge and experiences (Criscuolo et al., 2022 ). Although CS has been used for a long time, it has expanded considerably in recent years (i.e. publications have increased by 2200 % between 1995 and 2018 (Pelacho et al., 2020 ) and CS projects were doubled in 12–13 years on SciStarter.com 1  1 Data extracted from the projects (around 200 in 2011) available at: https://blog.scistarter.org/2015/10/ten-citizen-science-projects-and-events-added-to-scistarter-this-week/   (around 200 in 2011) and currently, the number of current projects is 1508 registered projects at the time of writing this paper  ). This has been mainly due to an increase in the public's environmental consciousness and policy and management needs for large-scale and long-term monitoring datasets increases (Fritz, 2019 ; Kosmala et al., 2016 ; Quinlivan et al., 2020 ). Additionally, emerging technologies (mobile devices, social media, low-cost sensors and cloud computing) have made data collection, processing, and communication from volunteers much easier (Socientize Project - Citizen Science Projects, 2013 ). CS can help increase public participation (i.e. scientific literacy), improve time- and cost-effectiveness, and empower individuals, communities, and society to increase geographic reach (e.g. reaching remote locations and different actors) (Conrad and Hilchey, 2011 ; Pateman et al., 2021 ; West and Pateman, 2017 ). CS can also contribute to inform policies at the local, national, and global levels, and thus facilitate more democratic decision-making processes (Schade et al., 2017 ). CS has provided considerable benefits in linking academic research and the public, e.g. on the ecological and environmental sciences that have some of the longest-running CS projects e.g. on conservation (Dickinson et al., 2010 ; Kosmala et al., 2016 ), e.g. on bird protection through the eBird Project (2002, 200+ publications). In spite of CS' benefits, some of its challenges revolve around the uncertainty surrounding data collection (and subsequent use), data quality, and citizen engagement (Ali et al., 2019 ; Conrad and Hilchey, 2011 ). 2.1 Citizen science and its contribution to the SDGs CS has the potential to make a significant impact on global sustainability and advancing progress towards the SDGs (Ballerini and Bergh, 2021 ); however, research on the contribution of CS to the SDGs is relatively new (Fraisl et al., 2020 ), such as through data used for monitoring (Criscuolo et al., 2022 ). Some examples include the Task Group on Data from Participatory Mapping for the SDGs by CODATA (e.g. with how to guides), and the Working Group on Citizen Science for the SDGs by SDSN TReNDS (inform SDG decision-making and combine Earth observation with CS data). These initiatives have focused on specific topics (e.g. environmental data), but have not considered the public perception from a holistic point of view, i.e. on the complete UN 2030 Agenda. Some CS projects have addressed the SDGs in an indirect  way2  2 How these projects are aligned with the SDGs (as a framework); that is, if a project is related to a disease (e.g. Ebola) is associated with SDG3 (health).  : SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG11 (Cities) and SDG6 (Clean Water) constitute the greatest contributions on the indicator level (for SDG reporting) of CS (Fraisl et al., 2020 ); SDG3 (Health), SDG4 and SDG15 were the most addressed in 125 European projects (Moczek et al., 2021 ). However, most of CS projects have had a superficial (63 %) or nonexistent (27 %) involvement with the SDGs (Ballerini and Bergh, 2021 ), and CS initiatives have not considered the SDGs as a frame of their work, beyond funding requests (Jameson et al., 2018 ). There have been limited number of projects that address directly 3  3 Specifically created with the aim to contribute to the SDGs.   the contribution to the SDGs contribution, with the exceptions of WeObserve (open platform for citizen science/citizen observatories and the SDGs), or specific projects (Peace Boat US and crea.blender SDG). Public participation of citizens towards the SDGs has been quite diverse, including (Shulla, 2020 ): citizens' representation in organized networks (e.g. multi-stakeholder partnerships); specific actions that contribute to solving sustainability issues; involvement in the policy action; education (empowerment or education of the citizens or increase their subject competency at different levels, e.g. at organisations, curricula, etc.) and monitoring and reporting (data provision). The main focus of attention has been on SDG performance monitoring and reporting. However, this requires costly and lengthy data collection processes, limited accuracy, coverage and openness (Fritz, 2019 ; Shulla, 2020 ); and their use has been limited to some of the SDGs (Fritz, 2019 ; Parkinson et al., 2022 ). While much attention has been given to the potential of CS for monitoring, it is crucial to understand individuals' perceptions of the SDGs and their implementation and how policymakers should use the SDGs to improve policy development (Ballerini and Bergh, 2021 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ). A number of studies have assessed the public awareness on how stakeholders perceive the SDGs, e.g. educational actors (e.g. Gaspar et al., 2022 ; Queiruga-Dios et al., 2020 ; Seva-Larrosa et al., 2023 ; Smaniotto et al., 2022 ), and a comparison between stakeholders in Korea (Hwang et al., 2021 ). Other large-scale examples of public perceptions towards SDGs include MyWorld survey and GlobeScan (Guan et al., 2019 ). In Europe, 41 % of the respondents stated that they be aware of the SDGs as an overall concept, but do not really know what the SDGs are (29 %) (Eurobarometer, 2016 ). Globally, nearly three out of ten people (28 %) across 13 countries surveyed in 2007 and 2016 stated that they have some or a lot of awareness of the new goals (GlobeScan, 2016 ). Similarly, less than half (49.7 %) of respondents worldwide were aware of the SDGs in the GlobalSurvey (United Nations, 2020 ). At a country level, Ghanaians have higher awareness on SDG1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas SDG9, 14 and 16 were the lowest (Odoom et al., 2023 ). Various studies have shown discrepancies between the public regarding SDGs and their relationship with the main sustainability dimensions (social, economic, and environmental) (Bain et al., 2019 ; Kleespies and Dierkes, 2022 ). In addition, the public understanding of each SDG tends to be quite different from that of the UN descriptions (Dalampira and Nastis, 2020 ).   3 Data and methods This article presents an analysis of a citizen science initiative, OSDG Community dataset, that aims to contribute to a better public understanding of the SDGs. 3.1 OSDG community platform dataset: descriptive statistics The OSDG Community platform is a CS project launched by Public Policy and Management Institute (PPMI) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP ICPSD SDG AI Lab) and a growing community of researchers in March 2021. As of March 2023, 2317 volunteers had joined the platform from 150 countries, with 1895 active users. The project achieved an engagement rate of 82 %, 10 points higher than in September 2022 (for more details, refer to Pukelis et al., 2022 ). Most of the volunteers are between 21 and 30 years old (56.4 %), with the highest education level (44.4 % with a bachelor and 37 % with a master) (Fig. 1  ). Sub-Saharan Africa (424 volunteers; 22.37 %), Southern Asia (351 volunteers; 18.52 %), Northern Europe (163; 8.60 %) and Northern America (152; 8.02 %) are the most well-represented regions by the volunteers, with India (230 participants; 12.13 %), the United States (104; 5.5.%), the United Kingdom (86; 4.5 %), and Nigeria (79; 4.2 %) the countries that have the highest number of participants (see Table S.1.). The CS volunteers' exercise consisted of a labelling exercise: they validated a text snippet's relevance to a SDG (whether they agreed or disagreed), based on their expertise (see Fig. 2   and Data Availability for the full dataset). When formulating this approach, the authors of the paper aimed to ensure that the exercise was straightforward and simple. Text lengths were short (3–6 lines; 100 words) from different sources (policy documents, projects, and publications). All texts were validated by at least, 3 different volunteers to ensure quality. Due to its complexity, SDG17 was not included. Once registered, the volunteer participated in a mandatory introductory exercise, which asked to label 10 pre-selected texts to ensure data quality control. Afterwards, the volunteer was able to review and compare their answers with other members using aggregated statistics. New volunteers were invited to weekly webinars and training history of SDGs, providing a basic training before the exercise. A final agreement score (Eq. 1) was calculated on each text excerpt, which is defined as the ratio of the absolute difference between positive (accept) and negative (reject) labels and the total number of labels received from the volunteers that participated in the exercise. This value ranges between 0 and 1. A score of 1 is the maximum agreement and 0 stands for no agreement. For any equal split of votes, e.g., 4 accept and 4 reject, the score is 0 (total disagreement); however, the score reaches its maximum value of 1 only if all the volunteers who labelled it either accepted or rejects a suggested label (total agreement). The average agreement score is then calculated by each text excerpt. Table S.1. provides some samples of some texts extracted from publications and the classification volunteers (positive vs negative) and the agreement score calculated.AgreementScore i , sdg   = ∣ labels pos  − labels neg  ∣  labels pos  + labels neg        Equation 1. Agreement score calculation With a set of 40,062 excerpts of text, this paper analyzed the last dataset (v2023-01-01; first quarter 2023). Although previous studies pointed out low-quality in some records from the dataset by SDG (see Angin et al., 2022 ), in this study the content from all SDGs were used. The distribution of each SDG is presented in Fig. 3  . SDG16 has 14 %, followed by SDG5 (4338 texts; 11 %), SDG4 (3740; 9.34 %) and SDG7 (3048; 7.61 %) are the top by number of labels whereas SDG12 (1108; 2.77 %) and SDG14 (1141; 2.85 %) the lowest. This distribution shows the interest of volunteers (i.e. they could select the SDG in which they have major expertise), as well as some specific campaigns (e.g. SDG16).  3.2 Topic modeling A topic modeling method was conducted on each text excerpt of all SDGs labelled from the volunteers to unveil the underlying themes or topics of discussion within the text. This method identifies the topics of discussion by identifying similar text patterns and clustering them and has been used for scientific literature, and policy documents. (Malakar and Lu, 2022 ; Sun et al., 2023 ). In this study, the CorTexT Manager software (Breucker et al., 2016 ), a data analysis platform with a set of large text analysis methods based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, was used. NLP is a technique for processing human language, including semantic techniques (e.g. natural language processing and information extraction), statistical techniques (e.g. text retrieval and text mining), or a combination of these (Henkel et al., 2017 ). First, the data was uploaded in a '*.csv' format for each SDG. Second, the data was parsed, and a lexical extraction was used to identify significant terms. This tool incorporates its own automated method to identify significant terms with high “unithood” (Frantzi et al., 2000 ) and “termhood” (Kageura and Umino, 1996 ) to address the time-consuming nature of term extraction within NLP tools. The processing of textual data for extracting the terms relies first in classic linguistic processes (e.g. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python for English) that ends up defining sets of candidate noun phrases (more details in CorTexT Lexical Extraction Documentation4  4 https://docs.cortext.net/lexical-extraction/   ).In this study, the specificity for ranking terms was computed using the chi2score  (Pearson, 1900 ), which considers the number of co-occurrences for each pair analyzed. Moreover, different frequency ranges of terms were employed (e.g. 150 keyword nodes whereas in some SDGs this value was defined as 130–140). Third, the CorTexT's network mapping tool was used to create the co-occurrence networks of each topic. The spatialization used by this software is the classical Fruchterman-Reingold layout (1991) and the Louvain resolution (Blondel et al., 2008 ) was used for the community detection algorithm. The labels of the clusters identified by CorTexT Manager were simplified (e.g. ‘water quality and water sources’ to ‘water quality & sources’). 3). The authors revised and validated the topics identified by the tool. Fourth, on each one of the keywords that composed the clusters, the average agreement score was calculated on each cluster (by considering the number of text snippets on that group) and classified according to the following scale: very high agreement (0.81–1), high agreement (0.61–0.80), moderate agreement (0.41–0.60), low agreement (0.21–0.40) and very low agreement (0–0.20). The sustainability dimensions were used as framework for presenting the results by using the OECD (2017)  classification: People (SDG1, SDG2, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG5), Planet (SDG6, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14, SDG15), Prosperity (SDG7, SDG8, SDG9, SDG10, SDG11), and Peace (SDG16). Partnership was not considered (SDG17 information is not currently available). The rationale for employing this schema is based on practical considerations. A graph theory network analysis was used to analyze the existing relationships between the different elements contained in a network (in this case, all the topics identified), using nodes, vertices and edges that connect these vertices (Ruiz-Frau et al., 2020 ). In this case, the nodes were represented by each topic with the node size represents the frequency, while the edges illustrate the connection between topics. The color of the nodes represents the agreement (green) or disagreement (red) using this scale. Gephi (v. 0.10.1) was used to visualize the graph and can adjust the node colors and sizes using different measures (e.g. point centrality and betweenness centrality). All networks were afterwards downloaded and processed by using this software through different distributions and information about the agreement score was added. For the sake of clarity, in some goals (SDG3, SDG5, SDG11 and SDG12) a cluster of nodes (status golan heights, golan heights east) and some outliers (e.g. cluster with one node and irrelevant terms) were removed. Graphs were displayed with R version 4.2.0 (R Core Team, 2022 ) along with the dplyr (Wickham et al., 2022 ) and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016 ).  3.3 Methods limitations The methods have the following limitations. First, the number of participants (1895 active users) may not allow a complete generalization to public contribution towards the goals in worldwide countries. The generalizability of the results may be limited. Second, the engagement activity of the participants (e.g. some participants could be more prolific than others) might distort the results. Third, perceptions data is based on subjective data and some underlying factors (e.g. job related to the SDGs, previous training) might have an effect on the results. Fourth, the goals were classified in one specific sustainability dimension, not considering the interlinkages (see Bain et al., 2019 ). Finally, the use of topic modeling method for identifying main lines could not have reflected the total whole spectrum.   4 Results 4.1 Agreement scores by SDGs Fig. 4   shows the average agreement score by SDGs. The results suggest there is more agreement in health (SDG 3) (average of 0.78), and life on land (SDG14) (0.77), whereas the lowest agreement is presented on zero hunger (SDG2) (0.56), reduced inequalities (SDG10) (0.57) and responsible consumption and production (SDG12) (0.58). The results were classified according to the OECD (2017)  sustainability dimensions (Peace, People, Planet, Prosperity, and Partnership).  4.2 Topic analysis by SDGs The topic results by SDG and agreement scores are presented according to the four sustainability dimensions (Partnership was not considered as SDG17 information is not currently available). The number of topics (clusters) obtained on each SDG range from five (e.g. SDG5) to ten identified clusters (e.g. SDG8, SDG10 and SDG15). 4.2.1 People This dimension is constructed from SDG1 to SDG5, with the highest level of agreement observed in SDG3 (Good Health and Well-being), and the lowest in SDG2 (Zero Hunger). In terms of topics that are more relevant to people's daily lives, there is generally greater agreement (e.g. professional perspective, working conditions, mental health); however, when there is more disagreement regarding institutional and bureaucratic issues (e.g. policy, licenses and HEIs). This disparity may be attributed to variations in participants' backgrounds and contexts, as well as awareness and knowledge in some goals. Fig. S.1 shows the cooccurrence network map of the SDG1, which consists of eight topics that range from poverty measurement, income & tax transfers, child deprivation, school enrollment, and poverty in specific regions. Poverty measurement is the largest cluster (22 nodes and weight average of 98.10); that is, more texts from OSDG exercise are related to this topic. However, in terms of agreement between the volunteers, poverty measurement (average of 0.76), poverty in South American regions (0.74), and child deprivation (0.70) are the most well-understood topics, whereas state dependence (0.53) and human development & social protection (0.57) are the least (Supplementary Table S.2.). Goal number 2 (Zero Hunger) is composed of 8 topics: public stocks & domestic prices (20 nodes); land use & agricultural land (15 nodes); food production & Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (15 nodes); growth rates & population growth (13 nodes); biofuel policies & mandates (13 nodes); agricultural research & Food Policy Research (8 nodes); risk management & farm level (6 nodes) and food insecurity (3 nodes). Overall, the agreement by the volunteers is lower than the previous: 75 % of the clusters has an average lower than 0.60 points. From these topics, the cluster with the highest level of agreement among volunteers is food insecurity, with a score of 0.8; however, agricultural research & food policy research is the one with the lowest level of agreement (0.53) (Fig. 5  ). SDG3 (Health) is one of the goals with the highest agreement from the volunteers (83 % of the topics having scores above 0.70). The texts that the volunteers used ranged from health insurance, mental health, health care expenditure, gender, or health in different regions (e.g., developed vs developing countries). Three clusters (mental health care, health insurance, and gender and mortality rate), scored above 0.80, indicating a shared understanding among volunteers. There was more disagreement regarding topics related to developing countries and licenses, scoring 0.56 (Fig. 6  ). Quality education (SDG4) is integrated by different topics that range from the institutional perspective (e.g. school system), to the professionals (e.g. school leadership; teaching profession & education), and students (e.g. child development, immigrant students & outcomes). Tertiary education and employment rate constitutes the biggest cluster (34 nodes; weight of 135.41). The agreement between volunteers for all clusters is above 0.70, with teaching profession and education (0.87), school system and evaluation (0.86), and immigrant students and outcomes (0.86) showing higher levels of agreement. Conversely, the highest education institutions (0.71), tertiary education and employment rates (0.74), and child development (0.74) have the lowest agreement scores in this group (Fig. S.2.). Gender equality (SDG5) covers five topics: working conditions (47 nodes), women's rights & violence (38 nodes), women entrepreneurs & support (23 nodes), health care (8 nodes) and discrimination (8). Among these topics, there is more disagreement between volunteers in texts about working conditions (0.73) and discrimination (0.78), while entrepreneurship (0.84) and women's rights and violence (0.84) have the highest agreement among the OSDG volunteers (Fig. S.3).  4.2.2 Planet This dimension encompasses five goals (SDG6, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14 and SDG15), and as with the previous dimension, topics that have a direct impact on citizens are generally better understood (e.g. access to quality drinking water, municipal waste management). Directives/plans are more controversial in some topics (e.g. water directive) whereas for others have better understanding (e.g. marine policy). Climate change (SDG13) shows some discrepancies, with the framework convention having higher agreement compared to adaptation plans and actions. The results of each SDG are presented below. SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) groups eight topics. This goal encompasses topics around government/policymakers (e.g. water risks & policy makers with 29 nodes; policy & government with 20 nodes) as well as directives (e.g. EU framework & directives with 7 nodes), and other topics (e.g. water use, quality drinking water or river management). When the text is linked to the directives (e.g. EU water framework & directives), there is less agreement (0.65); on the opposite, quality drinking water (0.78) and groundwater use (0.76) are associated with the goal by the volunteers (Fig. S.4). SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) groups clusters from resource efficiency, municipal waste, agriculture or relevant stakeholders. In this specific network, the biggest cluster (collection & municipal waste, 38 nodes and 25.36 average of weight) is the one that presented the highest agreement (0.72). Agriculture transport & practices have the lowest agreement (0.44) among all topics in this goal (0.44) (Fig. S.5). Climate change goal (SDG13) is composed of eight clusters (e.g. climate finance, cooperation development, climate hazards and adaptation plans). Framework convention climate change (0.82) and climate finance (0.81) show the highest agreement among the volunteers (e.g. 0.81) whereas adaptation plants & actions (0.67) and disaster risk (0.67) the highest disagreement (Fig. S.6). Fig. S.7 shows the cooccurrence network of SDG14 (Life Below water). As can be observed, there is a higher agreement among the volunteers (majority of nodes are green), being all nodes higher than 0.78. In this specific case, fisheries management & policy (0.92) and marine resources & oceans (0.85) stand out; it is interesting to note that even the topic with the lowest agreement, salmon & adriatic sea, still has a relatively high score of 0.78. SDG15 (Life on Land) is integrated by nine nodes that includes topics about population growth, biodiversity plants, species (e.g. fish and mammals), emissions and laws. Tier indicators (0.51), emissions deforestation forest (0.59) and population growth (0.59) have less agreement; biodiversity strategy action, which is the highest, has more agreement (0.71) (Fig. S.8).  4.2.3 Prosperity Prosperity, that is linked with the Economic dimension of sustainability, is made up of 5 clusters. Topics linked to regions present the major discrepancy (e.g. SDG8 and SDG9), which suggests the complexity of economic issues and policies in different contexts, with the exception of SDG10 (inequality in regions). Similarly, issues related to taxes (social security & taxes; tax revenues) present the lowest agreement, indicating that these topics are more controversial and complex. Affordable and clean energy (SDG7) presents a high agreement among the volunteers (almost all topics are above 0.8). Cluster related to renewable energy & sources presents the major agreement (0.85); however, Electrical Engineering (EE) projects and transactions costs the lowest (0.77) (Fig. S.9). Ten clusters integrate SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth). The average agreement by cluster is above 0.70 (high level), denoting that volunteers share a common understanding of the importance of decent work and economic growth. The highest understanding is in employment & labour force (0.81), income tax & rates (0.80); the lowest in gender gap (0.70), regions (0.71) and exchange rate (0.71) (Fig. S.10). SDG9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure presents ten clusters that range from some sectors (manufacturing sectors), innovation (innovation policy and communication technologies), and services. A monitoring cluster is the one that presented a higher agreement (0.89); whereas regions (0.66) and innovation policy & countries (0.63) were the lowest (Fig. S.11). SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) integrates inequalities linked to specific regions (e.g. urban areas, countries), socio-economic issues (e.g. social security, poverty measurement). In this specific goal, when regions are linked to inequality has a major agreement (e.g. 0.72), as well as poverty measurement (0.75). Trade negotiations (0.75), and social security and taxes (0.60) were the lowest (Fig. S.12). Six clusters of SDG11 range from road traffic and safety, local governments, and development plans. Public transport and access opportunities show the major agreement (0.85) followed by mobility services and public authorities (0.81). However, road traffic and safety (0.71) and local governments and tax revenues (0.73) present the lowest agreement (Fig. 7  ).  4.2.4 Peace Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG16) presents the lowest agreement among the volunteers (0.60) and is integrated with 9 clusters. This goal is essential as no sustainable development is achieved without an atmosphere of peace, human rights, stability and effective governance. The results showed that policy research & social change (0.47) and public policy & analysis (0.49) have less agreement, while international1   criminal law (0.78), universal declaration (0.74) and judicial & constitutional law (0.72) the highest (Fig. S.13).  4.2.5 Agreement at the topic level and polarity Fig. 8   provides a summary of all the clusters from the SDGs and their average agreement categorization, where 20.47 % clusters show a very high agreement level (0.81–1), 64.57 % of the clusters present a high agreement (0.61–0.80) and only 14.96 % exhibit a moderate agreement (0.41–0.60). The ones with the highest agreement between the volunteers were SDG14 (85.71 %), SDG4 (50 %), SDG7 (50 %) and SDG13 (50 %). Prosperity (76 %), Planet (68 %), and Peace (66 %) have the majority of clusters in the high agreement score, with People the one with the highest score in the ‘Very high agreement’ (25 %). These results reflect the complexity and multifaceted nature of the SDGs (e.g. each SDG is composed by a wide variety of subtopics), making it challenging to reach a consensus on specific solutions and measures. The results also highlight the need for more collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders to address this global challenge effectively. Fig. 9   shows the maximum and minimum average agreement scores across all SDGs, with an overall range of 0.20. Although there is generally more agreement in some dimensions, such as People and Peace, the polarity among the volunteers (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum agreement values per goal) is higher in those areas, with a polarity of 0.31 in Peace and 0.22 in People; Prosperity (0.17) and Planet have similar levels of polarity (0.18 in Planet and 0.17 in Prosperity). At the SDG-level, the results show that, although SDG16 and SDG3 have higher levels of agreement, they have more polarity between the volunteers (0.31). Similarly, SDG2 (0.27) and SDG10 (0.30), which have the lowest levels of agreement, shows this divergence (Fig. 8 ). This could be interpreted as a reflection of the diversity of perspectives and the complexity of the interpretation of the goals, highlighting the need for further collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders to achieve a sustainable future.    5 Discussion The insights gained from the OSDG CS exercise presented in this study highlight the increasing interest of citizens (with >2000 volunteers all over the world) in participating in projects directly  related to the SDGs. Public participation has the potential to make a significant impact on sustainability challenges (concurring with Ballerini and Bergh, 2021 ; Fritz, 2019 ). However, CS projects have been often compartmentalized (i.e. focusing on certain goals) or taken a top-down perspective (i.e. CS linked to monitoring), as indicated by Ballerini and Bergh (2021) . The results of this paper show that public participation through CS can be valuable in capturing diverse perspectives, identifying areas of consensus, and raising awareness and knowledge (which complements Shulla's (2020)  arguments). This information extends the CS potential in promoting a broader understanding of sustainability challenges, and priorities and complements the evidence of usefulness CS data, demonstrating that topic modeling can offer a new avenue for analysis (at the topic-level). This study complements previous CS efforts, which have primarily focused on specific areas (e.g. environment) or on decision-making (e.g. SDSN TReNDS), by specifically addressing the aspect of public perceptions on the whole agenda. The topic modeling approach provides additional insights to Fritz (2019)  by demonstrating that public perceptions can be gathered from CS data and can better participate in the SDG implementation, which supports previous studies that analyses public awareness on the SDGs by using text mining techniques (e.g. Hwang et al., 2021 ) and complements studies that have relied primarily on surveys as their main method for data collection (e.g. Guan et al., 2019 ). The distribution of texts from the CS exercise shows that citizens' interest concentrated in some goals (SDG5, SDG3, SDG7), complementing United Nations (2020)  at a global scale. This concurs with Moczek et al. (2021)  and Ballerini and Bergh (2021)  who found CS efforts are typically compartmentalized and should not be an acceptable approach due to the integrative and indivisible nature of the agenda (see United Nations, 2015 ). In terms of public perceptions, the overall average agreement results indicate that there is greater agreement between volunteers on some SDGs, such as SDG3 and SDG14, than on others, such as SDG2, SDG10, and SDG12. These findings are consistent with studies, that suggest citizens' awareness and knowledge of SDGs are concentrated around some SDGs (e.g. Fløttum et al., 2022 ) and some SDGs are more easily understood by the public than others (as discussed by Queiruga-Dios et al., 2020 ; Seva-Larrosa et al., 2023 ; Smaniotto et al., 2022 ). Some clusters have the highest agreement, for example, for the Planet, Prosperity and Peace dimensions, whilst for People and Peace have the highest polarity. This complements Dalampira and Nastis (2020) , who found the public have tensions between some dimensions (e.g. economic versus other dimensions). This concurs with studies that highlight CS projects can add a multifaceted layer of understanding to the complex nature of the SDGs (see Ballerini and Bergh, 2021 ; United Nations, 2015 ). The results of this paper highlight that the public has different views on the SDGs and there was no single “public” view of sustainability (as discussed by Bain et al., 2019 ; Dalampira and Nastis, 2020 ; Kleespies and Dierkes, 2022 ). The in-depth perspective (i.e. the SDG topics) shows that issues that affect citizens on a daily basis (e.g. mental health, working conditions in People; municipal waste, access to water in Planet) have a higher level of agreement among volunteers from different regions. This can be explained as they have first-hand experience and direct experience with these issues and therefore have a deeper understanding of the concerns and challenges related to them, emphasizing the relevance of incorporating local knowledge and lived experiences into the decision-making process (complementing Marzuki, 2015 ; Renn et al., 1993 ). The public is more receptive when topics fits their beliefs (see Bain et al., 2019 ). Another explanation is that they have a better knowledge of some topics (e.g. greenhouse effects), due to wider media coverage (as discussed by Smaniotto et al., 2022 ). Some topics may be more difficult for citizens (there is more disagreement) to agree upon, such as: bureaucratic issues (e.g. policy, licenses or HEIs); economic issues (e.g. taxes); directives/laws for People dimension; Directive/plans (e.g. wastewater directive); adaptation plans and actions for climate change for Planet dimension; and, taxes (social security) for Prosperity dimension. This might be related as they require specific expertise and knowledge on the topic. This highlights the importance of effectively communicating and engaging citizens in these complex topics, which complements Gaspar et al. (2022) , who found the level of knowledge about the technical aspects of a specific complex topic (e.g. food sustainability) is moderate or even low among students. Addressing the issues (and sustainability dimensions) that have more interest for the citizens could have benefits on the other sustainability dimensions (as SDGs are interlinked in nature). The OSDG initiative can be raise awareness and engage the public in sustainability efforts worldwide, but also it has to face long-term challenges of ensuring that such efforts are effective (i.e. having people involved), acknowledged, and sustainable over the long term. The results of this paper have implications for policymakers and individuals (e.g. Principal Investigators and staff) involved in the design and implementation of CS projects. The results suggest the need for policymakers to prioritize certain SDGs and topics to engage citizens more effectively and mobilize support for sustainable development initiatives. Policymakers could use the publicly available data to comprehend public understanding of the SDGs and concerns (i.e. polarity), and to identify areas (at topic level) where action is needed (e.g. awareness campaigns). For individuals involved in CS projects, the results highlight the importance of considering the diversity of perspectives and priorities when designing projects (e.g. projects inclusive, representative and addressing the main concerns), along with the need to engage citizens more directly  to support the Agenda 2030.  6 Conclusions Active public participation is crucial for policy-making, particularly in areas such as sustainability that are relevant to society. However, CS projects that address SDGs in a direct way has been limited, with fewer efforts on understanding volunteers' perceptions from a bottom-up perspective. This paper analyzes the public's perception of the SDGs through CS and how the public can better participate in their implementation. A topic modeling of the volunteer exercise data was used to determine the public's perception of the SDGs towards each of the Agenda 2030 goals (with the exception of SDG17) and how the public can better participate in their implementation. Sixteen SDGs and average agreement scores were analyzed by using a sustainability framework (Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and People) to provide a holistic perspective. The results indicate that while some SDGs, such as health or life below water, have higher levels of agreement (e.g. health or life below water), others (e.g. zero hunger), have discrepancies in certain topics. The results show that CS, when used to gather perceptions data, can be a valuable tool for capturing diverse perspectives, identifying areas of consensus, and raising awareness and knowledge. The results extend the understanding of the potential of CS in promoting a broader understanding of sustainability challenges and priorities. Failing to reach the targets outlined in Agenda 2030 could have a detrimental impact on the lives of billions of people, exacerbating socio-economic and environmental crises. It is imperative that all levels of society become actively engaged in reaching the targets. The results of the OSDG CS project indicate a widespread consensus among the participants on certain issues, providing valuable insights that have the potential to inform and enhance active participation in the Agenda and support the implementation of transformative actions. The results provide an overview of the differences in public perception on the SDGs and their implementation. This study highlights the importance of focusing on specific SDGs and topics where public engagement is needed. This requires a better understanding of public perspectives and targeted efforts to raise awareness, particularly in areas where there are discrepancies. Additionally, CS projects must be designed incorporating inclusivity and representation in order to recognize the diversity of public opinions and priorities. By directly involving citizens in sustainability initiatives and ensuring their active participation, CS projects can better support the global goals, as this aligns with SDG17. Initiatives, such as the OSDG, can play a significant role in raising global awareness and engagement in sustainability efforts. The misperceptions regarding the SDGs should be reduced to achieve a better policy implementation, and does improve public participation and help policy-making processes. Further research should be carried out on underlying volunteer motivations (e.g. the reason why they participate in the activity), which can help to gain an insight into the implementation of these data, as the contribution of CS itself (not only as monitoring). The characteristics of volunteers (country and, gender) and how and where have acquired knowledge about the goals (e.g. alignment with training and, professional career) should also be investigated.
