                  Developing countries, such as China, have achieved unprecedented success in a single Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which usually leads to trade-offs between the three pillars of sustainability, and even destroys sustainability. Quantifying the degrees of coupling among the pillars is essential to support policymakers' systematic actions to minimize trade-offs and maximize co-benefits between the pillars, and simultaneously achieve all SDGs. However, assessing the degrees of coupling among the pillars for the full SDGs is lacking. Here, we evaluate the progress of the pillars towards the SDGs and quantify the degrees of coupling among them at both national and sub-national levels in China from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate that the degrees of coupling among the pillars were almost constant while the degrees of coupling between the pillars and economic growth declined over time. The degrees of coupling between environmental impact and economic growth accounted for 52%–83% of the SDGs’ progress. Reducing the degrees of coupling helps achieve simultaneously economic growth and environmental protection. The higher the degrees of coupling, the lower progress. This trend was universal among all provinces (sub-national level) regardless of their development levels. Our study highlights not only the necessity to track the degrees of coupling among the pillars, but also decoupling environmental impact from economic growth to achieve the SDGs.

Institute of Agricultural Remote Sensing and Information Technology Application College of Environmental and Resource Sciences Zhejiang University Hangzhou China       Developing countries, such as China, have achieved unprecedented success in a single Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which usually leads to trade-offs between the three pillars of sustainability, and even destroys sustainability. Quantifying the degrees of coupling among the pillars is essential to support policymakers' systematic actions to minimize trade-offs and maximize co-benefits between the pillars, and simultaneously achieve all SDGs. However, assessing the degrees of coupling among the pillars for the full SDGs is lacking. Here, we evaluate the progress of the pillars towards the SDGs and quantify the degrees of coupling among them at both national and sub-national levels in China from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate that the degrees of coupling among the pillars were almost constant while the degrees of coupling between the pillars and economic growth declined over time. The degrees of coupling between environmental impact and economic growth accounted for 52%–83% of the SDGs’ progress. Reducing the degrees of coupling helps achieve simultaneously economic growth and environmental protection. The higher the degrees of coupling, the lower progress. This trend was universal among all provinces (sub-national level) regardless of their development levels. Our study highlights not only the necessity to track the degrees of coupling among the pillars, but also decoupling environmental impact from economic growth to achieve the SDGs.

The SDGs were set as a blueprint for a more sustainable future for all (Liu, 2010 ; Griggs et al., 2013 ; Elder and Olsen, 2019 ; Zeng et al., 2020 ). Owing to the pursuit of prioritizing specific goals or targets across countries, there are usually many interactions among the three pillars (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ) while many governments and experts argue that there is a fundamental “trade-off” among the pillars (Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2015 ; Elder and Olsen, 2019 ). However, studies to date either ignored the interactions among SDGs or only considered the interactions among a few SDGs instead of the full SDG agenda (Lu et al., 2015 ; Nerini et al., 2018 ; Lipper et al., 2020 ; Sadoff et al., 2020 ), which may become a smokescreen for hindering the achievement of all SDGs, notably environmental impact following socio-economic development (Zeng et al., 2020 ). Coupling describes a type of interactions among the economy, society, and environment (He et al., 2017 ; Lu et al., 2019 ). To avoid economic, social, and environmental sustainability being perceived as contradictory aspirations, quantifying their coupling degrees at both national and sub-national (provincial or regional) levels is urgent (Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2018 ; Allen et al., 2019 ; Fu et al., 2019 ; NPG, 2019 ; Reyers and Selig, 2020 ). Such information can support policymakers’ systematic actions to promote interdependent cooperation among different managing bodies of each pillar, minimize trade-offs, maximize co-benefits, and simultaneously achieve all SDGs (Bryan et al., 2018 ; Griggs et al., 2019 ; Kroll et al., 2019 ; Friedman et al., 2020 ; Nature, 2020 ; Sadoff et al., 2020 ). In this study, we developed systematic methods to quantify the interactions among SDGs by performing a comprehensive coupling analysis between the pillars of SDGs and economic development in China, the world's largest developing country and the second-largest economy. China faces substantial socioeconomic and environmental challenges over the past several decades, such as regional and income inequality, water and energy shortages, and water, soil, and air pollution (Peters et al., 2010 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). In addition, China is trying to find pathways suitable for their specific conditions to achieve the SDGs (Bryan et al., 2018 ; Hu et al., 2020 ). A variety of sustainability investment portfolios containing synergistic effects and co-benefits across the pillars have been implemented (Gao and Bryan, 2017 ), such as the three major battles to prevent and resolve the major risks, poverty, and pollution, which are comprehensive, integrated, and multi-sectorial. We tracked the progress towards achieving the pillars of SDGs and the degrees of coupling among the pillars of the SDGs, and between the pillars and economic growth [gross domestic product (GDP) per capita] at both the national and provincial levels by quantifying (scoring) the pillars of SDGs from 2000 to 2015 (see details in the Methods). We mainly analyzed the data from 2000 to 2015 because of many environmental indicators have not been counted by the Chinese government since 2016. We addressed four major questions. First, how has the progress towards the pillars of SDGs evolved in China? Second, how has the coupling among the pillars of SDGs varied in China? Third, how has the coupling between the pillars of SDGs and economic development evolved in China? Fourth, what are the pathways suitable for China to achieve SDGs in the next ten years? To answer these questions, we collected annual time series data (e.g., from the indicators and a monitoring framework for SDGs) relevant to the economic, social, and environmental pillars of the SDGs from 2000 to 2015 at both national and provincial levels. We first aggregated the scores for China's three pillars by aggregating 84 SDG indicators, and the SDG Index scores (0–100) were calculated for China and its 31 provinces or municipalities by aggregating the three pillar scores to yield an overall measure of performance in achieving the SDGs. The score between 0 and 100 reflects the placement of the country/province between achievement and failure on the SDGs. We also detected the degrees of coupling among the pillars of the SDGs, and between the pillars and economic growth at both the national and provincial levels. We then compared the difference in the degrees of coupling between provinces with different development levels over the same period. Finally, by fitting these coupling degrees with the SDG scores we found the pathways suitable for China achieving the SDGs.  2 Methods Six interrelated steps (Fig. S1 ) were involved in the assessment and analysis of the SDG scores in China at two different levels (national and provincial).Step 1 Indicator selection and data acquisition.  We first selected SDG indicators (Table S1 ) from (1)  a global indicator framework for the SDGs developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (UNSD, 2017 ), (2) the Sustainable Development Report 2021 by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), which provided a method to measure the baseline SDGs at the national or provincial level (BSSDSN, 2021 ), and (3) a report on indicators and a monitoring framework for the SDGs by the SDSN (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2015 ). Similar to the previous studies (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Allen et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2020 ), we acquired 94 indicators and selected 84 of them for analysis considering the availability, duplication, and relevance of data across spatiotemporal scales.   We also established additional SDG indicators (Table S1 ) based on our understanding of the SDGs and associated peer-reviewed papers (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Our list consisted of 84 indicators at different levels, which exceeded the 83 indicators used in the 2017 SDG Index and Dashboards by the SDSN to assess China's performance toward achieving the SDGs for only one year (BSSDSN, 2021 ). Moreover, we considered the coverage of targets across all 17 SDGs and the pillars of sustainable development for a balanced assessment. While some indicators crossed all pillars, the overall breakdown of indicators was estimated as 17 economic, 27 social, and 40 environmental indicators (Table S1 ). It should be noted that GDP (per capita) is only an optional indicator of economic sustainability or development. Higher economic sustainability does not mean higher GDP, while higher GDP does mean a higher level of economic development macroscopically; vice versa. To avoid contradictions and criticisms, GDP per capita is used to represent economic development in this study, while not as an indicator of economic sustainability. We used a mix of data (Table S1 ) retrieved from official sources with comparable concepts, methods, and results and unofficial sources provided by research institutions with varied techniques (Lafortune et al., 2019 ). The official data (98% of the total data) were retrieved from the China Statistical Yearbook (2001–2016), the National Bureau of Statistics (2001–2016), the China Statistical Yearbook of Environment (2001–2016), the China Rural Statistical Yearbook (2001–2016), the China Civil Affairs Statistical Yearbook (2001–2016), the China Population and Employment Statistical Yearbook (2001–2016), and the China Marine Statistical Yearbook (2001–2016). Unofficial data (2% of the total data) were retrieved from peer-reviewed papers (Shan et al., 2018 ; Chen et al., 2019 ; Wei et al., 2021 ).Step 2 Missing data prediction and bound selection.  Many SDG indicators on long-term and multi-spatial scales have missing data (4.6% of the data need to be predicted) due to a lack of widely accepted statistical tools for recording them (Table S1 ). To calculate the comparable SDG Index scores from 2000 to 2015, we predicted the missing data for SDG indicators by fitting a linear regression model (GBD et al., 2016 ; Huang et al., 2016 ; Huan et al., 2021 ). The country and its provinces with negative interpolation data were assigned a value of 0. To facilitate data comparisons across indicators, we rescaled the indicators to 0–100 (worst to best performance), with “performance” defined as the progress of the country or its provinces toward achieving the overall SDG or an individual pillar based on the indicator values. We normalized the national- and provincial-level data sets of each indicator in accordance with the methodology used in Sustainable Development Report (2021) (Lafortune et al., 2018 ; BSSDSN, 2021 ). The higher the normalized SDG scores, the better the performance toward achieving the SDGs. To eliminate the possible influence of skewed data distribution on the normalized values, we selected the upper and lower bounds of each indicator using methods similar to those described in the Sustainable Development Report 2021 (Lafortune et al., 2018 ; BSSDSN, 2021 ).   We set the upper bounds based on a five-step decision tree (Lafortune et al., 2018 ): (1) absolute quantitative thresholds were used in the SDGs and targets, such as the ratio of industrial solid waste disposal to generation; (2) if there was no explicit SDG target, the upper bound was set to universal access or zero deprivation for specific types of indicators, such as the proportion of illiterate and semi-illiterate persons in the population aged 15 years and over, harmless disposal rate of domestic garbage, city gas penetration rate, popularization rate of urban water use, net primary school enrollment rate, and urban sewage treatment rate, based on the principle of “leaving no one behind”; (3) if science-based targets should be achieved by 2030 or later, the upper bound was set to 100%; (4) if a few countries already achieved an SDG target, the average of the top five performers was used; and (5) the average of the top five performers was also used for the other indicators. We set the lower bounds as follows: (1) for all SDG indicators used in the Sustainable Development Report 2021, the same lower bound used in that report was adopted by the present study; (2) the lower bound for the other SDG indicators was set to the indicator value (one data point) closest to the value of the bottom 2.5th-percentile performer (across the entire country and all provinces over the study period 2000–2015 annually) of the sorted sets of data. If the bottom 2.5th percentile was distributed between two consecutive integers, the lower bound was set by rescaling the distance between the bottom 2.5th percentile and the larger and smaller integers. We specified top- and bottom-performing SDG indicator values, as a lower value indicates better performance in specific indicators (e.g., CO2  emissions per capita) but worse performance in others (e.g., net primary school enrollment rate).Step 3 Indicator normalization and aggregation.  After the national and provincial bound selections, we transformed all indicators linearly to a scale between 0 and 100 at both national and provincial levels as follows (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; BSSDSN, 2021 ; Huan et al., 2021 ):  (1) x ′  = x − min ( x )   max ( x )  − min ( x )    × 100     where x'  indicates the normalized indicator value after rescaling; x  denotes the initial indicator value; and min and max respectively represent the lower and upper bounds for the indicator corresponding to the best and worst performance. All normalized values above the upper bound were scored as 100, and those below the lower bound were scored as 0. The rescaled indicators were expressed as ascending indicators, with higher values indicating better performance so that they were easy to interpret and compare across indicators: a score of 50 indicates halfway toward achieving the SDGs or a specific pillar of the SDGs, and a score of 75 indicates three-quarters of the distance from the worst to best performance. We obtained the SDG Index scores using arithmetic means (Lafortune et al., 2018 ; Xu et al., 2020 ), as described in the Sustainable Development Report 2021. In this aggregate score, all three pillars were weighted equally to express the importance of the integrated solutions that addressed the SDGs equally. Because the numbers of indicators used to measure the pillars were different, we introduced an implicit weighting factor. This factor would be reduced across pillars when the number of indicators increased to measure some of the pillars (Lafortune et al., 2018 ). Each pillar's indicator was equally weighted; namely, the indicator was inversely weighted by the number of indicators that were available for that pillar.Step 4 Estimation of the SDG scores over time.  We estimated the overall SDG Index score at different levels as follows (Lafortune et al., 2018 ):  (2) I i  ( N i  , N i j   , I i j k    )  = ∑ j = 1  N i   1 N i   ∑ k = 1  N i j    1 N i j    I i j k       where I i     represents the SDG Index score for a country or province i , N i     indicates the number of pillars of the SDGs for the country or province i , N i j      denotes the number of indicators for pillar j  for the country or province i , and I i j k      is the score of indicator k  under pillar j  for the country or province i . Similarly, we estimated the individual pillar score at different levels as follows (Lafortune et al., 2018 ):(3) I ′ i  ( N i j   , I i j k    )  = ∑ k = 1  N i j    1 N i j    I i j k       where I ′ i     is the individual pillar score for a country or province i.  We aggregated the scores for China's three pillars (environmental, economic, and social) into a single SDG Index score per year between 2000 and 2015. This aggregation produced 16 scores at the national level and 496 scores at the provincial level, all of which were used to analyze the temporal dynamics of overall performance toward the SDGs. We also pooled separately, the values of the indicator metrics for the pillars of the SDGs at both national and provincial levels. These resulting scores were used to analyze the temporal dynamics of the overall performance toward achieving economic, social, and environmental sustainability at different levels (Allen et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, we performed separate calculations of the changes in the SDGs (including SDG Index score, and the economic, social, and environmental pillar scores) over the period 2000–2015 at different levels by subtracting the normalized scores reached in 2000 from the scores in 2015.Step 5 Coupling and decoupling analyses.  We calculated the degree of coupling to measure the interactive influence within three pillars of the SDGs, and between sustainable development and economic growth systems on each other (He et al., 2017 ; Lu et al., 2019 ). The model for the degree of coupling is presented in the following equation:  (4) C = { f ( E 1  )  g ( E 2  )  / ( [ f ( E 1  )  + g ( E 2  )  ]  / 2 )   2  }  1 / 2       where C  denotes the degree of coupling in a given year, f ( E 1  )     represents one of the pillars of the SDGs in a given year, and g ( E 2  )     indicates the economic growth (or one of the pillars of the SDGs) in a given year. The C  metric is interpreted as follows: 1 = C  ≥ 0.8 indicates great coordinated development between the two systems; 0.8 > C  ≥ 0.7 indicates coordinated development between the two systems; 0.7 > C  ≥ 0.6 indicates low-level coordinated development between the two systems; 0.5 > C  ≥ 0.6 indicates mild dysregulation development between the two systems; 0.4 > C  ≥ 0.5 indicates moderate dysregulation development between the two systems; 0.4 = C  ≥ 0 indicates serious dysregulation development between the two systems. In addition, we selected developed and developing provinces in China for the analysis based on the average degree of coupling of each province during 2000–2015. First, the top five provinces (developed provinces) and the bottom five provinces (developing provinces) in terms of GDP per capita were selected. The average degrees of coupling were then compared between the two groups of provinces. To further assess the decoupling state between sustainable development and economic growth, the decoupling index (DI ) value was calculated as the ratio between (i) the rate of change in the given pillar of the SDGs (e.g., economic, social, and environmental pillar scores) and (ii) the rate of change in the economy (GDP per capita) within a specific period (typically one year) (Liang et al., 2014 ; Lu et al., 2019 ). Let Δ S t  = S t  / S t − 1      (sustainable development) and Δ Y t  = Y t  / Y t − 1      (economic growth), then the DI  value of year t  is expressed as: D I = Δ S t  / Δ Y t    . The DI  metric is interpreted as follows: DI  > 1 indicates coupling (the growth rate of the pillar scores is higher than that of economic growth); DI  = 1 indicates a threshold between absolute coupling and relative decoupling of sustainable development and economic growth; 1 > DI  > 0 indicates relative decoupling (the growth rate of the pillar scores is lower than that of economic growth); DI  = 0 indicates constant sustainable development with a growing economy; and DI  < 0 indicates absolute decoupling (the pillar scores decrease while the economy continues to grow).Step 6 Statistical soundness.  We assessed collinearity (redundancy) between indicators under each pillar using pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficient (r ). No signs of collinearity (r >  0.9) within the pillars were observed (Fig. S2 ); however, when evaluating Pearson's correlation coefficient across the pillars, high correlation coefficients (r >  0.9) were obtained in one case, which is that there was no causal relationship between the two indicators even though the correlation coefficient was >0.9, we retained these indicators (Lafortune et al., 2018 ).   We used Cronbach's alpha (α ) to determine the inter-item correlations within the pillars (Lafortune et al., 2018 ): α  = 0 implied that the indicators were independent, and α  = 1 implied that the indicators were perfectly correlated, whereas α  > 0.7 generally implied that the indicators measured the same underlying construct. Based on this statistic, there were high inter-item correlations (α  > 0.7) for 24 projects, moderate inter-item correlations (0.4 < α  < 0.7) for 21 projects, and low inter-item correlations (α  < 0.4) for 19 projects (Fig. S3 ). We tested the robustness of the lower bounds selected for indicator normalization by considering alternative approaches to setting the worst performance (=0). As an alternative to setting the lower bounds, we censored the datasets at the 5th percentile and used the average of the bottom five performers. No changes were made in the upper bounds, as they represented the goal benchmarks to be achieved by 2030. Only a small number of national or provincial rankings showed more than 10 position differences between the original and changed rankings (Fig. S4 ). We, therefore, conclude that our results are robust regarding the selection of the lower bounds. We explored the uncertainties associated with the number of SDG indicators by uncertainty analyses. The analysis was conducted with all possible combinations of the indicators. For example, there were 17 indicators for the economic pillar, so the possible number of indicators selected for the analysis varied between 1 and 17. When selecting m  indicators from n  indicators, the number of possible combinations was expressed as:(5) C n m  = n !  m ! ( n − m )  !        When the number of permutations exceeded 100,000 times, we randomly selected 100,000 times. Next, we calculated the scores of the economic, social, and environmental pillars for all combinations of the indicators. The distribution of the scores for each pillar in China in 2015 was obtained to analyze the influence of the number of indicators. The uncertainty (variation) in the economic, social, and environmental pillar scores decreased with an increased number of indicators. When there were two or more indicators for the economic, social, and environmental pillars, the corresponding median pillar scores remained almost constant (Fig. S5 ). We measured the sensitivity of the SDG Index scores to indicator values with a widely-used sensitivity index (Xu et al., 2020 ; Huan et al., 2021 ). The sensitivity index is expressed as follows:(6) S x    =   ( Δ X/X )   /  ( Δ P/P )      where S x   indicates the sensitivity index; X  and P  respectively represent the SDG Index score and indicator value for a performer (e.g., a specific province in one year) under the initial condition; and ΔX  and ΔP  respectively denote the change in the SDG Index score and indicator value for the performer between the initial and modified conditions. In the sensitivity analysis, the value of each indicator decreased and increased by 10%, separately, for China at both national and provincial levels. The SDG Index scores were recalculated to obtain the S x   values, and the results indicated that the SDG Index scores exhibited very low sensitivity to changes in the indicator values (mean S x   < 0.2; Fig. S6 ).  3 Results 3.1 Coupling degrees among the pillars of the SDGs China is still far from achieving the SDGs in its development trajectory, and it faces major challenges in achieving its SDGs by 2030. Fig. 1  a demonstrated that the national SDG Index scores increased by 66.9%, from 31.7 in 2000 to 52.9 in 2015. The SDG Index scores of most provinces were lower than 40.0 in 2000, with East China having a higher score than West China (Fig. S7 ). However, the scores of all provinces were also lower than 60.0 in 2015. There were large spatio-temporal variations across pillars, scales, and regions, while the overall SDG scores improved over this period. At the national level, the environmental and social pillar scores increased by 33.8 and 33.0, respectively, while the economic pillar score dropped by 3.1 from 2000 to 2015 (Fig. S8 ). At the provincial level, the environmental pillar scores of 29 provinces continuously improved from 2000 to 2015 (Fig. S9 ), while the corresponding scores of Qinghai and Xinjiang decreased over time (Table S2 ). In addition, the economic pillar scores in 28 provinces improved throughout the study period (Fig. S10 ), while the corresponding scores of Liaoning, Guangdong, and Chongqing decreased over this period (Table S2 ). Moreover, all provinces increased their social pillar scores over time (Fig. S11 ). From 2000 to 2015, the provinces with the most positive changes in scores representing achievement toward economic, social, and environmental pillars were Tibet (21.3), Ningxia (22.9), and Chongqing (18.3), respectively (Fig. S8 ). The coupling and coordination development strategies of the pillars in different regions of China have remained unchanged from 2000 to 2015, which led to little progress in the achievements of SDGs. Our results demonstrated that the degrees of coupling among the pillars of the SDGs varied slightly during this time at the national level (Fig. 1 b) while significantly at the provincial level (Fig. S12 ). The dynamic was also observed (Fig. 2  a–c) in developed provinces (top five richest provinces) as well as in developing provinces (bottom five poorest provinces). Although the degrees of coupling (>0.8) among the pillars have shown great synergy relationships, there has been little remarkable progress (scores improved over 20 from 2000 to 2015) towards the SDGs over time (Fig. S8 ), regardless of development levels (Fig. 1 c and d).  3.2 Coupling degrees between the pillars and economic growth The serious dysregulation development between the economic and sustainable systems in China from 2000 to 2015. We used the coupling model to reveal the quantitative relationship between sustainable development and economic growth (the GDP per capita, which is the most widely used indicator of economic growth (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 )) systems. The degree of coupling between the pillars of the SDGs and economic growth declined from 2000 to 2015 at the national level (Fig. 1 b), indicating a decoupling response of economic growth to sustainable development since 2000. Decoupling implies reducing the degree of coupling between the pillars and economic growth. To further verify the relationship, we also used a decoupling index (DI ) in this study. We found that DI  values tended to be [0, 1] from 2000 to 2015 (Fig. S13 ), confirming a decoupling response of economic growth to the pillars of the SDGs. We then calculated the degree of coupling between the pillars of the SDGs and the economic growth of 31 provinces (Fig. S12 ), and between the developed provinces and developing provinces (Fig. 2 d–f). The dynamics of these coupling degrees (<0.4) were similar to those observed at the national level.  3.3 Decoupling environmental impact from economic growth to achieve SDGs It is time to revise the relationship between economic growth and sustainable development. We performed optimal curve fitting of these coupling degrees with the SDG Index scores, and the economic, social, and environmental pillar scores (Fig. 3  ). The results showed that the degree of coupling of the environmental impact (i.e., score) and economic growth was the main factor affecting the SDG Index scores, economic pillar scores, and social pillar scores, explaining 83%, 52%, and 81% of the total variation, respectively. Moreover, the degree of coupling of the economic impact and economic growth were the main factors affecting the environmental pillar scores, explaining 49% of the variation (Fig. 3 ). The higher the degree of coupling between the pillars and economic growth, the lower the SDG score. These dynamics were also observed (Fig. 4  ) in developed provinces as well as in developing provinces. Generally, the overall progress in achieving SDGs in developed provinces was higher than those in developing provinces. Moreover, we tested the existence of these dynamics with a regression model for individual provinces (Supplementary Statistics) and obtained similar results as those observed across China (Table S3 ). Regressions between the SDGs and the coupling degrees for each province fell into four response types (bell-shaped, U-shaped, linearly decrease, and not significant). In total, 55%–87% of the provinces show U-shaped relationships, indicating that the achievement of the SDGs increased during the sustainable decoupling of the environmental impact and economic growth. Although the regression model evidenced the existing decoupling pattern between economic development and sustainable development, cross-province variations and time effects also need to be considered (Xu et al., 2020 ). Therefore, we tested the fixed effects model and constant intercept model in China (Supplementary Statistics), and in its developed provinces and developing provinces. The relatively poor performance of the constant intercept model suggests that the cross-province difference is important in China and its developed provinces (Table S4 ), and the relatively poor performance of the fixed effects model suggests that the cross-time difference is important in developing provinces. Furthermore, the regression model has limitations due to possibly non-stationary time-series analysis at the provincial level (Zhang et al., 2015 ). Therefore, we conducted the stationarity and co-integration tests on our data. The results showed that our data are stationary and have a long-term co-integration relationship during 2000–2015 (Tables S5 and S6 ). We used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model that has been frequently applied in the last decade (Al-Mulali et al., 2015 ). The robust ARDL regression model results (Table S7 ) indicated consistent relationships of decoupling patterns for all tested provinces in a long term. Although China is off-track to achieve the SDGs by 2030, these results indicate that decoupling environmental impact from economic growth may contribute to the overall response toward achieving the SDGs.   4 Discussion In this study, our results indicate that from 2000 to 2015, the progress toward the SDGs increased due to the sustainable decoupling of the environmental impact and economic growth. At the national level, China's GDP per capita increased by an annual average of 38% to 49,992 yuan, with an overall 6-fold increase from 2000 to 2015 (Fig. 1 b). Economic development leads to a higher demand for environmental quality (e.g., clean soil, water, and air) while providing access to new technology. Accordingly, governors should implement regulatory strategies or provide subsidies and incentives to reduce possible environmental pollution. In addition, stakeholders should apply advanced technologies or management practices (Liu, 2010 ; MFA, 2019 ; Zhuo et al., 2020 ). However, rapid economic growth also consumes natural resources and affects the environment (Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2015 ; Bryan et al., 2019 ); it not only slowed the progress in achieving social and environmental sustainability, but also caused a positive or negative variation in the progress towards economic sustainability in China (Fig. S14 ). Several studies on environmental Kuznets curves (Al-Mulali et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ) have revealed the patterns of economic production and environmental consumption characterized by “high investment, high consumption, and high pollution” will likely undermine economic sustainability. The development model of rapid economic growth over the last four decades has been characterized by inefficient resource utilization and high environmental pollution in China (Liu and Diamond, 2008 ). In fact, environmental behaviors, such as environmental pollution and cleanup are regarded as contributors rather than barriers to economic development (Liu, 2010 ). Our analysis also reveals that even if the decoupling pattern is similar, the economic, social, and environmental achievements of developed and developing provinces are quite different, these changes may be caused by differences in regional characteristics, development stages, technological, and policy factors (MFA, 2019 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). The rapid development of China's economic undertakings, significant improvements in social services, and the overall advancement of environmental protection measures have all strengthened the SDGs (Supplementary Discussion). However, environmental burdens, such as soil-water-air-waste pollution and biodiversity loss (Yu et al., 2019 ; Ma et al., 2020 ) are often linked to other environmental challenges, such as land degradation and climate change, posing a threat to China's sustainability (Pradhan, 2019 ). In fact, these burdens usually are caused by the unchanging coupling development model pattern among economy, society, and environment (Figs. 1 b, 2a–c ). Here, we demonstrate that decoupling environmental impact from economic growth—despite being a major challenge, this could also be regarded as a chance to strengthen environmental protection and increase economic growth—may contribute to the overall response toward achieving the SDGs. For developing countries, such as China, it is not sustainable to pursue economic growth without due consideration of social and environmental objectives (Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2015 ), as only focusing on more rapid economic growth will forego opportunities for achieving higher SDGs (Allen et al., 2019 ). For instance, environmental objectives cannot be realized without specific economic development to provide people with a livelihood, and the result is a poverty trap with mutually reinforced poverty, environmental degradation, and poor governance (Cao et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, for China, there is still a long way to go toward the achievement of its SDGs, as indicated by regional economic, social, and environmental inequality and differences (Supplementary Figs. 7–12 ). Therefore, the Chinese government should make a priority for programs that protect the environment during economic development (Supplementary Discussion) in order to achieve a “win-win” situation for environmental protection and economic sustainability (Cao et al., 2009 ). Despite the potential difficulties associated with making these changes, they can happen in the future (Liu and Diamond, 2009 ). The formulation of national policies has further supported the decoupling of the environmental impact and economic growth (Cao et al., 2009 ; Liu, 2010 ; Gao and Bryan, 2017 ) to address historically impacted environments, particularly around soil, water, air, and solid wastes (Ma et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the Chinese government should consider facilitating holistic sustainability (especially environmental and economic) through integrated policy-driven actions (Supplementary Text 1). Specifically, it is necessary to adopt a more effective environmental protection strategy system (Fig. S15 ) to alleviate the trade-off challenges between environmental protection and economic development (Liu and Diamond, 2008 ; Liu, 2010 ; Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2015 ; Yu et al., 2019 ). In fact, environmental protection has been typically achieved through robust socio-economic objectives, including targeted poverty alleviation, rural revitalization, dual-carbon goal, and the Belt and Road initiative, which have resulted in unprecedented investment in the entire field of environmental sustainability since 1978 (Fig. S15 ). China has gained an increasing awareness of the significance of realizing an “ecological civilization” and decoupling the environmental impact from economic growth. Therefore, sustainable development has been established as a national strategy in China. At present, China is promoting the construction of national sustainable demonstration zones in six regions as part of its innovation agenda, thereby providing Chinese samples and plans for global sustainable development (State Council of China, 2018 , 2019 ). Given the smooth implementation of these responses, China always insists on long-term and large-scale investments (Cao et al., 2009 ), diverse and systematic solutions (Obersteiner et al., 2016 ), and an organizational system focused on classification, coordination, and collaboration (Fu et al., 2020 ); all of these have contributed to the substantial progress and decoupling made in economic, social, and environmental aspects. Despite regional and time variation in the progress toward achieving the SDGs, our analysis indicated that the sustainable decoupling of the environmental impact and economic growth is emerging, and the SDGs are likely to be achieved by 2030 in China. China's experiences in sustainable development are expected to help other countries with their realization of the SDGs, especially developing countries. Based on the experiences of China, other countries should take environmental protection as large-scale public investment in the long term, giving it a higher priority than other sustainable services (e.g., education and infrastructure). The ultimate goal is to promote the further decoupling of the environmental impact and economic growth and achieve the SDGs (Fig. S16 ). Interventions must be implemented systematically with consideration of the degrees of coupling among the economic, social, and environmental pillars. An integrated portfolio of environmental protection programs is essential to achieving the coupling and synchronous development of economic, social, and environmental aspects, and preventing unintended consequences. Countries should implement imperative, tough, and decisive actions to guarantee the achievement of the SDGs, and provide socio-economic and environmental support for the people affected. Because each environmental protection program may contribute to several SDG pillars, and each pillar can be solved by multiple programs, portfolio-wide planning is critical to achieving SDGs. This study assesses the coupling relationship among the economy, society, and environment and finds a possible path to achieve China's sustainable development. The results reported in this study are of practical value to the achievement of the SDGs in China. Our study also provides vital information for other countries and across regions and nations embarking on a similar journey.  5 Conclusion To avoid the pillars of the SDGs (economy, society, and environment) being perceived as contradictory aspirations, our study first assessed the progress of the pillars and quantified their degrees of coupling degrees in China. Although the degrees of coupling among the pillars showed great synergy relationships, there was little progress toward the SDGs during 2000–2015. The degrees of coupling between the pillars and economic growth declined from 2000 to 2015 at both national and provincial levels, which explained 52–83% of the progress towards the SDGs. The higher the degrees of coupling, the lower progress towards the SDGs. This trend was universal among all provinces (sub-national level) regardless of development levels. For this trend, the constant intercept model result suggests that the cross-province difference is important in China and its developed provinces (top five richest provinces), and the fixed effects model result suggests that the cross-time difference is important in developing provinces (bottom five poorest provinces). Moreover, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag regression model results determined the same long-term trend for all tested provinces.
