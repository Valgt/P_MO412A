                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call upon all countries to achieve 17 broad development goals by 2030. The SDGs are a central component of many national development plans and foreign aid strategies. While the SDGs have become a central aspect of development planning, how achievable are they under present conditions? This paper explores a dynamic “middle-of-the-road” baseline global development scenario (Shared Socio-economic Pathway 2) using an integrated assessment model (International Futures) to evaluate progress toward target values on nine indicators related to six human development SDGs. We find that, between 2015 and 30, the world will make only limited progress towards achieving those SDGs with our current set of policy priorities. Our study finds that across the variables explored here (nine indicators for 186 countries = 1674 country-indicators), 43 percent had already reached target values by 2015. By 2030, target values are projected to be achieved for 53 percent of country-variables. This paper highlights special difficulty in achieving targets on some SDG indicators (access to safe sanitation, upper secondary school completion, and underweight children) representing persistent development issues that will not be solved without a significant shift in domestic and international aid policies and prioritization. In addition, we highlight 28 particularly vulnerable countries that are not projected to achieve any of the nine human development related target values in a middle-of-the-road scenario. These most vulnerable countries (MVCs) must be the focus of international assistance.

Pardee Center for International Futures 2201 South Gaylord Street Denver CO 80203 USA     The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call upon all countries to achieve 17 broad development goals by 2030. The SDGs are a central component of many national development plans and foreign aid strategies. While the SDGs have become a central aspect of development planning, how achievable are they under present conditions? This paper explores a dynamic “middle-of-the-road” baseline global development scenario (Shared Socio-economic Pathway 2) using an integrated assessment model (International Futures) to evaluate progress toward target values on nine indicators related to six human development SDGs. We find that, between 2015 and 30, the world will make only limited progress towards achieving those SDGs with our current set of policy priorities. Our study finds that across the variables explored here (nine indicators for 186 countries = 1674 country-indicators), 43 percent had already reached target values by 2015. By 2030, target values are projected to be achieved for 53 percent of country-variables. This paper highlights special difficulty in achieving targets on some SDG indicators (access to safe sanitation, upper secondary school completion, and underweight children) representing persistent development issues that will not be solved without a significant shift in domestic and international aid policies and prioritization. In addition, we highlight 28 particularly vulnerable countries that are not projected to achieve any of the nine human development related target values in a middle-of-the-road scenario. These most vulnerable countries (MVCs) must be the focus of international assistance.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  Human development  Assessment  Projections  Quantitative modelling  Forecasting    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals are an integrated framework of human, social, and environmental development objectives that include 17 goals with 169 targets and 232 specific indicators (Griggs et al., 2013; UNGA, 2015 ). They represent a global agreement across United Nation’s member states that have been widely used in national development plans (UNDG, 2017 ), academic research (Cole, Bailey, & New, 2017; Cumming et al., 2017; Rickels et al., 2016 ), and foreign aid prioritization (DfID, 2017; Wainer & Russell, 2016 ). Much work has been accomplished measuring and monitoring the current status of SDG achievement using indices and benchmarks (Golding et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2016; OECD, 2017; Sachs, Schmidt-Traub, Kroll, Lafortune, & Fuller, 2018; Schmidt-Traub, Kroll, Teksoz, Durand-Delacre, & Sachs, 2017; WHO, 2017b; World Bank, 2017 ). While the SDGs have already influenced political decision-making, how likely are we to achieve these targets if we continue with our current policy prioritization? Are we on the right path? Or, are we quite close to achieving these SDGs and only need to make a few critical policy choices to get us to the right path? Or, are we badly off track to achieve the SDGs with few options to bridge the gap between current levels and indicator goals? The objective of this study is to evaluate a sub-set of human development related SDGs at the national level in 2015 and then to project related indicators to 2030 using a baseline scenario in an integrated assessment model. We analyze nine human development related indicators across eight targets for six goals. These nine indicators represent multiple dimensions of human development, touching on education, health, infrastructure, and economic development. See Table 1   for an overview of the relationship between goals, targets, indicators, variables, and target values used here. We begin by estimating the current state of affairs across the following indicators: extreme poverty, hunger, underweight children, childhood mortality, primary school completion, lower-secondary school completion, access to safe water, access to improved sanitation, and access to electricity. The indicators covered in this research do not include all human development related measures in the SDGs. But the list is broadly representative of human development related SDGs and covers issues in an integrated framework that includes education, health, infrastructure, and economic development targets, sometimes for specific age groups. These indicators were chosen both because of their data coverage and because they are included within the International Futures (IFs) model (see ‘modeling approach’ below). We find that, by 2015, 43.2% of country-indicators had already reached target values. Along a middle-of-the-road development scenario, the percent of target values met is projected to increase to 53.8% by 2030. Regionally, Africa lags most significantly behind in its achievement of the SDGs, with a lower percent of countries achieving target values explored here by 2030 than any other region. Across issue areas, progress toward target values for extreme poverty, primary school completion, access to safe water, and access to electricity is projected to be most rapid, while target values for underweight children, child mortality, lower secondary school completion, and access to safe sanitation are approached most slowly. This research demonstrates that, along a middle-of-the-road development scenario, only limited progress towards achieving human development related SDGs is likely.  2 Projecting development 2.1 Background literature Previous research has projected variables typically related to focused subsets of SDG indicators such as poverty (Burt, Hughes, & Milante, 2014; Chandy, Ledlie, & Penciakova, 2013; Edward & Sumner, 2013; Hughes et al., 2009; Milante, Hughes, & Burt, 2016; Ravallion, 2013; World Bank, 2015 ) hunger, land, and nutrition (FAO, 2017b; Popp et al., 2017 ) energy and electricity access (Dagnachew et al., 2017; IEA, 2017; Lucas et al., 2015; Lucas, Dagnachew, & Hof, 2017 ), outdoor air pollution (IEA, 2017; Klimont et al., 2017; Stohl et al., 2015 ) indoor air pollution (Kuhn, Rothman, Turner, Solórzano, & Hughes, 2016 ) child mortality (Liu et al., 2015, 2016; Mathers & Loncar, 2006; Murray, Laakso, Shibuya, Hill, & Lopez, 2007; You et al., 2015 ), educational attainment (Dickson, Hughes, & Irfan, 2010; Dickson, Hughes, & Irfan, 2016; Kc et al., 2010; Lutz, Butz, & Samir, 2017; Lutz & Samir, 2013 ), education enrollment or graduation rates (Dickson, Hughes, & Irfan, 2010; Dickson et al., 2016 ), and access to water and sanitation (Anand, 2006; Hanasaki et al., 2013; Rothman, Irfan, Margolese-Malin, Hughes, & Moyer, 2014 ). Some studies have projected SDG achievement in interacting issue areas such as in the fields of health (Fullman et al., 2017; González-Pier et al., 2016; Nicolai, Hoy, Berliner, & Aedy, 2015 ) and the environment (van Vuuren et al., 2015b, 2017 ). With exceptions such as the country-specific Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study (Fullman et al., 2017 ), projections of both individual and interacting SDG variables are almost always at the regional or even global level, making it impossible to gauge the likelihood of country-level SDG achievement. Others have attempted to assess the current state  of multiple SDG achievement at the country level through data gathering and monitoring and evaluation. These include the composite SDG Index created by Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (Sachs et al., 2018 ). Researchers have scored countries’ past and current progress toward targets, often focusing on specific groups of targets or countries (Golding et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2016; WHO, 2017b; World Bank, 2017 ). This manuscript adds to SDG research by projecting likely country-level progress on a significant subset of interacting human development related SDG targets across multiple development systems, including poverty, education, health and the environment. The findings can be compared to country level findings where available and aggregated into regional level findings. The variables studied in this report measure human development and are included because of data availability and coverage within the IFs model. Baseline scenarios are useful for setting reasonable expectations for the development of a system and are an important starting point for strategic planning. It is only with established baselines that alternative scenario analysis becomes possible and various methods can frame uncertainty and explore plausible alternatives. At their most basic, methodologies for determining baselines can involve simple extrapolations of historical variables. More complex baselines can incorporate dynamic and non-linear relationships that capture structural transformations to better understand both continuity and change. One set of scenarios in widespread use is the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) (O’Neill et al., 2014 ). The SSPs include five scenarios that frame potential global development trajectories originally developed to capture the uncertainties around climate change adaptation and mitigation and allow for cross-model collaboration. While the SSPs were not created to assess the SDGs specifically, they do provide a useful set of baselines for SDG evaluation as they provide cross-cutting projections of human, natural, and social development and were created as, “reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems” (O’Neill et al., 2014, 387 ). Studies using the SSPs have ranged across many issue areas including the environment (Hanasaki et al., 2013; Hasegawa, Fujimori, Takahashi, & Masui, 2015 ), land use (Popp et al., 2017 ), hunger (Hasegawa et al., 2015 ), levels of conflict (Hegre et al., 2016 ), and poverty (Campagnolo & Davide, 2017; Hallegatte & Rozenberg, 2017 ). SSPs have been used to situate regional scenarios within a global context (Mason-Droz et al., 2016; Palazzo et al., 2017 ). SSP2, the scenario used as a baseline in this paper, assumes moderate constraints mitigating and adapting to climate change and represents a middle-of-the-road development path where future trends are largely consistent with recent historical trends. This scenario is initialized by taking published forecast series across key variables and making them exogenous to the IFs model (van Vuuren et al., 2017; Jiang & O’Neill, 2017; KC & Lutz, 2017 ).  2.2 Modeling approach We use the IFs forecasting system to project the variables corresponding to each SDG indicator (Table 1 ). We chose this model based on its accessibility, breadth of human development sector representation, level of integration, and its ability to produce country level forecasts. IFs can be used to evaluate a range of SDG indicators, and is one of few public IAMs that can assess SDG achievement at the country level (Allen, Graciela, & Wiedmann, 2016; Millennium Institute, 2017; The World Bank, 2018b ). The IFs tool forecasts hundreds of interacting variables across human, social, and natural system dimensions for 186 countries. Projections created by others projecting the SSP related indicators can be exogenously used to drive the IFs model which producing a forecast with internal logical consistency across multiple dimensions of human development (see Appendix A  for a description of the exogenous series used in this analysis). The tool has been widely used previously in academic and policy publication (Hughes, 2016, 2019; Joshi, Hughes, & Sisk, 2015; Moyer, Porter, Johnson, Moyer, & Bohl, 2015; Moyer & Bohl, 2018 ). See Fig. 1   for an overview of the systems represented in IFs. IFs includes a demographic model representing age-sex cohort structures and including endogenized representations of fertility, mortality, and migration (Bohl, Hughes, & Johnson, 2016 ). The economic model is equilibrium seeking and represents six sectors with labor by skill-level; it endogenizes drivers of productivity from across human, social, and physical systems, tied together in a social accounting matrix (Hughes, 2007; Hughes et al. 2009 ). IFs contains a health model differentiating mortality and morbidity into 15 types for 22 age-sex cohorts, uniquely driven by a combination of immediate or ‘proximate’ variables and underlying or ‘distal’ forces (Hughes, Kuhn, Peterson, Rothman, & Solórzano, 2011; Mathers & Loncar, 2006 ). The education model tracks student flows across levels of education from primary through tertiary, driven by the government finance, economic, and demographic models (Dickson, Hughes, & Irfan, 2010; Dickson et al., 2016 ); it represents the stock of adult education as the population ages. The infrastructure model represents supply and demand of roads, water, sanitation, information communication technology, and electricity (Rothman et al., 2014 ). Governance is represented through measurements of security, capacity, and inclusion (Hughes, Joshi, Moyer, Sisk, & Solórzano, 2014 ). IFs represents constraints on and trade-offs within investment in human development through a government finance module that relies on revenue generation through taxation and foreign aid and that details spending and transfer payments. A social accounting matrix integrates financial flows across economic, government finance, and other models. Gender is a cross-cutting issue represented in educational, health, and infrastructure access as well as participation in the broader economy. The interaction across countries is represented through international flows of trade, foreign direct investment, aid, debt, migration, and the threat of international conflict (Moyer, 2012 ). These human systems are connected to natural systems as well. IFs represents production, trade and use of multiple energy forms (Hughes, Solórzano, & Rothman, 2014 ). Land use is represented across five categories; crop, mean, and fish production are tied to demand of both households and industry (Hedden et al., 2016; Moyer & Firnhaber, 2012; Rothman, Hughes, & Narayan, 2017 ). Carbon stocks in the atmosphere, interacting with ocean and forest sinks, are driven by changing patterns of fossil fuel consumption and then impact temperature and precipitation change at national levels. Technology is important in essentially all models in IFs with a combination of endogenous and exogenous representations. This research implements SSP2 into IFs to determine whether countries are on track to achieve the selected SDG indicators by 2030 (the SDG time horizon). This is done by taking exogenous indicators from the SSP database and imposing them on the IFs tool (see Appendix A  for a list of the series taken from the SSP database and used in IFs to create SSP2). Some of the SDG indicators evaluated here directly connect to SSP series. Examples include GDP per capita, a driver of the IFs poverty forecasts. For other variables, elaborations of the SSPs are related to, but provide less or little guidance with respect to the calculations of the indicators. For example, SSP quantifications exist for adult educational attainment, but not for primary and secondary completion rates. This means there are potential inconsistencies between the SSP representations and the IFs model outputs, a challenging issue when building exogenous assumptions into a heavily endogenized model. The sections below describe how the nine variables (see Table 1 ) explored in this paper are operationalized within the IFs model. While these nine indicators are only a small subset of the total number of indicators in the SDG framework, they do represent a broad set of human development measures, capturing aspects of health, economic development and distribution, education, infrastructure, etc. These specific indicators were chosen both because of their data coverage and because they can be projected using IFs. Each of these indicators has a formal corresponding dataset assigned to it by the UNDP (see Table 1 ) which is used to initialize the value in the IFs model.  2.3 Extreme poverty SDG 1 is the end of poverty “in all its forms everywhere.” For this study, we focus on Target 1.1, the eradication of extreme poverty, one indicator for which is the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 per day. Poverty levels in IFs are calculated as a function of average income and its distribution. Income is assumed to have a lognormal distribution (that the natural log of income is normally distributed), which is a good approximation of empirical distributions of income for most countries (Bourguignon, 2004; Eicher and Turnovsky, 2003 ). More specifically, IFs projects poverty as a function of per capita consumption and the distribution of income, measured using the Gini coefficient (Hughes, 2015 ). Household consumption per capita is measured in 2011 USD at PPP. Data on poverty used to initialize projections for poverty levels by country and to evaluate 2015 country level achievement come from the World Bank’s Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day as a percent of the population, which is also the UN’s suggested source to use for benchmarking (UNDESA, 2017; World Bank, 2018 ).  2.4 Undernourishment and underweight children SDG 2 aims to eliminate hunger and poor nutrition. For this paper we look at two targets with two distinct indicators (Table 1 ): 2.1.1, the population-wide prevalence of undernourishment (hunger) and 2.2.2, the prevalence of underweight children. Hunger (2.1.1) is a function of available and consumed calories. Child malnutrition (2.2.2) is also driven by calories, as well as by access to clean water and sanitation (which implicitly represents the potential for diarrhea to limit the ability to utilize calories consumed).  2.5 Population undernourishment (hunger) The IFs projection of hunger is driven by caloric availability, which is driven by variables from the agricultural and economic models. The agriculture model is partial equilibrium and uses stocks (e.g., food stores) to equilibrate between supply (production plus imports less exports) and demand, generating change in relative price. Calorie demand per capita (from crops, meat, and fish), is affected by both income and food price. Data to initialize the prevalence of hunger, agricultural demand for crops, meat, and fish, calories per capita per day come from the Food and Agriculture Organization (2017a)  the official data compiler for SDG indicator 2.1.1 (UNDESA, 2017 ). Data for household income for the unskilled portion of the labor force come from the Global Trade Analysis Project at Purdue University (2018) .  2.6 Underweight children Poor access to calories and/or environmental conditions that make it difficult to absorb available calories can leave people chronically malnourished. For this indicator we forecast underweight children, defined as, “the percentage of children under age 5 whose weight for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0–59 months,” (World Bank, 2018 ). There are few other forecasts for prevalence of underweight children (IFPRI, 2016 ). The proximate, or more immediate drivers of underweight children are calories per capita, access to safe water (either piped or ‘improved’), and access to safe sanitation (either shared or ‘improved’). This formulation of drivers comes from the WHO’s Global Burden of Disease project (GBD) methodology and their empirical risk factors of underweight children (Mathers & Loncar, 2006; Murray & Lopez, 1996 ). The data to initialize the IFs projections of underweight children (which could be used to evaluate 2015 country level achievement), come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2018 ) which is a harmonized dataset based on UNICEF, WHO and World Bank data, the three official compilers of the data to be used to evaluate SDG indicator 2.2.2 (UNDESA, 2017 ).  2.7 Child mortality The aim of SDG 3 is to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” To assess SDG 3, we focus on the second target, under-five mortality, and specifically indicator 3.2.1 or the likelihood of death before 5 years of age (UNDESA, 2017 ). Child mortality from all 15 types of mortality and morbidity in IFs is projected using both the demographics model and the health model. The health model uses and extends the methodology first developed by the WHO’s Global Burden of Disease project (Hughes et al., 2011; Mathers & Loncar, 2006 ). This methodology uses both distal (deep, long-term and structural) drivers and proximate (based on social patterns and behaviors) drivers to project 15 types of mortality and morbidity for each age-sex cohort. Key distal drivers provide a basic calculation of mortality by age, sex, cause, and country are adult education, income (using GDP per capita as a proxy), and technological progress. Proximate drivers, then, adjust mortality from specific causes of population fractions. For example with respect to child mortality, the communicable disease burden is adjusted using calculations of the prevalence of underweight children, safe water, and sanitation access rates. The probability that a person survives to any given age is calculated using the mortality rates for each age-sex cohort. The data to initialize the IFs projections of child mortality (also used to evaluate 2015 country level achievement in this paper), come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2018 ) which is a harmonized dataset based on UNICEF, WHO, World Bank and UNDESA data. UNICEF is the official compiler of the data to be used to evaluate SDG indicator 3.2.1 (UNDESA, 2017 ).  2.8 Education SDG 4 intends to, “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all,” and target 4.1 is: “by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes,” (UNDESA, 2017 ). Here we focus on primary school completion (the portion of students who graduate from primary school over the total number of age appropriate students) and lower secondary school completion (the portion of students who graduate from lower secondary school over the total number of age appropriate students). The education model in IFs projects gender and country-specific intake, enrollment, survival, and graduation rates for primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, and tertiary education levels. The education model is integrated with the demographic, governance, and economic models, using costs, public spending, and population cohort size to project student flows. The level of educational attainment for young adults by sex is calculated as a function of these rates and carried with the adult population as it ages. These data are initialized using data from UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics (2018) , the organization responsible for SDG indicator 4.1 and the official compiler of data to be used to evaluate SDG indicator 4.1.  2.9 Access to safe water and sanitation The “availability and sustainable management” of water and sanitation is included in SDG 6. For this study, we focus on two indicators representing two targets under this goal: 6.1.1, “proportion of the population using safely managed drinking water services,” and 6.2.1, “proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water” (UNDESA, 2017 ). In IFs, access to water and sanitation is included in the infrastructure model, which is linked to the demographics, health, governance, and economic models. IFs projects three access levels for water (unimproved, other improved, and piped) and sanitation (other unimproved, shared, improved), mirroring the ‘ladder’ approach taken by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (WHO, 2017a ). To project the portion of the population with access to each level, IFs uses a nominal logistic equation with the following independent variables: average years of education for the adult population (age 25 and older), GDP per capita (PPP), portion of the population living in extreme poverty, and total government health expenditures as a portion of GDP (Rothman & Ifran, 2013; Rothman et al., 2014 ). All of the data used to initialize the projections of access to water and sanitation and evaluate 2015 country level achievement come from the WHO/UNICEF’s Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) data base (WHO/UNICEF, 2018 ). UNICEF and WHO are the organizations responsible for these SDG variables and the JMP database is to be used to evaluate SDG indicator achievement for 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 (UNDESA, 2017 ).  2.10 Electricity SDG 7 aims to ensure “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” For this paper we focus on indicator 7.1.1, the “proportion of population with access to electricity” (UNDESA, 2017 ). Electricity access is forecast for urban and rural populations, each as a logistic function with the following independent variables: portion of the population living in extreme poverty and government effectiveness using the World Bank WGI scale (Rothman & Ifran, 2013; Rothman et al., 2014 ). The data for the IFs projections of access to electricity and used to evaluate 2015 country level achievement in this paper, come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2018 ) which is the official data compiler of SDG indicator 7.1.1 (UNDESA, 2017 ).   3 Results The SSP2 scenario represents a moderately optimistic world in which economies grow and low-income countries converge towards high-income countries, HDI improves, poverty declines, and conflict reduces. Using IIASA GDP projections for SSP2, for example, low-income economies are projected to grow at an average annual rate to 2030 of 6.1% (Dellink, Chateau, Lanzi, & Magné, 2017 ). That greatly exceeds the projected growth of 2.1% in high-income countries. However, this moderately optimistic scenario leads to only limited progress towards achieving human development related SDGs. The total number of country-indicators (of the nine evaluated here for 186 countries) projected to reach target values is projected to increase from 713 (43%) in 2015 to 891 (54%) by 2030. In 2015, 27% of countries do not achieve any the nine target values explored here, and nine percent of countries achieve all targets. By 2030, 15% of countries are projected to not achieve any SDG explored here, with 17% of countries achieving all nine target values. (See Appendix B  for a break-down of target value achievement by region and by indicator.) Achievement varies considerably across indicator targets. Fig. 2   shows the percent of countries that achieve SDG targets across variables in 2015 and 2030. Some indicators are projected to improve relatively rapidly: the primary school completion target is reached in 76% of countries (an increase of 15 percentage points) and access to improved water is achieved in 72% of countries (an increase of 24 percentage points). Extreme poverty eradication targets are achieved in 67 percent of countries, growing by 16 percentage points relative to 2015. Some variables show significant increase in country-achievement, though starting from a low base. For example, access to safe sanitation was only achieved in 27% of countries in 2015 and grows to 43.5% of countries by 2030. Completion of lower-secondary education targets were achieved in 20% of countries in 2015, increasing to 35% of countries by 2030. Less progress is made with achieving targets in other variables. Child mortality target values are achieved in 10.8% more countries between 2015 and 2030. Electricity access targets are also achieved in only seven percent more countries by 2030. Underweight children targets are only achieved in an additional 6.5% of countries, the variable explored here with the least improvement. Undernourishment targets are only projected to be achieved in only two countries. The hard-to-achieve SDG indictors explored in this study have three characteristics. First, some reflect transitions that occur at a later stage in a development process. Lower secondary completion is a clear example of this, as primary completion is a necessary pre-condition. Second, some reflect development preferences driven by human priorities. For example, sanitation access tends to occur after safe water access because people prioritize the latter over the former. A third characteristic is that some indicators face development challenges that are structural, such as conflict and poor governance. These make high fertility rates difficult to lower, affecting indicators such as child health. Similarly, persistent problems of child mortality, undernutrition, and underweight children are driven by weaknesses in food-distribution-governance systems that are pernicious and that impact the most vulnerable people, those with little voice or purchasing power. Without dramatic policy interventions (something not represented in a middle-of-the-road scenario) development objectives on such variables cannot be achieved. Patterns of SDG achievement vary significantly by region. Figs. 3 and 4    show the percentage of countries per region that achieve the nine SDG indicator targets in 2015 and 2030. In an SSP2 scenario, some SDGs will be widely achieved in some regions. Latin America and Caribbean is projected to significantly increase access to water, achieve primary school completion, and improve child mortality rates in many countries. Asia is also poised to improve access to water, complete primary school targets, and see many countries achieve the poverty target. However, other regions are expected to lag significantly behind. For example, by 2030, Africa is projected to have achieved the least number of SDG targets at a national level of all regions evaluated. Fig. 5   shows the number of countries by region that do not achieve each of the nine target goals explored here. Across each of these indicators, Africa is consistently the largest region by country-count projected to not achieve the SDG targets, followed by Asia. The best performing target indicator (primary school completion) still show 35 African countries without achievement by 2030. Of the 186 countries explored in this paper, 28 Most Vulnerable Countries (MVCs) do not achieve any of the target indicators (26 of these are sub-Saharan). Many of these MVCs are characterized by conflict – 13 are on the 2018 harmonized list of fragile states from the World Bank and eight have either a UN or regional peacekeeping mission (The World Bank, 2018a ). They represent the most acute development challenges for the international aid community. To further understand these countries facing acute development challenges we grouped the 186 countries into categories based on the number of human development related SDGs that they achieve in a middle-of-the-road scenario. See Table 2  , where the 28 MVCs are represented in the “0” column (zero SDG targets achieved in 2030), with countries achieving more target values moving to the right. MVCs include over 751 million people in 2015, growing to 1055 million by 2030. While our modeling is focused on the 2030 horizon, it is worth noting that these countries are projected to keep growing, more than doubling in size relative to today to 1721 million by 2050. As a share of global population, MVCs are projected to shift from 10.2 percent today to 17.8 percent by 2050. This demographic growth is driven by the highest fertility rates of any of the nine groupings in Table 2 , with over 5.3 children per woman (forecast to decline to 4.1 by 2030). Currently over 335 million people under the age of 15 live in MVCs with that number forecast to grow to 413 million (representing 22.5 percent of all youth) by 2030. Across other development indicators MVCs have limited health, education, and economic development. In addition, they are also deeply reliant on foreign aid, with 29.9 percent of government revenue coming from the international community (the group of countries that achieve only one SDG is also heavily reliant on foreign aid with 22.7 percent of government revenue originating from the international aid community). Conversely, there are also a large number of countries that have already achieved all of these nine targets in 2015. Across the nine indicators explored here, between 20 and 60 percent of countries have achieved these targets already in 2015. This speaks to the limited nature of the SDGs “universal” application: if most countries have achieved the global target in the base year, universal targets should probably be eschewed in favor of relative targets. An alternative approach for a universal development framework using relative targets could be approached in various ways, either by making the specific target indicators contingent on country context or making achievement thresholds contingent on level of development.  4 Discussion Projecting the future is always a challenge and this exercise is not meant to be a prediction of a deterministic future. However, instead of trying to foretell what the future is likely to hold, models should be used to better understand how the world around us is unfolding given the path we seem to be on. From that understanding policy should be made that considers the past, present, and possible future trajectories of sustainable human development. There are many ways to frame the uncertainty and test the reliability of projections including longitudinal statistical techniques, scenario analysis, historical forecasting, and qualitative analysis. In this paper we have not explicitly framed the uncertainty around these projections because many of them have been driven by an extant scenario that shaped inputs to the IFs platform. Future work should be done to better frame the uncertainty around such a baseline scenario that dynamically unfolds along a middle-of-the-road pathway. Future research could, for instance, also focus on SDG achievement across other SSPs. And some research has already been completed in this space, including an assessment of the required interventions to bring development on track to achieve the SDGs. For example, one alternative scenario development approach was put forward in the “Roads to Rio+20”, which focused on three alternative policy pathways for achieving the SDGs (van Vuuren et al., 2015a; Moyer & Bohl, 2018 ). This research analyzed the level of intervention required to achieve SDGs across scenario paths representing technology, decentralized governance and reduced individual consumption. The IFs tool is a deeply integrated quantitative modeling framework. This has both benefits and costs. The main advantage is that it must include equilibrating and accounting systems, which create a space for many variables to be considered in the calculation of an output while retaining dynamism and realism. A disadvantage, however, is that the large number of interacting variables can appear to be a “black box” because the extensiveness of model assumptions and interacting variables, while adding that realism, can make interpretation difficult. A fuller assessment of trade-offs across modeling methodologies would be another valuable research project. A second main benefit of the IFs tool is that it allows for analysis at the country level. Most integrated assessment models are regional or global. While such aggregation can be useful for projecting development in some natural systems – particularly global scale environmental problems, such as climate change - it may also “wash-out” the country-level heterogeneity within regions. Additional research exploring trade-offs in the unit of analysis used in modeling exercises would also be a valuable research endeavor.  5 Conclusion Along a middle-of-the-road development path characterized by improvements in agricultural, demographic, economic, education, energy, environmental, governance, health, infrastructure, and technology variables, the world is not on track to achieve human development related SDGs by 2030. The regional disparity in achievement is significant. In particular, in Africa the target values are achieved in only nine percent of countries for sanitation, seven percent for lower-secondary completion, and five percent for underweight children indicators. The geographic focus used to assess prospects for SDG achievement matters. When explored on a global basis (summing up populations across countries), we are on track to achieve two of the SDG indicator target values evaluated in this report: primary school completion and child mortality. This is a positive development. However, the SDGs were developed on a country basis and achievement should be evaluated in those terms as well. If so, it becomes clear that alternative pathways of development forward are required to achieve these global targets.
