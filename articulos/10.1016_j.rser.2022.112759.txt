                  Endeavouring to promote sustainability and citizens' well-being, and attempting to avoid or at least mitigate catastrophic climate change; the European Union adopted in 2019 the “Green Deal” as a new growth strategy, to thus become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. As an intermediate 2030 target, it set the goals of at least 40% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, an increase to 32% share for renewable energy, and 32.5% increase in energy efficiency. Reaching these targets was estimated to require investments of €260 billion/year till 2030, which is 1.94% of EU's annual gross domestic product in 2020. The aim of this paper is to introduce a perspective that attempts to analyse relationships between two exceptionally important and ambitious simultaneous goals of the Green Deal: to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as the Sustainable Developments Goals, all based on the sustainability environmental, economic and social pillars. The study shows that the link between these two goals, including the cost-benefit effects for all citizens, should be made clearer. Without adequate understanding and monitoring of the consequences of each action, and quantitative indicators for the environmental, economic and social sustainability pillars, the attainment of the goals would be subject to high uncertainty. With ongoing global changes and problems within and surrounding the European Union, implementation of the Green Deal without the noted adjustments poses a potential risk to sustainable development and to the European Union unity. Transition to climate neutrality can be sustainable only if supported by conviction and accord.

Endeavouring to promote sustainability and citizens' well-being, and attempting to avoid or at least mitigate catastrophic climate change; the European Union adopted in 2019 the “Green Deal” as a new growth strategy, to thus become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. As an intermediate 2030 target, it set the goals of at least 40% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, an increase to 32% share for renewable energy, and 32.5% increase in energy efficiency. Reaching these targets was estimated to require investments of €260 billion/year till 2030, which is 1.94% of EU's annual gross domestic product in 2020. The aim of this paper is to introduce a perspective that attempts to analyse relationships between two exceptionally important and ambitious simultaneous goals of the Green Deal: to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as the Sustainable Developments Goals, all based on the sustainability environmental, economic and social pillars. The study shows that the link between these two goals, including the cost-benefit effects for all citizens, should be made clearer. Without adequate understanding and monitoring of the consequences of each action, and quantitative indicators for the environmental, economic and social sustainability pillars, the attainment of the goals would be subject to high uncertainty. With ongoing global changes and problems within and surrounding the European Union, implementation of the Green Deal without the noted adjustments poses a potential risk to sustainable development and to the European Union unity. Transition to climate neutrality can be sustainable only if supported by conviction and accord.

Taking year 2050 as a future reference point, when net-zero carbon emission should be reached, there are two documents which provide suggestions how to achieve this goal – the Net-Zero 2050 plan (Net Zero defined as the condition when the rate of CO2  emissions to the atmosphere is at most equal to the rate of its removal from it) published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [2 ] and the Green Deal (GD), as the new growth strategy of the European Union (EU) [3 ]. The IEA Net-Zero 2050 plan (IEA plan) is the first comprehensive document expounding a global and sectoral pathway to net-zero CO2  transition, including analysis of broader implications for the economy, energy industry, citizens and governments. It points out that achieving net zero on global level requires engagement of all countries and greater cooperation among them, where it is essential to provide technical and financial support for developing countries for which access to finance and new technologies is almost unreachable. Since countries have different capacities to implement the necessary actions needed for energy and climate transition, a precondition is that all countries should define and implement their national energy and climate policies where efficiency, electrification, and replacement of coal by low‐emissions energy sources for electricity generation play a central role, especially over the period to 2030. Full implementation of the IEA plan would require that the world governments will have to make unprecedented investments in advanced infrastructure and provide support for new technologies that enable energy transition and achievement of climate targets, while the world population will have to make supportive behavioural and physical adjustments. According to the IEA plan, the needed advanced batteries, hydrogen production electrolysers, and direct CO2  capture and storage, are recognized as innovations that can boost climate neutrality, but almost half of the emissions savings needed in 2050 would need completely new technologies which were not yet commercialised. The IEA together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that the annual energy investment for their plan will reach $5 trillion by 2030 (for approximation, 1 € = 1.12 $), adding an extra 0.4% a year to annual global gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Mobilising such financial resources would call for close cooperation between government and all stakeholders (industry, investors, and consumers), since the climate and energy transition process will be impossible without synchronisation of all measures and active involvement and cooperation of a decisive majority. What's more, it is obvious that policymakers will be facing challenges in establishing energy transition policies that do not damage macroeconomic stability and social welfare [4 ]. For example, reducing fossil fuels consumption will reduce public revenues (e.g. taxes on diesel and gasoline) and export revenues, of which they comprise a dominant share in some countries [5 ]. On the other hand, a shift from fossil fuels will in the short-run increase unemployment in related energy sectors and apply pressure on budget expenditures for job creation, re-skilling and other social measures financed from the state budget. IEA reports that transition to net-zero will result in 5 million lost jobs but that 14 million jobs will be created by 2030. The new jobs will, however, be in different locations and sectors and will require new educational profiles and skills. These structural changes will require fiscal and budget reforms for creating incentives for private investments, as well as new sources of revenue [6 ]. The IEA plan concludes, however, that macroeconomic effects of climate neutrality are rather unpredictable, and that structural reforms will need harmonisation in different public policy areas. It is obvious [7–9 ] that rapid and fundamental changes in global society needs urgent action from decision makers that will mitigate risks and provide a solution for decarbonisation in a coherent and effective way. Furthermore, considering continuing global changes and new risks there is a need for a dynamic approach to the economics of public policy that should be based on investments and innovations, institutional structures and finance. While providing different scenarios and wide-range of common measures for the decarbonisation process that should be implemented on global level, the IEA plan cannot be used for policy making since it is not followed by financial and action plans. Additionally, it does not analyse the link between the SDGs and the decarbonisation process. Since the IEA report consists only of general global recommendations but without a cost-benefit analysis of the net-zero transition, our further analysis here will be focused on the GD, which is a strategic document accompanied by an investment plan as well as by regulations that provide its full implementation in the EU. The aim of this paper is to introduce a perspective that attempts to succinctly analyse the costs of, and relationships between, the two well-intentioned exceptionally ambitious and expensive goals of the GD: to attain net-zero emissions by 2050 while meeting the SDG, all based on the sustainability environmental, economic and social pillars. The concept of climate neutrality (net greenhouse gasses emissions GHG reduction to zero through climate actions) can be more precisely analysed for the EU, as the first region which promoted this goal in the GD. The EU is the third largest GHG emitter (after China and the United States) responsible for 7.46% [10 ] of global emissions in 2020. At the same time, it is the leading planner of the transition to a net-zero economy [11 ]. In the period 1990–2019, the EU reduced GHG emissions by 24%, noting however, that the current global policies can reduce GHG emissions by only 60% by 2050 [12 ]. In 2018 the EU set climate and energy targets for 2030, which aims at 40% reduction GHG emissions from 1990 levels, at least 32% increase of renewable energy share, as well as energy efficiency improvement of at least 32.5%. Reaching these targets was estimated to require investments of €260 billion a year by 2030 [3 ], amounting to 1.94% of the EU's GDP generated in 2020. In December 2019, the European Commission (EC) prepared and adopted the “Roadmap to the Green Deal” announcing more ambitious target to cut down emission by 55% by 2030, and to become climate neutral by 2050. The GD roadmap was characterized by promoting sustainability and well-being of citizens as the centre of policymaking. This target was later entered into the EU regulatory framework and a separate investment plan was adopted to support the broader EU environmental and social objectives. To avoid the propagation of a common misunderstanding, “Green” is just a colour or name given by some to desirable environmental effects, while “Sustainable” is fundamentally different, defined by three or more pillars, only one of which is “Green” (environmental). Beyond climate-related measures, the EC estimated that there are costs which are not a direct part of green transition, but are necessary for sustainable development. These investments include annually €100 and €150 billion for environmental protection and resource management, respectively, as well as €142 billion for health and long-term care, affordable housing, education, and life-long training. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic brought new challenges and created serious concerns about whether climate neutrality can remain a major priority [13 ], since the huge and unexpected global health emergency and the associated significant economic slowdown hindered the GD implementation [14 ]. While some of the EU officials proposed to use the expected pandemic recovery period as a synergistic opportunity for planning and implementing the GD [15 ,16 ], others pointed to a need for reshaping the EU budget and initiated an inquiry about whether financial resources will be sufficient for both recovery and climate neutrality [17 ]. It is clearly to be expected that climate neutrality as a strategic orientation that introduces significant near-term adverse changes for the entire economy and society, would provoke broad public discussion or even resistance and conflicts among different interest groups [18 ]. The expected main disputes are that such transition to a low-carbon economy would generate high public spending [19 ] and job losses [20 ]. There is, however, contrary empirical evidence that investments in decarbonisation during economic crises tends to lead to public cost reductions and generation of additional income, which in turn create new jobs and reduce governmental expenditures [21–23 ]. Analysing the outcomes and effects of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act adopted in 2009, which is the largest economy stimulus package in recent history, it can be seen that half of the new jobs created by green investments were manual labour positions without increase in wages [24 ]. Even though the effects of decarbonisation on the labour market are still debated and polarized, it is certain that carbon reduction has positive impacts on population's health [25 ], in generating related government savings, and good prospects for social development [26 ]. Additional concerns about the GD [27 ] include its inadequately holistic consideration of key elements such as availability of adequate resources and implementation tools, including policies and social fairness [28 ], and that the implementation of the GD doesn't adequately take into account that member states have different socioeconomic structures and that they use different energy resources [29 ]. Demonstrating commitment to the implementation of the EU climate targets under the GD, the EC adopted in July 2021 a series of legislative proposals , including revisions of the existing regulations (such as Emission Trading System (ETS), Energy Efficiency Directive, Renewable Energy Directive, Effort Sharing Regulation) and introduction of a new border carbon tax on goods produced in countries outside the EU, in whose production carbon is emitted. Explaining carbon tax as a way to reduce carbon leakage (a situation where companies may transfer their business into non-EU countries which have lower emission targets) [30 ,31 ], a border carbon tax involves several challenges [32 ] where the biggest is this tax implementation [33 ], and criticisms of being regarded as an example of ‘green protectionism’ [34 ,35 ]. It was claimed that the GD will affect geopolitics through its impact on the EU energy balance and global energy markets, thus affecting oil and gas-producing countries in the EU neighbourhood so that the GD may have an impact on European energy security and on global trade patterns [36 ]. Even though the EU is determined to reduce fossil fuel consumption, at the moment it is highly dependent on import of fossil fuels and is directly exposed to the rise of energy prices. What's more, explosion of fossil fuels prices in the European market since September 2021, as well as the historic price increase of carbon allowances in February 2022, are regarded to be a consequence of the more demanding European environmental policy. Contrary to its primary aim, the European policy of carbon neutrality might be in collision with the SDG. High energy prices have significant welfare effects, especially for lower income households that must spend a higher share of their income on energy. Additionally, the latest increase in energy prices is the main component contributing to the rising inflation in the EU, which has direct impact on the living standard and socio-economic situation of citizens. As a consequence of the Covid crisis, a decrease in income was noted [37 ] to especially hit the European countries and regions reliant on energy intensive sectors of industry, and on regions that depend on distant markets. In view of these contrary effects of the proposed energy transition, this paper also addresses the question whether the GD is a policy framework which incorporates the SDGs based on environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainable development promoting social fairness, and enables a just transition towards more sustainable economies and societies. This perspective's analysis is especially important for the recovery period following the COVID–19 pandemic. Recognizing that this paper's topic is of great interest and volatility, which continuously changes, the authors of this perspective paper have made an effort to address it reasonably adequately despite that, attempting to indeed also describe its dynamics, which are of significant interest by themselves. Section 2  of this paper addresses the relation between the GD and SDGs. The environmental dimension of the GD is presented in Section 3 , whereas the financial sustainability and social pillar are presented in Sections 4 and 5 , respectively.  2 The Green Deal - SDG nexus The EC presented in 2018 a vision for achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 through, as stated, a “socially-fair and cost-efficient transition” [38 ,39 ]. In December 2019, the EC adopted the European GD [3 ] as “a new growth strategy that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of GHG in 2050. It is emphasised that this transition must be just and inclusive”. It also states that the risk of energy poverty must be addressed. Since the adoption of the GD, both the European Parliament and the European Council have authorized the long-term EU climate-neutrality objective. The European Parliament has endorsed the EU objective of achieving net-zero GHG emissions in its resolutions [40–43 ], while the European Council has established a plan for creation of a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe as one of the main four priorities in its Strategic Agenda for 2019–2024 [44 ] and in EC Conclusions [45 ]. An integral part of the EC strategy is the United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [46 ] adopted in September 2015 by the 193 member states, following a more than three-year process of intergovernmental negotiation. The 2030 Agenda features 17 interconnected SDGs and 169 targets. Covering the three pillars of sustainable development (environmental, economic and social) and integrating the core principles of ‘leaving no one behind’, ‘inclusiveness’, and ‘multi-stakeholder partnerships’, the SDGs emphasize a holistic approach to achieve sustainable development for all countries. It is noteworthy that understanding and planning of sustainable development requires quantitative measurements. Such measurements and characterisations have some well-known shortcomings and need some methodological improvements [47 ,48 ], however, they can be a useful tool for policy makers in the energy transition [49 ]. The GD states that it was designed to meet the SDGs and the well-being of citizens as the main pillars of the EU's policymaking and action. It is highlighted that economic growth, social fairness and environmental progress are deemed to be compatible and mutually reinforcing. The proposed various elements of the GD can be summarized as nine policy areas: Climate Action, Clean Energy, Sustainable Industry, Building and Renovating, Eliminating Pollution, Sustainable Agriculture, Biodiversity, and From Farm to Fork and Sustainable Mobility (Fig. 1  ). In 2015 the United Nations started publication of the Sustainable Development Index Reports as useful tools for monitoring of implementation 17 SDGs and 169 targets. According to the latest SDGs 2021 Index for European Countries [50 ], the average EU SDGs Index slightly declined from 71.4 points in 2019 to 70.7 points in 2020, mainly because of the Covid crisis and its impact on life expectancy, poverty and unemployment. The highest decline was recorded in SDG 8 (“Decent work and economic growth”) and SDG 1 (“No poverty”) because of the increase in unemployment and increased poverty. Drops were also seen in some indicators related to living conditions and access to electricity and energy, such as in SDG 11 (“Sustainable cities and communities”) and SDG 7 (“Affordable and clean energy”). Countries with higher SDGs Index were seen to also be higher in the “Leave no one behind” Index. The EU adopted the GD and related regulatory framework and established itself as the first region that has a bold commitment to climate-neutrality, but there is a need for further efforts, for example in controlling consumption patterns to reduce international environmental spill-over effects. The EU indeed decreased carbon emissions but other parts of the world increased them (e.g. in cement and steel production) to cover the EU demand. Fig. 2   illustrates that abroad-generated carbon emissions for covering EU's use of goods and services grew faster than the GDP. Although the GD considers SDGs, its latest report mentioned that the GD is directly related to only 12 out of 17 SDG, and it can be noticed that it is inadequately focused on the social pillar. It is also noteworthy that targets were identified for only 15 of the 102 indicators [45 ]. The targets were set only for climate change, energy consumption and education. This leaves the major SDGs indicators without EU targets. To evaluate the integration of SDGs into the GD, Koundouri et al. [51 ] advanced the analysis by developing a methodology approach that shows the areas where the GD is consistent with SDGs on the EU level as well as on the EU country level, as shown in Fig. 3  . Analysing the implementation of 17 SDGs within 9 areas of intervention of the GD, their research showed a high level of correlation (dark green cells) in the 36 out of 153 areas, indirect relationship in 87 areas (light green cells), while in 30 areas the relationship is minor or does not exist (white cells). Fig. 3  shows that some areas of the GD (such as “From farm to fork”, “Sustainable industry”, “Elimination of pollution” and “Climate action”) integrated SDGs more. On the other hand, three areas of the GD policy (“Building and renovating”, “Sustainable Mobility” and “Biodiversity”) should be more integrated with SDGs. It is further evident that SDG 16 (Peace Justice and strong institutions), SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities), and SDG 5 (Gender equality) are least integrated within the GD policy. Even though the first two areas of the GD policy (“Biodiversity” and “From Farm to Fork”) are directly related to common agricultural policy (CAP), it is not clear how the current CAP contributes to climate neutrality, since CAP provisions and budget for climate issues are insufficient. Furthermore, the scope of these the GD areas extends considerably beyond the set of issues addressed in the current CAP reform process. The new CAP regulation was therefore adopted in December 2021 [52 ]. According to the European Environmental Agency [53 ], agriculture has a share of 11% from the total EU carbon emissions, and it is recognized that the agriculture sector can hardly contribute to carbon reduction without substantial changes. It seems that achieving the GD targets would require a significant adjustments in CAP, including promotion of innovations for reducing excessive use of water, use of fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotics, re-design of the production system, and changes in consumers’ behaviours and dietary patterns [54 ].  3 The environmental pillar of the Green Deal To clearly establish the conditions for an effective and fair transition, provide predictability for investors, and ensure a transition integrated into a regulatory framework with adequate mechanism of support, the EC adopted the existing Climate Law with a related regulatory package and the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan. The Climate Law [55 ] is the first European climate law which integrated the climate neutrality objective into legislation and ensured that all EU policies contribute to this strategic goal. To achieve emission reduction targets, the EC reviewed all relevant climate-related policy methods and adopted a set of regulations (the “Fit for 55” package) on 14 July 2021, introducing the desirable environmental standards. Some of the key elements within this regulatory package are: the revised Renewable Energy Directive  [56 ] that increased the share of renewables in energy production from the previous 32%–40% by 2030; the revised Energy Efficiency Directive  [57 ] that set a rule for the public sector to require to renovate 3% of its buildings each year, and revision of the Energy Taxation Directive  [58 ] that proposed new taxation of energy products that is in line with new climate targets. A new set of laws includes a new regulation promoting higher emissions standards for cars and vans  [59 ], and the revised Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation  [60 ] requiring additional electricity-charging stations. A new set of regulation on land use, forestry and agriculture [61 ] was adopted to accelerate reaching the EU target for carbon removal by natural sinks. One of the most important mechanisms which should help achieve climate neutrality is the European ETS covering large power stations, industrial plants and aviation, which represent about 40% of total the EU emissions. The revised ETS [62 ] introduced lower values of the overall emissions cap, increased an annual rate of emissions’ reduction, abolished free emission allowances for aviation, and included shipping emissions for the first time in the EU ETS. An analysis has foreseen that the revised ETS will reduce power sector emissions by 54% by 2057, while carbon prices within the EU ETS will increase to 129 €/tCO2 in 2030 and 212 €/tCO2 by 2040 [63 ]. Even though the Covid crisis resulted in a 5.8% decline in global carbon emissions in 2020, the IEA scenarios analysis predicts that the total emissions will in 2021 be only 1.2% lower than in 2019. The reduction of carbon emissions in 2020 [64 ,65 ] caused a quick effect on the ETS [66 ] where the price of emission allowances dropped by over a third (from around €25 to €16), reflecting also the fall in financial markets in general. The shift towards more stringent climate policies and new ETS rules have, however, already raised the price of carbon allowances where the carbon price reached its historical peak 97 €/tCO2 on February 8th, 2022. The EC also proposed a new climate measure, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) [67 ] aiming to prevent the risk of carbon leakage since there is a high risk that EU companies will transfer their carbon-intensive production to non-EU countries that have less demanding emission targets, or that EU products might be replaced by imported more carbon-intensive ones. The plan is that CBAM will be initially applied to a selected number of goods (iron and steel, cement, fertiliser, aluminium and electricity generation) and will be gradually introduced on products in direct proportion to the reduction of free allowances allocated under the ETS for those sectors. Even though this measure already exists in California, where an adjustment is applied to certain imports of electricity, while Canada and Japan are considering this mechanism too, the CBAM proposal provoked intense discussion between EU member states. It sends a strong message to trade partners all around the world, particularly in developing countries, that carbon emissions have a price, and thus might provoke geopolitical tensions [68 ]. The OECD published several documents [69–71 ] highlighting the benefits of carbon taxes. It is noted in the latest document [72 ] that 83% of energy-related carbon emissions in the 15 developing and emerging economies (Côte d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and Uganda in Africa; the Philippines and Sri Lanka in Asia; and Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Jamaica and Uruguay in Latin America and the Caribbean) are entirely untaxed. If the governments impose carbon taxes equivalent to €30 per tonne of carbon on fossil fuels, they could generate revenues of around 1% of their GDP. In its latest Fiscal Monitor [73 ], the IMF estimated that carbon taxes will rise rapidly to $75 per ton CO2  in 2030, and that carbon tax revenue can reach 1.5% of GDP for the Group of 20 countries (G20) in 2030. This revenue can be redistributed in way to support transition in low-income households, including affected workers in intensive-energy sectors or region (for example, coal-mining areas). It is also estimated that carbon pricing can reduce illness and mortality from air pollution (725,000 fewer premature deaths in 2030 for a $75/ton tax in the G20 countries alone), and that businesses deploying new associated technologies would earn profits and create jobs, which in 2017 already reached $11 million globally in just the renewables sector.  4 The financial sustainability of the Green Deal Implementation of the GD is based on a mechanism which describes a plan with associated investments, and the specific programmes and institutions that will carry out all the necessary activities. The Sustainable Europe Investment Plan [74 ] is the investment pillar of the European GD, which is proposed to mobilise at least €1 trillion of private and public investments through the EU budget and the associated programmes (Fig. 4  ). Out of the total planned investment for the GD, more than half (€530 billion) is proposed to be financed from the EU budget. The EU's budget for the period 2021–2027 amounts to €2.018 trillion in current prices, which includes a budget of €1.211 trillion for a seven-year period for broad policy areas, and a NextGenerationEU budget of €806.9 billion. The NextGenerationEU programme is planned to provide grants (€407.5 billion) and loans (€385.8 billion), which will be financed by issuing a common debt. The largest component is the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism (RRF), which amounts to €723.8 billion between grants and loans to support investment and reforms, with a focus on the ecological and digital transition (Fig. 5  ). Other funding sources include Support for Cohesion and Territories in Europe (REACT-EU), the Just Transition Fund, and other EU programmes such as Horizon 2020, InvestEU, and Rural Development [75 ]. To raise up to €800 billion (or 5% of the EU GDP) until 2026, around 30% of the funds planned to be raised through the issuance of “green bonds” while the rest will be gathered through other programmes [76 ]. In October 2021, the EC issued the first green bond which is the world's largest green bond issuance ever. On May 2021, the EC started to finance the NextGenerationEU for enabling support for the EU member states that have submitted their resilience and recovery plans [77 ] in advance, addressing challenges and contributions regarding environmental sustainability, productivity, macroeconomic stability, and fairness. Each resilience and recovery plan were required to include at least 37% of the expenditure for climate-related investments and reforms, and 20% to foster digital transition. The EU budget was proposed to foster the revenue side of climate objectives (e.g. by using revenues from plastic-packaging waste and allocation of 20% revenues from the auctioning of the EU ETS). According to the latest Eurostat data, the total amount spent from the annual budget of the EU Member States as well as of the EC and the EIB, for contributing to the $ 100 billion international commitment for climate finance under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2019, was €16.2 million [78 ]. The EU budget alone cannot, however, be sufficient for reaching climate neutrality or to meet the investment needs. Additional national co-financing of about €114 billion is expected to be started for environmental and climate projects. At the national level, it is expected that the GD will trigger the context for tax reforms by removing subsidies for fossil fuels, shifting the tax burden from labour to pollution, and accounting for the social pillar. Supporting a cost-effective transition to climate neutrality by 2050, considers review of state aid in all sectors, especially the most polluting ones. It is noteworthy that while the EU promotes investments that accelerate the shift from fossil fuels towards climate-neutrality, the EC adopted in February 2022 a regulation that considers investments into nuclear and gas power plants as sustainable investments. This is apparently because it is likely to provide, at least in the short term, security for investors and acceleration of investments in these fields under the current energy crisis that is shaking Europe (imbalance in the European natural gas market is highly dependent on the vulnerable import from Russia, causing the rapid rise of electricity, gas, coal and oil prices). This decision caused a dispute among the EU member states because it carries with it significant risks: the GHG emissions from development and use of fossil fuels, and the ominous risks, including the production of up to million-years-perilous radioactive waste, proliferation, and plant safety, from using nuclear power. The regulatory framework defined that the InvestEU [79 ] fund should help in the reorientation of private capital towards sustainable investments and an EU budget guarantee to allow the European Investment Bank (EIB) and other implementing partners to invest in more and higher-risk projects. EIB is expected to raise the financing share of this type of projects to 50% of its operations in 2025. For regulation of the Innovation [80 ] and Modernisation funds [81 ] it is proposed that their finances be based on auctioning revenues of carbon allowances under the ETS, which will provide clean energy investments in the 10 lower-income Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia). On the other hand, the EC seems to assume that implementation of the GD will generate significant economic benefits. Encouraging public and private investments in clean energy technologies is likely to improve industries’ competitiveness. The clean technologies will reduce the EU import-dependency on imported fossil fuels and improve the resilience of the economy and society. Several macro-economic models were used to evaluate broader macro-economic impacts of the decarbonisation [82 ]. Even though these models cannot address the “quality of growth”, they show that higher emission targets will have only negligible impact on the economy and their effects will be stronger on investments, sectoral outputs and employment.  5 The social pillar of decarbonisation and the Green Deal Implementation of the GD would trigger sustainability impacts not only regarding financial/economic support but also because of associated social inequities, since it applies unequal additional pressures on specific regions of the EU having energy and carbon-intensive sectors of industry, on its vulnerable households, and on substantial transport users in the short run. Climate neutrality policy can generate both positive and negative local/regional impacts on various SDGs via physical, social, economic, and political avenues [83 ]. By large, environmental policies and transitions can impose potential socio-economic impacts on employment and consumers. Although a healthier environment is likely to have positive effects on employees and consumers, such effects may be minor in some cases, all threatening equality:• Costs for both producers and consumers are likely to be reduced (e.g. more durable products reduce costs for replacement; lower costs for environmental clean-up and public health generally reduce companies' and consumers' tax burden), but some of the savings will not be equally available to all because of needed higher investments and inter-dependencies associated with equality;  • Sustainable industries create new jobs, but such opportunities are not the same for all people and regions;  • Working conditions (wages, job security, occupational safety, labour rights, etc.) for those who take employment in new sectors may not necessarily improve;  • Some workers may lose their jobs permanently, which also reduces tax revenues and increases public spending, lowers quality of life, and increases social inequalities;  • Carbon taxes and price rise for high-carbon products and services may disproportionately affect lower-income households or other vulnerable groups (e.g. migrants who depend on family travel) [84 ].    Recognizing that the transition generates also such negative effects, the Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) was created as an instrument for supporting regions and sectors that are most affected by it because of their higher dependence on fossil fuels or carbon-intensive processes (Fig. 6  ). The JTM is intended to support re-skilling programmes, employment in new economic sectors and energy-efficient housing, that in addition to the EU budget contributions by programmes directly relevant to the transition, such as the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund Plus [85 ]. The JTM consists of three “pillars”: a Just Transition Fund [86 ,87 ], a dedicated just transition scheme under InvestEU, and a new public sector loan for additional investments to be leveraged by the EIB (Fig. 7  ). To enable fair and acceptable transition for all the EU member states, resources will be allocated in accordance with their carbon reduction targets, socio-economic challenges of energy transition, and levels of economic development. To support EU regions most vulnerable to the transition, it is planned that the JTM should mobilise at least €100 billion over 2021–2027. The majority of sources will be financed from the EU budget and the national budgets of Member States, as well as from InvestEU and the EIB. The EU is historically faced with high regional disparities, so the JTM was created as a special mechanism of support for carbon intensive regions within EU member states. The recent statistics show that in 2020, the EU member states recorded a recession of −5.9%, which has negative effects on well-being and will further deepen social differences. All countries except Ireland recorded contraction, with the economic downturn having been the most severe in Spain (−10.8%) and Italy (−9%) [88 ] whose economies are heavily depended on revenues from tourism and hospitality. The regional disparities in GDP/person range from €8840 (Bulgaria) to €101,760 (Luxemburg) [89 ]. Unemployment also exhibits great regional differences, where Greece (17.6%) and Spain (15.5%) had the highest unemployment rate in 2021, while the Czech Republic and Poland recorded the lowest (2.8% and 3.2% respectively) [90 ]. Considering the latest Eurostat data for 2020, general government expenditure on health, education and social protection in EU was 21.9% [91 ]. Around 21% of the people in the EU are, however, at risk of poverty (including energy poverty), and/or social exclusion, most highly in Romania (35.8%), Bulgaria (33.6%) and Greece (27.4%), and lowest in the Czech Republic (11.5%), Slovakia (13.8%) and Slovenia (14.3%) [92 ]. The share of people unable to keep their homes adequately warm, defined as a poverty status, is that 8.2% of the EU population are at risk of energy poverty. The highest level of energy poverty is in Bulgaria (27.51%), Lithuania (23.1%), and Cyprus (20.9%) [93 ]. It is evident that the living standard in the EU is worrisomely unequal, and the socio-economic consequences will make it even more so after a likely reduction of existing economic aid packages. It should be emphatically clear that allowing, and what is worse, causing, inequality between member states and regions poses a serious risk to the unity of the EU itself and for sustainable development, all of which demands urgent action for improvement of the socio-economic dimension of the GD.  6 Conclusions and recommendations The IEA Net-Zero 2050 plan is globally the first comprehensive one that points to the need for international cooperation to achieve climate neutrality at the global level and contains a valuable treasure of information. Although it defines over 400 measures, this plan still does not have all the necessary action elements to be characterized as a complete plan for adopting concrete activities at the global level. On the other hand, the GD represents a long-term development strategy in which the EU defined, in December 2019, climate neutrality as a strategic goal. Although the Covid crisis raised doubts about the choice of priorities, the EU mobilized resources and defined a detailed investment plan that includes a legislative framework and new institutions that will be in charge of the GD implementation. The GD demands unprecedented peace-time investment and would thus be at least a short-term burden on the taxpayer, as well as on other EU needs: it is estimated that achieving the climate and energy targets for 2030 (40% reduction of GHG emissions from 1990 levels, at least 32% increase of renewable energy share, as well as energy efficiency improvement of at least 32.5%), will require investments of €260 billion a year by 2030, amounting to 1.94% of the EU's GDP generated in 2020. There are additional costs, beyond those of climate-related measures that are not a direct part of the transition itself, but are necessary for sustainable development. These are estimated to annually be €100 and €150 billion for environmental protection and resource management, respectively, as well as €142 billion for health and long-term care, affordable housing, education and life-long training. Based on all the given estimations, as well as recognition that long-term future planning is always laden with uncertainties, the main aim of this perspective paper is to analyse the costs of, and relationships between, two exceptionally ambitious expensive goals: to attain net zero emissions by 2050, and during the same time meet the SDGs enabling fair and just transition. Since this is a topic of great interest and volatility, which continuously changes, the authors of this perspective paper have made an effort to address it reasonably adequately despite that, attempting to indeed also describe its dynamics, which are of significant interest by themselves. The conclusions and recommendations as listed in the paper Sections are:• As presented in Section 2 , even though the EU promoted its bold commitment to climate-neutrality, it is still necessary to: a) bring the whole process more in line with the SDGs, especially with the social pillar of sustainability (the European annual SDGs report stated that the GD refers to only 12 out of 17 SDGs); b) define quantitative targets (e.g. targets were identified for only 15 of 102 indicators, focusing on climate change, energy consumption and education); and c) improve consumption patterns to reduce the international environmental spill-over effect. It is, however, not enough for the EU member states to reduce carbon emissions if they continue to consume and import high carbon-footprint products from other countries. The impression is that the EU sees the need for international cooperation, for solving the problem of spill-over effects, while neglecting the related conditions of many small developing economies. This component of cooperation is, however, a key for achieving SDGs on the global level.  • As described in Section 3 , the environmental pillar of the GD has been significantly strengthened thanks to a set of regulations that have improved the requirements under existing regulations, as well as to the adoption of new standards (such as higher vehicle emissions standards and better regulations of land use, forestry and agriculture). Proposing the CBAM as a new climate measure to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, the EC provoked vivid discussion and geopolitical tensions since additional border carbon tax will increase the price of imported products. This new measure has an important potential to encourage higher emission reduction targets in other countries outside the EU, since reduction of carbon emission on global level is not possible without involvement of at least the major emitting countries. Furthermore, this measure may motivate and encourage other countries to develop measures and programmes that will enable allocation of resources to companies which want decarbonisation.  • As presented in Section 4 , a complete investment plan, which would provide financial support for the GD implementation, was adopted. It proposes a financial framework for the budgetary period 2021–2027, including supportive and executive institutions, as well as some new financial mechanisms (e.g. the Just Transition Mechanism), which should enable a sustainable programme of financing.  • The financial plan for the GD implementation (Section 4 ) indicates that half of the funding sources will be from the EU budget, so additional funds are needed from private and other investors. Since the economic transition demonstrates a shift from an energy-intensive economy to a technology-intensive economy, it is necessary to provide all countries with fair access to new associated technologies. It is noteworthy that even though some EU members states have successfully promoted and used renewable energy technologies (e.g. PV and wind farms) during the last decade, these systems have achieved technological and market maturity, so governments should provide stimulations and support for new innovative state-of-the-art technologies.  • Under the current energy crisis that is shaking Europe, especially the imbalance in the European natural gas market that is highly dependent on the increasingly vulnerable imports from Russia, as well as the rapid price increases of electricity, natural gas, oil, and coal, the immediate question is how to ensure energy security in the short term and then in the long run. It is therefore understandable that the EU classified investments into gas and nuclear power plants as “green”. It seems that security of supply was deemed as a priority despite the GHG emissions from using fossil fuels, and the short- and million-years risks associated with using present technologies' nuclear power.  • As described in Section 5 , the EU has large regional differences as a consequence of factors such as different living standards, resources, needs, and socio-economic characteristics of its member states. Even though existential and other benefits of carbon neutralization are expected in the long run, there is a challenge of how to enable socially-fair and equitable transition for all European citizens in the short run. Although the JTM was created to help transition in the regions most affected due to presence of coal mines and energy-intensive industry sectors, it is inevitable that the greatest burden of transition will be felt by vulnerable households and enterprises. It can thus be expected that JTM funds may not reach all vulnerable groups because they do not live in qualifying regions characterized by the energy intensive industry or the fossil fuel energy sector (e.g. some residents of Portugal).  • Since JTM funds are intended only for EU member states, Europe's Western Balkan countries will have to face not only the problem of lack of funds, but also of additional taxation of their products through CBAM.  • As to compliance with the SDGs, a more robust and transparent link with clear cost-benefit analysis for all citizens, is needed.  • The whole concept of climate neutrality as long-lasting strategic goal must include a suitable, albeit complex, monitoring and evaluation mechanism.  • Without thoroughly assessed and clearly presented consequences of each action, including quantitative indicators covering the socio-economic and environmental pillar of sustainability, the implementation of such an ambitious goal would be associated with a high degree of uncertainty for the EU countries, as well as for the world.  • In view of global changes and inevitable problems within each EU member state and at the EU level, insisting on the implementation of the GD without assessment of its socio-economic effects, could potentially jeopardize EU's sustainable development, its financial stability, social equity and quality of life for present and future generations, unity of the EU, and world stability in general.  • Long-lasting transition to climate neutrality can be sustainable only if at least most of the participating countries find strong common benefit in this process and agree to it.
