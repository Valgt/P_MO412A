Analysis and Interpretation  Correspondence    Correspondence  Health in all policies: a strategy to support the Sustainable Development Goals Francisco Becerra-Posada a   a Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC 20037, USA Pan American Health Organization Washington DC 20037 USA     Regarding the Comment by Jeff Waage and colleagues (May, 2015)1   about governing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we appreciate the authors' perspectives on the process of finalising the SDGs and agree with their recommendations to develop new and more accountable governance structures that work across sectors. As a result, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has begun to incorporate the Health in All Policies framework,2   putting it into practice across the region of the Americas. We view it as an important mechanism to find synergies between the third SDG explicitly related to health and the 16 others, which all have the potential to affect health. The SDGs are a result of a complex process that attempts to build on the successes of the MDGs. The proposed list of goals and their associated objectives reflect the multitude of factors that influence development along with the aspirational agenda to improve governance systems. Health is essential to sustainable development and is also one of its most significant achievements. Whereas only one of the 17 SDGs is exclusively about health, many others have targets or represent sectors that are essential to address the environmental and social determinants of health. As society builds sustainable cities, ends poverty and hunger while promoting equity, it also improves health. The conditions in which the world's people are born, live, work, and age, whether they are environmental, economic, or social, determine one's health in very profound ways, often extending beyond the health sector and health policies. Greater synergies between health and other sectors could be achieved by framing the SDGs in such a way that their attainment requires policy coherence and shared solutions across multiple sectors; that is a Health-in-All-Policies approach. This approach provides a policy making framework for governance systems to develop complex solutions for complex problems arising from the array of health determinants. Here at PAHO, we have taken up the challenge of addressing the social determinants of health in the region through action across sectors by becoming the first region in the world to adopt a Regional Plan of Action on Health in All Policies.3   We have also established a Special Task Force on Health in All Policies and the SDGs with the objective of defining a core group of indicators from across the SDG framework that can be used to promote intersectoral actions and monitor their effect on health. We believe that this work complements our Regional Plan of Action on Health in All Policies while working hand-in-hand with our Member States to achieve the ambitious goals being finalised at the UN General Assembly later this year. In preparing for the post-2015 agenda, the public health community now has a unique opportunity to use a Health in All Policies approach in informing policies and practices, recognising the importance of building partnerships and developing networks with and within different sectors of society with the ultimate goal of supporting health equity while promoting positive social change.
