                  Hundreds of millions of unstable croplands have been underutilized in the time series by repeated cultivation and abandonment, leading to threats to food security and loss of ecological benefits due to frequent disturbance on ecosystem restoration. Understanding unstable cropland and its connections to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is required in the context of increasing food demand and natural conservation. Here, we first investigate the global cropland instability and influencing factors, then simulate the stable utilization of unstable cropland and its ecological effects under different scenarios of maintaining crop production. 395 million hectares of croplands in 173 countries are found under unstable utilization, accounting for 22% of global croplands. Over three-quarters of unstable croplands are distributed in areas with unfavorable agricultural conditions or high conservation value, and countries experiencing high cropland instability share a common characteristic of climatic or terrain constraints on agriculture. According to the simulation results, 141 million hectares or 36% of the unstable croplands could be released for ecological restoration with 3.8 more billion tons of carbon sequestration, while the rest of the unstable croplands could be stably used to increase 3% of global total crop production. This study highlights the importance of managing unstable croplands in climate mitigation and natural conservation as well as reconciling crop production and other SDGs, with guiding significance for land-use management, climate action, and biodiversity conservation.

Hundreds of millions of unstable croplands have been underutilized in the time series by repeated cultivation and abandonment, leading to threats to food security and loss of ecological benefits due to frequent disturbance on ecosystem restoration. Understanding unstable cropland and its connections to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is required in the context of increasing food demand and natural conservation. Here, we first investigate the global cropland instability and influencing factors, then simulate the stable utilization of unstable cropland and its ecological effects under different scenarios of maintaining crop production. 395 million hectares of croplands in 173 countries are found under unstable utilization, accounting for 22% of global croplands. Over three-quarters of unstable croplands are distributed in areas with unfavorable agricultural conditions or high conservation value, and countries experiencing high cropland instability share a common characteristic of climatic or terrain constraints on agriculture. According to the simulation results, 141 million hectares or 36% of the unstable croplands could be released for ecological restoration with 3.8 more billion tons of carbon sequestration, while the rest of the unstable croplands could be stably used to increase 3% of global total crop production. This study highlights the importance of managing unstable croplands in climate mitigation and natural conservation as well as reconciling crop production and other SDGs, with guiding significance for land-use management, climate action, and biodiversity conservation.   Keywords Land use  Natural conservation  Ecosystem restoration  Crop production  Carbon sink   Data availability The data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction Agricultural production has replaced large-scale natural ecosystems across the planet (Crist et al., 2017 ; Foley et al., 2011 ; Gibbs et al., 2010 ; Potapov et al., 2022 ), becoming a major driver of carbon emissions and biodiversity loss (Lark et al., 2020a ; Vijay and Armsworth, 2021 ). Optimistic scenarios for combating climate change and species extinction often rely on ecosystem restoration, especially forest regeneration. It is recognized as a critical strategy towards multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by increasing carbon sequestration and providing habitats for endangered species, offering ecosystem services and socio-economic benefits (Chazdon et al., 2016, 2017 ; Fu et al., 2023 ; Griggs et al., 2013 ). However, ecological restoration processes are easily interrupted by human land use demands and are often not sustained. Although hundreds of millions of hectares of cropland have been abandoned (Feng et al., 2022 ), which appears an opportunity for habitat restoration for ecological benefits, a significant portion of the abandonment is found too ephemeral to provide major benefits for biodiversity and climate due to re-cultivation (Crawford et al., 2022 ). Monitoring changes in land use over the years reveals a type of land that is repeatedly cultivated and abandoned, which we define as unstable cropland (Chaudhary et al., 2020 ; Du et al., 2019 ; Kc and Race, 2020 ; Prishchepov et al., 2021 ). This unstable cropland, often accompanied by changes in land use/cover, is neither cropland nor ecological land in the traditional sense; to some extent, it is underutilized as cropland, creating uncertainty to crop production and livelihoods and possibly threatening SDG 2 (Zero hunger). Furthermore, it is likely to repeatedly disturb the restoration of natural ecosystems and thus lead to unstable habitats (Fig. B1), reduced carbon sink and ecosystem services, which are challenges addressed by SDG 13 (Climate action) and SDG 15 (Life on land) (Acevedo-Charry and Aide, 2019 ; Isbell et al., 2019 ; Moreno-Mateos et al., 2020 ). The fact of food insecurity requires more cropland to end hunger (FAO, 2021 ; Mogollón et al., 2021 ), while more natural habitats and forest recovery are needed to mitigate biodiversity decline and climate change (Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ), leading to land use competition for different SDGs. In this context, more understanding of unstable cropland use as well as its connections to sustainable development is required, especially when little attention has been paid to the potential effects of recurring land use conversions (Martinez-Feria and Basso, 2020 ; Næss et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2021 ). Typically, unstable cropland causes more extensive and frequent disturbances to ecosystem restoration than stable cropland of the same size (Fig. B1, Discussion 4.2.1). This implies that managing unstable cropland has the potential to free up land for durable ecosystem recovery and more benefits, which is largely ignored in the current cropland establishment-abandonment studies (Næss et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2021 ; Zabel et al., 2019 ), and the quantity involved and the impacts on natural conservation are yet unclear. Different from most established research that separates the cropland establishment from abandonment, we focus on unstable cropland from a dynamic perspective and its potential effects and connections to SDGs (Iordan et al., 2023 ; Næss et al., 2021 ). Regarding this, we investigate the global cropland instability and influencing factors and further simulate the possible impacts of stabilizing unstable cropland. Through simulations and scenario analyses, the potential of cropland release and the impacts on natural conservation and carbon sink are estimated and synthesized to provide a multi-win solution for SDGs. Collectively, this study could reveal the spatial distribution and restrictions of unstable cropland and provide implications for reconciling crop production and other SDGs, land-use management, and sustainable development.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Research logic To meet these challenges, more understanding of unstable cropland utilization as well as its impacts is required. Here we first explored the distribution and characteristics of unstable cropland globally and the cropland instability at the national level. Under different scenarios of maintaining crop production, we simulated the stable utilization (or ecosystem restoration) of unstable cropland. Using spatial statistics and scenario analysis, we analyzed the potential sites and amounts of unstable croplands available for durable ecosystem recovery and those for stable utilization. This information was combined with an analysis of ecosystem restoration potential to estimate the impacts of managing unstable cropland on natural conservation and carbon sink under various scenarios (Fig. B2).  2.2 Data and processing Unstable cropland pixels are identified and simulated at a resolution of 250 m. The shapefile and grid maps for analyses are shown in Table 1  . The global cropping intensity maps and land cover data for identifying unstable cropland are derived from the annual dynamic dataset of global cropping intensity and Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers (CGLS-LC100 Collection 3), respectively. The Key Biodiversity Areas are from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA), and the Protected Areas are from the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). The global land area with climate constraints is derived from the FAO Map catalog, from which we extracted the sites with severe moisture constraints and severe temperature constraints as the climate-restricted zone. By extracting land with a slope > 25° based on the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data, the terrain-restricted zone for crop production is prepared for further analyses. Through extracting soil layers with extreme topsoil pH (pH<4.5 or pH ≥ 8.5) or with sandy (or loamy sandy) textures from the Harmonized World Soil Database, the soil-restricted zone for crop production is prepared. The global gridded crop harvested area and yield data provided by Grogan et al. (2022)  are used to estimate crop production. The vegetation biomass data are derived from the global datasets of forest above-ground biomass and are combined with the methods provided by IPCC guidelines to estimate vegetation carbon sequestration.  2.3 Identifying unstable cropland In this study, unstable cropland refers to land that is repeatedly cultivated and left unused, accompanied by temporal changes in land use/cover and manifested by instability in crop production function. Considering the differences in the maximum cropping intensity in different regions, we identified land with interruptions in growing crops in one or more years as unstable cropland. The global cropping intensity maps (Liu et al., 2021 ) are used for identification, in which four variable values from 0 to 3 indicate no crop, single, double, and triple crops in a year, respectively. We first extracted pixels with cropping intensity equal to or >1 at least in one year from 2015 to 2019 as the cropland in the broad sense. Since some pixels have been converted to unplantable land types, we removed the impervious surface, water bodies, and wetlands. To highlight the temporal changes in the cropping intensity of cropland, we established a cropping intensity tag for each cropland pixel based on the time axis. The sliding window method is used to detect unstable cropland. Given that unstable cropland is characterized by repeated farming and abandonment, we recognized pixels with tags including intermittent “0” sequences as unstable croplands (Fig. B3). Additionally, we considered unstable croplands unutilized for more years as higher unstable ones; unstable croplands with one year unutilized were recognized as low unstable, two or three years unutilized as moderately unstable, and four years unutilized as highly unstable. Furthermore, we calculated the cropland instability rate (%) to characterize the stability status of cropland utilization in a region, which equals the ratio of unstable cropland area to the total cropland area. To provide an objective assessment of the cropland instability at the national level, we developed a cropland instability index by integrating the area and proportion of unstable cropland. The formula for calculating the cropland instability index involves taking the natural logarithm of the unstable cropland area and multiplying it by the cropland instability rate. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between cropland stability and national food security. We first measured food security using the prevalence of moderate/severe food insecurity, based on Food Security Indicators provided by FAOSTAT for the years 2018–2020 (FAOSTAT, 2023 ). We then analyzed the correlation between cropland instability and food security levels using Spearman correlation analysis.  2.4 Scenario boundary setting Given the growing food demand, managing the use of cropland should not come at the expense of food production. Therefore, our simulation analysis of stabilizing unstable cropland is based on the precondition of maintaining crop production. We thus considered different levels of crop production maintenance for the simulation analysis by allowing crop production to change within a certain range: the basic production maintenance scenario (the basic scenario) requires maintaining current crop production roughly unchanged; based on this, we considered the variation of maintaining crop production within ±15%, leading to a high production maintenance scenario (the high scenario) and a low production maintenance scenario (the low scenario), respectively. The basic scenario: After the simulation of stable utilization of cropland, crop production is roughly unchanged compared to the baseline production (using production in the year 2015 as a baseline); this scenario could benefit nature conservation while keeping no decline in crop production. The high scenario: Our estimated crop production after stabilized utilization of cropland is about 15% higher than baseline production; this scenario implies a more food-secure situation as it meets the increasing demands for food. The low scenario: Our estimated crop production after stable utilization of cropland would decrease by approximately 15% than baseline production; this scenario has lower requirements for production maintenance to promote more ecosystem restoration in areas of need, more concerned with global climate change and biodiversity decline and closely linked to the SDG13 and SDG15.  2.5 Simulating stable utilization of unstable cropland 2.5.1 A spatial rule for simulation Stabilizing unstable cropland allows for durable ecosystem recovery of a portion of the unstable cropland and stable use of the rest. Particularly, we developed a spatial rule for simulating the stable utilization (or ecosystem restoration) of unstable cropland, in which unstable cropland pixels would be either for durable ecosystem recovery or stable cropping, and those with higher ecosystem restoration priority (ERP) are preferentially identified for ecological restoration. Using this rule and scenario analyses, we analyzed the unstable cropland available for durable ecosystem recovery under the condition of maintaining crop production. In the initial cropland layer with unstable cropland identified, unstable cropland pixels with higher ERP values are preferentially selected for ecological restoration, whereas the lowest value pixels (ERP ≈ 0) are selected last. After selecting unstable cropland pixels of each ranking (for ecological restoration), the remaining unselected pixels, which are taken for stable utilization, are used to calculate crop production. Then, the crop production after each round of pixel selection is compared with the baseline production. If the crop production target set in the scenario is not met, the next round of selection continues; the simulation ends when the production change matches the target of the three scenarios we set. At this point, the pixels selected are those used for ecological restoration, and the pixels unselected are for stable cropland use.  2.5.2 Ecological restoration priority We referred to the additive benefit function (ABF) to rank the ERP for unstable cropland pixels (Di Minin et al., 2014 ; Moilanen et al., 2014 ). ABF is a function that calculates the total benefit of combining multiple factors. It is commonly used in cost-benefit analysis and resource allocation, allowing decision-makers to compare different options based on their benefits and make informed decisions. Such an approach could identify areas with more ecological restoration features as high-priority areas. It enables more restoration requirements to be met through recovering per amount of area and does not require targets or thresholds that necessarily have a degree of arbitrarity. To this end, we considered the need for ecological restoration and established seven ecosystem restoration feature layers; unstable cropland pixels covered by more ecosystem restoration feature layers are attributed with a higher value of ERP. The seven restoration feature layers are specified as follows: (i) Key Biodiversity Areas are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity and are recognized as critical places worldwide for species and their habitats (Eken et al., 2004 ; Garrett et al., 2020 ; Kullberg et al., 2019 ). Protected Areas play a vital role in slowing habitat loss and maintaining a sustainable population of species (Geldmann et al., 2014 ; Lewis et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2017 ). Since these are areas of high conservation value, unstable cropland within them is likely to cause marginal outputs at significant ecological costs. We thus extracted the terrestrial Key Biodiversity Areas and Protected Areas as two of the restoration feature layers. (ii) Floodplains are areas on both sides of rivers and around lakes that are susceptible to flooding, where cropland is at riverine risk and unstable (Nardi et al., 2019 ; Potapov et al., 2022 ). We thus extracted floodplains as a restoration feature layer. (iii) Unstable croplands in poor agricultural conditions are unsuitable for agricultural production and may adversely impact regional ecosystems, we thus extracted the climate-restricted zone, soil-restricted zone, and terrain-restricted zone (Materials and Methods 2.2) as the restoration feature layers. (iv) The production uncertainty zone represents areas where cropland performance is highly unstable in actual production; we selected it as the restoration feature layer as it is highly underutilized and is likely to cause higher environmental costs.  2.5.3 Quantifying changes in crop production We estimated crop production at baseline and after stable utilization of unstable cropland, based on the global gridded crop harvested area and yield data (Grogan et al., 2022 ) at 5-min grids. As we could not determine which specific crop would be cultivated on each unstable cropland pixel under different scenarios, we estimated crop production (three main crops of wheat, rice, and maize are considered) by quantifying changes in cropping area and cropping intensity for each 5-min grid cell. Assuming that the cropping structure within each grid cell remains unchanged, we estimated crop production on each 5-min grid cell according to Eqs. (1) and (2) . However, it is important to note that most of the unstable cropland shows unstable cropping intensity. For example, some cropland pixels were cultivated less times in 2015 compared to other years. This indicates their underutilization at the 2015 cropping intensity and their potential for increasing intensity, and that estimating crop production with the 2015 cropping intensity could cause an underestimation. We thus quantified this potential and considered two cases: crop production with the 2015 cropping intensity and with stable intensity (the maximum supportable intensity) (Xu et al., 2021 ).(1) P c , stable  i  = AF c i  × HA c , 2015  i  × Y c , 2015  i     (2) P c , stable +   i  = AF c i  × HA c , 2015  i  × Y c , 2015  i  × P CI i      Where, i   represents the 5-min grid cell i  . P c , stable  i    represents the production of crop c   with the 2015 cropping intensity under stable utilization; P c , stable +   i    represents the production of crop c   with the stable cropping intensity under stable utilization. AF c i    is the area change factor, which is the ratio of cropping area under stable utilization to that under the baseline. HA c , 2015  i    represents the harvested area in the year 2015 in grid cell i , and Y c , 2015  i    represents the yield in the year 2015. P CI i    is the potential coefficient of increasing intensity on the 2015 cropping intensity for grid cell i  , determined by the average potential (at the pixel level, the ratio of the maximum cropping intensity that occurred during 2015–2019 to the 2015 cropping intensity) of cropland pixels (250 m) within grid cell i .   2.6 Change in vegetation carbon storage Managing unstable cropland enables more durable ecosystem recovery to increase ecological benefits for climate and biodiversity. Our approach begins by assessing the ecosystem restoration potential through the measurement of potential vegetation biomass. Based on this assessment, we estimated the potential carbon sink provided by the vegetation, following the IPCC guidelines. Given that ecosystem recovery of unstable cropland is too ephemeral to provide major benefits due to re-cultivation, we assumed that the vegetation biomass during the ephemerally unutilized period of unstable cropland is negligible compared to an advanced succession stage. In this context, an advanced succession stage refers to a phase when the vegetation cover and species composition have significantly recovered and diversified compared to the earlier stages of succession, showing similar characteristics with undisturbed ecosystems. The potential ecological benefits of stabilizing unstable cropland are thus measured with the biomass and carbon storage attainable at this advanced succession stage. To achieve this, we employed a moving window method that assigns a 5-min window to each pixel of unstable cropland released for ecosystem restoration. If there are pixels within a window exhibiting varying biomass values, we take the maximum value as the potential biomass with sufficient ecosystem recovery. If no biomass is present within the window, it indicates that the pixel is unable to evolve into an ecosystem with significant biomass. The potential vegetation biomass B stable j    and carbon storage C stable j    are calculated under different scenarios:(3) B stable j  = max B j _ window  n   , n = 1 , 2 , … , N 2     (4) C stable j  = B stable j  × 1 + R j     × CF     j   is the j  th  unstable cropland pixel for ecosystem restoration. B j _ window  n    is the biomass of the n  th  pixel within the 5-min window of pixel j  . R j    is the ratio of below-ground biomass to the above-ground biomass. We assigned corresponding R j    values to pixels within different ecological zones according to IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 2006a ); global ecological zones are divided based on observed climate and vegetation patterns (available at http://www.fao.org ). CF   is the carbon fraction of dry matter, using which we could convert biomass to carbon following IPCC default conversion factor (IPCC, 2006b ).   3 Results 3.1 Unstable croplands and constraints Unstable cropland is widespread across the globe occupying 395 million hectares (Mha) (Fig. 1  ), approximately 22% of global cropland. About one-third of unstable croplands are identified as highly unstable, leading to waste of land resources or hindering sustained ecological restoration. Asia carries 41% of global unstable cropland and nearly half of the highly unstable cropland. To describe the level of instability of cropland utilization, the cropland instability rate is calculated to quantify the proportion of unstable cropland to cropland area in a particular region. Regarding this, Australia has the highest instability rate at 40%, in contrast, South America shows a low instability rate of 10%. Using spatial superposition analysis, we find that more than three-quarters of unstable croplands have natural or socio-economic constraints on cropland utilization, distributed in the climate-restricted zone, soil-restricted zone, terrain-restricted zone, and areas with high conservation value (Fig. B4). This potentially leads to higher environmental costs associated with the use of cropland. Where, over half of unstable cropland is distributed in the climate-restricted zone (Materials and Methods 2.2), where climate constrains agricultural production potential to a high degree. The proportion of unstable cropland to cropland reaches 42% in the climate-restricted zone, indicating that unfavorable climatic conditions are detrimental to cropland stability. Over one-fifth of unstable cropland is distributed in the soil-restricted zone (Materials and Methods 2.2), where the topsoil pH and texture are highly unsuitable for agricultural production, resulting in a 31% cropland instability rate. Besides, there are also 32.4Mha of unstable cropland located in the terrain-restricted zone (sloping land>25°), in which the cropland instability rate reaches 27%. The higher rate of cropland instability in the restricted zone indicates to some extent that unfavorable natural conditions may reduce cropland stability and sustainability. Moreover, some areas with high biodiversity conservation value have extensive unstable cropland areas. 47.6Mha of unstable cropland are found occurring in Protected Areas; 26.9Mha are located in Key Biodiversity Areas, which are home to critical populations of the world's threatened species. Unstable croplands occupying vital or vulnerable habitats tend to cause higher ecological costs at marginal outputs. To protect life on land (SDG15), particular attention should be paid to unstable croplands within these areas.  3.2 Cropland instability at the national level Exploring cropland instability at the national level helps reveal the characteristics and efficiency of cropland use in different countries, as well as exploring the common factors affecting cropland instability. Russia carries 16% of the global unstable cropland on 7% of the global cropland, while Brazil contributes only 2% with 5% of the global cropland area. Given the significant variation in cropland area across countries, a single rate or area of unstable cropland cannot fully represent its stability. We thus evaluate the cropland instability at the national level with a cropland instability index. Some common characteristics in countries with high cropland instability are found (Fig. 2  ). Among the top 20 countries with highest cropland instability, 15 of them have severe climatic or terrain constraints on agriculture, such as high latitude, extremely arid climate, and mountainous topography. Besides, 5 of these 20 countries with the highest cropland instability are found in conflicts recently or currently; for example, in Afghanistan and Syria, 76% and 68% of cropland are in an unstable state, respectively. This indicates, to some extent, that conflicts may aggravate cropland instability or that certain factors (e.g., resource competition) simultaneously drive war and cropland instability. Among the one hundred countries (regions) with cropland instability rates beyond 50%, only two developed countries (Finland and Iceland) are included. For most developed countries, contributions to global unstable cropland are lower than those to global cropland, reflecting their relatively stable cropland patterns. Notably, 4 of the top 5 countries (except for Kazakhstan) with the highest cropland instability rank among the world's least developed countries (Fig. 2 ). High proportion of unstable cropland is likely to make them more vulnerable to sustained access to food. This can be supported by our findings that most countries at a low prevalence of moderate/severe food insecurity when the cropland instability rate is below 20%. Despite this, according to our correlation analysis between cropland instability and food security, at the national level, cropland stability and food security do not show a necessary link, which can be explained by total cropland area, cross-border trade, and diversified food sources.  3.3 Land release for durable ecosystem recovery Through cropland use simulation and scenario analyses, the sites and quantity of unstable cropland available for durable ecosystem recovery are analyzed. Results show that managing unstable cropland enables varying amounts of land released for lasting ecosystem recovery under varying levels of maintaining crop production. Up to 141.4 Mha (36%) of unstable cropland could be released for durable ecosystem restoration under the basic scenario (Table A1), where the potential for nature conservation is maximized while keeping no decline in crop production. Thus, this scenario could simultaneously benefits SDG 2 and SDG 15 by releasing more habitats and increasing food production and its stability. These unstable croplands for restoration are mainly distributed in the Western Siberian Plains, Canadian Plains, Sudanese Steppe, and Southeastern Australia (Fig. 3  ). Up to 24 countries (regions), such as Finland, Namibia, and Kuwait, could free up >30% of unstable cropland for ecosystem restoration (Fig. B5, Table A2). These countries, mostly located in Africa, Northern Europe, and Central Asia, generally have worse agricultural conditions. In contrast, 37.2Mha, about 9% of unstable cropland, could be released for durable ecosystem recovery under the high scenario, where most unstable cropland would be retained for cropping with the proportion for ecosystem restoration lower than 20% in most countries. Although only a small portion of the land is allowed for lasting ecological restoration, this scenario contributes significantly to SDG2 through increasing the calories of crop production by 14%, under the context of population growth and increasing hunger. Approximately 303.2Mha (77%) of unstable cropland could be released for durable ecosystem recovery under the low scenario. The proportion of unstable cropland for ecological restoration would be over 90% in Egypt, Chad, Mauritania, and 44 other countries (regions). Generally, unstable cropland in the Sahara Desert and the Middle East tends to have a high proportion of land released for ecosystem restoration, and that in Western Europe and South America has a lower proportion for restoration.  3.4 Potential benefits of carbon sequestration Using spatial statistics and scenario analyses, the simulation results are combined with an analysis of ecosystem restoration potential to estimate the impacts of managing unstable cropland on carbon sink. Stable utilization of unstable cropland allows sufficient ecosystem recovery of released land by excluding reutilization to prosper global vegetation biomass. It is estimated that stabilizing unstable cropland has the potential to increase vegetation carbon storage by 3.8 billion tons (Pg) under the basic scenario while enabling a slight increase in crop production. This indicates that stabilizing cropland use can significantly increase carbon sinks while ensuring crop production and promoting ecosystem restoration, which simultaneously benefits SDG2, SDG13, and SDG15. Moreover, it could unlock vast potential for vegetation carbon storage of 8.6 Pg under the low scenario, which is almost close to the total carbon storage (9.2 Pg) of forests across China (Table A1), albeit with some amount of crop production loss. Increased carbon sequestration by vegetation is not equally distributed across countries. Russia and Indonesia would be the primary contributors to global carbon sink benefits (that is, increase in carbon storage) (Fig. 4  , Table A3); these two countries have the potential to increase vegetation carbon storage by 1.8 Pg and 1.3 Pg respectively, accounting for about 21% and 15% of the global carbon sink benefits, followed by Canada and China. In addition, unstable cropland within or surrounded by forests shows higher benefits in carbon storage when it is available for ecosystem restoration, especially in Africa's Gulf of Guinea coast and Congo Basin, the plains of Eastern Europe, the plains of Western Siberia, and the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. Natural ecosystems in these areas are advanced and complex; durable ecosystem recovery would greatly benefit carbon storage as well as the complex biomes and diverse ecosystems. More importantly, the cumulative contribution rate of the top ten countries accounts for 63–71% of global carbon sink benefits, implying that prioritizing the stable utilization (or durable ecosystem recovery) of unstable cropland in these several countries is likely to increase significant carbon sequestration.  3.5 Maintenance of crop production For simulating stable utilization (or ecosystem restoration) of unstable cropland, a crop production module is developed with the feedback of production change to maintain crop production within a certain range. To examine the integrated production changes, we further convert crop production into crop calories based on the nutritive factors provided by FAO. When we use the 2015 cropping intensity to estimate crop production, the calories of global crop production would increase by 12% more than the baseline under the high scenario, decrease by 15% under the low scenario, and remain largely unchanged under the basic scenario. Stable utilization of unstable cropland (with stable intensity) could increase global crop calories by 14% than the baseline under the high scenario and increase global crop calories by 3% under the basic scenario with 36% of the area released for ecosystem restoration (Table A1). This indicates that stabilizing the cropping intensity of cropland is helpful to increase crop production. Even in the case of retiring all unstable cropland for ecosystem restoration, the stable and intensive utilization of global cropland could fully cover the maize loss and compensate for 72% and 48% of wheat and rice losses, respectively. As evidenced by the findings, stabilizing unstable cropland could benefit crop production while reducing the footprint and thus provide more space for natural habitats. However, the extent to which crop production is affected varies across countries and crops (Fig. 5  , Fig. B6, Table A4). To characterize the gains and losses in crop production at the national level, a change index of crop calories is calculated with the ratio of crop calories under different scenarios to that at the baseline. Some countries, such as Sri Lanka, could benefit in crop production under either scenario. The majority of countries could benefit from stabilizing unstable cropland under the high and basic scenarios, such as Russia and China. Despite the fact that large-area unstable cropland is identified for durable ecosystem recovery in these two countries, the impacts on food production are not so significant for their vast cropland area.   4 Discussion 4.1 Influencing factors of cropland instability The causes of unstable cropland are complex, varying by region and time, with most being the result of a combination of factors. Through summarizing established studies on cropland utilization, we basically could classify the influencing factors of cropland instability into four categories: (i) Natural constraints (e.g., arid climate, high slopes, infertile soils, natural disasters) impact the cropland stability via affecting land functions and farmers' decisions (Chaudhary et al., 2020 ; Kc and Race, 2020 ; Liu et al., 2019 ; Lobell and Burke, 2008 ; Martinez-Feria and Basso, 2020 ); (ii) Socioeconomic drivers (e.g., cropping profits, employment preferences, population migration, urbanization, global trade) influence farmers' decisions on whether and what to plant (Chen et al., 2022 ; Du et al., 2019 ; Ioffe et al., 2012 ; Li and Li, 2017 ; Prishchepov et al., 2021 ; van Vliet et al., 2015 ); (iii) Policy factors (e.g., promoting crop fallow) mainly represent the government's intervention on cropland utilization (Díaz et al., 2019 ); (iv) Conflicts impact the cropland stability by directly destroying crops and impeding farmers' planting operations (Huang et al., 2019 ; Olsen et al., 2021 ). Quantifying the contribution of a particular influencing factor is challenging, as unstable cropland is impacted by multi-factors simultaneously in most cases. Nevertheless, we are able to demonstrate, to some extent, that some natural and social constraints are closely related to cropland instability. One piece of evidence is that the instability rate of cropland is typically higher in zones with physical or socio-economic constraints than in other general areas (Results 3.1). Besides, as the restricted dimensionality increases, the cropland instability rate increases (Fig. B7); the number of constraints has a positive correlation with the cropland instability rate at the 0.05 level. Both of the two support our analyses that unfavorable physical conditions have negative impacts on the stable utilization of cropland. More broadly, globalization has put cropland utilization into a more complex system, with increasing exposure to global climate change, international trade, changes in diet structure, and demands for biodiversity and carbon sequestration. The dynamics of cropland at the global scale thus deserve sufficient attention for more understanding of instability and its underlying drivers, and to control cropland instability and underutilization.  4.2 Fulfilling the role of cropland management towards SDGs 4.2.1 Linking cropland use patterns to SDGs Understanding cropland use and its connections to the SDGs is beneficial in the context of increasing land demands for crop production, natural conservation, and carbon sequestration. The spatial pattern of using cropland determines the location and potential for crop production and ecological restoration, as well as the environmental costs. The temporal stability of using cropland affects production efficiency and uncertainty as well as the duration of ecosystem restoration, thus leading to varying production and ecological benefits. These benefits/losses are highly associated with different SDGs, especially, crop production for zero hunger (SDG2), carbon sink for climate action (SDG13), and habitat quality and ecosystem services for life on land (SDG15). This indicates that SDGs-beneficial cropland use should enable efficient food production with fewer natural habitats occupied and less environmental cost. Particularly, it is noteworthy that not only can spatially relocating cropland reduce the environmental footprint of food production but that temporally stabilizing unstable cropland can also provide significant ecological benefits for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. This is exactly highlighted by our findings that stable using two-thirds of unstable croplands for cultivation could increase carbon sink and biodiversity benefits by releasing the rest for durable ecosystem restoration while maintaining crop production.  4.2.2 Managing unstable cropland for reconciling multi-SDGs Pursuing different SDGs leads to spatial conflicts of different land uses. Cropland expansion for growing food demand is often accompanied by competition with other land uses driven by other SDGs, e.g., ecosystem restoration for life on land (SDG15). Reconciling these goals places an urgent demand on reducing the adverse impacts of cropland use on other SDGs. Unstable cropland is considered detrimental to food security and ecological benefits due to its underutilization and disturbance to ecosystem recovery. In this study, the importance of managing unstable croplands to combat climate change and preserve biodiversity is highlighted with a simulation of stabilizing unstable cropland and its potential benefits; retiring unstable cropland with high ERP (occupying high conservation value areas or facing unfavorable agricultural conditions) for ecosystem restoration and stably using the rest is beneficial to sustainable land use, more stable crop production and additionally, increasing carbon sink and intact habitats. This has far-reaching implications across different sectors for agriculture, climate action, and biodiversity conservation. Investigating unstable cropland and its connections with SDGs offers valuable insights into how to leverage land use management for reconciling crop production and other SDGs. This information serves as a basis for decision-making regarding land-use management and sustainable development. Additionally, managing unstable croplands provides a source-based pathway to control cropland expansion, where most current efforts such as designating the protected area and prohibiting irrational reclamation (Dinerstein et al., 2017 ; Jones et al., 2018 ; Venter et al., 2014 ) are exactly process-based or bottom-line restrictions. Stabilizing the use of some croplands and enabling the rest for ecosystem recovery could save 36% of the land area to sustain crop production, showing great potential in controlling expansion. Better use of existing unstable cropland is preferable to continued expansion, especially in the context when cropland is moving onto lower-quality land and high conservation value land (Chen et al., 2022 ; Lark et al., 2020b ; Vijay and Armsworth, 2021 ).  4.2.3 Combining stable cropland use with sustainable cropland use Cropland fallow systems have been proposed by many researchers to achieve sustainable use of cropland. Usually, intermittent utilization of cropland is recognized as environmentally friendly and conducive to sustainable land use in a specific region. However, just as the sum of individual rationality does not equal collective rationality, sustainable land use in each region/land is not necessarily conducive to the SDGs on a global scale; for instance, the intermittent cultivation and idling, while beneficial in mitigating local environmental costs, but may lead to a loss of ecological benefits on a global scale due to disrupting ecological restoration process and corresponding carbon sequestration (Fig. B8). Therefore, there is a need to combine the advantages of sustainable cropland use with SDG-beneficial cropland use. In this regard, we propose the combination of stable cropland layout and sustainable land use practices, to reconcile multi-SDGs at the macro scale and benefit sustainable land use at the micro scale. On the one aspect, stabilizing unstable cropland can help establish a clear and stable cropland layout and thus contribute to reconciling crop production and natural conservation by ensuring some unstable croplands' durable ecological restoration, especially those occupying high conservation value areas or facing unfavorable agricultural conditions. Long-term ecological restoration can be facilitated by policies and economic instruments such as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). On the other aspect, stable cropland utilization does not equate to overutilization but rather supports the implementation of sustainable land management practices for sustainable agricultural production. Commonly used measures include temporarily suspending economic activities, conservation tillage, soil conservation measures, land consolidation and improvement in an organized manner. Providing technical assistance and financial incentives to adopt these practices can encourage farmers to continue farming on stable croplands rather than re-cultivating land that is undergoing ecological restoration.   4.3 Feasibility It is important to note that this study provides a conceptual framework and estimation of the benefits of managing unstable cropland through simulations. However, it does not encompass specific plans and actions for implementing ecological restoration. In the implementation process, thorough investigation and consideration of multiple factors are necessary. To realize the potential ecological benefits of stabilizing unstable cropland, promoting ecosystem restoration on released land and protecting farmers' interests are both crucial. Convincing people to give up farming requires addressing their socio-economic needs; for example, providing alternative income opportunities, investing in infrastructure and services, and involving communities in decision-making. At the same time, land consolidation and industry cultivation can be implemented to improve people's livelihoods (Pašakarnis and Maliene, 2010 ; Qu et al., 2019 ). Several established ecological restoration-related projects, such as reforestation, are also helpful to promote land release for rehabilitation (Lefebvre et al., 2021 ; Windisch et al., 2021 ). Although it is challenging, it is more feasible than relocating global cropland (Beyer et al., 2022 ; Folberth et al., 2020 ), as it involves particular cropland with prominent issues. On the other side, to facilitate the stable utilization of the rest unstable cropland, strong policy and economic instruments such as agricultural subsidies are suggested to incentivize farmers' sustained cropland use (Li and Li, 2017 ). Given that most unstable cropland is affected by one or more restrictions, it is necessary to identify these restrictions and improve them accordingly via agricultural technologies. Sustainable land management practices are also recommended for the long-term stability and productivity of cropland. Furthermore, simulating unstable cropland use on a global scale leads to varying impacts across countries and regions (Fig. 4 , Fig. 5 ). Corresponding measures should be taken to guarantee national fairness based on cost-benefit analyses of production and environment across countries (Table A3, Table A4); for example, including increased carbon sink in the carbon market and national greenhouse-gas accounting (Kander et al., 2015 ; Lou et al., 2022 ; Nogrady, 2021 ) to benefit nations with large-scale ecosystem restoration, and establishing trading and compensation mechanisms between the beneficiary and disadvantaged countries.  4.4 Limitations and uncertainties The stable utilization (or ecosystem restoration) of unstable cropland is simulated using a spatial rule based on the ERP. Seven feature layers of ecosystem restoration are established to determine the ERP in each pixel. Those layers are regarding unfavorable agricultural environment, natural restrictions, and high conservation value, which are mainly physical and regulatory ones and are unlikely to be changed in the short term. Indeed, some factors that constrain cropland utilization or support ecological restoration may change in the future with technological development and climate change. However, our simulation does not consider these changes and unpredictable factors (e.g., conflicts (Olsen et al., 2021 )) but is applicable to the general situation at the current agriculture level. In addition, our identification of unstable cropland is based primarily on remote sensing monitoring, which can only identify the phenomenon of unstable cropland but cannot distinguish the drivers of cropland instability (including, but not limited to, natural-driven abandonment, socioeconomic-driven abandonment and re-cultivation, fallow for land fertility). Uncertainties in our analyses are linked to two aspects: simulation of stabilizing unstable cropland and estimation of corresponding effects. On one aspect, simulation results of using unstable cropland are highly affected by the ERP. According to the rule we established, unstable cropland covered by more restoration feature layers has a higher ERP value. Such a rule enables unstable cropland that occupies areas of high conservation value and faces more unfavorable agricultural conditions to be prioritized for ecological restoration but fails to distinguish the importance of different restoration feature layers. On the other, uncertainties of estimation derive mainly from the relevant data and methods. Estimations of crop production are validated at the national level by comparing the crop production in 2015 by our calculation with the data published by FAO; the closeness of the two confirms our calculations' credibility. The changes in crop production are calculated with the gridded crop harvested area and yield data as well as the cropland area change at 5-min grid cells; the latter is determined by the simulation results of the previous step, and the former is produced with Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) model and validated by comparing to FAOSTAT5 reported harvested area by crop and by country and by comparing to other publicly available global gridded datasets. Estimates of potential vegetation biomass and carbon storage are influenced by the accuracy of biomass data and the soundness of estimation methods. The biomass data we use has been validated in the published dataset. The potential vegetation biomass is calculated with established methods (Windisch et al., 2021 ) and supported by the climax succession hypothesis (Meeker and Merkel, 1984 ) and Tobler's First Law; the vegetation carbon storage is calculated with the authoritative methodology provided by IPCC guidelines.   5 Conclusions Ecosystem restoration is recognized as a critical strategy towards multiple SDGs by increasing carbon sequestration and providing habitats for endangered species. However, hundreds of millions of unstable croplands have been repeatedly cultivated and abandoned, leading to uncertainty in food security and frequent disturbance to ecosystem recovery, and thus losing major benefits of carbon sinks and stable habitats. In the context of increasing demand for crop production and natural conservation, more understanding of unstable cropland as well as its connections to SDGs is required. Here, we investigate the global cropland instability and influencing factors, and simulate the stable utilization of unstable cropland and its potential effects under different scenarios of maintaining crop production. 395 million hectares of croplands in 173 countries are found under unstable utilization, accounting for 22% of global croplands. Over three-quarters of unstable croplands are constrained by natural and socio-economic factors, occurring within the climate-restricted zone, soil-restricted zone, terrain-restricted zone, and areas with high conservation value. Among the top 20 countries with the highest cropland instability, 15 of them have severe climatic or terrain constraints on agriculture. According to our simulation results, 141 million hectares, approximately 36% of the unstable croplands could be released for durable ecosystem restoration with 3.8 more billion tons of carbon sink benefits, while the rest of the unstable croplands could be stably used to increase 3% of global total crop production. Our findings highlight the importance of managing unstable croplands to combat climate change and preserve biodiversity while maintaining crop production. This provides implications for reconciling crop production and other SDGs as well as insights for land-use management, climate action, and biodiversity conservation.
