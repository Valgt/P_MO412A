                  In the recently identified pandemic of COVID-19, most countries have stopped their work, industrial activities, businesses and education activities. This pandemic also had a great impact on energy and environment research, which is a vital component in the transition to sustainable development. In response to this pandemic, Qatar had to stop all kinds of on-site education activities and shifted to virtual learning techniques (or distance learning). Using distant learning has a potential impact on the quality of education and research activities, especially energy and environment research. So, to assess the effectiveness of virtual learning in this pandemic time in Qatar, a structured survey is conducted for university students and staff to assess their perception about distant learning. The survey revealed that virtual learning overall had a positive impact, but it can affect the quality and the progress of education in the country.

In the recently identified pandemic of COVID-19, most countries have stopped their work, industrial activities, businesses and education activities. This pandemic also had a great impact on energy and environment research, which is a vital component in the transition to sustainable development. In response to this pandemic, Qatar had to stop all kinds of on-site education activities and shifted to virtual learning techniques (or distance learning). Using distant learning has a potential impact on the quality of education and research activities, especially energy and environment research. So, to assess the effectiveness of virtual learning in this pandemic time in Qatar, a structured survey is conducted for university students and staff to assess their perception about distant learning. The survey revealed that virtual learning overall had a positive impact, but it can affect the quality and the progress of education in the country.   Keywords Covid-19  Distance learning  Education  Sustainability  Sustainable development  Resiliency    1 Introduction Virtual learning plays a critical role in advancing energy and environment research and education and given the impact of this pandemic on the global energy ecosystem, the importance of virtual learning is further emphasized. In the post-Covid-19 world and in alignment with the global orientation towards sustainability, it is essential that we explore the synergy between distant learning models and sustainable development. This synergy is often referred to as Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). According to the author of “Issues and Trends in Education” for Sustainable Development it is stated that: “Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is commonly understood as education that encourages changes in knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to enable a more sustainable and just society for all. ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet their needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development” [1] . The book published by the UNESCO emphasized the flexibility the ESD quality of education in terms of cultural diversity and environment. Furthermore, in link to the environment, the same source also states that: “The concept of ESD was born from the need for education to address the growing environmental challenges facing the planet” [1] . There is an increasing evidence that suggests the current Covid-19 pandemic has so far led to a healthier climate change. Indeed, with people working and studying remotely from home, there is less usage of transportation and therefore less consumption of oil. This has in return resulted in a clear decline in oil production and usage, and eventually in the fall in oil price as well. Major factories causing climate change have also stopped working for a while, and a new economic recession was declared [2] . Globally, Qatar has been among the pioneers in commitment to the UN sustainable development agendas, signing several agreements in sustainable development, education, and climate change [3] . Furthermore, Qatar is expanding its research capacity to address its most pressing challenges such as freshwater scarcity, utilization of sustainable energy, environmental impacts of desalination, sustainable urban environments and sustainable sports [4–7] . In addition, since the blockade on Qatar in 2017, the country has extensively developed its capacity and resilience in several sectors; including education and research. To define resilience even better, it is said that: ‘Approaches to learning for resilience start at where the individual or community is and build capability and positive outlook — avoiding the doom and gloom scenarios often associated with climate change and risk management initiative’ [8] . The authors of “An Interdisciplinary Approach for Disaster Resilience and Sustainability” noted the following regarding resilience in education: “In order to achieve the enhancing resilience in all scales of stakeholder in society such as individuals, groups or institution under the same regional and international direction framework” [9] . Locally, Qatar has formed the Supreme Committee for Crisis Management led by the spokesperson Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohamed Al Khater. In an attempt to enhance its sustainable development under the current health circumstances, Qatar has formed the Supreme Committee for Crisis Management led by the government spokesperson and Assistant to deputy foreign minister H.E. Lolwah bint Rashid bin Mohamed Al Khater and the Assistant Under-Secretary for Educational Affairs at the Ministry of Education and Higher Education Ms. Fawzia Al-Khater. In terms of enhancing capacity in academic institutes, Al Khater, announced that: “The Ministry is ready because necessary infrastructure is available. Since 2011, we have started electronic education which is operational in the schools and it was used by all students, teachers and parents in the previous, so they are familiar”. She also pointed out that the ministry noted that it has prepared educational content for these levels by producing daily lessons that will be approximately 10 min each, focusing on providing the student with the concepts and values of these lessons, which will be available on electronic links via the digital platforms provided by the ministry [10] . Qatar has taken actions to cope with ‘distance learning’ towards end of February which is when COVID-19 reached a critical stage, and public places got closed. Moreover, since the pandemic started, higher education institutes in Qatar have taken several measures to ensure the continuity of the educational process. For example, Omar Al Ansari, Vice President of Academic Affairs at Qatar University has noted: “Clear instructions which must be taken into consideration for the success of this educational system; by attend training workshops for distance education platforms held by Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning on regular basis; attending the lectures according to the academic schedule; providing the students with links to their lecture in advance; respect the privacy while using these interactive platforms and students will be informed that the lectures will be recorded and uploaded on the software being used” [11] . These efforts are also part of Qatar’s commitment to counter terrorism and achieve international security. In addition, Qatar has pledged to commit financial aid that amounts to $500 million (QAR 1.82 billion) in order to support various UN programs, including the establishment of four new UN offices in the capital Doha [12] . With a (GDP) worth of 201 billion US dollars in 2019 (marks 0.17 percent of the world economy), Qatar was able to bounce back very expensive challenges, as it happened back in 2017 when the blockade occurred. To date, the oil rich state is able to resist a costly air space blockade and has been able to resist food and medicine shortages by importing them from the Far East and Western countries due to its strong national wealth. For this reason, resilience comes hand in hand in terms of sustainability. Thus, learning can prevent ESD risks from occurring, and even if it occurred it will not be as severe, because a back-up plan was formed from one or more stakeholders. The same source also remarks that: Particularly, the characteristics of risk commonly occur in rapid onset evens (e.g., floods, cyclones and tsunamis) and flow onset events (e.g. climate change, poverty and health) resulting in high impacts, and it can be significantly reduced as it can strengthen and enhance the communities towards disaster resilience [9] . The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that distant learning methods can be a sustainable solution for ensuring the continuity of research and education activities at higher education institutes. However, the effectiveness of distant learning is yet to be investigated, especially when considering the perception of the end users; university lecturers and students. Hence, this study will explore virtual distance learning in Qatar, specifically in Qatar University through a structured survey about challenges and opportunities regarding the new digital platforms provided by the University.  2 Methodology Since surveys considered to be generally accurate and quick, it was the most convenient method chosen for this research. Most importantly, it allowed the authors to have a one-on-one feedback from targeted students. In this particular survey, perception of introducing new virtual learning tools (in particular participants satisfaction level) have been discussed and analyzed. This survey was conducted on a sample of 50 random participants from Qatar University (comprising students and staff), who are using learning tools such as WebEx and Blackboard Collaborate. For the following survey, SurveyMonkey® which is a reliable online business software, has been used for this research. The participants were contacted about the survey using social media platforms.  3 Results One of the most important questions in the survey was about the participant’s future recommendation of virtual distance learning. The results have shown that more than 70% students said yes, while 28% have said they will not likely to recommend virtual learning tools in the future as shown in Fig. 1 . Likewise, in terms of experience evaluation, the results have shown that the majority of participants (around 45%) believe that it was a ‘very good’ experience, whereas 29% said it was ‘excellent’ as indicated in Fig. 2 .   The third most critical question in the survey was the participants’ opinions on the degree of impact of distance learning in sustainable development education. The question was put to know the amount of knowledge that students have regarding Educational Sustainable Development (as a percentage rating score from 20% to 80%). The results have shown that 40% of students believe that it forms a total of 60% percent impact on sustainability in Fig. 3 . Drastically, 62% of students regarded the rating effect of both Distance Learning and ESD together as ‘Positive’ as shown in Fig. 4 .   Since Qatar University teaches courses in both Arabic and English, there was a broad sample of Arabic speaking and English-speaking participants from various nationalities. Almost 80% of the participants were Qataris and the remainder, 20% were non-Qataris. Also, around 40% of the participants were Masters students and 37% were Bachelor students. As a result, numbers have shown that the majority of the students are graduates forming 70% of the total number. Notably, 70% of the participants were pleased with their distance learning experience and recommended it for future use even when the pandemic is over. This demonstrates that the entire experience was convenient for the majority. Most importantly, questions regarding education and sustainability have been asked, to determine the knowledge of the participants regarding this matter. Thus, 63% of the students viewed that there is a positive effect regarding the relationship between distance learning in education and sustainable development. Table 1  summarize the results and findings.    4 Conclusion Because the pandemic scenario is relevantly new to Qatar, with the restrictions only starting in early February of this year, large collective data has not been compiled yet. Therefore, future follow-up for researchers would be beneficial to have more accurate data on a large-scale period of time. Reasonably speaking, the authors did not face any challenges forming this research and collecting data as it was all been done online. The participants were cooperative with their responses and have shown enthusiasm about the new style that education has taken. The survey questions given in this paper were selected from a larger set of questions, based on impact on education for sustainable development. The authors wanted to emphasize the level of awareness for students in regard to educational sustainable development all together. The results have demonstrated that overall, university students and staff are pleased with the country’s efforts in integrating virtual learning efficiently and successfully at higher education institutes. It is worthwhile mentioning that Qatar’s Higher Supreme Education Council has promised to provide less fortunate students with a computer and fully paid Internet access. That might be something difficult to achieve with other developing countries that have a larger population and poor economic conditions. It is clear that the education system’s resilience through this pandemic, can be enhanced and sustained using virtual learning tools. However, the quality of the educational system and its performance can be significantly affected, and as a result the progress towards sustainable development.
