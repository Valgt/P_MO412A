                  With the fast growth of the global economy, energy supply and demand have a strong impact on social, economic, and environmental aspects. As a consequence, this has pushed the decision-makers to formulate objectives, guiding economic policies toward sustainable goals. The process is known as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that have been proposed by the United Nations. This being said, the energy sector is a vital domain with a vast potential for improvments in terms of technologies and ligistalations. Solar energy is among the most efficient solutions proposed to reduce the economic and environmental footprints of energy. In this frame, the current paper aims to localize solar energy within SDGs and analyze the contribution of the solar energy towards the achievement of the SDGs. Moreover, the current work highlights the contributions of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park in the United Arab Emirates to achieving the SDGs. Indeed, the MBR Solar Park concept offers valuable insights of environmental impacts by deploying clean and affordable energy sources in place of conventional fossil fuel power plants that are still heavily used in the region. The MBR Solar Park operation has already mitigated 6.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and this number will likely rise when all phases are installed and operational. Moreover, it has been shown that MBR Solar Park achieve several SDGs such SDG 8: decent work and economic growth, SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15: life on land.

With the fast growth of the global economy, energy supply and demand have a strong impact on social, economic, and environmental aspects. As a consequence, this has pushed the decision-makers to formulate objectives, guiding economic policies toward sustainable goals. The process is known as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that have been proposed by the United Nations. This being said, the energy sector is a vital domain with a vast potential for improvments in terms of technologies and ligistalations. Solar energy is among the most efficient solutions proposed to reduce the economic and environmental footprints of energy. In this frame, the current paper aims to localize solar energy within SDGs and analyze the contribution of the solar energy towards the achievement of the SDGs. Moreover, the current work highlights the contributions of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park in the United Arab Emirates to achieving the SDGs. Indeed, the MBR Solar Park concept offers valuable insights of environmental impacts by deploying clean and affordable energy sources in place of conventional fossil fuel power plants that are still heavily used in the region. The MBR Solar Park operation has already mitigated 6.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and this number will likely rise when all phases are installed and operational. Moreover, it has been shown that MBR Solar Park achieve several SDGs such SDG 8: decent work and economic growth, SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15: life on land.   Keywords Sustainable development  Sustainable development goals SDGs  Solar energy  Renewable energy  Circular economy    1 Introduction Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are seventeen global goals developed by the United Nations General assembly to promote a sustainable future for all. The goals were established in 2015, and it is projected that their wide scale deployment will be accomplished by the year 2030 [1 ,2 ]. The Agenda 2030  initiative and accompanying UN Resolution have included this aim to ensure a better future for the entire globe. The SDGs, shown in Fig 1  , formulation allows the gaging of implementation and accomplishments towards Agenda 2030 . In relation to the SDGs, renewable energy development allows achieving energy security for transportation, environment, construction, economy, mechanical work, and industry [3] . Renewable energies generated from solar [4 ,5 ], wind [6 ,7 ], hydro [8] , tidal [9] , geothermal [10 ,11 ], and biomass [12]  help supply energy demand and facilitate the development of communities and protection of the environment on a global scale. Renewable energy has been hailed as a formidable solution to the energy crisis over the last decades [13 ,14 ] while avoiding adverse climate and nature-related consequences.According to IRENA's 21 reports, 2019 was a record-breaking year in terms of renewables' growth in terms of installed power capacity. These resources currently surpass plants operating on fossil and nuclear fuels in terms of initial and operation costs [15] . In many global locations, solar PV is the cheapest source of electricity generation, excluding Antarctica [16] . Unfortunately, legislative targets for a renewable share in the power mix, although essential, remain below expectations as technologies are growing at a significantly faster rate than laws regulating them. Nevertheless, promoting the development and utilization of renewable energy is now a common consensus, and countries are engaging to explore renewable energy potential [17 ,18 ], especially that Economic growth and energy demand are correlated [19] . This is clear by examining data of energy demand as a function of major economic events, such as the trends shown in Fig. 2  . The demand/supply patterns has stimulated the rapid development of renewable energy resources independently [21 ,22 ]. The transition also includes the usage of hydrogen, mainly for fuel cells powering small energy generators and portable devices. Nevertheless, sustainability is more complex than it might appear at first sight [23] . The retrofit of every energy system that is fossil fuel-based is almost impossible, especially that renewable resources generally have lower efficiency and price volatility compared to their conventional counterparts. But in terms of their decentralized nature, their proliferation allows a wider access to energy, especially to rural areas, which will consequently improve human wellbeing, productivity and quality of life. As poverty is reduced, health conditions are improved, and employment opportunities are enhanced while equity among citizens is promoted. Sustainable development is interlinked with economic activity that depends on environmentally friendly and socially beneficial energy [24–26] . The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, has shown a rapidly grown in energy consumption over the last decades [27–29] . The use of fossil fuels increased to meet the rising domestic energy demand [30] . A diversification strategy should be implemented in the region to use alternative sources, including renewable energy [31] . This transition toward a more sustainable energy future would reduce greenhouse emissions and reduce air pollution. UAE have committed to implement global climate change agreements and formulated ambitious plans for renewable energy at a national and emirate level. In this context, solar energy expansion is rapidly generating electricity and heat to meet the energy demand with a population of almost 10 million from 1 million in 1980 (fcsc.gov.ae). In 2015, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) moved its headquarters to Abu Dhabi. Similarly, in 2019 the one the world's largest single-site solar project was commissioned with its nominal power of 1.17 GW. With today's low cost of solar photovoltaics (PV) energy due to technological advancement and growth, the UAE can rely on PV energy to meet most of its future electricity needs without deploying more fossil fuel stations [32–34] . With the pursuit of that, UAE ambitions grew and launched Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park, at Seih Al Dahal in Dubai. 5 GW PV and CSP plant are worth around 50 billion AED, which corresponds to ($ 13.6 billion) that is overseen by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). The plant covers over 44 km2 , which makes it when commissioned in 2030 the largest single-site solar park in the world. Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for 250 MW solar PV is $2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and $7.3 cents per kWh for 700MW CSP plant [35–39] . Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park project will contribute to achieving SDGs in UAE, UAE Energy Strategy 2050, and UAE Policy in Renewable Resources. Fig. 3   provides an information summary (data from DEWA website; (www.dewa.gov.ae ). MBR Solar Park consist of several phases, 1s t phase has been in operation since 2013 with 13MW photovoltaic solar panels using CdTe thin-film modules. 2n d phase became operational in 2017 with 200MW. DEWA achieved a world record by obtaining the lowest price globally at $5.6 cents per kWh at the time of tender. 3rd phase is to develop 800 MW; DEWA has yet also achieved a world record for obtaining the lowest price of $2.99 cent per kWh. It is the first Middle East and North African project to use single-axis solar tracking. Also, it uses cleaning robots for panels to increase plant efficiency. Single-axis solar tracking increases the energy generation of PV system as it tilts the panels perpendicularly towards the sunlight rays. 4th phase of MBR was awarded for building 950 MW, the largest investment project globally that combines technologies such as CSP and photovoltaic solar power. 600 MW will be generated from a parabolic basin complex that consists of three units (200MW each), 100 MW from solar power tower (molten salt technology), and 250 MW from photovoltaic solar panels. Also, upon completion, the fourth phase will have the largest energy storage capacity in the world of 15 h. 5th phase capacity is 900 MW based on photovoltaic technology; it is planned to commission starting from Q2 of 2021. Thus, it supports DEWA's efforts in achieving the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to provide 75% of Dubai's total power output from clean energy by 2050. This work presents and discusses the significance of renewable energy proliferation in achieving sustainable development and sustainable development goals (SDGs). In particular, the contribution of solar energy, which is abundant in the sunbelt region of the Middle East, is explored towards achieving each of the 17 SDGs. Also, the role of solar energy in the circular economy is highlighted.  2 Solar energy Theoretically, the solar energy falling daily on Earth has the potential to adequately fulfill the energy demand of the entire planet [40 ,41 ]. The solar irradiance received from the solar rays can be utilized through different technologies such as solar thermal (concentrated and non-concentrated) [42 ,43 ] and photovoltaic (PV) approaches [44–47] . Each technology harvests sunlight rays and converts it into different end forms. For instance, photovoltaic convert photons into electrons to obtain electrical energy, while in solar thermal applications, the photons are absorbed, and their energy is converted into tangible heat. This heat is used to heat a working fluid that can directly be collected and used for space and water heating [48–50] . Among one of the highest solar optical efficiency obtained was 86.2% using nanofluids [51] . Moreover, the PV panel efficiency is generally around 15–20% [40 ,51 ,52 ]. Hence, solar energy is considered as a key driver for reducing global emissions and balancing environmental, social and economic aspects. The adoption of solar energy will enhance energy security and mitigate climate change [53 ,54 ]. 2.1 Solar energy impact Several facets are associated with solar energy utilization, starting with the manufacturing of energy conversion devices, their deployment, and their eventual disposal/recycling. Environmental impacts from PV manufacturing are numerous. To manufacture a conventional silicon PV module, energy-intensive processes involving hazardous chemicals are present during normal operation [55] . Also, at the end of a productive lifespan of a PV module, recycling has proven to be complicated due to the complexity and intertwining of different materials and the high value associated with the recycling of silicon and all valuable elements. On the other hand, social and economic impacts are usually not addressed in literature since solar technology is relatively young, and its life cycle of 25 years is considered long. A reflective glance is needed to isolate the main drivers for future markets of solar energy devices, and Fig. 4   introduces the main social and economic impacts that are correlated, split into positive and negative factors [56–66] . The goal is to arrive at a sustained marketplace presence with maximum technological innovation to raise the device efficiency, reduce manufacturing costs and improve the ecological impact. This will allow a positive shift in the diversification of capital flow from financial institutions and sponsors. The following sections highlight the expected impacts from environmental, social, and economic perspectives to assess the integration of solar PV systems with the SDGs.  2.2 Environmental impact The PV manufacturing processes are usually energy-intense, with many special operating conditions and devices (temperature and pressure). Add to this the inevitable utilization of hazardous chemicals and gasses during the production of wafers and/or third-generation photovoltaics [54 ,67 ]. One can also count the auxiliary devices appended to any PV installation, such as Li-ion battery banks that have environmental issues. The solar industry is facing strong competition compared to all fossil fuel generation. Several barriers could prevent solar energy from reaching its full potential. One of the main barriers to the massive use of solar technology is solar cell efficiency. Researchers are increasingly working to overcome the theoretical efficiency limits of silicon-based solar cells [68 ,69 ]. The current efficiency record of c-Si solar cells is 26.7%; however, the thermodynamic efficiency limit is calculated to be around 33% [70] . Similarly, the current efficiency record of copper zinc tin sulfide and zinc phosphide (CIGS) cells is 23.4% [70] . Tawalbeh, Al-Othman, Kafiah, Abdelsalam, Almomani and Alkasrawi [67]  reported that the carbon footprint emissions from PV systems to be in range of 14–73 g CO2 -eq/kWh. Thus, all of these studies are cradle to gate, where the assessment is partial to the factory gate. However, the carbon emissions presented are much lower when compared to the emissions of fossil fuel plants.  2.3 Social impact The lack of access to electricity can impose limits to various prospects of growth and restrain satisfactory quality of life for people. Providing solar in all areas especially rural areas, is necessary and crucial. This alternative electricity source can satisfy the demand. Solar energy can provide electricity at a low cost without deforming the environment [71] . On the other hand, solar energy possesses a social impact, where people receive better entertainment watching TV or tuning in the ratio, therefore a better reach for information. Improve the lighting facilities that they can easily move anywhere they need to go. The security also increased as they see clearly during the nighttime. Thus, this integration led to a positive impact socially [72 ,73 ].  2.4 Economic impact The lack of sufficient energy constrains economic growth and development, thus, clean and economically efficient renewable energy critically link to sustainable development and growth. Access to affordable energy results in sustainable development and improvement in rural areas [74 ,75 ]. Moreover, energy availability fosters economic activities such as employment opportunities and meeting lower utility bills [76–78] . Over the years, per capita electricity consumption of solar PV plant has dramatically decreased, the procurement could average USD 0.039/kWh for projects in 2021 is a 42% reduction to prices in 2019. Correspondingly, the cost is one-fifth lower than fossil fuel plants. In United Arab Emirates, Chile, Ethiopia and Mexico confirm that cost can be low as USD 0.03/kWh [79] .   3 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focuses on the interactions between nature and humans. Generally, the goals are designed to facilitate the development of the economy, ecosystem, and social life [80] . It is a huge responsibility of all the stakeholders to show strong commitment and monitor the progress of business towards the seventeen sustainable development goals to fulfill the aim of a better community and world. All the seventeen goals that are presented by the United Nations are mutually and dependently reinforcing the three sectors of development mentioned above. Analyzing business operations and progress based on SDGs enables the executive and managers to evaluate business performance in achieving a sustainable future. This helps to categorize whether the process and operations are of weak sustainability or strong sustainability. According to Zanten and Tulder [81] , the evaluation of sustainability depends on the influence of operations on nature, human-made capital, and humanity. It has been analysed that various tools exist to evaluate and track the progress towards achieving the SDGs to achieve the related data more efficiently and in an understandable form. For instance, the SDG-Tracker which was launched on June 28th, 2018, gives the most recent data and SDG development across all the indicators. In essence, SDGs pay close attention to the multiple issues related to gender equity, learning, culture, and many more across the globe. 3.1 Importance of renewable energy to achieve SDGs Renewable energy provides the opportunity to increase the access to modern energy facilities for the poor community that is essential for the development of every SDGs that aims to reduce child labor, disease and inequality, hunger, poverty and develops a sustainable environment [82 ,83 ]. The progress and exact contribution of renewable energy to achieve SDGs are to be evaluated and monitored by the country and will lead to economic and social development. According to studies, renewable energy provides energy access and makes energy affordable and reliable to every household and industry. In relation to the SDG goals, renewable energy offers long-term and durable energy security through appropriate investments in energy supply concerning environmental needs and economic growths. According to studies, the usage of renewable technologies can fuel the newer economic activity, create jobs for people, modify the stranded assets and provides a cleaner and better environment for all [84] . Renewable energy reduces the severity of climate change and the health and environmental impacts of the changing climate [85–87] . According to the literature, the mitigation of dangerous climate change is realised to be a strong influencer behind the increasing use of renewable energy [2 ,85 ,88 ]. In order to fulfill the goals of sustainable development, many countries, specifically EU countries, are seen to focus on the development of employment opportunities and economic change by supporting the promotion of renewable energy [89 ,90 ]. However, it is desirable to determine the associated cost with the construction and maintenance of renewable sites to meet the increasing need for energy. It has been observed that the expansion and development of renewable energy result in improved energy access among the communities of developing countries. Under favourable climate conditions, renewable sites and plants can provide affordable and easy energy access to a large number of populations which reflects the accomplishment towards SDGs [91 ,92 ]. In particular, the renewable energy site provides sufficient energy at an affordable price to all the poor rural areas of the world. Moreover, the modernization of energy services is facilitated by using non-electrical renewable energy technologies. For instance, renewable solar energy helps in water heating and drying of crops. Besides this, the transportation sectors are facilitated by the use of biofuels [93] , whereas, the process of cooling, heating, cooking, lighting, and water pumping is facilitated by modern biomass and biogas [94–96] . Also, the development of renewable energy makes the businesses to prepare and save their own energy at the site and allows them to transfer the access energy to the surrounding areas, thus making them gain more money. This scenario has reduced the dependence of business and organisations on a limited number of suppliers, therefore reduces the price and economic instability.  3.2 Solar energy role in each SDGs There are several environmental and sustainability concerns that are needed to be addressed when talking about energy generation. Previous energy generation is limited to gas sectors and fossil fuels. The intensive and rapid use of these technologies has significantly affected the global environment leading to massive emission of carbon and other hazardous gasses that ultimately leads to global warming [97] . The areas where the activities are in progress experience a low quality of life due to environmental damages. Sometimes the fuel that is produced by these fossil fuels are relatively high in price and fails to meet the requirements of manufacturing clean and affordable energy for the communities. Solar energy helps in achieving the requirement that will ultimately lead to sustainable development. One of the major contributions of solar energy is the production of clean and affordable energy, creates economic growth and improves grid security [98 ,99 ]. Studies show that solar energy is the world's leading and faster-growing renewable energy source due to its low price and environment-friendly nature. The technology is somehow new as compared to the traditional renewable resources and is seeming to have a bright future ahead. The rapid growth of solar energy is related to the significant drop in its costs. Looking at the reduced cost, solar energy is predicted to be cheaper, and the installation cost will also become much cheaper than ever before [100] . Looking at the price benefits, more developing countries are found to be investing in solar energy as compared to the developed countries. Studies show that solar power has produced much cheaper energy than coal, oil, and gas other than solar [101] . Moreover, due to the absence of infrastructure facilities for aiding traditional energy resources, solar power is becoming more popular in developing countries. Due to the affordable price and clean manufacturing process, solar energy is being utilized and manufactured by most developing countries to meet the current energy demand. Besides the cost benefits, solar energy is linked to fulfilling many other SDG goals. There are many social and economic benefits when society gains access to such affordable and clean energy. In light of Creutzig, Agoston, Goldschmidt, Luderer, Nemet and Pietzcker [102] , the major contribution of solar energy is in the reduction of climate change effects. It has substantially reduced the issues related to extreme weather events like droughts, fires, or storms, and cyclones. Besides this, rising sea level is another major issue that has been catered by solar energy and makes the world to achieve sustainable development goals. In comparison with fossil fuels, solar energy contributes to saving the environment and it directly results in the high land, air, and water quality. Therefore, investments in solar energy fulfill the energy goals and protect the environment as it lowers greenhouse gas emissions without having negative impacts on the growth of the country. Besides the reduction of carbon footprint, solar energy benefit in achieving economic growth. The provision of new employment opportunities in the solar sector marks a huge positive impact on the growth of the world economy [28 ,103 ,104 ]. The jobs that are related to solar energy is much safer than other renewable sites. For instance, the rise of job opportunities in solar-powered micro-enterprises among developing countries is vital in reducing poverty which is the first goal of sustainable development. In sum, the role of solar energy is very significant in achieving the below seventeen sustainable goals for a better plant and community. The contribution of solar energy to the three pillars of sustainable development [54 ,105-109 ] is summarized in Fig. 5  . There is a high relevance of solar for the SDGs, solar energy provides environmental, social and economic benefits that can accelerate our trajectory toward SDGs. Solar energy contributes to the reduction of poverty, and access to affordable and reliable electricity [110] . In addition to lowering the carbon footprint and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions which secures society from infections and diseases, solar energy fulfills the basic needs of education, health, and access to clean water and sanitation [111] . On the other hand, solar industry provides employment opportunities, reduces hunger, and improves access to food and shelter [112] . Increasing employment opportunities creates an equitable human civilization, which reduces the corruption rate and uplifts the community [113] . Also, solar energy provides equal opportunity for all males and females, thus promoting gender equality among the population, especially in rural areas [114] . In comparison with fossil fuel, solar energy uses a smaller amount of water during the production and cleaning process of PV panels [115 ,116 ], giving it dominance over other energy sources. Investment in infrastructures and innovation is essential to run the economy and develop clean and affordable energy resources [117] . Moreover, investing in renewable energy projects such as solar power plants will eradicate forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in developing countries [118] . The reduction in air pollution by solar panels results in the protection of plants and animals and reduces forests' degradation [119] . This decreases the climate crisis most cleanly and enhances natural beauty by developing a sustainable and clean environment. Clean energy generation minimizes the severity or rate of health problems and also reduces the chances of unprecedented or unexpected health issues or threats [120] . Renewable Energy benefits are beyond the conventional measurement of economic performance; thus, it positively impacts global welfare. Moreover, solar PV also promotes circular economy-based policy and regulation. The circular economy is a new concept of sustainable development and an instrument of environmental protection. As a result, governments, policymakers, engineers, and scientists are urged to look for ways to use circular economy systems, such as better eco-designs, waste prevention, and material reuse and recycling, while lowering waste and emissions. Models of the circular economy can reduce industrial waste, pollution, and energy leakages, consequently adding value to both the business and the natural environment. Table 1   shows the relation between circular economy with solar PV systems in relation to the SDGs. However, research on circular business models is in its early stages, and the business literature pay little attention to the challenges associated with circular economy implementation. Life cycle assessment and waste reduction can help to establish a circular economy for solar PV. To have a significant renewable energy source, a well-trained workforce that is competent in addressing solar PV-related technological difficulties is essential and proper production, installation, maintenance, and disposal should be present.  3.3 United Arab Emirates (UAE) SDGs status Sustainability is the most challenging issue in 21st century [139 ,140 ]. Around the world SDGs were proposed as a follow up of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to serve the same objective in a more comprehensive manner [139 ,141 ,142 ]. The goal targeted is to focus on developing and developed countries in parallel for achieving sustainable development. UAE has made enormous progress on sustainability. Ministry of International Cooperation and Development has established strategic indicators to support UAE in the MDGs [143 ,144 ]. UAE has one of the highest increases in the world population due to immigration thus there is a very rapid development in cities. Therefore, UAE strives to increase the quality of life by applying SDGs. UAE authorities strive to protect the environment and increase the quality in life for the citizens. As an example, Estidama in Abu Dhabi provides the highest green standards in the design, construction, and building management. Also, it is one of the first programs for sustainable development in the Middle East [145] . Dubai has established several of areas to increase UAE's potential in different fields such as IT, sustainable cities, and renewable power stations. Dubai also implemented new projects on artificial intelligence, robotics, and IoT sensors and created the future city. In the light of this, one of the most important projects that support infrastructure and sustainability is Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park that has been announced in January 2012. This venture is the largest solar project globally, with a total capacity of 5000 megawatts (MW). Thus, MBR Solar Park strongly extends its contribution to sustainable development, making Dubai a model for all GCC countries [146] . As shown in Fig. 6   and according to Bertelsmann-Stiftung (BS) index, the UAE index score is 70.3, with a regional average score of 66.3. UAE. It is impressive what UAE developed over the years [147] . UAE is still working on SDGs with full efforts and included this in a national development plan. The adoption of the sustainability concept integrates all social, economic, and environmental factors in sustainability in UAE [148] .   4 Case study Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park During 2000, United Nations defined eight international development goals, named them the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and targeted them by assigning different targets. Several works addressed unfinished agenda and strengthening sustainable development and partnership [149 ,150 ]. Firstly, the MDGs generated an innovative collaboration and set ambitious goals by putting people and their needs first. MDGs helped in different fields, such as lifting people out of poverty, enabling girls to attend school and have greater ambitions, and protecting our planet. However, progress has been uneven, where poverty remained overwhelmingly intensive in certain locations and achieving equality remains undone [151 ,152 ]. To set a new development agenda, different organizations, scientists, and citizens came together to put a new development agenda to fit all criteria worldwide. Subsequently, SDGs were created in 2015 with 17 goals and 169 targets. These targets were generated, and each government enrolled in the UN will set its own national targets considering the national circumstances. The SDGs are looked as an extension of MDGs yet with additional challenges targeting strengthening sustainability [85 ,153-155 ]. According to Eurostat [156] , the overall share of renewable energy in final energy consumption in the EU is presently 16% twice that of 2004. Also, EU has improved its energy productivity by 26.2% since 2000. In this context, United Arab Emirates (UAE) adopted a whole government approach that necessitates the initiation of a National Committee on SDGs to broaden the ownership of the 2030 Agenda. UAE races to achieve the goals nationally. Similarly, the UAE's policy focuses on implementing development programs that assist in the achievement of various SDGs. In parallel, UAE has launched in 2017 ‘Energy Strategy 2050′ to fulfill energy demand in UAE and increase the contribution of clean energy in the total energy mix from 25% to 50% by 2050 and reduce carbon footprints of power generation by 70% [229 ]. Being part of the "sun belt", it is clear from Fig. 7   that UAE has a high potential for solar applications in general, and PV technologies in particular [158 ]. The figure indicates an extraterrestrial solar radiation on a horizontal surface of 9.22 kWh/m2  and sunshine hour on daily average is 12.00 [157] . With the exponential advances in solar PV systems, there is a vast increase in the demand of implementing photovoltaic technology around the world. Moreover, solar energy technology is essential to ensure future energy demand is secured. With fossil fuel resources being nearly exhaustible, solar energy can stabilize energy prices and provide many economic, social, and environmental benefits [159] . There are numerous social, economic, and environmental impacts of this prestigious project. Due to the size of this Giga project, DEWA divided construction into several phases, as shown in Table 2  . Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park is a mega project, and therefore the UAE government is aiming to accelerate the movement toward the SDGs. Table 3   shows the practicable contribution of the MBR Solar Park toward the achievement of the SDGs. Fig. 8   shows the contribution of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park into sustainable development; the data were obtained from DEWA website (www.dewa.gov.ae ). MBR solar park is targeting to reduce about 1.6 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually and power 320,000 residences. MBR solar park is situated around 50 kms south of Dubai city. Dubai's Population in 2020 is 3.38 million which is almost 34% of the UAE population, according to the official Dubai Government website [189] . Dubai is the second largest emirate with an area of 4114 km2  that corresponds to 5% of UAE (82,880 km2 ) without the islands [190] . In this context, implementing a renewable energy project enhances the development and growth of Dubai and UAE. Renewable energy contributes to sustainable development through the improvement of social aspects. The solar plant can dramatically improve the lifestyles of rural people all over the world, and this technology has made the lives of rural people far more active and more accessible than ever before [191 ,192 ]. The availability of electricity improves living standards and creates a new way of thinking and gaining entertainment. An additional benefit is the creation of numerous numbers of permanent jobs for the plant during the construction and operation phases. The short-term work and income can be a social problem as it influences on the individual and the entire community. This can lead to resettlement to another city or area. However, rapid migration and settlement of workers in the project area may have adverse impact on community health and road safety. The immense land use of 44 km2  has no impacts as the land is allocated far away from the city and land was not used. The overhead transmission lines have no impact in bare desert lands. Under these conditions solar radiation is the last obstacle that can stand against the complete shift to solar energy for countries like UAE and other countries in the GCC [193] . According to [33] , during March 2017 an educated workforce of more than 900 workers guided by managers and engineers of international standings and certifications are sufficient to fully construct a utility scale PV plant capable of generating a tremendous amount of electricity to houses and schools. The project requires additional plots to accommodate workers and build facilities. Electricity supply will not be a problem since the load and energy storage systems are present. Waste can be easily managed as the volume would be low; a private company can benefit from waste collection services. With social acceptance of renewable energy projects, many successful energy projects will be implemented in a large scale and increase the renewable energy capacity. It should be noted that solar systems have an impact on welfare which is associated with employment, health and education expenditures, and the cost of health impact from local air pollutions. By avoiding GHG emissions the economic and social dimensions will continue to grow with more efficient sustainable economy and investments will be counted as future consumptions. This enormous project is implemented by Dubai's Supreme Council of Energy in Dubai and operated by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). Tracing the whole national economic structure, we can analyze the economic activity and employment impact induced by an increase in the demand for the solar sector. However, several years back in UAE, solar sector was infirm and new. Today there are palenty consultant companies and contractors that are approved from DEWA for solar PV installations. Therefore, the employment increased result to the development and operations of solar energy power plants projects. Similarly, manufacturing solar PV panels helped the employment to several professionals in different sectors. Policies also are needed in order to make sure renewable technologies are competitive in the energy market [194–197] . Other related studies examined the economic impact of solar PV plant in countries like Turkey and Morocco [198–203] . In Turkey, when implementing solar PV and CSP, the potential is for 179,600 – 222,000 jobs to be created by 2020. In Morocco, the simulated economic impact on Growth Domestic Product (GDP) is found to be 1.21–1.99% by 2040 and employment potential is 269,252 – 499,000. Solar energy has a wide range of objectives which include economic development. Economic benefits include overall health costs that plays a direct role with the reduction of air pollutant emissions. The benefits are not necessarily limited to health costs, in addition new job offers are proposed and part of the expenses of jobs is deviated elsewhere in the economy. Adopting solar technology through government allows small businesses to invest in renewable energy projects and this is a powerful tool for socioeconomic development and local wealth increase. The technological development could enhance the efficiency of solar power transition, which could directly influence the economic feasibility of solar power plant generation. As a result, more plants would be feasible and implemented to fit the society's needs. In addition, governmental policies can enhance the implementation of renewable projects and generation operations. There is a considerable number of studies that focused on the economic feasibility of solar power PV generation. Land-use factors and other factors play a vital role in solar to the electric conversion efficiency of PV modules and must be considered to map the solar potential [204 ,205 ] considered. The economic potential is also represented by the cost of electricity and the smaller the cost, the greater the economic potential [206] . The benefit of renewable energy is beyond the traditional measurement of economic performance. Solar PV also promotes circular economy-based policy and regulation. Correspondingly, reusing and recycling end-of-life components have enormous benefits that include the environment and the economy [207] . A circular economy for solar PV can be achieved by life cycle assessment and material substitution. When energy is owned and generated locally, the economic benefits harness strong political security and relative energy independence. Therefore, the government in developing countries should promote solar PV installations through incentives to support the economy due to its long term environmental and economic benefits. Solar PV also creates high technology occupations within the solar PV industry. In order to have a major renewable energy source, well trained workforce should be present with competent in handling solar PV related industrial issues ranging from fabrication, installation, maintenance, and disposal. Solar energy has clear advantages over any other energy resource. It will not deplete as a natural resource, produce carbon dioxide emissions, or generate any liquid or gas waste absorbed by the atmosphere. PV energy generated is clean, silent, abundant, renewable, and inherently safer than any other traditional fossil fuel-based generation system. Greenhouse gas emissions are negligible during the PV system operations [56 ,208-213 ]. Whereas, during the fabrication of PV panels, chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid are used, along with electricity and water. Thus, the production of PV panels emits greenhouse gasses. Environmental impacts of merging solar PV and CSP systems [214]  with the most effective techniques, policies pertaining to the implementation. PV modules' transportation, installation, and disposal processes emit greenhouse gasses, making them not fully clean. However, compared to any other energy source, PV is environmentally friendly to a great extent. The increase of PV installations creates a massive amount of new waste. Indeed, if recycling is performed, it adds environmental benefits and supports market growth of solar energy. The amount of waste may account for approximately 8 million tons per year by 2030 [215 ,216 ]. Moreover, if PV panels' end of life (EoL) is managed properly, rare materials such as ruthenium, gallium, indium, and tellurium can be utilized. Thus, there is a critical need to address this issue and connect the impact associated with PV systems at the end of their life cycle [217 ,218 ]. Circular economy approach emphasizes on product, component, material reuse, remanufacturing, energy utilization through product value chain and specifically cradle to cradle life cycle [219 ,220 ]. Unlike the current linear model, where the economy system is unsustainable following the extract-produce-use-dump material and energy flow model, circular economy circulates the production. It provides the economic system alternative route [221] . Rabaia, Abdelkareem, Sayed, Elsaid, Chae, Wilberforce and Olabi [54]  reviewed the environmental impacts associated with solar energy systems. As the global population is exponentially srising, the energy generation demand will continuously increase proportionally. Thus a secure, environmentally friendly resource is needed. A solar PV system usually includes arrays and strings of PV panels, a charge controller (DC to DC), an inverter (DC to AC), a power meter, a breaker, and a battery in case of off-grid system [222 ,223 ]. Several obvious environmental advantages for solar energy over other energy resources since solar energy will not be depleted as a natural resource [224] . These advantages include reduction of the emissions of greenhouse gasses (mainly CO2 , NOx ) and prevention of toxic gas emissions (SO2 ), reduction in transmission lines of electricity grids, improvement in quality of life, increase national energy independence, an increase of work opportunities, and provide support and security to energy market [225] . The adoption of solar energy will harness various social, environmental, and economic positive impacts [226] . The total environmental impact on climate change, matter formation, marine ecotoxicity, and fossil depletion categories will be reduced. Climate change will inflate different challenges, such as health problems, biodiversity loss, and other environmental challenges. Renewable energy deployment should be integrated in government strategies around the world to address these challenges [227 ,228 ]. For example, solar energy would reduce the pollution and improve public health. Governments at all levels have set policies to support renewables in order to decrease health impacts associated with energy production and usage.  Conclusion In this paper, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been proposed as a motivational guideline for projects and policies in the energy sector to achieve their sustainable goals. Solar energy clearly supports such technoeconomic movement towards the achievement of the SDGs. Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MBR) Solar Park is a great example of ambitious solar projects to materialize sustainable goals. Its major contribution toward the SDGs can be summarized as follows:- The mitigation of 6.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, thus realizing SDG 15: Life on Land.  - By 2030, the combined power plant capacity is estimated to be 5000 MW, and hence contributing to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.  - Provide alevelized cost of electricity as low as 2.4 US cents per kWh, which contributes to SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.  - Providing power to the equivalent of 320,000 houses, thus verifying SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, and SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.    MBR Solar Park is currently the most significant project in the region, allowing various solar energy technologies to be tested and deployed. State-of-the-art technologies such as solar thermal, concentrating solar plants, solar photovoltaic, and central solar concentrators are being installed, tested and commissioned on small and large scales alike. The future potential of MBR Solar Park is growing hand in hand with the 2050 vision of Dubai having 75% of energy generated from renewable resources.
