                  Access to safe drinking water is one of the most vital targets of sustainable development goal (6.1). However, climate change has become a significant challenge to safe water access. Climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns create many hydro-meteorological hazards such as drought, floods, and desertification. These hazards pose a major risk to the water supply system, particularly in areas vulnerable to climate change's impacts. The onset of these hazards may damage the hydro-ecological system and water supply infrastructure, cause an interruption in water supply, and pollute water resources. Therefore, assessing access to safe potable water after the onset of any hazard is crucial to ensure sustainable management. For this purpose, the current investigation aims to assess access to safe, potable water in flood-affected neighborhood councils of district Nowshera. The sample sites were purposively selected based on specific criteria, and 2 % (564) of households were surveyed using the Kobo collect tool. The six parameters, accessibility, availability, affordability, acceptability, water quality, and equity, were assessed for access to safe potable water using WHO and UNICEF standard procedures. The estimated results classified the study area access into safely managed (49.5 % to 51.77 %), primary (17.59 % to 47.92 %), limited (3 % to 94.67 %), unimproved (1.82 % to 41.46 %) water facilities. The current results provide the status of access to safe potable water and visualize the deprived households for priority action. This study indicates that recent flooding has significantly affected access to safe potable water. The methods and techniques utilized in current research can be used to monitor sustainable development goals. The present study highlights the need for a climate change perspective in addressing access to clean water in flood-prone areas. It identifies key factors for future research and policy action.

Access to safe drinking water is one of the most vital targets of sustainable development goal (6.1). However, climate change has become a significant challenge to safe water access. Climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns create many hydro-meteorological hazards such as drought, floods, and desertification. These hazards pose a major risk to the water supply system, particularly in areas vulnerable to climate change's impacts. The onset of these hazards may damage the hydro-ecological system and water supply infrastructure, cause an interruption in water supply, and pollute water resources. Therefore, assessing access to safe potable water after the onset of any hazard is crucial to ensure sustainable management. For this purpose, the current investigation aims to assess access to safe, potable water in flood-affected neighborhood councils of district Nowshera. The sample sites were purposively selected based on specific criteria, and 2 % (564) of households were surveyed using the Kobo collect tool. The six parameters, accessibility, availability, affordability, acceptability, water quality, and equity, were assessed for access to safe potable water using WHO and UNICEF standard procedures. The estimated results classified the study area access into safely managed (49.5 % to 51.77 %), primary (17.59 % to 47.92 %), limited (3 % to 94.67 %), unimproved (1.82 % to 41.46 %) water facilities. The current results provide the status of access to safe potable water and visualize the deprived households for priority action. This study indicates that recent flooding has significantly affected access to safe potable water. The methods and techniques utilized in current research can be used to monitor sustainable development goals. The present study highlights the need for a climate change perspective in addressing access to clean water in flood-prone areas. It identifies key factors for future research and policy action.   Keywords Climate change  Flood  SDG 6.1  Sustainable development  Pakistan    1 Introduction Freshwater, a vital natural resource essential for all living organisms' survival and well-being, is deteriorating globally due to the rapid expansion of urban areas, fast industrialization, and excessive groundwater use. Therefore, it is crucial to implement effective and sustainable water resource management strategies, particularly at the watershed level (Jain et al., 2020 ; Selvam et al., 2015 ; Tiwari et al., 2018 ). The rapid pace of human development and the inherent conflicts between society, the economy, and the environment have posed significant obstacles to successfully implementing sustainable development strategies (Sikka et al., 2021 ; Xie et al., 2021 ). Water scarcity has become gradually critical, worsened by factors such as population growth and the impact of climate change, particularly in semi-arid and arid areas with fluctuating precipitation patterns (Matomela et al., 2020 ). Predictions suggest that by 2025, an alarming 1.8 billion people worldwide will inhabit regions experiencing severe water scarcity (Li et al., 2023 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). According to the fifth report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), about 80 % of the world's population faces water scarcity issues (Elhassnaoui et al., 2021 ). The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2019) states that the fundamental water requirement per person is around 50 liters daily. Any deviations from this basic need, whether in developed or developing nations, typically stem from challenges related to water accessibility, availability, and quality. The quality and quantity of drinking water can trigger conflicts and unrest, especially in vulnerable regions grappling with water scarcity (Boretti and Rosa, 2019 ). Hence, it is imperative to emphasize regular monitoring and the sustainable management of water resources. Adopting intelligent and integrated urban and rural planning practices is also required a top priority. These measures are vital for safeguarding human well-being and promoting peace and political stability, particularly in regions facing water-related challenges (Nagabhatla and Brahmbhatt, 2020). The climate change perspective raised additional flood concerns, as these events significantly affect the population, environment, and infrastructure (Jain et al., 2020 ). Floods occur globally, but their effects are more severe in developing countries(Hussain et al., 2021 ). Floods adversely affected the inhabitants in flood-vulnerable areas (Khanday and Sujatha, 2022 ). Besides damaging properties and crops, it also disrupts the water supply system(Shokouhifar et al., 2022 ). However, water and sanitation are essential for environmental sustainability(Wang et al., 2020 ). Flood disasters impact water supply infrastructure and pollute water sources, causing interruptions in access to clean potable water(Aydin and Sevgi Birincioğlu, 2022 ). The damage to water infrastructure may interrupt water supply and impact water quality of surface and groundwater resources(Jain et al., 2020 ). Freshwater supply systems and water treatment plants are highly susceptible to flooding as these directly rely on electricity, mechanical devices, and electronic machines (Salehi, 2022 ). The vulnerability of the water supply system to flood depends on the location of water schemes in low-lying areas close to rivers. In times of crisis, the water supply infrastructure must be resilient enough to ensure a sustainable and reliable water supply for consumers and essential users (Jain et al., 2020 ; Zhu et al., 2022 ). The perception of sustainability within the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has recently become closely intertwined with the management of water and wastewater (Kanchanamala Delanka-Pedige et al., 2021 ). Aligning with the principal goals of sustainable development, as marked by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is imperative for these sustainable strategies (Saqr et al., 2021 ; Velis et al., 2017 ), underscore the importance of ensuring that these approaches not only address current water needs but also safeguard the requirements of future generations, all while working toward achieving the targets outlined in the United Nations’17 SDGs and their associated objectives (Asif et al., 2023a, 2023b; Du et al., 2024) . The United Nations’ Agenda 2030, which comprises seventeen goals and their corresponding 169 targets, sets the stage for addressing various global challenges (Huang et al., 2019b ; Tsalis et al., 2020 ). To ensure the effective implementation of this global agenda, the United Nations has called for systematic assessment and monitoring of progress towards SDGs. This monitoring aligns with a worldwide SDG indicator framework developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG indicators (Chen et al., 2020 ; Huang et al., 2019a ). In particular, SDG 6 targets, namely 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4, are dedicated to achieving equitable access to sufficient water resources, ensuring the sustainable withdrawal of clean and pure water to tackle water inadequacy issues, and ultimately reducing the number of individuals affected by water shortage (Mujtaba et al., 2024 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). These goals are directly linked to the sustainability of natural resources and carry profound implications for environmental, social, and economic well-being (Mehmood et al., 2023 ). To entirely realize the goal (6.1), it is crucial to sustainably manage all-natural water resources that supply clean water to downstream human populations. These natural and semi-natural water supply systems are crucial in flagging pollutants from water sources affected by human activities, ultimately providing safe and affordable drinking water (Mulligan et al., 2020 ). According to a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistan ranks third among nations grappling with severe water shortages (Chen et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). The Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) projected in May 2018 that the country is anticipated to face a scarcity of safe water by 2025. Presently, only 20 % of the population has access to safe drinking water, with the remaining 80 % relying on water sources contaminated by sewage, fertilizers, pesticides, and industrial and domestic effluents (Nabi et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2024 ). The deterioration of Pakistan's drinking water quality is swiftly progressing due to rapid population expansion and developmental activities. Human-induced factors contribute to approximately 80 % of all waterborne diseases and are responsible for 33 % of related fatalities (Mujtaba et al., 2024 ; Yin et al., 2023 ). The National Drinking Water Policy (2009) and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Drinking Water Policy (2016) aim to ensure access to clean and sustainable potable water for all inhabitants by 2025. However, the existing water supply system provides only 30 to 40 % of the population cannot fulfill the required community drinking water demand. Consequently, people only have access to private water sources to address the shortage (Saiqa Imran, 2018 ). Pakistan is one of the worst-affected countries by climate change, with extreme hydro-meteorological occurrences (Baqa et al., 2022; Hadipour et al., 2020 ). Since 1937, floods have devastated many areas in Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, including the district of Peshawar, Charsadda, and Nowshera ((Ait-Kadi, 2016; Khan et al., 2013; Akhter et al., 2023) . Nowshera district experienced major flood events in 2010 and 2022. These flood events have created many water related problems by damaging the water supply infrastructures and water filtration plants. The flooded water contaminated 98 % of drinking water sources in these regions (Zulfiqar et al., 2019 ). The local community members in study area rely on municipal water schemes, hand pumps, boreholes, and dug wells, which are directly or indirectly damaged and polluted by floods. The contamination of these water sources gives rise to water-related diseases such as malaria, cholera, dysentery, and skin problems, as highlighted by (Shah et al., 2022 ). Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the status of access to clean potable water and address the significant challenges in accessing safe potable water. This paper further identifies critical factors for ensuring access to safe potable water. Many research studies assessed and mapped access to safe potable water (Akhter et al., 2023 ). Assessed drinking water security in coastal areas of Bangladesh for the implication of sustainable development goal 6.1, similar research has been carried out by (Saqr et al., 2021 ) on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) associated with Groundwater over-exploitation vulnerability using GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis in Egypt. (Mujtaba et al., 2024 ) utilized a holistic approach to embrace the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-6) towards water security in Pakistan while (Arora and Mishra, 2022 ) conducted research on Sustainable development goal 6 for assessing Global water security. However, the current research work is unique, as it was carried out in flood-affected areas and utilized the Kobo collect tool for recording the primary data with Geographic coordinates. The current investigation attempts to investigate the access to safe potable water in flood-affected areas, aligning with the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 6.1.  2 Material and methods 2.1 Study area This research was undertaken in Nowshera District, situated within the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan, spanning from 33° 41` N to 34° 10` N latitude and 71° 39` E to 72° 16` E longitude (Fig. 1  ). Nowshera City serves as the region's capital and the district seat. The district's administrative division comprises three tehsils: Nowshera, Jehangira, and Pabbi. Among the 47 Union Councils in the district, Pabbi is the smallest in terms of area, while Nizampur is the largest. Notably, the 2010 flood impacted around 40 neighborhood councils (NC), whereas the 2022 flood affected 31. The district shares its boundaries with Kohat District to the south, Orakzai to the south west, Attock District to the east, Peshawar District to the west, Mardan District to the north, Charsadda District to the northwest and Swabi District to the northeast. Covering a total area of 1748 km², the district includes 52,540 hectares of agricultural land, with agriculture serving as the region's primary income source. According to the 2017 census, Nowshera District has a population of 1,518,540. In this region, inhabitants extract water through hand pumps, boreholes, and dug wells, primarily dependent on groundwater for their drinking water needs. The drinking water and sanitation systems in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) districts are under the supervision of the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) and the Local Government Rural Development Department (LGRDD). These departments administer various programs, each designed to fulfill specific population objectives, as outlined in the study by (Imran et al., 2018 ) (Fig. 1 ).  2.2 Access to safe drinking water evaluation Evaluation of SDG target 6.1 involves several key steps and procedures, as shown below.1) Conducting a cross-sectional household survey involving a questionnaire and visual inspection of water supply infrastructure.  2) Performing qualitative water sampling of community water sources and stored household water to detect microbial contamination indicators.  3) Focus group discussions with Neighborhood Council (NCs) leaders and community members.  4) Conducting an evaluation and inspection of municipal water schemes to assess functionality, maintenance, and sustainability.     2.3 Data collection Access to clean water evaluation depends on both primary and secondary data sources. Primary data was collected with the Kobo collect tool from household surveys and field observations, while secondary data was collected from government reports, population census, and local water supply agencies. The data regarding coverage and quality of water was taken from local water supplier such as the Public Health Engineering Department Nowshera, TMA, and the Worker Welfare Board Nowshera.  2.4 Data collection procedures 2.4.1 Field study sites Flood disasters have given rise to many challenges in District Nowshera, with one significant concern being the harm inflicted on water supply infrastructure and groundwater aquifers. To tackle this problem, sample sites were purposively chosen based on specific criteria. These criteria aimed to encompass a range of flood affected NCs where flooding directly impacts potable water supplies or indirectly deteriorates water quality through the seepage or percolation of flood water into aquifers. Significant parts of the study area were twice affected by the 2010 and 2022 floods. After these events, the people of sample NCs were not satisfied with the water quality. By the established criteria, 2 % samples of households from 11 Neighborhood Councils were examined to assess the accessibility to safe drinking water in the Nowshera district (Fig. 1 ). The details of the sample size and selected NCs information are shown in Table 1  .   2.5 Statistical analysis The data for the current research was collected through the Kobo Collect tool using an Android phone. The data was transferred from the Kobo tool server to an Excel sheet for statistical analysis. The data for each NC were assembled, and descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Further, the data was analyzed using GIS software in a GIS analyst tool. Vital demographic data and other frequency data of interest were visualized to monitor access to safe water.  2.6 Evaluation components 2.6.1 Household survey A random sample of 2 % households was selected from 11 neighborhood councils (NCs) and surveyed using Kobo collect tool, a digital platform designed for mobile data collection, adhering to the standard procedures outlined by UNICEF/WHO, joint monitoring program (JMP) for water, sanitation and hygiene assessment (Table 1 ). A team of 11 enumerators was engaged for data collection and assigned to conduct household surveys in their respective NCs. To ensure data quality and ethical standards, Basic training for these enumerators regarding core questions, data collection methods, and research ethics was arranged. This study employed a stratified sampling approach to select a diverse group of household members, comprising both male and female individuals, who were categorized into three distinct age cohorts: i) young adults (18 to 30 years), ii) middle-aged individuals (31 to 59) and iii) older adults (60 years and above). A structured questionnaire was utilized to collect data from participants across these age groups, thereby enabling an in-depth exploration of their experiences, perspectives, and opinions related to the research topic.  2.6.2 Household questionnaire The questionnaire for current research work was designed to incorporate all key indicators and achieve SDG target 6.1. A questionnaire comprised of 30 core questions was designed, out of which 18 core questions were assigned to evaluate access to clean water, 07 questions to resilience, and 05 to the impact of drinking water quality on human health. These questions have been designed based on JMP standard procedures. The household members were asked about the primary water source, accessibility, availability, affordability, and water quality (Supplementary File 1 ). They were also asked about the impacts of floods on potable water and its infrastructure. Open-ended questions were also included to let the respondents discuss current and future challenges and strategies.  2.6.3 Visual inspection of household water The interviewer visually inspected the household water supply facilities during the 1st week of August using WHO inspection form 27. Interviewers noted whether animals could contaminate the household water source, whether drinking water was stored in covered containers, and how it was dispensed from containers. They also estimated the distance from the home to the primary water source. The household members were asked about their satisfaction with water quality after the flood. The study participant was asked to give the interviewer a cup of water from the drinking water stored in the home to check the taste, odor, and color, where the participants were not satisfied with drinking water quality. The water samples from the distribution systems were analyzed in several homes in sample NCs. The PHED Nowshera helped to collect and analyze all water samples for bacterial contamination, coliform bacteria, and E. coli (Supplementary File 2) .  2.6.4 Community interview The municipal water committee members, NC chairmen, and community members were interviewed regarding access to safe potable water, significant challenges and problems, and their perception of climate change. The questionnaire was designed to include questions about water coverage, current and future water demand, and the impact of water quality on human health. They were also asked about significant diseases and health issues after the flood.  2.6.5 Infrastructure evaluation The water supply system of sample NCs was investigated physically. This assessment included visually inspecting the water storage tanks, the distribution system and pipelines, and the Municipal water source.    2.7 Indicators for evaluation of access to clean water The Access to clean water was measured and analyzed using a comprehensive set of indicators in Tables 2 and 3   . The WHO and UNICEF joint monitoring program (JMP) classified water facility type into five classes based on safely managed, fundamental, limited, unimproved indicators, and surface water (Table 4  ). 2.7.1 Application of GIS for evaluation of access to clean water The data for evaluating these parameters was collected with the help of the Kobo collect tool, which records the site GPS location of the household.GIS and remote sensing techniques were applied to assess access to clean water. The distribution of household locations has been shown on the map. The geo-statistical analyst tool (inverse distance weightage tool IDW) was used for thematic mapping.    3 Results 3.1 Evaluation of access to clean water as sustainable development goal target 6.1 Access to safe drinking water is a basic need of humans because life is impossible without water. However, its availability in terms of quantity and quality is one of the major environmental issues on this planet. Rapid population growth, climate change, natural hazards, and disaster increase their vulnerability with time (Daud et al., 2017 ). As a result, water will become the most vulnerable resource in the coming decades. Access to safe and clean drinking water is a significant issue in flood-affected areas. The study area is twice affected by the 2010 and 2022 floods. Considering these two events, evaluating the status of drinking water is mandatory. For this purpose, a household survey was conducted to investigate access to clean drinking water. Household members were asked about the source, accessibility, availability, acceptability, and quality of drinking water. The details of all parameters are given below.  3.2 Main source of water in the study area The main water source is the primary and predominant source from which a particular location or community obtains its water supply. This source typically provides the most significant portion of the water used for various purposes like drinking, sanitation, and other daily needs (Rajapakse et al., 2023 ). The household members were asked about their access to the primary source of drinking water in their household. The respondents' answers were recorded using the kobo collect tool with GPS location. The primary sources were classified into five categories: borehole, municipal water, hand pump, piped water, and others. The highest access value to the borehole was reported for Shamir Garhi at 22.95 %, Nawa Kalli at 12.24 %, and Bara Khel at 15.21 %, while the lowest was recorded for Kabul River at 1.72 %. The access to Municipal water for Khalil Abad is 99 %, Ashore Abad at 42.85 %, Mana Khel at 27.08 %, Dagi Khel at 21.15 %, and Amangarh at 62 %, while the lowest for Kabul River at 1.7 %, Bara Khel is 4.3 % and Allah-yar Khel 6.1 %. The hand pump, piped water, and other source users were reported within the 21 % or less range. The details are given in Fig. 2  .  3.3 Other sources used for drinking water Other sources are those that the people of particular NCs preferred for drinking. Other sources used for drinking water refer to the alternative or supplementary sources of water utilized alongside the primary source to meet the drinking water needs of a location or community. These are not the primary sources, but they can be used in various situations or considered backups (Saqr et al., 2021 ). Household members were questioned about another source additional to the main one. The highest borehole and tube well users were reported from Kabul River at 96 %, Khalil Abad at 75 %, and Allah-yar Khel at 61 %, while the lowest consumers were reported from Bara Khel and ashore Abad at 31 %. Access to Piped water was recorded for Ashore Abad at 55 %, Bara Khel at 48.8 % while lowest for Amangarh at 8.75 %. The value of the remaining sources ranged between 36 % and 2 %. The details are shown in Fig. 3  .  3.4 Collection point of water A collection point for water is a designated location or site where individuals gather to obtain or collect water for various purposes, such as drinking, cooking, or sanitation. These points are typically connected to a water source and are accessible to the community, serving as a central location (Howard and Bartram, 2005 ). The water points were classified into dwelling, yard, tape water, tube well and hand pump, dug well, and other sources. The highest value of own dwelling was recorded for Allah-yar Khel, 99 %; Ashore Abad, 86 %; Amangarh, 72 %; Behram Khan Khel, 67 %; and Bara Khel, 63 %, while the lowest value was recorded for Dagi Khel, 7.6 %. The highest value of own yard collection point was recorded for Shamir Garhi at 52 %. Similarly, tape water tube wells and hand pumps were recorded as the highest for Khalil Abad at 27.58 %, Kabul River at 39.65 % and Dagi Khel at 30 % (Fig. 4  ).  3.5 Distance from water source The distance from the water point refers to the measurement of how individuals or communities have to travel or the proximity between their location and their water source. It indicates the physical separation between where people live and where they must go to access the water for their daily needs (Boretti and Rosa, 2019 ). The distance covered in a particular time taken in water collection is considered a parameter for accessibility. It is classified into five categories: ten or <10 min, 15 to 20 min, 25 to 30 min, and more than 30 min. The 1st category's highest value was recorded for Allah Yar Khel at 99 %, Behram Khan Khel at 94 %, Khalil Abad at 68 % and Mana Khel at 61 %. The second category's highest score was recorded for Amangarh at 47.5 % and Nawan Kalli at 46 %. The third category's highest value was recorded for Kabul River at 48 %, Shamir Garhi at 45 %, and Ashore Abad at 44 %. The details are given in Fig. 5  .  3.6 Duration of water availability from the source The duration of water availability from the source refers to the length of time that water is consistently accessible from the specific water source. It indicates how long people can rely on the water supply from that source without interruptions or shortages, ensuring that it meets their daily needs for the specified period (Rajapakse et al., 2023 ). The question for water availability in the questionnaire has been divided into four categories, i.e., 24 h, 12 h, six or <6 h, and don't know. The highest value for 24-hour water availability was recorded for Allah-yar Khel 97 %, Behram Khan Khel 92.98 %, Dagi Khel 65 %, and Mana Khel 63 %. The highest score for 12 h was 51 % for Bara Khel and 10.34 % for Kabul River. While six or <6 h water availability index was 86.20 % for Khalil Abad and 82 % for Ashore Abad. The details are given in Fig. 6  .  3.7 Satisfaction from the quality of water Satisfaction with water quality reflects the contentment or fulfillment experienced by individuals or communities regarding the overall characteristics and safety of the water they use. It measures how well the water quality meets their expectations and needs, including factors like taste, odor, clarity, and absence of contaminants, which contribute to their contentment and peace of mind in using that water (Miller et al., 2019 ). The answer to this question has been classified into satisfied, not satisfied, neutral, and don't know. The highest score for satisfaction from water quality was noted for Khalil Abad 96 %, ashore Abad 89 %, and Amangarh 88 %. In Mana Khel, 97 % of people were unsatisfied with the quality of the drinking water, and in Dagi Khel, 63 % were not satisfied. The details are given in Fig. 7  .  3.8 Acceptability of water quality from the source The acceptability of water quality from the source indicates whether water quality obtained directly from its origin, such as a well, river, or tap, meets the established standards and is deemed safe and suitable for its intended uses (Ait-Kadi, 2016 ). This assessment considers various parameters like purity, cleanliness, and absence of harmful substances to determine whether the water is acceptable for drinking, cooking, and other applications without health risks or safety concerns. It measures how well the water quality meets their expectations and needs, including factors like taste, odor, clarity, and absence of contaminants, which contribute to their contentment and peace of mind in using that water. The answer to this question is categorized into yes acceptable, No, not acceptable, unacceptable color, and improper test. The highest value for the 1st category was recorded from Khalil Abad at 99 %, Amangarh at 97.5 %, Ashore Abad at 93 %, and Kabul River at 84 %. For the second category, the highest score was noted: 97 % from Mana Khel, 42 % from Dagi Khel, and 36 % from Bara Khel. The highest score for unacceptable color was 21 % for Dagi Khel, while for unacceptable taste, 32 % was recorded for Allah-yar Khel. The details are given in Fig. 8  .   3.9 Affordability of water supply Affordability refers to the ability of consumers to pay water utility bills or install hand pumps and boreholes to access safe potable water(Saqr et al., 2021 ). The Public Health Engineering department collects 360 rupees bill payments from each household after three months, equal to more than a dollar. Hence, consumers can afford it easily in the study area. However, in some places, the distribution lines of municipal water are unavailable, or where the municipal water schemes are disrupted, the residents are deprived of municipal water facilities. Consequently, those who can afford boreholes or hand pumps installed these facilities themselves while those who cannot arrange private facilities access to the neighbor's water facilities. About 60 % of people have access to municipal water facilities in the study area, and the remaining rely on private water facilities for potable water.  3.10 Water quality sample results The Public Health Engineering Department of Nowshera requested that the water samples be tested for water quality parameters. These departments are responsible for monitoring and analyzing water quality twice a particular year or at any time on public demand. The public health engineering department delivered the water quality data in an Excel sheet (Supplementary File 2), visualized in Figs. 9  , 10  , and 11  .  3.11 Application of the JMP service ladder in samples NCs The 2 % households of 11 sample NCs have been surveyed for the current investigation. The household members were asked about JMP's recommended core questions (Supplementary File 1). The collected data was analyzed to estimate the JMP service ladder (Table 4 ), based on which the study area has been classified as the proportion of the population access to safely managed water facilities, basic water facilities, and limited water facilities.  3.12 Safely managed water facility A potable water facility accessible from an improved source, on-premises, available when needed, and free from contamination is classified as a safely managed water source (Rajapakse et al., 2023 ). As per water survey analysis, 49.59 % to 51.77 % of surveyed households have access to safely managed water sources (Fig. 12  ). A significant proportion of the population who includes in this category is the households located close to municipal water sources or households with access to deep boreholes in their premises.  3.13 Basic water facility Drinking water obtained from improved sources, provided collection time is not more than 30 min for a round trip, including queuing (Rajapakse et al., 2023 ). The estimation of households with access to basic water facilities ranges from 17 % to 47 %. Significant leakage in municipal water supply pipelines and water collection from neighbors' boreholes exist. Similarly, in these areas, people are not satisfied with the water quality affected by the 2010 and 2022 floods. The distribution of basic water facilities is shown in Fig. 12 .  3.14 Limited water facility  The potable water, which is not available on-premises, and the collection time required of more than 30 min for a round trip, including queuing, are classified as limited water facilities by the JMP service ladder (El Bouzidi et al., 2024 ). The proportions of the population access to this facility range from 3 to 94.67 %. The members of these localities are unable to dig deep boreholes and hand pumps while the shallow water is degraded by flood events, which is saline or has a bitter taste. The people of these areas approach far-flung areas for safe drinking water.  3.15 Unimproved water source  The potable water obtained from unprotected Dug wells and unprotected springs are classified as an unimproved water source. A small portion of the population in the sample NCs access to dug wells for potable water. The main factors behind this are the unavailability of municipal water and the need for access to a borehole or hand pump. Some people cannot afford to dig boreholes or install hand pumps; therefore, they utilize traditional dug wells for potable water. However, one of the drilled wells is located in Dagi Khel used to spiritually treat many skin diseases, locally called (Sre makha jumat ). The distribution of unimproved water sources is given in Fig. 12 .   4 Discussion The current research is dedicated to assessing access to clean potable water in the aftermath of the flood disaster in Nowshera. The standard WHO/and UNICEF joint monitoring program (JMP) techniques were used for assessment. The JMP introduced a service ladder for WASH assessment, which divides the water facility into safely managed, basic, limited, unimproved, and surface water (Zheng et al., 2023 ). The sites that comprise 11 flood-affected NCs were purposively selected. The 2 % of the sample NC households were surveyed with the Kobo collect tool (Table 1 ). For this purpose, a questionnaire has been designed, which comprises 18 core questions. The results categorized the study area into four classes, i.e., safely managed, basic, limited, and unimproved (Martínez-Santos, 2017 ; Wang et al., 2024 ). The household survey reveals that among the sample NCs in Dagi Khel, Nawan Kali, Kabul River, Mana Khel, Allah-yar Khel, and Bara Khel, more than 60 % of the population has access to boreholes as their primary source of water. Similarly, in Amangarh, Khalil Abad, Behram Khan Khel, and Ashor Abad, more than 60 % rely on municipal water as the primary water source (Boretti and Rosa, 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Elhassnaoui et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2024) . Over 60 % of the population uses borehole water for different purposes, such as washing, cooking, and drinking. The members of households who utilize boreholes and municipal water collect water from their dwellings, while some people have access to their yards or public tap water (Lan et al., 2022 ). The significant proportion of the population who utilize boreholes or municipal water for drinking purposes has been reported in Khalil Abad, Kabul River, and Allah-yar Khel, which indicates that these people are satisfied with the water quality of boreholes and municipal water (Khan et al., 2023; Jamil et al., 2023) . At the same time, the household members in Nawa Kali, Ashor Abad, and Bara Khel reported using piped water (The water taken from Neighbors) for drinking purposes, which indicates non-satisfaction with a borehole or municipal water for drinking (El Bouzidi et al., 2024 ). The remaining NCs people utilize other sources like dug wells, tanker water, and packed water in Dagi Khel, Amangarh, Behram Khan Khel, Mana Khel, Bara Khel, and Ashor Abad. Using other sources indicates that these people have no access to municipal water or that the available water is unfit for drinking (Nagabhatla and Brahmbhatt, 2020; Rehman et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) . The household members were also asked about the time taken to collect water from the source. Due to nearest access, the members of Behram Khan Khel, Allah-yar Khel, Khalil Abad, and Mana Khel have reported the highest value of 10 or less than 10 min for collection. At the same time, the remaining NC, a significant proportion of the population, takes 15 to 30 min for water collection, which has been classified as a primary water facility as per the JMP service ladder. Similarly, some people in Shamir Garhi, Ashor Abad, and Kabul rivers take more than 30 min to make a round trip to collect water from the source. Members of the surveyed household were also asked about the duration of water availability without any interruption. More than 60 % of the population in Dagi Khel, Nawan Kalli, Behram Khan Khel, Mana Khel, and Allah-yar Khel has reported 24-hour water availability. More than 50 % of households were reported in Bara Khel for 12 h of water availability. Khalil Abad and Ashore Abad were highlighted, where more than 80 % of people had access to water available for 6 h only. The results showcase that the municipal water is either unavailable or, due to significant leakages in municipal water pipelines in these NCs, so the people approach another safe source away from their dwellings. The members of the household were also asked about their satisfaction with the quality of the water. Khalil Abad 96 %, Ashore Abad 89 % and Amangarh 88 % were noted for their satisfaction with water quality. In Mana Khel, 97 % of people were not satisfied with the quality of the drinking water, and in Dagi Khel, 63 % of people were not satisfied with the quality of the drinking water. The floods degraded the water quality of shallow boreholes, and there are no functional municipal water schemes in these NCs, as they rely on Dagi Khel municipal water schemes, from which limited water is supplied to these regions. Similarly, the members were also asked about the acceptability of water (Sutradhar and Mondal, 2021 ). The highest value for acceptability was recorded from Khalil Abad at 99 %, Amangarh at 97.5 %, Ashore Abad at 93 %, and Kabul River at 84 %. The highest score was noted for non-acceptability, 97 % from Mana Khel, 42 % from Dagi Khel, and 36 % from Bara Khel. The highest score for unacceptable color was 21 % for Dagi Khel, while for unacceptable taste, 32 % was recorded for Allah-yar Khel (Daud et al., 2017 ; The NC chairpersons were also interviewed about municipal water coverage, satisfaction with municipal water services, and his significant challenges and issues (Mulamattathil et al., 2015 ). The chairman of NC Mana Khel highlighted that there is limited access to municipal water as three non-functional water schemes require little attention from the concerned officials. However, they depend on the Dagi Khel water scheme, which cannot meet the required water demands. Further, Khan et al. (2021)  reported that people cannot afford deep boreholes, while shallow water is unfit for drinking due to unacceptable taste and smell (Daud et al., 2017 ; Ondieki et al., 2021 ). Similarly, as per an interview conducted with chairman NC Khalil Abad, the pipelines of water schemes installed by the worker welfare board are leaked, and drinking water in many areas is mixed with sewerage water, which is unfit for drinking purposes. All NC chairpersons were satisfied with the primary municipal water source but were unsatisfied with distribution pipelines due to significant leakages and no interest from concerned officials. As per their information, in each NC, 60 % of the population has access to municipal water sources and demands new water supply schemes and filtration plants. The community elders were also interviewed about their perception of drinking water quality after floods, satisfaction with the municipal water supply, the major issues and challenges, and their demands from the government. The community elders reported that drinking water quality was degraded after the 2010 and 2022 floods. They were satisfied with the source but highlighted significant pipeline leakages and demanded water filtration plants. They also urged the government to ensure safe and affordable water to every citizen without interruption. Community elders also demanded quick action regarding any failures in the municipal water supply. There is a dire need to ensure the monitoring of access to safe and clean potable water as sustainable development goal 6 target 6.1, especially in those regions in the world that are most vulnerable to natural hazards and disasters. In the aftermath of any disaster, the water supply system is directly and indirectly affected, and proper attention and priority actions are needed. Flood events such as riverine floods and flash floods, even typical rainy seasons, can disrupt the water supply system. This finding reveals that the water supply system must be monitored after disastrous events, and the new water supply project should be designed to be more resilient to cope with any situation. Proper source selection and location are the most critical factors for future planning.  5 Conclusion The present research assessment of access to clean drinking water after the flood of 2010 and 2022 has been carried out in district Nowshera. The WHO and UNICEF (JMP) standard procedure for monitoring, a primary tool for assessing all essential indicators for sustainable management, has been used in current research. The sample size and study area have been purposively selected based on specific criteria. 2 % of the sample NCs households were surveyed using the Kobo collect tool. The Kobo collect tool is very easy, responsive, environmentally friendly, and time-saving software that saves the data in an online Kobo tool server and automatically analyzes data in an Excel sheet. The JMP service ladder classified the study area into four classes: safely managed (49.5 % to 51.77 %), basic (17.59 % to 47.92 %), limited (3 % to 94.67 %), unimproved (1.82 % to 41.46 %) water facilities. The results reveal that a significant proportion of the population is deprived of access to safely managed water facilities. The damage to water supply infrastructure and aquifer pollution caused by the floods has exacerbated the existing water challenges affecting vulnerable populations. The study's results also underscore the urgent need for resilient water management strategies, infrastructure rehabilitation, and water quality monitoring to ensure equitable access to safe drinking water. The finding also highlights the importance of integrating water security into disaster risk reduction and sustainable development framework. The field survey for monitoring access to safe drinking water required trained enumerators who should be familiar with the basic terms used in the design questionnaire. The data for this type of research should be obtained from other survey reports, which are readily available within government and regional reports. The mapping of SDG 6.1 is straightforward and requires no extra skill in GIS software. The thematic maps designed in GIS software play a crucial role in planning and decision-making. Hence, the current research work is recommended for policymakers, planners, concerned agencies, and public awareness. The authors request further research on assessing and ensuring access to safe and clean water with modern geostatistical tools and machine learning techniques.
