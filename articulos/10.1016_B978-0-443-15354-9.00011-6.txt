               With the increasing global population and deteriorating natural habitats, finding fresh and potable water has become a great challenge in many nations. On top, declining water resources and increased water contamination levels with industrial and agricultural effluents have become a major concern to many government bodies in the world. Currently, around 1.8 billion of the total population do not have access to potable water, and 2.7 billion humans experience scarcity for at least a month each year. Ironically, the majority of these populations live in the regions that are very close to the seawater, and in these regions, desalination is a great solution to overcome the clean water problems. Various techniques are developed for seawater treatment to make it potable while utilizing membrane or electrochemical or thermal-based approaches that include nanofiltration, capacitive desalination, electrodialysis, distillation (with solar energy as an option), and gas hydrate production, etc. Desalination could be a great solution to meet the daily water requirements in many nations’ coastal and nearby regions, but the costs are usually very high. There is a lot of research going on to alleviate the water scarcity issues in many of these regions of the world, and new methods of seawater desalination, collection, and management are being implemented. At the same time, the reusing of seawater for food production and industrial growth is being considered. Thus, the desalination of seawater could help safeguard both the environment and human health. Therefore, while considering many inventions, their challenges, and opportunities in the field of seawater treatment, this chapter discusses the fundamental principles of many existing seawater treatment technologies and their progression, and developments of new technologies and their benefits as well as drawbacks while focusing on new avenues to meeting the future demands of coastal as well as interior regions. Analysis of the costs associated with desalination, including energy, infrastructure, and maintenance costs, is also presented in this chapter. Finally, several opportunities to expand the horizon of desalination technologies to the regions that are away from the coastal belts to expand the services of desalination technologies to serve global humanity are presented. This chapter also highlights the potential of desalination technologies in addressing water scarcity, a pressing global issue that threatens sustainable development, and the importance of considering sustainable development goals in the development and implementation of desalination technologies to minimize the potential negative impacts.

On top, declining water resources and increased water contamination levels with industrial and agricultural effluents have become a major concern to many government bodies in the world. Currently, around 1.8 billion of the total population do not have access to potable water, and 2.7 billion humans experience scarcity for at least a month each year. Ironically, the majority of these populations live in the regions that are very close to the seawater, and in these regions, desalination is a great solution to overcome the clean water problems. Various techniques are developed for seawater treatment to make it potable while utilizing membrane or electrochemical or thermal-based approaches that include nanofiltration, capacitive desalination, electrodialysis, distillation (with solar energy as an option), and gas hydrate production, etc. Desalination could be a great solution to meet the daily water requirements in many nations’ coastal and nearby regions, but the costs are usually very high. There is a lot of research going on to alleviate the water scarcity issues in many of these regions of the world, and new methods of seawater desalination, collection, and management are being implemented. At the same time, the reusing of seawater for food production and industrial growth is being considered. Thus, the desalination of seawater could help safeguard both the environment and human health. Therefore, while considering many inventions, their challenges, and opportunities in the field of seawater treatment, this chapter discusses the fundamental principles of many existing seawater treatment technologies and their progression, and developments of new technologies and their benefits as well as drawbacks while focusing on new avenues to meeting the future demands of coastal as well as interior regions. Analysis of the costs associated with desalination, including energy, infrastructure, and maintenance costs, is also presented in this chapter. Finally, several opportunities to expand the horizon of desalination technologies to the regions that are away from the coastal belts to expand the services of desalination technologies to serve global humanity are presented. This chapter also highlights the potential of desalination technologies in addressing water scarcity, a pressing global issue that threatens sustainable development, and the importance of considering sustainable development goals in the development and implementation of desalination technologies to minimize the potential negative impacts.

The existing water supplies will run out sooner as the world’s population keeps expanding. Fortunately, population centers are frequently found close to the water supplies. However, due to the unexpected population explosion and rapid industrialization across the globe, there is a significant increase in the requirement for freshwater for domestic and agricultural purposes. Globally, agriculture uses over 70% of the water, industries use about 20%, and households only utilize about 10% of the water.1   Safe water is considered one of the crucial components when considering a nation’s food security and agricultural developments. However, the amount of freshwater is decreasing at a startling rate. This issue is further complicated by the release of industrial effluents into rivers and lakes as well as the excessive discharge of sewage.2–4   Factors, including population explosion, constant upgradation of living standards,  climate change, etc., make the problem more critical. Fig. 13.1   shows the global water scarcity projections for 20405   by World Resources Institute. If the same trend continues, by 2025, around two third of the world’s total population could be residing in areas facing severe water scarcity. In most water-stressed nations, 97% of the water is available as seawater, covering around 70% of the earth’s surface. Due to the high salinity of seawater (33–37 g of salt/L), it cannot be used as it is in any of the applications discussed above.6   Therefore, the desalination of seawater is of utmost importance. Desalination emerged in the 1960s as one of the most important methods for purifying seawater to obtain acceptable salinity levels for various uses.7   Desalination techniques can treat water from multiple sources, including seawater, domestic as well as industrial wastewater, and brackish water, etc.8   There are more than 21,000 desalination facilities existing in more than 120 nations throughout the world.8  Fig. 13.2   shows various techniques used as part of the desalination.7   Desalination uses three main approaches: thermal, electrical, and pressure-based techniques. Thermal distillation is the oldest technique and has been used for a very long time. As a part of this, modern distillation process use various approaches, including low-pressure vessels, to bring the boiling point of the water to a lower value and thermally reduce the energy needed for desalination. A second important kind of desalination process uses energy in the form of electricity to separate salts through a permeable membrane from the seawater. However, the energy needed in this method depends on the initial concentrations of the salt. As a result, it is suitable only for water with lower concentration values of salts. Reverse osmosis (RO) extracts the salts from water  by passing them via a selectively permeable membrane under the influence of pressures. In this book chapter, various techniques available for seawater desalination, their working principle, merits-demerits, cost analysis, and the future scope were discussed and presented.  13.2 Historical developments The desalination technique was first proposed in the 18th century by the United Kingdom’s naval warfare force to enhance navigational autonomy with no additional water storage on the ships. The first desalination technology was single flash distillation, which was later upgraded into the more effective multistage flash distillation (MSF) process since the ships at the time had steam engines. George and James Weir came up with the first desalination plant in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1885.9   In the following years, desalination units for civil as well as domestic applications were made functional all over the world. A Dutch company, in 1907, came up with a very initial desalination unit in the Arabian Gulf at Jeddah. In 1928, the same unit was directed for installation on the order of King Abdulaziz Al Saud, having a total  capacity of about 135 m3 /day. In 1953, Kuwait and Qatar witnessed the development of desalination technologies. In particular, a total of ten units in Kuwait having an approximate capacity of 4545.5 m3 /day and five units having a combined capacity of 682 m3 /day were built in Qatar. In Kuwait, an additional ten identically sized units were installed in 1955. Desalination plants were continuously built all over the world from this point by numerous corporations like Westinghouse in the United States, Krupp in Germany, and Società Italiana Resine in Italy.7   RO is another widely used method that utilizes semipermeable membranes to purify water. Jean-Antoine Nollet initially observed the osmosis phenomenon in 1748, although it wasn’t used for about two centuries.7   A team of researchers conducted the initial investigations in the United States at the universities of California and Florida in 1956. Although the first membrane came into existence in 1959, the first working desalination unit with a 19 m3 /day capacity wasn’t implemented until 1965 10  . Asymmetric membranes with different porosity resulted in the advancement of this technology. Requirements for a huge amount of electrical energy and the short lifespan of the membrane were the initial causes of the sluggish proliferation of RO technology. As lowering the total dissolved salts levels of brackish water was the subject of the first applications of RO technology, its osmotic pressure values were lower than that of the seawater. The initial desalination unit based on RO technology was developed in the USA in 1977 for municipality applications with a total capacity of 11,350 m3 /day.10   At the same location in 1985, another significant desalination plant with a capacity of 56,800 m3 /day was put into operation. The improvements in the lifespan of membranes and the development of energy recovery devices led to significant technological advancements in the RO. Due to this, it is now used in seawater applications and is economically competitive with other technologies. This enhancement was made possible in the 1990's by implementing an energy recovery system that involved installing technologies, such as hydro turbines, before reintroducing brackish water into the ocean. As of now, RO, with 68.7% built capacity, is the best-known technology for the desalination of seawater, which is followed by others, including multistage flash (MSF—17.6%), Multi-Effect Distillation (MED-6.9%) and other technologies (6.8%).10–14   Although Desalination plants are located all over the globe, most of them (47.5% of total capacity) are well-established in the Middle East and North Africa where seawater (70.5% of the world’s capacity) serves as the primary source of raw water.10   Several technologies are currently being researched to lower further the energy requirement for producing freshwater. Although there are many matured technologies, in this chapter five most important technologies that have been in the development stage with the potential for large-scale operations based on pressure,  electricity and thermal approaches along with their advantages and disadvantages while projecting their costs and economic viability will be discussed in detail in this chapter.  13.3 Electrodialysis Electrodialysis (ED) falls under electrochemical approaches, which involves the transportation of ions through a semipermeable membrane when a controlled electric voltage is applied. Different ion exchange membranes (IEMs) combined with the help of electrical energy cations and anions are separated when an electric current is applied.11   ED is a well-established technology for purifying almost all types of wastewater. In addition to water treatment applications, ED and ED-based technologies, including reverse electrodialysis (RED) and bipolar electrodialysis (BMED), have been extensively studied in the past for novel applications, including the coupling of membrane processes to increase the overall process efficiency.12  Fig. 13.3   shows a schematic for electrodialysis setup for seawater.7   Different desalination technologies use various anticorrosion, antifoaming and other chemicals in the pre and post treatment that significantly negatively impact the environment. In comparison, ED does not require phase changes, reactions, or chemicals.13   From the environmental point of view, it is a great approach. Although ED is adaptable for a wide range of applications, and it is typically viewed as being too energy-intensive for the desalination of seawater. The electrical energy requirements of ED indirectly result in greenhouse gas emissions. Many advancements are still being made in the ED process on a small scale in  laboratories, and as of now, ED contributes to 4% of the world’s desalination capacity.15   Following are the advantages and disadvantages of the ED process. Advantages1. Since there is no phase change during the separation process, it does not need a lot of energy that is usually required in other desalination techniques.  2. Following ED, brackish water filtering simply needs chlorination for the sterilization of water.  3. There is no osmotic pressure in this process, and hence pressure can be adjusted appropriately.  4. It is a relatively simple process compared to other technologies.    Disadvantages1. The removal of organic substances, colloids, and SiO2  is not possible with ED.  2. Pretreatment is essential to avoid fouling on ED stakes.  3. To ensure compatibility, it is important to make the right material selections when creating ED membranes and stacks.     13.4 Nanofiltration Nanofiltration is frequently used to desalinate water and remove other contaminants from water sources. One of the four membrane technologies that use pressure to separate pollutants from water streams is nanofiltration (NF).16   The remaining three are RO, microfiltration, and ultrafiltration. These technologies use semipermeable membranes with the capacity to hold back (reject) dissolved and/or suspended particles from a water stream containing these contaminants. Nanofiltration may be described as the filtration method that utilizes water with few total dissolved particles and a nano-porous membrane. Pores in a nanofiltration filter have a size of about 0.001 µ.17   Nanofiltration can remove most of the organic molecules, a variety of viruses, and different salts. Fig. 13.4   depicts the working set of a nanofiltration system.7   Hard water is frequently softened with nanofiltration because it removes the divalent ions that increase the hardness levels of water.18–22   In nanofiltration, membranes that resist off-charged ions or molecular compounds are used underpressure, which serves as a filter between RO and ultrafiltration. Various membranes are utilized, including organic, ceramic, and nanofiltration, with different densities and pore sizes.17   These nano-bodies with size variation between 0.5 and 1 nm led to the transition between microporous and thick films. Typically, it is considered that  nanofiltration membranes do have nominal limits within 1000 and 200 Da.19   Nanofiltration membranes have more than 99% removal capacity for multivalent ions and a low to moderate removal capacity of about 70%, with a strong rejection of more than 90% when considering monovalent ions.16   The solute particle and nanopore sizes play a significant role in nanofiltration. The dissolution and diffusion properties of the solute particles also affect the overall separation efficiency. The electric field has a specific transport impact on the charged particles. The performance of a nanofiltration device is majorly affected by three major parameters, including solvent permeability, membrane flow, and solute removal. Nanofiltration is a method of cross-flow filtering, and the membrane requires less pressure to operate (75 psi) than RO (150 psi).16   The fundamental drawback of nanofiltration is that monovalent ions can easily pass through the nanofiltration membranes. The nanofiltration technique can change the concentration of total dissolved solids to lower values, but not so efficient when compared with the RO. Although the main use of nanofiltration in the industry is still limited to freshwater treatment, and is also frequently used in the dairy, chemical plants, paper and textile industries, etc. 18   The advantages of this process include,• The pH of output water is usually neutral  • The suspended and dissolved contents are filtered even from the brackish water  • It helps reduce heavy metals in the filtered water  • Lowers the discharge volumes  • It also helps in disinfection  • Reduced retentate concentrations compared to the RO for low-value salts  • Chemical-free process, for example, requires no salts or chemicals to operate  • When needed softening membranes are also applied, and hard water is softened.   • Sulfates and nitrates are reduced  • Decrease the turbidity, color, and tannins    The major Disadvantages of this process are• Compared to RO membranes, nanofiltration membranes are slightly expensive  • For salts and univalent ions, there is little retention  • Requires pretreatment where 0.1–20 µ particles need to be removed  • Higher energy is consumed in comparison to the UF and MF (0.3–1 kWh/m3 )  • Presence of free chlorine in water can damage membranes (lifespan of 1000 ppm). For high chlorine concentrations, a bi-sulfite treatment or an active carbon filter is recommended before nanofiltration    The following are some of the typical applications of nanofiltration• Desalination of by-products from the production of food, dairy products, and beverages  • Whey, UF permeate, or retentate may be partially desalinated as applicable  • Dye and optical brightener desalination  • Clean-in-place (CIP) chemical waste purification  • Modification of food items or their coloration  • Concentration of dairy, food, and beverage by-products  • Concentration of fermentation-related waste    In practice, NF has been employed to soften municipal water on a global scale for several years. The unique benefit of membrane technology in this application is that it does not require any chemicals to enable the elimination of hardness ions. NF has a higher flux rate than RO and gives an edge over RO.20   As a result, less membrane material is needed, and operating expenses come down with the low pressures of the pumping systems.  13.5 Distillation The most often used technique for separating homogenous fluid mixtures is distillation. It is the technique in which a liquid is evaporated into a vapor, which is later condensed back into a liquid with a purity much higher than the original liquid.21   The volatilization process typically requires heating the liquid, although it can also be accomplished by lowering the pressure or combining both. On the other hand, rectification, also called enrichment, is the process of purification of a compound with high volatility by interacting with counter-current streams  of liquid and vapor.22   Different liquids are separated from nonvolatile solids using distillation techniques, for example, separating alcoholic beverages from fermented materials. Also, two or more liquids with different boiling points, such as separating lubricating oils, gasoline, and kerosene from crude oil, can also be separated using the same. It appears that the initial experimenters used the distillation method of water purification. In 384–322 BCE, Aristotle concluded that seawater’s evaporation would lead to pure water formation.21   Most distillation techniques utilized in the industry and lab research are modifications of simple distillation. Fig. 13.5   shows the process of industrial distillation,24   where a well reboiler heats the liquid, and a condenser is used to cool the vapor, and a receiver is used to collect the distillate. When a mixture constituted of different compounds is subjected to heat energy, the one with maximum volatility or, in other words, with the lowest boiling material will distill out first, followed by the others. This is an easy-to-use system that separates liquids with wildly dissimilar boiling points while purifying a mixture of liquid and nonvolatile components. The laboratory scale unit is composed of glass joined together with ground glass joints and rubber corks. However, for industrial applications, equipment is made using metal and ceramics. Conventional distillation cannot be used to separate a mixture of liquids whose boiling points are near one another. A technique termed fractional distillation, or differential distillation, came into light for these purposes. The process of multiple-effect distillation, also known as multistage-flash evaporation, is another development of the simpler  distillation method. Another technique is vacuum distillation which is occasionally used, and it uses a vacuum pump to create a very high vacuum in a version of the reduced-pressure technique. This process generally deals with compounds having extremely high boiling temperatures.22   An alternative technique, steam distillation, can be used for the distillation process at temperatures below the standard boiling point and is useful when the substance to be distilled is chemically inert to water and immiscible.23,25   Following are the advantages of the distillation process Advantages• Enhances the quality of the water  • Purifies the water while eliminating all contaminants  • Removes the potentially hazardous waterborne pathogens during the heating process  • Water is distilled from salty ocean water can be used in desert regions where there is a shortage of freshwater    Disadvantages• High energy consumption  • Energy is frequently used from nonrenewable resources like fossil fuels; it directly contributes to global emission    A seawater desalination method based on renewable energy could efficiently address the above issues.25    13.6 Gas hydrate production Gas hydrates, sometimes referred to as clathrate freezes, spontaneously develop around hydrocarbon gases when they are subjected to temperatures more than the freezing point of the water. The word “clathrate” came from the Greek word “khlatron,” which means barrier.26   Clathrate compounds, being crystalline in nature, are inclusion compounds with small guest atoms or molecules physically imprisoned in host cavities generated by a three-dimensional assemblage of hydrogen-linked molecules. If the encased molecules are gases rather than water, these compounds are referred to as gas hydrates instead; these are far more frequently found.27   Cubic I, cubic II, and hexagonal H are three different configurations of water molecules that are observed based on the size of trapped molecules.26   When a gas hydrate melts, water and hydrocarbon are produced simultaneously, resulting in a re-circular mixture. This approach has a greater working temperature than the previous direct freezing techniques, which uses less energy to generate and melt the gas hydrates. Clathrate hydrate, often known as “hydrates,” is a solid  crystalline inclusion compound made up primarily of water and, to a lesser extent, a guest molecule. It originates at a combination of high pressure and relatively moderate temperatures. The gas hydrate stability region is the area where gas hydrates are stable and is influenced by the factors such as inhibitor/promoter, guest molecule, and concentration of each gas.28  Fig. 13.6   depicts the schematic of the working of a gas hydrate system.27   Although the inclusion of some large molecule guest molecules could stabilize the hydrates at almost ambient temperature, the hydrates are often synthesized and stabilized above the freezing temperature of the water. In general, the aqueous solution solids, dissolved species, and most organic species are all excluded from forming a gas hydrate. Since only pure water can form hydrates, all other contaminants like salts and other substances are easily separated and discarded through gas hydrate production and dissociation. These serve as the foundation for the desalination process. The production of hydrate is naturally inhibited by the salts found in the seawater; therefore, significantly more subcooling has been necessitated. This constraint can be easily bypassed by using propane (C3 H8 ), an appropriate guest gas, or an appropriate hydrate promoter like tetra hydra Ferron or sodium dodecyl sulfate.29   In the early 1960s, some groups used hydrate promoters or clathrate hydrate-forming chemicals to facilitate the freezing of saline water. Koppers Co. was the first business to create a desalination method based on producing propane hydrates.29   Various hydrate formers were considered to study hydrate separation kinetics and continuous flow systems.30   Numerous process concepts were developed and tested on pilot scales during the following ten years, from 1960 to 1970, which  resulted in difficulties separating hydrate crystals from the concentrated brine and removing dissolved guest molecules from the recovered host. Previously, the Bureau of Reclamation was authorized by Thermal Energy System, Inc. to perform direct injections of the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerant (R141b) into pressured seawater reservoirs underhydrate-forming conditions (100 psi and 5°C) and complex hydrates and brine suspension were developed (slurry); however, before dissociation, the gas hydrates needed to be retrieved and removed from the saltwater. Small dendritic hydrate crystals with a significant quantity of salt trapped in the interstitial gaps were produced in this method. The test was reasonably beneficial despite not building and testing a wash column as part of the process. Although a wash column was not built and tested as part of the process, the test was reasonably useful.31–33   The operation was expected to cost between $0.59 and $0.68 m−3 . These investigations cleared several operational issues and future development needed for the desalination process through hydrate formation, including the challenges of separating the gas hydrate and the salt crystals. It also emphasized the significance of figuring out how to filter the hydrate crystals, planning and running a wash column, and using hydrate formers (promoters) to operate the processes at relatively high temperatures and low pressures. Hydrate desalination of salty water uses less energy and is more cost-effective, especially in distant places.33   According to the information presented above, the hydrate-based desalination method appears to be a promising alternative to the established techniques, including MSF and RO.33   Since low-temperature conditions substantially impact the production of gas hydrate, desalination applications in cold regions would also improve the economics of hydrate-based technology by reducing the energy cost of freezing the seawater. To make hydrate desalination more affordable and practically implementable for commercial applications, low-cost and easily accessible hydrate boosters are currently being investigated.  13.7 Capacitive deionization for desalination of seawater Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a new method for seawater desalination. This method is based on the ion electro-sorption mechanism at the surface of two electrically charged electrodes, which are typically made of highly porous carbon compounds.34  Fig. 13.7   represents the working of a CDI system.35   Previously, it was used for brackish water desalination and removal of charged species dissolved in aqueous solutions, wastewater treatment, and water softening. CDI seems to be the best possible alternative to matured technologies like RO, specifically for streams such  as brackish water. Blair and Murphy published the first study on a CDI-type system in 1960, and in the next four decades, this technology experienced only occasional advancements.35–37   The creation of the first macroscopic theory applicable to CDI in 1971 and the introduction of carbon aerogels as a CDI electrode material in the middle of the 1990s are only two examples of developments made during that time.35   Interestingly, Farmer et al., in 1996, used the term “CDI”. Over the past decade, CDI research and commercialization efforts have increased dramatically. The CDI community has developed dramatically, resulting in significant advancements in the new cell structures with modified designs of the systems and the use of several IEMs along with alternative ideas that include flow-able electrodes made of carbon and modified hybrid systems with the battery electrode.36   Additionally, significant progress was made in understanding the intricate interactions between the electrochemical surfaces, including modeling the kinetic and equilibrium elements of the desalination process. A CDI system’s effectiveness is influenced by various factors.38   The choice of electrode material is a fundamental aspect to consider, and various carbon materials have been investigated thus far, such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.37   However, the operational mode and the system design are just as crucial. A CDI system may even run continuously, thanks to the recent improvements involving flow electrodes.39   Lastly, CDI was explored for different applications that go far beyond “simply” producing drinkable water.40–42   Advantages• It allows salt removal at minimal subosmotic pressures at ambient temperature. The principal inputs are a small cell voltage (1 V) and an electric current, whose magnitude is dependent on the size of the overall system. As a result, CDI does not require connection to the  heat source or pumps with high-pressure capacity, which implies that the CDI system scalability is easy.  • Since the ions are directly carried out of the feed water, low-salinity feed waters can be desalinated with potentially high energy efficiency (brackish water).  • Upon being charged, CDI may store energy (much like a supercapacitor) and desalinate the water. The initial supplied charge for the ion removal is approximately fully recovered during the process of discharging the electrode material, resulting in a very high coulombic efficiency of the EDL technologies, including this energy storage capacity is not used.  • It helps in softening of the water  • Removes heavy metals  • Phosphate and nitrates are removed    Disadvantages• There are very few statistics available for seawater desalination by CDI  • The efficacy of the electrode (performance of adsorption and energy effectiveness) could deteriorate average period of time  • Need pretreatment  • The cycle-based operation of the CDI and MDCI appears to be a barrier to their commercialization    The CDI technique is energy-efficient, with the ability to even desalinate brackish water and water with low salt concentrations that are unfit for human consumption. In recent years, CDI has achieved considerable advancements by embracing various innovative technologies and electrode materials.43   The electrode materials’ structure and content can improve the CDI technology’s impact. To implement the large-scale manufacturing of CDI technology, additional investigation is required in the areas listed below.36  1. Expanding research on the adsorption performance mechanism and the kinetics of the electro-adsorption reaction is important to develop a theoretical framework for investigating electrode materials.  2. By developing CDI into a desalination technology that could precisely remove particular ions, improving its ability to eliminate ions selectively can make up for the shortcoming of standard desalination technology, which cannot specifically remove ions.  3. The production of electrode materials that are highly adaptable, inexpensive, and have a high adsorption capacity can make it easier to conduct future development and research and therefore advance the use of CDI technology.      13.8 Comparative assessment of desalination technologies Desalination technologies can be broadly categorized into thermal, electrical, and membrane-based methods. Thermal methods include distillation, whereas RO and nanofiltration are membrane-based technologies for seawater desalination. In comparison, distillation is energy-intensive and unsuitable for large-scale operations, whereas RO is widely used for seawater desalination but requires high pressure with moderate energy consumption. ED uses an electric current to separate ions and can be used for brackish water desalination. NF is a form of ultrafiltration that can remove dissolved salts and other small molecules and is suitable for treating surface water and groundwater. RO is the most common and widely used membrane-based method for seawater desalination. Gas hydrate production is an emerging technology that uses natural gas hydrate crystals to separate salt from water. It can potentially be less energy-intensive than the thermal and membrane-based methods but is currently still in the research and development phase. CDI again uses electricity and falls under an electrochemical process that uses the electrodes to remove ions from the water. It is a relatively new technology and potentially less energy-intensive than other desalination methods. However, it is still in the early stages of development and commercialization. In summary, RO, ED, and NF are the most widely used and well-established desalination technologies, while gas hydrate production and CDI are still in the early stages of development. Overall, RO is considered the most efficient and widely used desalination technology but is also the most expensive.44   Electrodialysis and nanofiltration are less efficient but less expensive alternatives. Distillation is energy-intensive and expensive. Gas hydrate production and CDI are new technologies that show promise but have not yet been widely adopted and the typical cost of seawater desalination from different technologies is depicted in Table 13.1  .  13.9 Desalination of seawater—a step towards sustainable development Implementation of desalination technologies also poses challenges, particularly regarding environmental impacts and energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to consider the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the development and implementation of desalination technologies. Wastewater treatment is essential for achieving SDGs relevant to water and sanitation. A key global challenge of the sustainable  development goals is water scarcity, which has been expressly defined as such (SDGs). Desalination technologies have the potential to play a significant role in addressing water scarcity; advances in desalination technologies have led to the development of more energy-efficient and cost-effective methods, making desalination a more viable option for addressing water scarcity. For several sustainable development objectives, including those pertaining to food security, health, and poverty reduction, access to adequate supplies of high-quality freshwater is necessary.44   Where SDG 3 aims for the betterment of lifestyle by promoting well-being for all, SDG 6 focuses on the availability of potable water and its sustainable management while focusing on sanitation for all. Properly treating wastewater helps to achieve these goals by reducing  the spread of disease and protecting water resources. In addition, SDG 9 focuses on providing resilient infrastructure while promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization with fostering innovation. SDG 14 aims to conserve the oceans, seas, and marine resources and their sustainable use. Conventional freshwater supplies are insufficient to fulfill the rising water needs since water use has been increasing at a rate that is twice as fast as the rate of population growth worldwide. Given that the oceans make upapproximately 70% of the earth’s surface, it makes sense that we should look to them as a resource to narrow downthe water supply-demand gap. Therefore, methods for desalinating seawater are required, and they are anticipated to be crucial in this regard. It is estimated that there are currently 16,000 operational desalination units existing all over the world.45   These facilities supply 95 billion liters of desalinated water daily for human consumption. Durable and sustainable water technologies can offer reasonably priced clean water by integrating tech-driven desalination technologies that employ seawater to meet local needs and assure autonomous operation and maintenance. Goal 6 of the sustainable development agenda addresses the sustainability and resilience of water sources, which are essential to human and environmental existence, in addition to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. The agenda of the 2030 year for sustainable development admits the necessity of water resources, including their critical role in better drinking water and sanitation access. Hygiene plays an important role in other development areas, including improving health, education, and poverty reduction. By making water more accessible and affordable, women and children are less likely to have to spend time and money to obtain water from unreliable sources, a responsibility that is frequently assigned to them.44–46   As a result of their improved access to water, women, children, and others may now spend more time on education and personal growth, advancing gender equality, and time spent in school. Moreover, maintaining a high drinking water standard lowers the risk of developing preventable water-related illnesses like diarrhea and cholera and promotes healthy lifestyles and well-being (SDG3). Since a reliable water supply makes it possible to use the land for agriculture in places where rainfall was previously a barrier, the availability of clean water also supports regional economic growth. Along with making settlements in remote locations more robust to the severe demand on existing freshwater supplies brought on by climate change and population growth, increased water availability enables potential entrepreneurs to sell water to homes and enterprises (SDG 8) (SDG 11& 14).10,46–48   For the sustainable development of any nation, desalination of seawater along the coastal belt and then supply to the interiors via pipeline or other means would certainly be required, which might sound impossible. Still, a slow and continued expansion while integrating with other technologies could become quite fruitful.   13.10 Conclusions and future scope In addition to the difficulties in optimizing desalination’s technological and financial components, several important societal difficulties exist. The energy consumed in desalination and the by-products it produces influence the environment. These environmental impacts require addressing several significant issues, including the energy needed for the operations, the greenhouse gas emissions, and the discharges of chemicals and saline concentration (referred to as brine) into the marine environment.48,49   To minimize the negative environmental effects of disposal and the associated financial burden, novel technologies, and approaches are required. Recent research claims that progress has been made, indicating that the brine could be transformed into beneficial compounds. It can even enhance the desalination system’s effectiveness by using hybrid systems. The process of desalination does not represent a standalone endeavor.49   It, together with other methods and approaches, is a piece of the world’s water puzzle. Here are a few examples; reuse of process water or modifying the infrastructure to accommodate extensive rainwater buffering could cater to water shortage issues. One of the biggest technological problems is making better use of the available water resources, depending on the real needs.48   Sophisticated desalination systems will be crucial and should be created in a way that allows for the best possible synchronization of production, storage, and use with the water system. In conclusion, seawater desalination is vital for providing freshwater in areas where natural freshwater resources are scarce or unreliable. However, traditional desalination methods can be energy-intensive and costly, and they can also have negative impacts on the environment. The recent advances in desalination technologies have made the process more cost-effective and environmentally friendly, but still, the process is not yet entirely sustainable. The cost analysis of desalination methods revealed that the costs of energy, infrastructure, and maintenance are significant factors that need to be considered when evaluating the feasibility of a desalination project. Treating wastewater is also important for the desalination process to be sustainable. The discharge of brine and other waste streams can negatively impact the environment, and it is important to find ways to minimize these impacts. Using renewable energy sources, including solar and wind, can also help reduce the environmental impacts along with the energy requirements of desalination. Additionally, the recovery of resources from the treated wastewater can also contribute to sustainable development. Therefore, further research and development are needed to improve desalination’s cost-effectiveness and environmental performance and related technologies to contribute to sustainable development.
