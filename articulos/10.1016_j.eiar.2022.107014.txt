                  The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) index is an aggregate performance measure of the progress of individual countries in achieving 17 SDGs covering economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Using a data-driven probabilistic approach, this study aims to model the risks associated with individual SDGs in a network setting and establish the relative importance of SDGs in predicting the aggregate SDG index. Further, SDGs are prioritized relative to their impact on the SDG index while considering the two extreme risk states of individual SDGs. ‘Clean water and sanitation’ and ‘quality education’ goals have the highest diagnostic value relative to the ‘high performance’ and ‘low performance’ state of the SDG index, respectively. The network comprising the risks associated with individual SDGs is most vulnerable to ‘quality education’, whereas ‘no poverty’ can significantly reduce the network-wide impact. Further, the two ranking schemes regarding the vulnerability and resilience potential of individual SDGs represent quite different rankings for a few SDGs, such as ‘life on land’, ‘partnerships for the goals’, ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ and others. The network model developed provides insights to policy-makers by establishing causal relationships among SDGs. For instance, ‘good health and well-being’, ‘sustainable cities and communities’, ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ and ‘partnerships for the goals’ are mutually interdependent. Similarly, other causal relations exist within the network.

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) index is an aggregate performance measure of the progress of individual countries in achieving 17 SDGs covering economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Using a data-driven probabilistic approach, this study aims to model the risks associated with individual SDGs in a network setting and establish the relative importance of SDGs in predicting the aggregate SDG index. Further, SDGs are prioritized relative to their impact on the SDG index while considering the two extreme risk states of individual SDGs. ‘Clean water and sanitation’ and ‘quality education’ goals have the highest diagnostic value relative to the ‘high performance’ and ‘low performance’ state of the SDG index, respectively. The network comprising the risks associated with individual SDGs is most vulnerable to ‘quality education’, whereas ‘no poverty’ can significantly reduce the network-wide impact. Further, the two ranking schemes regarding the vulnerability and resilience potential of individual SDGs represent quite different rankings for a few SDGs, such as ‘life on land’, ‘partnerships for the goals’, ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ and others. The network model developed provides insights to policy-makers by establishing causal relationships among SDGs. For instance, ‘good health and well-being’, ‘sustainable cities and communities’, ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ and ‘partnerships for the goals’ are mutually interdependent. Similarly, other causal relations exist within the network.

The SDGs represent a shared expression of stakeholder needs at a global level balancing economic, social and environmental development (Fonseca and Carvalho, 2019 ). “The SDGs aim to inspire the operationalization and integration of Sustainability into organizations worldwide, addressing current and future stakeholder needs and contributing to the achievement of sustainable development for society at large”  (Fonseca et al., 2020 , p. 3). The Sustainable Development Report 2021, including the sixth edition of the global SDG index and dashboards, presents the performance of individual countries against the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2021 ). The report utilizes data published by the United Nations, World Bank, several research institutions and non-governmental organizations. The sixth edition of the SDG index and dashboards summarizes current performance and trends relating to the 17 SDGs for 165 countries. Detailed methodological information is available on www.sdgindex.org . Data and statistics can help countries track their performance on the SDGs and devise strategies for achieving the goals (Sachs et al., 2021 ).  The SDGs represent different areas of public investment, including core infrastructure, water and sanitation, human capital and the environment. The SDG index, which is developed by Sachs et al. (2021) , represents an aggregate assessment of each country's performance on the 17 SDGs, giving equal weight to each goal (Requejo-Castro et al., 2020 ). An SDG index score of 0 implies the worst possible performance, whereas 100 represents the best outcome. For instance, Australia's score of 75.6 indicates that it is 75.6% of the way toward achieving the best possible outcome across the 17 SDGs. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all three dimensions of sustainable development, namely economic, social and environmental. The highest priority of every government is to mitigate the pandemic given its devastating impact on sustainable development and economic growth. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the food, energy and water (FEW) nexus and adversely affected the progress of related SDGs, including ‘zero hunger’, ‘clean water and sanitation’ and ‘affordable and clean energy’ (Yin et al., 2022 ). COVID-19 led to the worst recession since World War II, threatening the FEW nexus security. Sustainable development is threatened by limited supplies amid expanding human needs. COVID-19 has amplified the gravity of such issues. For instance, the pandemic has caused the contamination of food and water. Similarly, the resulting lockdown measures produced ripple effects on social (e.g., social unrest and unemployment), economic (e.g., disrupted supply chains and international trade), and environmental (e.g., reduction of pollution and increase of medical waste) dimensions of sustainability. COVID-19 impacted more severely those nations that were performing low in the indicators regarding well-being, such as care for the elderly, personal safety and hygiene (Thore, 2022 ). Sustainable development, including the three dimensions of economic, social and environmental sustainability, involves a process to improve livelihoods and save basic natural resources from being ruination through environmental services. This process helps to stabilize and improve the economy, environment and ecosystem of a region over time (Omri, 2020 ). An integrated set of policies for maximizing human welfare within a dynamic framework would be desirable. However, such policies can engender huge social and natural costs, thereby outweighing the benefits. It is, therefore, important to formulate sustainability objectives and policies while understanding the complex nature of interactions between nature and society. Conventional fragmented approaches are unable to capture the complexity surrounding sustainability issues (Hjorth and Bagheri, 2006 ).  The main limitation of SDG studies has been their inability to capture dependencies among the SDGs while mapping universal targets to national action plans (Biglari et al., 2022 ). Analyzing complex systems such as sustainable development requires research methods that can capture the dynamic interactions among the 17 SDGs. SDGs and related targets and indicators are mutually interdependent, thereby exhibiting both synergies (whereas the achievement of one goal improves the performance in another) and trade-offs (whereas the achievement of one goal reduces the performance in another). According to Stafford-Smith et al. (2017) , there is a need to improve the understanding and scientific resonance of future SDG-related initiatives, and there are still open issues regarding SDG performance measurements, operationalization, and interlinkages. The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are critical to attaining sustainable development. Therefore, policy-makers need to explore the possible relationships (trade-offs and complementarities) among the SDGs (Fonseca et al., 2020 ). Risk-informed decision-making in the context of sustainable development must focus on synergies and trade-offs among the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability (Aly et al., 2022 ). Dependencies between the 17 SDGs have received limited attention in the literature. The risks associated with these SDGs may manifest in the form of global catastrophic and existential threats (Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ). The SDGs challenge various stakeholders, including governments, communities and practitioners, to achieve multiple objectives through a coordinated and systematic approach. According to Gallagher et al. (2016) , learning from the FEW nexus can help policy-makers establish links between the separate SDGs. In order to effectively implement SDGs, policy-makers and practitioners seek usable knowledge, including more clarity around alternatives and decision-making processes under conditions of uncertainty and complexity. The main objective of this study is to explore dependencies among the 17 SDGs through the lens of risk science with a focus on assessing the network-wide risk associated with interdependent SDGs. Utilizing global sustainability data (Sachs et al., 2021 ), a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model is developed to capture interdependencies among the SDGs. Bayesian Networks (BNs) or Bayes Nets or BBNs, are a type of probabilistic graphical models that can effectively model problems involving risk and uncertainty across diversified application areas due to the powerful probability theory involved (de Oliveira et al., 2012 ; Lawrence et al., 2020 ; Ekici and Ekici, 2021 ; Qazi and Al-Mhdawi, 2023 ). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: A brief overview of the relevant literature is presented in Section 2. The research methodology is described in Section 3 and the results are presented in Section 4. We discuss the implications of our study in Section 5 and present conclusions and directions for future research in Section 6.  2 Literature review 2.1 Sustainable development goals The 17 SDGs can be classified into three main dimensions of sustainability, including economic (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9), social (SDGs 4, 5, 10, 11, 16, and 17) and environmental (SDGs 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, and 15) pillars (Ameli et al., 2022 ). The interdependent nature of sustainable development dimensions and the 17 SDGs is well established in the literature (González Del Campo et al., 2020 ; Kørnøv et al., 2020 ). The SDGs are described as a single integrated agenda, necessitating policy-makers to understand the implications of their strategies on interdependent SDGs (Dawes, 2022 ). Hegre et al. (2020)  posit that synergies have prevailed among all SDGs from 2000 to 2016 except ‘reduced inequalities’ (SDG 10), which has not progressed in tandem with other goals. Successful achievement of SDGs requires understanding multiple, complex interactions among the goals, including both synergies and trade-offs, for risk-informed decision-making in the context of sustainable development. According to Fonseca et al. (2020) , the change toward achieving the SDGs offers many opportunities for reinforcing rather than inhibiting itself. In particular, ‘no poverty’ (SDG 1) and ‘good health and well-being’ (SDG 3) have synergetic relationships with most of the SDGs. On the other hand, ‘responsible consumption and production’ (SDG 12) is the goal strongly associated with trade-offs. The 2030 Agenda was adopted to address several challenges and risks associated with the prosperity and well-being of all. Although the implementation of SDGs requires adopting an integrated approach, policy-makers need to prioritize SDGs based on their relative importance while planning in a resource-constrained environment (Bandari et al., 2022 ). For instance, Xiao et al. (2022)  posit that all SDGs must be equally addressed by 2030 as suggested by the United Nations, but it does not mean directing the same effort toward achieving each SDG. ‘Quality education’ (SDG 4) and ‘climate action’ (SDG 13) are the top priority goals to tap into these interaction potentials. Several studies have investigated the impact of COVID-19 on SDGs, finding that COVID-19 has significantly impacted the achievement of SDGs worldwide. Elsamadony et al. (2022)  assessed the multidimensional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SDGs and identified the five most affected goals as ‘gender equality’, ‘affordable and clean energy’, ‘decent work and economic growth’, ‘sustainable cities and communities’ and ‘responsible consumption and production’. Yin et al. (2022)  examined the impact of COVID-19 on the FEW nexus and proposed solutions for a quick recovery by focusing on SDGs 2, 6, and 7. Some key strategies to mitigate the pandemic's impact on the FEW nexus include developing relevant facilities, infrastructure and digital technologies, improving the availability of FEW and promoting community involvement. Using a cognitive map, Ameli et al. (2022)  proposed a policy response to support achieving the SDGs by taking the COVID-19 long-term implications into account. Wang and Huang (2021)  used bibliometric techniques and a meta-analysis approach to establish the impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and reported that, while the research breadth (scope) is extensive, the research depth is insufficient. A cluster analysis reveals that COVID-19 has negatively impacted the majority of SDGs, although the pandemic may also bring opportunities to some SDGs. Suitable strategies can be developed for a given economy based on its performance across the 17 SDGs. Using the case of Japan, DeWit et al. (2020)  argue that suitable strategies can help governments and local agencies protect public health and essential services, which can ultimately lead to improved resilience and sustainability. On the other hand, the failure to pursue long-term sustainability goals can cause increased inequality, opportunity costs and cascading hazards. Biglari et al. (2022)  identified ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’, ‘partnerships for the goals’, ‘decent work and economic growth’, ‘responsible consumption and production’, ‘climate action’, ‘life below water’ and ‘life on land’ as the most critical SDGs influencing overall progress toward sustainable development.  2.2 Modeling techniques for sustainable development goals Aly et al. (2022)  conducted a review of the academic literature with a focus on identifying key modeling techniques used to tackle SDG-related issues. The results show that most models explored policy changes needed to achieve the SDGs and monitor the impact of those changes. The main limitation of these models has been their inability to capture uncertainty. Nine modeling techniques are consistently used to frame and analyze SDG-related issues, namely system dynamics, agent-based modeling, BBNs, econometric models, economic models, integrated models, knowledge-based models, network models and mathematical quantitative models. Integrated modeling has been the most widely adopted approach, whereas BBNs have only been utilized in three studies out of 101. To boost the implementation of the SDGs, future modeling efforts must focus on understanding and managing the interconnections among them. Using a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) based on a recent literature review, Cernev and Fenner (2020)  identified ‘no poverty’, ‘good health and well-being’, ‘life below water’ and ‘life on land’ as foundational SDGs, critical to maintaining a healthy human and environmental resource base for the progress toward all goals. Other SDGs that can act as important leverage points include ‘climate action’, ‘quality education’, ‘zero hunger’, ‘decent work and economic growth’, ‘responsible consumption and production’ and ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’. In particular, ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ and ‘partnership for the goals’ can be considered as having a direct or indirect impact on all other goals. The synergistic interaction of all SDGs is important for achieving the goals and reducing the currently increasing levels of risk (Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ). Aguilera et al. (2011)  conducted a comprehensive literature review to explore the use of BBNs in environmental science and concluded that the potential of this robust modeling technique remains largely unexploited. Non-linear thinking, termed as systems thinking, can help understand both the sources of and the solutions to modern problems, which are not amenable to linear and mechanistic thinking. According to Hjorth and Bagheri (2006) , causal mapping-based techniques can effectively model sustainability-related issues. ‘Wicked’ problems are characterized by increased complexity and uncertainty, with a focus on multidisciplinary issues involving diverse variables and multiple stakeholders with competing objectives. Ecosystem services and sustainable development require effective modeling of these ‘wicked’ problems via BBNs. Benjamin-Fink and Reilly (2017)  provide a brief overview of BBNs in this context. BBNs provide a robust approach to analyze and interpret the complexities and interdependencies of the SDGs. For example, Requejo-Castro et al. (2020)  use a data-driven BBN approach to explore the association between SDG 6 (i.e., ‘clean water and sanitation’) and other SDGs. The SDGs seek to address issues related to the three dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental–and their governance. Ignoring the interdependent nature of different dimensions of sustainable development can lead to formulating ineffective strategies and policies.  2.3 Risk management and sustainable development The complexity of compound events has made it difficult to understand dependencies between economic, social and environmental facets of sustainability. New international frameworks on sustainability, disaster risk reduction and climate change have established ambitious targets, necessitating the adoption of effective strategies while understanding the implications of such strategies on the sustainability-disaster risk reduction nexus (Peduzzi, 2019 ). Governments and stakeholders need to adopt a rigorous risk management process to achieve sustainability in the wake of the increasing frequency and impact of natural disasters. Risk-informed decision-making can help achieve sustainability goals, with a focus on the risk-resilience-sustainability nexus. Sajjad and Chan (2019)  propose an integrated risk management approach while capturing hazard, vulnerability and resilience. The risk-resilience-sustainability nexus lens can provide insights to policy-makers regarding risk management and sustainability achievement by providing a multi-perspective and multi-objective risk management framework. Adopting such a framework can help sustain long-term development goals and overcome the shortcomings of existing risk management practices. In the context of optimizing performance across interdependent SDGs, it is important to explore alternative scenarios and perform trade-off analyses while considering systemic ‘cause and effect’ relationships across interconnected SDGs. For instance, FEW ‘nexus thinking’ can improve the theoretical and practical understanding of how risks across associated SDGs can emerge in a network setting, which in turn can lead to formulating effective strategies (Gallagher et al., 2016 ). The 17 SDGs adopted in 2015 by the UN General Assembly are required to be achieved by 2030. However, policy-makers and practitioners face imminent challenges regarding the successful implementation of SDG-related policies. Risks faced by society in the future are contingent on the development path we choose today. Many countries and communities are experiencing huge climate-related risks beyond their coping capacities. “Global evidence repeatedly points out that risk is intricately connected to ‘resilience’ – a multi-faceted concept that is closely linked to the many aspirations of the SDGs, including achieving food security, poverty alleviation, universal education and improved health and wellbeing”  (Hochrainer-Stigler et al., 2017 , p. 482).  Risk-sensitive future investment is vital for achieving progress across all facets of sustainability and related SDGs. Although several studies have emphasized the importance of risk-informed decision-making in sustainable development (Raikes et al., 2022 ; DeWit et al., 2020 ; Sajjad and Chan, 2019 ) and exploring causality among the SDGs (Biglari et al., 2022 ; Bandari et al., 2022 ; Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ), risk assessment of the SDGs in a probabilistic network setting remains underexplored. In particular, there is a need to explore dependencies among the SDGs through the lens of risk science (Aven, 2011 ; Aven and Kristensen, 2005 ; Aven and Cox Jr, 2016 ), such that the network-wide risk exposure of individual SDGs can be established to help policy-makers prioritize SDGs for resource allocation. Further, a risk-based perspective can provide insights regarding the vulnerability and resilience potential (Aven, 2011 ) of SDGs.   3 Research methodology A multi-stage methodology was adopted to achieve the research objectives of this study (see Fig. 1  ). A dataset was collected, comprising the performance scores of 165 countries on a scale of 0 to 100 across 17 SDGs and the overall SDG index for the year 2021 (Sachs et al., 2021 ). A score of 0 (100) represents the worst (best) possible performance. The dashboard included in the Sustainable Development Report 2021 (Sachs et al., 2021 ), maps the scores of individual SDGs to four categories of performance, including: green (i.e., goal achievement), yellow (i.e., challenges remain), orange (i.e., significant challenges) and red (i.e., major challenges). This study conceptualizes the risk associated with an SDG as the likelihood of not achieving the SDG and discretizes each risk into three states: high risk, medium risk and low risk. For the proposed model, the green category is classified as a ‘low risk’ state, the yellow and orange categories are merged and classified as a ‘medium risk’ state, and the red category is labeled as a ‘high risk’ state. The dataset contained some missing values, which the modeling exercise retained in the form of a fourth ‘unknown’ state to factor in risk estimate uncertainties. For the SDG index, a uniform-width discretization scheme was adopted to discretize the overall performance score into three states – high performance, medium performance and low performance - with the ‘high performance’ state representing the best performance across all SDGs on average. Such uniform-width discretization schemes have been effectively utilized in decision-making under risk and uncertainty (Ekici and Ekici, 2021 ; Simsekler and Qazi, 2022 ). The descriptive statistics of the 18 variables are presented in Table 1  . The minimum and maximum values for individual SDGs correspond to a scale of 1–3, with 1, 2, and 3 representing the low-, medium- and high-risk states, respectively. A BBN model is a network of interconnected variables (nodes) with arcs representing cause-effect relations or statistical dependencies. BBN models can be used to visualize the forward and backward network-wide propagation impact of uncertain variables (Hosseini and Ivanov, 2020 ). One of the main features of BBN models is the ability to integrate both expert judgment and historical data within a single model (Hanea et al., 2018 ). BBNs have been used across diverse application areas, including project management (Dikmen et al., 2021 ; Qazi and Dikmen, 2021 ), supply chain and logistics management (Gaudenzi and Qazi, 2021 ; Qazi, 2022 ), healthcare (Dag et al., 2016 ), disaster risk management (Lawrence et al., 2020 ) and others. This study explores the use of a data-driven BBN modeling scheme to establish connections among SDGs-related risks and prioritize individual SDGs based on their network-wide impact and diagnostic value. The Augmented Naive Bayes (ANB) algorithm is a semi-naive structure learning method based on the Bayesian Search approach (Friedman et al., 1997 ). In a Naive Bayes structure, the class variable is the only parent of all feature variables, whereas the ANB algorithm captures conditional dependence between feature variables by adding additional arcs with no limit on the number of additional connections across feature variables. The ANB algorithm can provide better estimates compared to the Naive Bayes algorithm because the feature variables are not considered independent conditional on the class variable. This study utilizes the ANB algorithm due to the above-mentioned features. The data-driven BBN modeling approach involves various steps: establishing states for individual variables, mapping a qualitative network structure and learning network parameters (i.e., probability distributions). Several software packages, such as Hugin, AgenaRisk and GeNIe, can be used to develop a BBN model (Cox et al., 2018 ; Simsekler and Qazi, 2022 ). Kjaerulff and Madsen (2013)  provide a detailed description of the mechanics of BBNs. Using the discretized data for the variables (see Table 1 ), a BBN model was developed in GeNIe. 2.0  (see Fig. 2  ). The BBN model was validated using the k-fold cross-validation technique (Marcot and Hanea, 2021 ). The model was able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 85.45%, which is comparable to the accuracy values reported in the literature (Qazi and Khan, 2021 ; Qazi et al., 2022 ). The diagnostic value-based assessment can be used to rank SDGs according to the prediction of an overall SDG index, from the most- to the least-informative SDG. This ranking scheme utilizes an information-theoretic measure known as cross-entropy and expresses, for each SDG individually, the expected reduction in entropy of the probability distribution over a specific state of the SDG index node after observing an individual SDG. Cross-entropy is a utility-free measure of the value of information and provides useful information about the significance of feature variables in predicting the value of a target variable (Delen et al., 2020 ). The results of the modeling exercise and sensitivity analysis are discussed in the next section.  4 Results and interpretations The BBN model (see Fig. 2 ) represents direct cause-effect relations between the SDG index (target variable) and individual SDGs (feature variables), and also illustrates other direct and indirect causal relations within the network. For instance, ‘quality education’ influences ‘sustainable cities and communities’, which in turn impacts ‘partnerships for the goals’. ‘Partnerships for the goals’ influence ‘good health and well-being’, which influence both ‘zero hunger’ and ‘no poverty’. Therefore, ‘quality education’ is both directly and indirectly associated with multiple SDGs. Similar relations are observed for many SDGs, including ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’, ‘climate action’, ‘sustainable cities and communities’, ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’ and others. Mapping such a network implies the significance of key SDGs, which can directly or indirectly influence network-wide performance. The bar chart displayed for each SDG represents the associated risk-based probability distribution across 165 countries. For instance, ‘zero hunger’ is considered a critical SDG based on the highest level of associated risk. On the other hand, ‘quality education’ seems a relatively less critical SDG based on the lowest probability of its ‘high risk’ state (i.e., 20.6%). In terms of the SDG index, around 73 countries are performing well on average across all SDGs, whereas 29 countries are experiencing significant challenges. The BBN model developed (see Fig. 2 ) was analyzed for the 29 countries showing low performance on the SDG index, with the results shown in Fig. 3  . On the one hand, the majority of SDGs show high risk, with ‘good health and well-being’, ‘clean water and sanitation’, ‘affordable and clean energy’, ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’ and ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ posing a serious challenge. On the other hand, Fig. 3  shows that countries with low performance on the SDG index are not particularly vulnerable to the risks associated with either ‘responsible consumption and production’ or ‘climate action’. The BBN model developed in Fig. 2  was also analyzed for countries with high performance along the SDG index, with the results shown in Fig. 4  . In this case, the majority of SDGs show a medium risk, with ‘life on land’, ‘responsible consumption and production’ and ‘climate action’ suggesting a significant level of risk of non-achievement. Alternatively, ‘affordable and clean energy’, ‘no poverty’ and ‘quality education’ pose a relatively low level of vulnerability to network-wide performance. The SDGs were ranked based on their diagnostic value in predicting a certain state of the SDG index (see Figs. 5   (a), (b), and (c)). The ranking is based on cross-entropy (Delen et al., 2020 ; Bayesfusion, 2017 ), which measures the expected reduction in entropy of the probability distribution of the SDG index after observing the value of individual SDGs. Among the diagnostic assessments for individual states of the SDG index, the minimum values were observed for the ‘medium performance’ state (see Fig. 5  (b)), implying a low predictive ability of SDGs in this case. ‘Clean water and sanitation’, ‘no poverty’ and ‘sustainable cities and community’ SDGs are most useful for predicting the ‘high performance’ state of the SDG index. Similarly, ‘quality education’ and ‘no poverty’ are the most critical SDGs in predicting the ‘low performance’ state of the SDG index. On the other hand, ‘life on land’ and ‘life below water’ are found to be the least critical SDGs. A sensitivity analysis (Qazi and Khan, 2021 ) was performed to establish the impact of different risk scenarios on sustainable development. First, the network-wide impact of the worst possible risk-based state of individual SDGs was assessed (see Fig. 6   (a)). ‘Quality education’ is the most critical SDG that can impact the overall performance of countries in sustainable development, but ‘no poverty’ and ‘affordable and clean energy’ are also very important. On the other hand, ‘responsible consumption and production’ and ‘climate action’ are found to be relatively less critical SDGs. Second, the network-wide impact of the best possible risk-based state of individual SDGs was assessed (see Fig. 6  (b)). ‘No poverty’ can significantly reduce network-wide risk exposure, and ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ are also quite critical for improving network-wide resilience. On the other hand, ‘responsible consumption and production’ and ‘climate action’ remain the least critical SDGs. Although ‘climate action’ and ‘responsible consumption and production’ are considered critical SDGs in the literature (Bandari et al., 2022 ; Rubtsov et al., 2021 ; Kumar et al., 2021 ; Phillips et al., 2020 ), the results of this study reveal that these SDGs can be prioritized after achieving other SDGs. The ‘sand cone’ model considers manufacturing performance as cumulative and sequential, with quality performance forming the foundation (Schroeder et al., 2011 ). Similarly, there are ‘layers’ of sustainability as a country develops toward full achievement of the SDGs and ‘no poverty’ seems to be the very foundation of the sustainable development ‘sand cone’. The two ranking schemes of the SDGs were analyzed relative to their positive and negative impact on the overall SDG index (see Table 2  ). ‘No poverty’ and ‘affordable and clean energy’ were identified as important SDGs in both ranking schemes, while ‘responsible consumption and production’, ‘climate action’ and ‘life below water’ seemed relatively less critical SDGs in both schemes. The ranking of some SDGs differed significantly between the two schemes, such as ‘quality education’, ‘reduced inequalities’, ‘life on land’ and ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’.  5 Discussion and implications The proposed network-based mapping of risks associated with sustainable development (see Fig. 2 ) provides insights regarding the importance of individual SDGs while considering their corresponding risk distribution. Several SDGs, including ‘zero hunger’, ‘good health and well-being’, ‘clean water and sanitation’ and ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’, are associated with high risk of non-achievement. On the other hand, a few SDGs, such as ‘quality education’ and ‘no poverty’, are exposed to low risk of non-achievement. Similarly, mapping of risk distributions related to high- and low-performing countries in sustainable development can help identify critical SDGs related to a certain country based on its unique circumstances (see Figs. 3 and 4 ). Such a representation of probability distributions across interconnected SDGs can help policy-makers identify critical SDGs based on the entire distribution rather than average-based point estimates, as has been criticized in the risk science literature (Qazi and Khan, 2021 ; Aven, 2020 ). The methodology adopted in assessing the SDG index assigns the same importance weight to all 17 SDGs (Sachs et al., 2021 ). However, the results of this study reveal that all 17 SDGs are not equally important in predicting the outcome of the SDG index. For instance, the diagnostic values of SDGs regarding the SDG index are quite different, implying certain ‘high-value’ SDGs can be more useful in predicting the true state of the SDG index compared to other ‘low-value’ SDGs. For instance, ‘clean water and sanitation’ and ‘quality education’ have the highest diagnostic value corresponding to the high- and low-performance states of the SDG index, respectively (see Figs. 5  (a) and (c)). The prioritization of SDGs based on their diagnostic value can help decision-makers focus on critical SDGs and establish better forecasts for related indicators. The proposed modeling approach can help identify critical SDGs based on their network-wide risk exposure while considering the vulnerability and resilience potential of individual SDGs. Such an analysis can guide policy-makers regarding optimal resource allocation schemes. For instance, the results indicate that ‘quality education’ has the highest vulnerability potential (see Fig. 6  (a)), implying any increase in the risk associated with this SDG can significantly increase the network-wide risk. On the other hand, ‘no poverty’ has the highest resilience potential (see Fig. 6  (b)), necessitating suitable strategies to help reduce the risk related to ‘no poverty’. The proposed modeling approach captures uncertainty about risk assessments, which improves its utility in the case of missing values across different indicators. The ‘unknown’ state represents missing values for individual SDGs, such as ‘life below water’, ‘no poverty’, ‘quality education’ and others (see Fig. 2 ). The results of the two ranking schemes provide the relative importance of individual SDGs for resource allocation (see Table 2 ). Since the network model developed aggregated country-level data across 165 countries, the results can be used by international organizations to prioritize strategies across regions representing high- and low-risk levels. The proposed modeling approach (see Fig. 1 ) can be used to prioritize SDGs for a certain country or a state while updating the model with the unique dataset. The relative impact assessment of individual SDGs (see Figs. 6  (a) and (b)) can be used as the percentage allocation estimates of resources across the SDGs. The results of this study also substantiate the findings of other studies. For instance, Dawes (2022)  concluded that globally four SDGs, including ‘responsible consumption and production’, ‘climate action’, ‘life below water’ and ‘life on land’ are most at risk of non-achievement. Similar inferences, in particular, about ‘life on land’ and ‘life below water’ can be made based on the model developed (see Fig. 2 ). However, a few other SDGs were found to be more critical than ‘responsible consumption and production’, such as ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’. These differences in findings are attributed to mapping entire distributions for risks associated with SDGs in this study. Cernev and Fenner (2020)  identified ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ and ‘partnership for the goals’ to have a direct or indirect impact on all other goals. The proposed model (see Fig. 2 ) substantiates the importance of these SDGs based on their (direct and indirect) connectivity across the network. Moreover, ‘no poverty’, ‘good health and well-being’ and ‘life on land’, which are identified as foundational SDGs (Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ), do seem to be critical SDGs based on the proposed model shown in Fig. 2 . According to Ameli et al. (2022) , there are five economic (i.e., ‘no poverty’, ‘zero hunger’, ‘good health and well-being’, ‘decent work and economic growth’ and ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’), six social (i.e., ‘quality education’, ‘gender equality’, ‘reduced inequalities’, ‘sustainable cities and communities’, ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ and ‘partnerships for the goals’), and six environmental SDGs (i.e., ‘clean water and sanitation’, ‘affordable and clean energy’, ‘responsible consumption and production’, ‘climate action’, ‘life below water’ and ‘life on land’). The proposed modeling approach can be used to classify the model developed into three SDG risk clusters, namely economic, social and environmental risks. Such a classification scheme can help understand the risks associated with the three dimensions of sustainability and formulate suitable risk mitigation strategies. This, in turn, can help bridge the research gap about understanding and managing the interconnections between the SDGs (Aly et al., 2022 ). This study has made two unique contributions to the literature on sustainable development. First, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to map causal relations among risks associated with individual SDGs in a probabilistic network setting. Second, this study proposes and operationalizes a data-driven approach to establish the relative importance of SDGs based on their network-wide risk exposure. This study also provides an opportunity for researchers to explore mapping interconnected SDGs through the lens of risk science (Aven, 2012, 2016a, 2016b, 2017 ). Several studies have explored dependencies among the SDGs (Dawes, 2022 ; Bandari et al., 2022 ; Ameli et al., 2022 ; Requejo-Castro et al., 2020 ; Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ), but this study provides a new perspective of mapping risk-based assessments of SDGs in a probabilistic network setting while capturing related uncertainties and cause-effect relationships.  6 Conclusions Utilizing the country-level data for risk-based performance against 17 SDGs, this study adopted a data-driven probabilistic approach to explore causal relations among the SDGs and establish the relative importance of individual SDGs while capturing their mutual dependencies. The causal network model developed indicated the interdependent nature of SDGs, in addition to their direct impacts on the aggregate SDG index, causing serious concern about the simple average-based aggregation scheme adopted in the SDG index calculation. Some SDGs, such as ‘good health and well-being’ and ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’ were found to have a direct and indirect causal dependency with multiple SDGs across the network. The low performance of countries on the overall SDG index was attributed to high risk across multiple SDGs, including ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’, ‘zero hunger’, ‘good health and well-being’, ‘clean water and sanitation’, ‘affordable and clean energy’ and ‘industry, innovation and infrastructure’. On the other hand, countries with high performance in terms of the SDG index were able to effectively mitigate the risks associated with multiple SDGs, including ‘no poverty’, ‘quality education’, ‘affordable and clean energy’ and ‘sustainable cities and communities’. The predictive ability of individual SDGs relative to the SDG index was assessed by calculating corresponding diagnostic values. ‘Clean water and sanitation’ and ‘quality education’ have the highest diagnostic value relative to the ‘high performance’ and ‘low performance’ state of the SDG index, respectively. The overall impact of individual SDGs on the overall SDG index was assessed relative to the best and worst risk-based scenarios of individual SDGs. The network comprising the risks associated with individual SDGs is most vulnerable to ‘quality education’, whereas ‘no poverty’ can significantly reduce the network-wide impact. On the other hand, ‘climate action’ and ‘responsible consumption and production’ were found to have the minimum impact on the entire network. This study has certain limitations. The sensitivity of the results has not been analyzed for different discretization schemes and algorithms. Various indicators and factors impacting SDGs have not been exclusively modeled. Risk mitigation strategies that can help achieve SDGs and improve economic, social and environmental sustainability have not been captured in the model. The SDG index relies on available data from several publicly accessible sources, encompassing all member states of the United Nations. SDG scores may not be reliable for some countries due to missing or inaccurate data. Future research can benefit from modeling dependencies among indicators and factors associated with the SDGs. Further, a longitudinal study can be conducted to capture and manifest the dynamic nature of sustainability-related risks. The use of expert judgment can help refine the causal network structure of interdependent SDGs. The sensitivity of results can be assessed against various algorithms and discretization schemes for the risk states. A comprehensive causal network, including risks associated with economic, social and environmental sustainability and potential risk mitigation strategies, can be developed using both expert judgment and historical data. The impact of COVID-19 on sustainable development can be assessed by developing and comparing two BBN models using the pre- and post-COVID sustainability data.
