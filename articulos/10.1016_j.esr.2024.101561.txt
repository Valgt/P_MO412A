                  The drivers of renewable energy production significantly impact the behavior of the renewable energy market, particularly through their vulnerability to climatic adversity. Physical and transition hazards associated with climate change threaten renewable energy-producing facilities. Current U.S. frameworks addressing climate resilience may require revision, as evidenced by the failure to achieve Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7). This study focuses on integrating climate risk factors into strategies to fully realize the market potential for renewable energy. From August 1, 2014, to July 6, 2023, we controlled for weather hazard variables to examine the impact of renewable energy return sources on the market values of renewable energy. Using multiple quantile-on-quantile extrapolation and cross-measure association, we found that climate risk elements, such as natural catastrophes (physical hazards) and uncertainties in climate policy (transition hazards), reduce the impact of returns on market drivers for renewable energy. The proposed climate resilience-oriented strategy framework aims to advance the achievement of SDG 7 b y internalizing physical and transition climate risk elements.

Global policymakers are striving to find sustainable solutions to the issues posed by global warming driven by economic growth while also addressing the increasing need for energy. Investment in renewable power production from both private and governmental sources is seen as a viable approach to this challenge. The adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in early 2005 marked a significant turning point, leading to rapid growth in the renewable energy sector ( Olabi &amp; Abdelkareem, 2022 ). By 2008, investments in renewable energy outpaced those in fossil fuel-based alternatives. However, the ambitious renewable energy targets set at the COP26 Summit face financial obstacles. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has emphasized the need for funding from regional, national, and international sources, including both public and private sectors, to support initiatives aimed at mitigating and adapting to global warming.    item S2211-467X(24)00270-0 S2211467X24002700 1-s2.0-S2211467X24002700 10.1016/j.esr.2024.101561 280851

Handling editor: Mark Howells The drivers of renewable energy production significantly impact the behavior of the renewable energy market, particularly through their vulnerability to climatic adversity. Physical and transition hazards associated with climate change threaten renewable energy-producing facilities. Current U.S. frameworks addressing climate resilience may require revision, as evidenced by the failure to achieve Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7). This study focuses on integrating climate risk factors into strategies to fully realize the market potential for renewable energy. From August 1, 2014, to July 6, 2023, we controlled for weather hazard variables to examine the impact of renewable energy return sources on the market values of renewable energy. Using multiple quantile-on-quantile extrapolation and cross-measure association, we found that climate risk elements, such as natural catastrophes (physical hazards) and uncertainties in climate policy (transition hazards), reduce the impact of returns on market drivers for renewable energy. The proposed climate resilience-oriented strategy framework aims to advance the achievement of SDG 7 b y internalizing physical and transition climate risk elements.

Investment in renewable power production from both private and governmental sources is seen as a viable approach to this challenge. The adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in early 2005 marked a significant turning point, leading to rapid growth in the renewable energy sector [1 ]. By 2008, investments in renewable energy outpaced those in fossil fuel-based alternatives. However, the ambitious renewable energy targets set at the COP26 Summit face financial obstacles. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has emphasized the need for funding from regional, national, and international sources, including both public and private sectors, to support initiatives aimed at mitigating and adapting to global warming. The COP26 discussions underscored the urgent need for financially viable systems that support the achievement of renewable energy goals and the transition to clean energy. This study aims to assess the impact of green finance, particularly carbon credits and green bonds, on the total generation of renewable energy. It is expected that streamlining finance allocation for climate initiatives and promoting equitable growth will enhance renewable energy production. However, the actual impact of these green financing mechanisms on renewable power generation remains uncertain [2 ].Previous studies have highlighted this issue. For example (Y [3 ]),discussed the economic viability of renewable energy projects in light of unexpected climate conditions (A. K et al., 2023). examined weather hazards in the electricity industry, while [4 ] evaluated global economic markets concerning climate risks from both physical and transition hazard perspectives. The 2022 Weather Assessment by Ref. [5 ] pointed out the lack of strategic planning at the corporate level, hindering research and development efforts in renewable energy production. Additionally, a recent Deloitte report emphasized the need for robust leadership in addressing climate concerns and promoting investment in energy innovations. The United States of America (USA) has been known for its persistent commitment to addressing climate change. Since President Bill Clinton took charge, the United States' political position on climate change has been uncertain and susceptible to change. Following the passage of the historical climate bill, the Joe Biben United States administration recently secured oil contracts, putting doubt on the possibility of climate change [6 ]. According to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (2017), companies involved in renewable energy production face two types of risk: physical concerns and transition concerns. Firms' climatic response can be better understood with an extensive knowledge of these two types of risk. Short-term and long-term risk elements are discussed in physical concern, but regulatory, technological advancement, economy, and reputation-related risks are all part of transition concerns. While physical concerns are region-dependent, transition concerns will increase uncertainty regarding the context of climate policy [7 ]. So, natural disasters' physical concern elements will be observed in the near term, but transition concern components caused by climate policy uncertainty will likely be felt soon. When considering the ongoing climate resilience gaps in the US, it is important to consider either of these possibilities [2 ]. The financial growth of renewable energy generating projects has become more challenging due to increased natural disasters and domestic issues in climate rules [8 ]. Additionally, it is reducing the potential for energy-related R&D initiatives. The United States' failure to meet its targets for SDG 7 in 2021 illustrates this (United Nations, 2022). Improving the United States' ability to generate affordable and reliable energy at home necessitates incorporating climate risk issues into new policy frameworks and increasing renewable energy sources [9 ]. To realize their full potential in light of climate change, the renewable energy components must be redirected throughout the design phase of this policy structure. The main contribution of this research's policy purpose is as follows:• The American government has set carbon neutrality as a key policy goal and achieving renewable energy initiatives is essential for achieving this goal. Consequently, by completing our research objective, we can create a policy structure that considers climate risk variables and finds the mechanisms of renewable energy production that have the desired effect. According to Ref. [10 ], renewable energy production projects could be at risk if American lawmakers fail to take the lead on climate change. This policy action is needed because there has been a lot of discussion about this concern [11 ]. The policy framework suggested in this research has the potential to assist in the development of climate resilience and guide policymakers in the achievement of the SDG 7 goals. Suppose the United States can fill this policy gap with a refocused policy framework. In that case, it will set an example for other countries needing help exploiting the potential of renewable energy sources.  • Additionally, this approach will be useful for creating a climate resiliency road plan to protect renewable energy production projects. This development will greatly influence the renewable energy sector, improving the investment climate for renewable energy projects. The current study adds to the policy discussion in this regard.  • Renewable energy and the factors influencing it will demonstrate the severe behaviour that climate challenges are expected to show in the market. Because of this curiosity, quantile modelling is necessary. The evaluation will follow the multivariate quantile-on-quantile regression (m-QQR) technique proposed by Ref. [12 ]. Because climate change and other natural disasters are expected to reduce the impacts of renewable energy drivers, the system model must account for these factors by including elasticities that reduce the effect. Given its bivariate requirements, the conventional quantile-on-quantile regression method proposed by (H [13 ]) cannot address this issue. By using the marginal effect strategy proposed by Farzin and Bond (2006), the m-QQR method can tackle this issue. The use of this approach will lead to the identification of new information that may improve policymaking.    The research is structured as follows in the sections that follow: Section 2  presents summary of the relevant research. In Section 3 , the economic model and data are explained. The findings from the study are described in Section 4 . Section 5  presents the research's conclusions and emphasizes its major significance.  2 Literature review 2.1 Climate change and renewable energy There have been significant positive social impacts from transitioning to renewable energy. International Energy Agency data shows that energy generation from renewable sources increased by 7 % in 2021, after an 8 % increase in the previous year (2022) [14 ]. Solar photovoltaic generators are replacing older, less effective coal-powered generators as nations attempt to reap the financial benefits of this renewable energy source. REN21 has previously reported this trend. There has been an upward trend and daily growth in the requirement for renewable energy as a major energy source within the framework of the global energy market [15 ]. Additionally, estimates show that renewable energy usage will expand significantly, from 20 % to roughly 30 %, by 2035. The renewable energy sector is vulnerable to several threats, such as geopolitical volatility, natural disasters, and uncertainty around climate and economic policies. The renewable energy sector's influence on global warming has been more apparent in recent years, coinciding with the worldwide adoption of carbon neutrality programs. Climate change has far-reaching consequences for the production of wind power, which is citing the country's renewable energy industry. This effect has been demonstrated to decrease the possibility of generating power during summertime by 40 % [16 ]. Climate change may also be the principal factor contributing to the bulk of worldwide financial losses in the energy sector, as shown by Ref. [9 ]. Catastrophic weather patterns resulting from unfavorable climate conditions might impact both the energy requirements and the stability of supply chains [17 ]. Renewable energy source incorporation and resilience energy system management are two ways that can be used to control and reduce climate change effectively. Additionally, comprehensive analyses of climate change structures can forecast the potential profitability of renewable energy sources depending on weather conditions [18 ]. highlight the importance of this data to subsequent climate change policy selections. The emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change, and renewable energy sources are essential in reducing this impact. Reducing human impact on the environment and accelerating climate change can be achieved through transitioning to renewable energy sources. The previous decade has been the warmest on record, and research shows that greater usage of fossil fuels is directly related to higher global temperatures. Without strong climate action, global temperatures are predicted to rise 1.5–2 °C by the end of this century; transitioning to renewable energy sources can stabilize these increases and reduce emissions. Recent research papers have examined how climate policy has affected the renewable energy sector [19 ].suggested a connection between energy and climate policies in regard to emissions induced by energy. Accordingly, climate policy goals are consistent with the energy conservation and renewable energy industries [20 ]. state that addressing the causes of carbon-led ecosystem changes should be the primary focus of climate change policies. To facilitate the strategic growth of systems for managing renewable energy [7 ], presented a model. According to Ref. [1 ]), carbon prices and other climate policies can help transition to renewable energy. Alternatively, research by Ref. [21 ] demonstrates that risks associated with climate change are a major component of stock price fluctuations. Climate policy changes may cause recent fluctuations in energy stock prices, according to Ref. [22 ]). The causes of energy market fluctuation are also the focus of current research. Recent studies have shown that stock market fluctuation and geopolitical risk substantially impact the energy market's instability [22 ] demonstrate how an uncertainty index could accurately forecast the actual fluctuation of renewable energy.  2.2 Green financing and renewable energy The significance of financial institutions in the marketplace for renewable power is examined in academic papers. The effects of the financial assets to deposits proportion on the production of renewable energy were examined by Ref. [23 ,24 ]looks at the effects of bank loans on the private economy [25 ]. has investigated the aspect of domestic loans to private businesses; the significance of financialization for the production of renewable power has been shown by this research. Nevertheless, expanding outside the conventional funding avenues is necessary to grow the renewable power-producing process. This leads to the second body of scholarly research that examines how green or climatic finance affects the production of renewable power. A more effective strategy is to seize the cash influx directed toward renewable power installations. A comparison of the scale and supply of green financing and green bonds may provide light on how to accomplish this goal. Green bonds are a particular kind of economic instrument in which the issuer makes a clear commitment to use the proceeds only to further alternative power projects [26 ]. The programs include a wide range of activities, including research and development projects meant to overcome technical barriers, improve power effectiveness, encourage water usage reduction and conservation, and lessen waste and contamination production. When the European Investment Bank (EIB) first issued green bonds, it was in 2007. Since its beginning in 2007, the market for green bonds has shown consistent development. From its 2007 debut of USD 1 billion to its 2019 issuance of USD 257 billion, the worldwide issuing of green bonds which involves the commercial and governmental industries at different levels, including national, municipal, and international has grown significantly. The weather bond initiative conducted a poll, the findings of which indicate that during a calendar year and by the conclusion of 2022, worldwide expenditure on green bonds is expected to double, hitting the significant milestone of one trillion dollars. Furthermore, the cost barrier associated with renewable power is effectively mitigated by increasing funding for the continued growth of renewable power systems and raising public knowledge of their significance. According to Ref. [27 ] study results, the cost of solar photovoltaics has decreased by eighty-nine and wind power by seventy percent since 2010. It is found that the costs connected with utility-scale renewable power are less than half of those involved with nuclear power and much less than those connected with gas and coal-generated power. Thus, the promotion of green finance has the potential to transform previous doubts about the scientific and financial viability of renewable power into a vital source of power for the present and future.  2.3 Research gap Research has documented the impact of green financing and global warming on the production of renewable power. When considering these effects from the standpoint of financial renewable power, it becomes clear that the climate sensitivity of renewable power production may have impacted the projects' financial method. Therefore, it is necessary to internalize the climate sensitivity of these projects in order to ensure a sustainable flow of green financing for renewable power-producing work. The United States' inability to meet the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7 necessitates the creation of a structure for weather resiliency in these kinds of initiatives, which involves studying how green financing channels behave when weather sensitivities are moderated. These hypothesized moderations likely influence the behavior of the renewable power marketplace via green financing channels. Creating a strategy structure is necessary to close this strategy gap, and the current research closes this gap by suggesting a structure for policy.   3 Data and the model 3.1 Experimental model The use of green financing channels and innovation for the growth of the renewable power sector is emphasized heavily in the COP27 discourse. The use of carbon credits as a hedging tool and possible funding source for renewable power projects is gaining popularity worldwide. However, the carbon credits are attacked for two things: (a) they are being used improperly in green washing, and (b) they are not being widely accepted. Green bonds cover the excess need for ecological funds to be used for renewable power production projects. The market for renewable power is growing thanks largely to these two green funding sources. The continued existence of a renewable power plant is now dependent on power innovation development and research. The market for renewable power is thus dependent on the anticipated profits from growing. Yet, unanticipated climate shocks and unpredictability have the potential to negatively impact the profitability of the renewable power industry and its drivers. Climate risk is a common occurrence in the development of renewable power initiatives, which reduces their investment appeal. This element has been shown globally by Ref. [28 ,29 ] has shown that unusual climate hazards may have an impact on the volatility of the renewable power marketplaces. Uncertainties in climatic strategy also influence firm-level developments aimed at creating renewable power solutions. Therefore, incorporating a potential moderating of climate risks resulting from natural catastrophes and Uncertainty surrounding climate policies may provide a more realistic picture of potential movements in the renewable energy market. Furthermore, the physical and transition risk categories are correlated with these theoretical factors. It is necessary to include these variables in the mathematical specification when growing weather resilient in order to conduct a more thorough analysis of the behavior of the renewable power marketplace and green finance patterns. These two climatic conditions may cause the green financing channels to operate differentially. Having a deeper awareness of these variations will aid in creating an investment plan for projects generating renewable power. The quantile-on-quantile (QQ) regression method is employed to analyze the impact of renewable energy returns on market values, which allows us to explore relationships across different quantiles of their distributions. These are especially suitable for capturing heterogeneity in market behavior, are insensitive to outlying observations, and help in policy making and risk analysis. Further, to appreciate the dynamic relationship between renewable energy returns and market values, we also employed multiple quantile-on-quantile extrapolation and cross-measure association techniques that extend the analysis up to individual quantiles. Disadvantages of QQ regression include requirements of data, assumption of independence, computational intensity, and interpretational issues. Nonetheless, what has been done in this study based on this methodology provides detailed risk assessment and guidance on policy frameworks that is unique and forms the guideline towards the development of sound climate change resilience for renewable energy. Assuming drivers (DR) and moderators (M), the empirical model looks like this:(1) REN t  = f ( DR t  , M t   )      DR = { RGB , RCC , INN  }      M = { ND , CPU  }      INN = Returns on Innovation of Energy. CPU = Climate Policy Uncertainty. RCC = Returns on Credits Carbon. RGB = Returns on Green Bonds.N D = N a t u r a l  D i s a s t e r s .     t = Study period.R E N = R e t u r n s  o n  R e n e w a b l e  E n e r g y  P r i c e s .      Moderator M will follow additional and multiplication associations with DR. As it relates to any member of DR, it will guarantee that M is present in the elasticity of REN. This will assist in identifying the members of M's moderating duties. Eq. (1)  may be expressed as the first-order separation of under the jth member of M's moderation, the bordering influence of takings on the ith renewable power production returns and drivers on the renewable energy prices.(2) ∂ REN t  / ∂ DR i , t   = f ′  ( DR i , t   , M j , t    )  , ∀ i , j      According to the criterion given in Equation (2)  the projected impact of drivers is dependent on how big Mat time t is. This magnitude, however, is going to change throughout time and may exhibit severe behavior. The effects will be represented by a X qxq     matrix, in which the values are dispersed along q quantiles across time t. To estimate the X qxq     matrix, back dependency among the sequences will be assumed. This hypothesis is supported by the way the series behaves in very cold climates. For an estimate (Y [30 ]), Regression Multivariate Quantile-on-Quantile will be used. This technique is a multivariate expansion of [31 ] quantile-on-Quantile Regression methodology. Following [32 ], the m-QQR approach may take the moderating effects into account using marginal impact modeling. It is hypothesized that there is a quantile distribution in the renewable energy returns and pricing. The following may be used to define, based on the renewable energy return-producing drivers and facilitators, the ρth  quantile of sustainable power prices:(3) R EN t  = β ρ  ( DR t  )  + ∑ m  α ρ  ( M t  )  + ∑ m  γ ρ  ( DR t  ∗ M t   )  + ϵ ρ       In this case, the null ρ-quantile's stochastic error is i. i.d. [≈(0, 1)]. REN represents the matrix of renewable energy return-producing drivers, which is called returns on prices of renewable energy, or DR. The medium of m arbitrators is denoted as the M moderated equation.(4) REN t  = ( β ρ  + ∑ m  γ ρ  M t   )  DR t  + ∑ m  α ρ  ( M t  )    + ϵ ρ      REN t  = δ ρ  ( DR t  )  + ∑ m  α ρ  ( M t  )  + ϵ ρ      δ ρ  ( . )     Since it is unclear how moderation would affect the DR is left undetermined in Equation (4) . Equation (4)  must be examined for DRφ  to evaluate the influence of the φth  quantile of returns of renewable energy generating REN's ρth  quantile drivers DR φ    . Therefore, the following is the first-order Taylor extension of δ ρ  ( . )    :(5)  δ  ρ  ( DR t  )  ≈ δ ρ  ( DR τ  )  + δ ρ ′   ( DR φ  )  ( DR t  − DR φ   )      Whereas DR φ     is indexed exclusively in φ, δ ρ  ( DR φ  )    , and δ ρ ′   ( DR φ  )     are placed in φ and ρ index. Similarly, the Taylor expansion of the first order γ ρ  M t     indicates that γ ρ  ( M φ  )     and γ ρ ′   ( M φ  )     are likewise indexed in ρ and φ. δ ρ  ( DR φ  )     and δ ρ ′   ( DR φ  )     can stay denoted as δ 0  ( ρ , φ  )     and δ 1  ( ρ , φ  )    , considering the layered operations of β ρ     and γ ρ  M t    . Changing them out in Equation (4)  yields:(6) REN t  = δ 0  ( ρ , φ  )  + δ 1  ( ρ , φ  )  ( DR t  − DR φ   )  + ∑ m  α ( ρ )  ( M t  )     ⏟  ( ∗ )   + ϵ ρ      δ 0     and δ 1     are indexed in ρ and φ, and ( ∗ )    constituent of Equation. (6)  Indicates REN's ρth  quantile, derived from DR's φth  quantile. As a result, ( ∗ )    illustrates the complete reliance between REN and DR. Additionally, the impacts of unexplained moderations are taken into account by the ( ∗ )    component of Equation (4) . In this way, Equation (6)  may be written as:(7) REN t  = β 0  ( ρ , φ  )  + β 1  ( ρ , φ  )  ( DR t  − DR φ   )  + ∑ m  { γ 0  ( ρ , φ  )  + γ 1  ( ρ , φ  )  ( M t  DR t  − M φ  DR φ   )   }  + ∑ m  α ( ρ )  ( M t  )     ⏟  ( ∗ )   + ϵ ρ       Here, the moderated effect of DR on REN is captured by the ( ∗ )    portion of Equation (7) . To evaluate Equation (7) , the optimization problem may now be expressed as follows:(8) min β 0  , β 1 ,   γ 0  , γ 1    ∑ q  ξ ρ  [ REN t  − β 0  − β 1  ( DR t  ˆ  − DR ˆ  φ   )  − ∑ m  { γ 0  + γ 1  ( M t  DR t   ˆ  − M φ  DR  ˆ  φ   )   }  + ∑ m  α ( ρ )  ( M t  )     ]  K ( F q  ( DR ˆ  t  )  − ρ  x  )       Now, DR ˆ  t  ,   DR ˆ  φ    , M t  DR  ˆ  t    , and M φ  DR  ˆ  φ     are the assessed quantities of DR t    , DR φ    , M t  DR t    , and M φ  DR φ    , correspondingly. ξ ρ     Must be handled in order to get the regression coefficients, to determine the weight of DR ˆ  φ     over the neighborhood of x bandwidth, Gaussian Kernel K ( . )     is constructed, taking into account the local effect of DR's φth quantile. The following graphic illustrates the distinction between DR ˆ  t     and DR ˆ  φ    :(9) F q  ( DR ˆ  t  )  = 1 q  ∑ b = 1  q  I ( DR ˆ  b  < DR ˆ  t   )      At x = 0.05, estimation bias is at its lowest.  3.2 Data description Global carbon credits return S&P Green Bond Index, S&P Global Clean Power Index, IHS MARKIT, and Wilder Hill Novel Power worldwide. As a result, the Innovation Index determines the carbon credits and return of green bonds, renewable energy pricing, and energy innovation. The whole impact caused by natural catastrophes is expressed in US dollars. The information has been accessible throughout the whole period of the USA's unfavorable weather occurrences. According to the daily statistics for this variable, the total amount of damage sustained during the event was distributed evenly across its whole length. For instance, the damage per day is computed as D/X (in dollar terms) if a natural catastrophe has an effect that endures for X days, and the overall incurred is D (in dollar terms). This estimate is made with the assumption that a disaster's aftermath may worsen or become better. Furthermore, it is also contingent upon structural and topographical elements peculiar to that province or area. As a result, the distribution of each disaster's effect will always be different. It might be possible to average the effects across time by supposing a uniform allocation of the consequences. To allocate tail numbers, the dispersion has been purposely not normalized since there is insufficient data to pinpoint the impact extremes for various locations within a given time frame. Finally, the Weather Policy Uncertainties Index is used to quantify the ambiguity surrounding weather strategy. Daily information from the US from August 1, 2014 until July 06, 2023, is used in the research. Table 1   presents the information's description data. The removal of the null hypothesis in the two different Jarque-Bera and ARCH-LM tests confirms the lack of regularity and homoskedasticity in the predictive parameters. The findings of skewness and kurtosis suggest that the variables may exhibit asymmetrical characteristics. Fig. 1   shows the variables' kernel density ranges, which rule out the potential of their leptokurtotic dispersion. Figs. 2 and 3    show the time-dependent correlation between the variables to verifying their distributional features. The 30-day rolling window correlation analyses in Fig. 2  and the dynamic conditional correlation analyses in Fig. 3  both demonstrate a potential tail dependence between the variables by showing frequent changes in the correlation values' directions. Methods based on quantiles are allowed.   4 Results and discussion Two moderators are included in the empirical framework that will be examined in this study. Therefore, moderators' exogeneity should be carefully considered. The moderating variables are likely to be exogenous if the Wu-Hausman and Durbin-Wu-Hausman analyses' null assumptions are rejected. All of the results may be seen in Table 2  . The challenge of multicollinearity can arise in an empirical context with several variables. Table 3  , a testament to the robustness of our study, showcases the findings of the variance inflation factor (VIF), which unequivocally indicates the absence of multicollinearity in the data points. Table 4   shows findings from the quantile autoregressive unit root analysis [33 ]. At a particular level, the return value series is static, but at greater quantiles, the moderating factors are stationary. Finally, Table 5   shows that the variables are associated with each other by a quantile cointegration analysis conducted by Ref. [34 ]. Thus, the empirical approach can proceed. 4.1 Estimation of cross-quantile relationship The cross-quantile correlation put out by (Y. W [35 ]) is followed in the analysis of the quantile dependency between the drivers and the production of renewable power. The strength of the dependency structure is shown by the quantile arrangements, while the measure dispersion of the model variables' low to high intensity ranges from 0.05 to 0.95. Figs. 4–6     provide the estimated results. The heat maps' color spectrum explains the relationships' intensity as well as orientation (favorable) or unfavorable). Quantiles of returns on the prices of renewable power are shown on the horizontal axis in all graphs, while quantiles of the drivers are displayed on the vertical axes. The estimated results will be given in the sections that following paragraph. Fig. 4  illustrates the correlation between the pricing of renewable power and the returns on carbon credits for all quantile configurations. However, it has been discovered that in high-quantile arrangements, the association's strength is weaker. The findings indicate that there is a steady decline in correlated strength between the returns on carbon credits as one move from lower to higher quantiles. Conversely, a steadily increasing correlational strength is seen in the slow quantile evolution of profits on the cost of renewable energy, and this strength persists up to the carbon credit mean quantiles of returns. Carbon credits illustrate that they are not able to increase the production of renewable power, particularly when the carbon credit return is substantial. It may also be a sign of the low adoption of carbon credit rates in renewable energy financing production. Although carbon credits have a low worldwide penetration rate, a McKinsey & Company evaluation study on the worldwide carbon credit market notes that carbon credits are necessary to meet net-zero targets. A pre-COP27 brief from Ref. [36 ] outlines a course that the nations must take in order to realize the benefits of the market for carbon fully. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate a need for more funding for the development of renewable power projects. Fig. 5 's heat map provides a solution to this void. It has been discovered that there is a growing association between the pricing of the study and the relationship between renewable energy and the financial gains from green bonds across various quantile combinations, ranging from low to high. It is also evident that this strength gradually increases from the middle to the green bond market's strong quantile returns. This finding suggests that green bonds have a high penetration rate as a climate-friendly financing option for the development of renewable power installations. The power and potential of green bonds in climate adaptation have been shown by current research on the topic of sustainable bonds in the Asia-Pacific region conducted by Standard & Poor's Worldwide Rating. During the COP27 Summit, the Global Economic Forum also emphasized the many facets of improving the performance of green bonds. These talks suggest that regulations to address renewable energy and financially sustainable demand initiatives are needed for generating projects since the power of the connection has yet to extend to the impending stage. While the financing for renewable power-generating projects is increasing, power innovation initiatives have yet to reach the necessary speed. The heat map shown in Fig. 6  illustrates the poor relationship between returns on power innovation and pricing for renewable power across quantile configurations. The overall strength is still modest, even if there is some substantial strength in the middle quantiles of energy innovation return and the highest quantiles of taking on the cost of renewable energy. It is a sign of the failure of energy innovation initiatives to enhance the amount of renewable energy produced. The potential influence of power innovation has been constrained by the time lag between fund collection and technology progress, the challenges associated with quantifying input and output, evaluating direction, and the persistence of policy lacunae [37 ]. has also recognized these problems in evaluating the unintended consequences of power innovation. The hazards noted by Ref. [38 ] are evident in the national and local markets, according to recent research conducted by the Energy Agency of the United Nations. Nonetheless, the analysis also reveals an increase in countercyclical energy spending and a steady advancement in energy policy. These new measures should internalize the Uncertainty surrounding domestic strategy and the growing price of capital. In a dynamic financial context, it may be improbable that the Ceteris Paribus requirement holds, as assumed in the examination of these connections. A number of negative circumstances may affect the potential connections among the drivers of renewable energy and its returns on investment, hence reducing the potential effects of these drivers. From the standpoint of adding inclusiveness and robustness to the updated policy structure, it is necessary to reveal these implications. The next paragraph will examine these correlations.  4.2 Estimation of partial cross-quantile relationship Negative weather circumstances have the potential to alter the renewable energy behavior mover. The crucial close-external wind rapidity and subsurface for renewable energy production solar radiation might be impacted by the increase in weather sensitivity. However, natural catastrophes may hurt the production and distribution of renewable power. Natural hazards are one of the challenges on the path to financing and investments in renewable power, according to the [39 ] study on the Global Energy Transitions Outlook. It illustrates the potential for natural disasters and ambiguous climate policies to mitigate the effects of renewable power drivers. Partial cross-quantile correlation is used to reflect these muted influences. We'll talk about the outcomes for each driver individually. Figs. 7 and 8    illustrate the fractional irritated-quantile connection between takings on carbon credits and pricing for renewable energy in the context of natural catastrophes and uncertainties around weather strategy. Fig. 7 's heat map demonstrates how the correlation's intensity decreases and how different quantile combinations exhibit negative correlations. These unfavorable connections, which range from low to elevated quantile combinations, suggest that the link between profits from carbon offsets and profits from the cost of renewable energy may be adversely affected by uncertainties in climate policy. Regarding the detrimental effects of Uncertainty around climate legislation and solar power generation in Europe, this conclusion is consistent with the findings of [40 ]. In the case of Sweden [41 ], also discovered comparable evidence for the climate policy uncertainty fifth assessment report. The [42 ] research demonstrates how carbon credits are vulnerable to unpredictability in weather strategy. The degree of effect varies when natural catastrophes are present, even when the impact behavior is unaltered. The approximations are shown in Fig. 8 . In this instance, the correlation's strength has been shown to be weaker. The perceived anomalies in the United States carbon trading marketplace render catastrophe hazard management inefficient, and these perceived problems with greenwashing may force market participants to withdraw. Furthermore, since carbon credits would be very vulnerable to natural calamities, their durability is uncertain. As a result, given the unfavorable weather, the movement of environmental funds and expenditures on renewable energy-producing projects would take some work. From the standpoint of formulating policy, this is a grave problem. Next, Figs. 9 and 10    provide the link between renewable energy return costs in a partial cross-quantile and the return of green bonds in the context of natural calamities and unclear climate policies. Fig. 9 's heat map demonstrates that although there are certain quantile groupings with negative associations, overall connection strength increases. It suggests that amid unfavorable weather circumstances, green bonds are a better option for investing. The green bond's unpredictability is also minimal in the absence of the carbon price. This is further explained by the fact that green bonds cover a larger range of projects than carbon credits do; that is, green bonds cover initiatives that have positive environmental benefits, whereas carbon credits only cover projects that reduce carbon emissions. The [43 ] study on the weather resistance evaluation of green bonds demonstrates the green bonds' feasibility as haven investments in the face of climate danger. Along these same lines, the [44 ] research has demonstrated worldwide proof of the effectiveness of green finance in the face of climate adversity. On the other hand, Fig. 10  indicates a decrease in the correlation's intensity when natural calamities are present. Despite the existence of green bonds with a focus on natural disasters, such as catastrophic bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, and natural disaster clauses, these types of loans are vulnerable to default in the event of a climate calamity. The financial viability of these instruments for switching to renewable power has yet to be examined. If these solutions aren't scaled up, their overall influence on renewable power-generating projects during natural catastrophes may be diminished. A study conducted by Ref. [45 ] at the firm level demonstrates the economic susceptibility of the firms that issue green bonds, particularly in the event of a catastrophic event. In addition [46 ], analysis highlights the reason behind the low expenditure on renewable power production projects during natural disasters, and an IMF report further elaborates on these issues. Accordingly, policymakers in the United States should continue to be concerned about ensuring a consistent flow of investments in renewable power production projects that are impacted by natural disasters. Furthermore, Figs. 11 and 12    show a partial cross-quantile correlation between returns on technological advances in energy and benefits on renewable energy costs when climate policy is volatile and natural disasters are present. Fig. 11  demonstrates that there is a minimal relationship across quantile variations, with certain quantile variations even showing negative correlations. These findings highlight the energy innovation could have been more effective in promoting renewable energy production in challenging climates [1 ]. argue that uncertainty around climate policy could lead to decreased asset prices, which could impede innovation. As the International Energy Agency (2021b) explains from an extensive policy point of view, the necessity of an appropriate institutional framework for integrating the negative climate consequences on renewable energy technology was taken up by Ref. [47 ]. Previous research by Baker and Adu-Bonnah (2008) suggests that climate uncertainty can lead to a surge in uncertainty surrounding research and development returns. The existence of natural disasters makes this already weak association even weaker even further. Fig. 12 's heatmap shows that positive connections became even less and negative correlations were even stronger. The current development of energy infrastructures in the United States shows its advanced age and lack of resilience to climate change, as pointed out by the California Energy Commission (2019). From an environmental sustainability standpoint, this is also brought up in a recent investigation by Ref. [48 ]. The current energy structure cannot address climate change, and the necessity of resilience towards unpredictable natural catastrophes has also been addressed, according to a recent statement from the White House (2023). In their analysis of the sequential increase and decrease of energy innovation in following periods of natural disasters [49 ],provide additional support for the fundamental points of this conversation. Energy innovation is slowed by natural disasters, which cut off funding for studies and development. However, policy action is required because energy infrastructure is more resistant to the effects of natural disasters, and policy is a gap in the energy policy framework of the United States of America. The cross-quantile and partial cross-quantile findings association analyses provide insight into potential relationships between earnings on renewable power costs and the profits from producing drivers for renewable energy, both in the absence and presence of natural disasters and confusion in weather strategy. Nevertheless, recommending any regulation prescriptions requires comparing these estimations' robustness to other methodology specifications. The following section will use both single and multiple quantiles on multiple quantile correlations to examine the durability of these estimations in more detail.  4.3 Estimation of quantile-on-quantile correlations It is crucial to comprehend how the type of effect differs across quantiles in addition to the association between returns on renewable power pricing and returns on the drivers of renewable energy production. Quantile-on-quantile regression is used to investigate this; the findings are shown in Figs. 13–15    . The effects will now be spoken about. The Quantile-on-quantile regression output, as seen in Fig. 13 , indicates a diminishing effect of carbon credit returns on renewable energy cost returns as quantile configurations go from lower to greater. The price returns on renewable energy from the fifth to the fiftieth quantiles show a beneficial influence. Quantile development results in the effect being reversed. Likewise, gains are seen in the fifth through fifty-fifth quantiles of the carbon credit returns; at higher quantiles, the effect becomes negative. It demonstrates that at the beginning of the deployment of renewable power, climate credits are a better financing instrument. However, their limited use in the process of generating renewable power is due to the need for the distribution of this technology. Additionally, there is a suspicion that the increased use of carbon credits is being exploited for double carbon offset or false advertising. During the COP27 Summit, the United Nations denounced this behavior. The European Parliament has taken the initiative to escalate matters further by proposing to outlaw carbon offset programs that use carbon credits. The practice of using more power from fossil fuels at the higher cost of carbon credits for renewable energy accounts for the negative effects at higher quantile groupings. Currently, the Quantile-on-quantile regression result shown in Fig. 14  indicates that returns on green bonds have a generally favorable influence on returns on the pricing of renewable power across quantile permutations. It is discovered that although the effect of returns on green bonds decreases along each of their quantiles, its effect along the returns on cost quantiles for renewable energy. It is discovered that when quantile progressions increase, so does this influence. For instance, at the lowest green bond return quantile, the effect of returns on sustainable power costs increases along the highest quantile of green bond return. Still, along the quantile of return on sustainable energy cost between the 80th and 95th quantiles, the same effect grows. It shows that green bonds are becoming a more and more popular choice among investors when funding energy efficiency initiatives. It also explains why green bonds have a larger marketplace share than carbon offsets. However, the green bond's diminishing influence at its greater quantiles suggests that its promise remains unrealized. It makes sense in light of the regulatory gap preventing the green bonds from moving forward. This problem with regard to investors is indicated in a recent Wall Street Journal article. Growing concerns over the greenwashing scandal are also hampering its expansion. This problem was originally brought to light in a previous Bloomberg research. According to the [50 ] report, the green bond market needs transparency to reach its full potential [51 ]. has examined this topic from a firm-level perspective. Finally, the QQR result shown in Fig. 15  demonstrates that returns on innovations in energy have a positive influence on returns on renewable power pricing for all quantile combinations. The result, nevertheless, indicates that the influence rises from the 55th to the 95th quantiles and falls from the returns on the pricing of sustainable electricity from the 5th to the 50th quantiles. Additionally, from the energy innovation yields quantiles ranging from the 5th to the 60th, there is a discernible decline in effects, but from the 65th to 95th quantiles, there is a rise in effects. The progressively diminishing influence of electrical power creativity between the bottom and middle quantiles of the two factors indicates that there needs to be more demand for power innovation in the early phases of green power initiatives. However, the increased potential return on investment associated with renewable power production projects may open up opportunities for power innovation. The possible paths for spreading power innovation to achieve renewable-led emissions neutrality are covered in a European Investment Bank study from recent times. The financial problems with investment in investigation and creation for power innovation in the United States were identified over ten years ago by Ref. [52 ], and the same problems were identified in an additional investigation conducted by Ref. [53 ]. As [54 ] noted, these problems are evident in the slack in the development of clean power in the United States of America [55 ]. also addressed the dynamics of outside factors in previous research, but it also addressed these concerns from the standpoint of development and research barriers.  4.4 Estimation of multivariate quantile-on-quantile correlations The external influences may moderate the QQR estimations that were covered in the preceding section. Consequently, m-QQR, or multivariate quantile-on-quantile modeling, will be used to evaluate these correlations while considering climate policy uncertainties and natural catastrophes. Next up will be a discussion of the test results. The impact of carbon credit returns on the renewable energy market in the face of ambiguous weather policies and environmental catastrophe scenarios is shown by the m-QQR outcomes displayed in Figs. 16 and 17   . For both situations, it is discovered that the effect is lessened throughout quantile variations. Under climatic strategy ambiguity, the impact of the quantiles of takings on the price of return of carbon credits and renewable energy is declining. It is discovered that after natural catastrophes, this influence is more severe. It suggests that, in the face of any climate adversity, carbon credit-based power-generating projects are not financially feasible. The operational and financial feasibility of renewable power-producing plants is affected by their susceptibility to weather conditions. Ernst & Young's Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index, in its 57th edition, addresses this topic. According to the paper, including climate risk in funding choices for renewable power might encourage the production of renewable power. The [56 ]Climate-Resilient Public-Private Partnerships are an early result of this integration. This suggests that the global mainstreaming of climate concerns into finance choices for renewable power is still in its infancy. The [57 ] research demonstrates that renewable power may not have the anticipated effect on climate-related difficulties, and limited investing prospects may be a contributing factor to this occurrence. This suggests that legislative action is necessary to fill this gap in the funding of renewable power. The influence of green bonds and renewable energy return costs under climatic strategy ambiguity, as well as usual catastrophes, is now shown in Figs. 18 and 19   , which provide the m-QQR findings. In contrast to the preceding scenario, the results demonstrate that, in the event of climate policy unpredictability, the impact on price on the renewable energy 35th to 95th quantiles of returns is greater than returns on green bonds. Even if it is less pronounced, the influence of natural catastrophes on the pricing of renewable energy is observed to increase from the 65th to the 95th quantiles. This demonstrates the potential of green bonds as an appropriate financing option for enterprises generating renewable power in the face of unfavorable weather. The increased uptake of green bonds may make this feasible. Due in part to its inter-temporal payment schedule [58 ], demonstrated that, as part of the Employed Cluster II to 5th Valuation Explosion of green bond would be a feasible investment alternative of the Interdisciplinary Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC). A thorough examination of the benefits of green bonds in comparison to conventional financial instruments has been provided by Ref. [59 ]. CEO of Weather Bonds Responsibility, Sean Kidney, recently discussed the possibility of green bonds as an effective tool for mitigating climatic hazards in a podcast. The European Bank for Infrastructure and Growth study on green bonds' weather resilience evaluation makes a nearly identical claim. To fully realize the promise of green bonds, it may need to be improved by the likelihood of greenwashing and their high cost. Policymakers may find this to be a serious worry. Finally, given climatic strategy uncertainties and natural catastrophes, the effect of returns on power technology on profits on renewable power pricing is shown by the results displayed in Figs. 20 and 21   . Given uncertainties about climatic strategy, the impact of electricity returns through the returns of quantiles on the cost of the renewable energy revolution is increasing. On the other hand, the influence increases from the 70th to the 95th quantiles and decreases from the 5th to the 65th returns on climate innovation quantiles. It demonstrates how power innovation is necessary to support the production of all levels of renewable energy, even while it is unable to reach its full potential. A situation quite similar to this one may be seen in natural catastrophes. Over the quantiles of returns on power innovation, such returns have a declining effect. Climate risk is causing a barrier to the realization of power innovation's potential, despite the fact that its importance in the process of producing renewable power is widely acknowledged. This data is supported by the latest [60 ] investigation. The [61 ] Weather Report notes that as weather hazard rises, investment opportunities for power innovation are becoming fewer. This was brought to Ref. [62 ]attention about ten years before. Power innovation initiatives must get consistent funding in order to reach their full potential, and the need for more funding in this area necessitates a shift in strategy.  4.5 Sturdiness assessment of estimations Thus far, the time domain has been used for the estimates. Other methodological applications will be used to analyze the relationships to ensure the robustness of the estimations. Thus, the frequency domain is used to perform the robustness assessment. Figs. 22–24     show the outcomes of using the wavelet coherence and partial wavelet coherence approaches. While the moderated connections are analyzed using the partial wavelet coherence approach, the unconditional correlations are analyzed using wavelet consistency. The short-run wavelet coherence results demonstrate that although carbon credits return definitely correlates with renewable energy return cost in the near term, the connection reverses over time in Fig. 22 . It shows investors do not think carbon credits are a good way to fund renewable power projects. When considering renewable power projects within the context of weather unpredictability, carbon credits are not a feasible investment option due to a noticeable lack of partial wavelet coherence in coherence findings (Fig. 22 ). The cost of renewable energy is less profitable than that of green bonds, according to the long- and short-term wavelet consistency data in Fig. 23 . Even if the relationship eventually becomes weaker, it still has a greater correlation than it does shown in Fig. 22 . The need for green bonds under weather uncertainty is shown by evidence that returns on renewable power costs lead to green bond returns evaluated using fractional wavelet consistency. On the other hand, a restricted association's existence over the medium term may indicate strategy gaps regarding the extent to which green bonds have permeated the market. Finally, the wavelet coherence findings for the short and long runs in Fig. 24  show that returns on power innovation are outpacing returns on pricing for renewable power. It explains why power innovation is necessary for initiatives generating renewable energy. The association's insufficient strength suggests that power innovation is not a viable means of advancing renewable power initiatives. The results of partial wavelet coherence demonstrate how, in times of climate unpredictability, the desire for power innovation is dampened. These results generally agree together with the quantile estimate findings, demonstrating the quantile estimates' resilience.  4.6 Summary of results Prior research on the behavior of the renewable energy sector has identified a number of significant features affected by climate risk. Hurricanes and heatwaves, for example, can significantly interrupt renewable energy supply networks, according to a study by Ref. [63 ], which in turn causes market instability. Renewable energy technology performance is significantly impacted by climate hazards, including variations in solar radiation and wind patterns [64 ], which in turn affect market volatility and investment returns. However, there are studies that contend that these risks have been reduced and the market has become more resilient due to the increasing use of modern technology like smart electricity systems and energy storage [65 ]. With this background knowledge, our research can investigate the ways in which climate risk factors influence market behavior, shedding light on the efficacy of renewable energy risk management solutions. The analysis demonstrates, in the renewable energy sector's behaviors, that carbon credits, green bonds, and energy innovation affect renewable energy production in distinct ways. Green bonds enhance renewable energy output in the more advanced periods of development, whereas carbon credits are an effective green funding channel for initiatives in the early stages. Eventually, in the process of generating renewable energy, development in energy has a beneficial impact. Results show that climate uncertainties reduce the effects of green finance and innovative energy technologies on renewable energy production, which moderates the effects on the renewable energy market. Implications of natural disasters are shown to be more acute and rapid, whereas implications of climate policy uncertainties have been determined to be more sustained. Carbon credits aren't as good of an investment prospect as green bonds. Energy innovation has less of an impact in climates that are detrimental. The findings indicate that climate risk variables change with time, whereas physical climate hazards can become more severe in the initial stages. Physical risk factors mitigate the effects of carbon credits. Regarding transition risk, green bonds are a sustainable investment alternative. However, their impact is reduced when it comes to physical risk. When both climate risk variables are considered, energy innovation declines. Two factors contribute to this: (a) the firm's physical location, which is known as the “area of innovation,” and (b) the business's ability to implement new ideas. Physical dangers and transitional hazards both affect these aspects.  4.7 Market impact and strategic recommendations It is necessary to elaborate more on the effects of green bonds, carbon credits, and power innovations on the renewable energy market, particularly in terms of market solutions. Green bonds, which support the expansion of renewable power generation in the later stages of construction, are crucial for providing a consistent supply of funding to sustain the market. This, in turn, fosters long-term growth in the renewable energy industry, boosts investor confidence, and leads to the development of sustained demand for renewable energy projects. Carbon credits that offer green funding during the pre-development stages of renewable energy projects influence market access and the potential for new projects. Carbon credits increase the number of entrants into the renewable energy market by reducing initial capital investment; however, the evolution of carbon credit prices can affect the stability of early funding. Innovations in power generation that impact subsequent stages of renewable energy production may enhance its capacity and efficiency, thereby increasing the competitiveness of renewable energy compared to conventional energy sources. This could encourage policymakers to adopt more favorable policies towards renewable energy, further promoting innovation and investment. However, climatic risks, including natural disasters and unpredictable weather patterns, pose threats to renewable energy generation and marketing. Such dependencies can disrupt supply systems, impact energy delivery, and have implications for the pricing of goods and services as well as investment. Strategic recommendations include the following: From the investor's perspective, it is advisable to utilize green bonds, carbon credits, and investments in power innovation while also considering climatic risks. Therefore, it is essential to adopt risk management techniques, such as insuring against natural disasters or using weather derivatives. Several policy tools should be employed to promote green financing, including tax incentives, subsidies, and regulatory mechanisms aimed at encouraging the issuance of green bonds and the availability of carbon credit markets. Additionally, effective measures or policies to mitigate the impact of climatic vulnerabilities on renewable energy resources need to be implemented. These might include increasing the resilience of infrastructure and facilities to extreme climate events, creating disaster alert systems for natural disasters, and conducting climate risk impact assessments when approving certain projects. Consequently, the top strategic recommendations for building innovation resilience in companies focused on renewables include investing in less weather-dependent technologies and in regions that experience comparatively low levels of climate change. Since the location of innovation activities affects an organization's attractiveness to investors and its ability to minimize disruptions, it should be a key consideration for every company. These strategic suggestions are particularly important as they clarify the study's findings related to the renewables market and offer practical recommendations to stakeholders, thereby enhancing the overall discussion of the study.   5 Conclusion and policy recommendations From August 1, 2014, to July 6, 2023, the analysis focused on the financial impact of renewable energy sources and how they affect the values of the renewable energy sector. The climate risk variables are controlled for. Techniques such as multivariate quantile-on-quantile regression and cross-quantile correlation generated the findings. A multi-stage policy structure is being developed using the study's findings. Our findings underscore the critical role of renewable energy technology improvements and falling costs in managing the negative effects of climate risk. However, it's crucial to actively manage market volatility to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Our analysis highlights the importance of an integrated approach to climate risk management in creating a renewable energy market that may survive and even prosper in extreme weather events. One key finding is that climate change provides opportunities as well as dangers to the renewable energy sector. One positive aspect is that investments and creativity in the renewable energy sector have been driven by the increasing recognition of the need for such approaches due to the increased frequency of disasters related to climate change. Investments with an extended time frame may be apprehensive in areas with less stable governance due to concerns about regulatory frameworks and possible climatic implications. Our research underscores the pivotal role of global agreements and government regulations in mitigating the adverse effects of climate threats on the renewable energy industry. A robust legal framework, with accessible incentives, is imperative for the continued growth of the renewable energy sector. 5.1 Implications for policy 5.1.1 Importance of climatic factors The study underscores the critical need to internalize concerns related to weather hazards, as renewable energy projects are particularly vulnerable to these factors. Physical and transition risks are identified as the primary climatic factors that should guide policy development. The policy framework should be phased, prioritizing the internalization of physical hazards, which directly impact renewable energy infrastructure, before addressing transition risks.    6 Phased implementation of policy framework 1. The two climate risk factors, physical and transition concerns, must be taken into account when developing the structure. The policy structure must be developed in phases, with each phase being based only on objectives. Renewable energy production infrastructure is vulnerable to physical concern factors, which must be internalized in the early stages of the policy structure. It is necessary to internalize the transition concern factors in the next stages of the policy structure after the physical concern factors have been internalized. After these risk internalization goals have been achieved, the structure's positive externalities could be improved.  2. Reliance on grid-based electricity delivery may make it easier to achieve climate resilience. Consequently, developments in renewable energy must concentrate on creating decentralized systems for generating and distributing energy that are independent of the grid. The participation of the public sector may not be enough to accomplish objectives. The government should establish people-public partnerships in order to include public support. The government can then launch a programme that promotes community ownership to ensure the long-term sustainability of renewable energy methods. With the help of the general population, we can determine the best place for establishing renewable energy structures because their vulnerability depends on geographical factors. The community-at-large has the responsibility for regularly monitoring these approaches after adoption. As a long-term infrastructure support for these solutions, it can help bring down implementation costs while also instilling a feeling of community involvement.  3. Altering renewable energy sources for fossil fuels will be essential to maintaining this aspect of the policy structure. This change is essential so that the transition risk vulnerability initiatives may supplement the physical climatic resilience initiatives. Reducing reliance on fossil fuels is an important first step towards addressing the growing demand for renewable energy. The government might achieve this goal through the use of intermediaries and commercial banks. The implementation of a Pigouvian tax, which corresponds to a company's carbon footprint, could deter companies from utilizing fossil fuels and encourage their adoption of renewable energy sources. As a result, renewable-energy-producing initiatives will grow in size and scope to meet the increased demand. An increase in the demand for renewable energy sources will make these initiatives more appealing to investors, who will then put more money into them through carbon credits and ecological bonds. Companies will be more motivated to promote energy innovation if they believe there will be an increase in renewable energy production.  4. More accessible, cost-effective, and sustainable energy solutions are possible with an increase in renewable energy production that is also more resilient to climate change. Reducing reliance on fossil fuels and constructing climate-resilient infrastructure are two ways to keep the power grid running smoothly from one generation to the next. Not only that, but it will aid in the conflict against climate change by lowering emissions. Consequently, this policy structure will aid decision-makers in steadily progressing towards the achievement of SDG 7 targets while also making indirect advancements towards the realization of SDG 13 and 8 goals.    6.1 Limitations and future research recommendations It is necessary to conduct research at the national and local levels to evaluate the moderating effects of climate hazards on the effect of renewable energy production on consumer demand for renewable energy. Renewable energy production projects' vulnerabilities to climate change could have been better understood if the analysis had included spatial considerations. However, the benchmark policy structure offered in the present research represents an aspect that should also be considered. Designing the policy structure to help other countries deal with similar challenges is essential. This research proposes a policy structure that serves as a model for future policymaking and can be adjusted to accommodate different situations. The current research contributes by demonstrating that the policy framework can be generalized. There is the possibility for additional research to be conducted on this particular aspect at a specialized level by considering the organization's analysis. There are methodological consequences for policymaking in both the short and long term with wavelet-based quantile approaches.
