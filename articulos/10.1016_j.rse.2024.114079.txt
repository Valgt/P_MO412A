                  The Sustainable Development Goals Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), equipped with the Glimmer Imager (GLI), provides high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) data across multiple spectral bands, potentially facilitating the monitoring of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study developed a denoising algorithm for the multispectral SDGSAT-1 GLI and demonstrated that its data capacity allows for the measurement of the SDG indicators 7.1.1, 11.5.2, and the achievement of target 7.3. The results indicate that (1) The denoising algorithm can effectively remove strips and salt-and-pepper noise from SDGSAT-1 GLI images, with the residual noise significantly reduced and almost little information loss. (2) SDGSAT-1 GLI data can accurately identify electrified areas at a finer spatial scale for calculating Indicator 7.1.1, compared to the traditional NASA's Black Marble Product. The findings show that highly urbanized cities exhibit a greater proportion of their population with access to electricity than underdeveloped cities. (3) SDGSAT-1 proficiently estimates economic losses resulting from non-natural disasters for Indicator 11.5.2. Changes in SDGSAT-1 NTL intensity strongly correlate with pandemic-induced economic losses, with an R2 exceeding 0.8. (4) When measuring Target 7.3 achievement, the SDGSAT-1 GLI multispectral bands classify streetlight types into light-emitting diode and high-pressure sodium lamps with acceptable overall accuracy (89.9%). Sequentially, the classification shows that Shanghai achieved a 13.09% energy-saving benefit. Overall, by leveraging the high spatial resolution, multiple spectra, and appropriate satellite overpass times of SDGSAT-1 GLI, the estimated SDG indicators in this study outperform those based on Black Marble products, and SDGSAT-1 GLI data have the potential to serve as a direct data source or reference factor for estimating at least 11 SDG indicators.

Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education) East China Normal University Shanghai 200241 China       Edited by: Jing M. Chen The Sustainable Development Goals Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), equipped with the Glimmer Imager (GLI), provides high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) data across multiple spectral bands, potentially facilitating the monitoring of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study developed a denoising algorithm for the multispectral SDGSAT-1 GLI and demonstrated that its data capacity allows for the measurement of the SDG indicators 7.1.1, 11.5.2, and the achievement of target 7.3. The results indicate that (1) The denoising algorithm can effectively remove strips and salt-and-pepper noise from SDGSAT-1 GLI images, with the residual noise significantly reduced and almost little information loss. (2) SDGSAT-1 GLI data can accurately identify electrified areas at a finer spatial scale for calculating Indicator 7.1.1, compared to the traditional NASA's Black Marble Product. The findings show that highly urbanized cities exhibit a greater proportion of their population with access to electricity than underdeveloped cities. (3) SDGSAT-1 proficiently estimates economic losses resulting from non-natural disasters for Indicator 11.5.2. Changes in SDGSAT-1 NTL intensity strongly correlate with pandemic-induced economic losses, with an R2  exceeding 0.8. (4) When measuring Target 7.3 achievement, the SDGSAT-1 GLI multispectral bands classify streetlight types into light-emitting diode and high-pressure sodium lamps with acceptable overall accuracy (89.9%). Sequentially, the classification shows that Shanghai achieved a 13.09% energy-saving benefit. Overall, by leveraging the high spatial resolution, multiple spectra, and appropriate satellite overpass times of SDGSAT-1 GLI, the estimated SDG indicators in this study outperform those based on Black Marble products, and SDGSAT-1 GLI data have the potential to serve as a direct data source or reference factor for estimating at least 11 SDG indicators.

This SDG indicator framework provides a comprehensive system for monitoring and evaluating progress across all 17 SDGs (Assembly, 2017 ). The United Nations has emphasized that a lack of sufficient data blocks the measurement of SDG indicators and the implementation of science-driven policy, particularly in developing countries (Guo, 2018, 2019 ; Sachs et al., 2021 ). Therefore, a new data source is crucial to meet the growing demand for monitoring SDGs (Guo et al., 2021a ; Guo et al., 2023b ). On November 5, 2021, the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals launched the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1). The goal is to accurately characterize human activity footprints and maximize the usage for SDG monitoring via three sensors, namely Glimmer Imager (GLI), Multispectral Imager (MSI), and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) (Guo et al., 2023b ; Guo et al., 2022 ). The GLI records the nighttime light (NTL) intensity in four bands (RGB bands and a panchromatic (Pan) band) with high spatial resolution (40Â m and 10Â m for RGB and Pan bands, respectively). Designed for spatially estimating social and economic development and assessing power consumption (Guo et al., 2023b ), SDGSAT-1 GLI data distinctly capture urban lighting at high spatial resolution, depicting urban spatial details and dynamics (Guo et al., 2023a ). To date, SDGSAT-1 GLI data have been successfully adopted to extract roads (Chang et al., 2022 ), evaluate the public perception of urban public space lighting (Lin et al., 2023 ), explore the county-level poverty reduction performance (Yu et al., 2023b ), improve village-scale built-up delineation (Li et al., 2023 ), enhance the classification accuracy of urban functional areas (Chen et al., 2023 ), and monitor and estimate losses from the Turkey-Syria earthquake (Levin, 2023 ; Yu et al., 2023a ). However, existing research on SDGSAT-1 GLI data does not specifically target individual SDG indicators and cannot clarify their contribution to SDGs monitoring. Furthermore, SDGSAT-1 GLI data face stripping issues and salt-and-pepper noise, severely hindering its use (Liu et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). To alleviate these issues, Zhang et al. (2022)  and Liu et al. (2023)  conducted noise reduction experiments on the Level-1 product of SDGSAT-1 GLI data. However, the SDGSAT-1 GLI data currently available for users are in the form of Level-4 products, and a lot of stripe noise and vignetting still exist in the products. These products have undergone geometric correction, resulting in oblique stripes in the images, which are more intricate than the simple vertical stripes in Level-1 products. Moreover, noise notably exists in all three red, green, and blue (RGB) bands, presenting interrelated characteristics. The above-mentioned study processes the multiple spectral images of SDGSAT-1 GLI separately, which could potentially risk erroneous judgment or omissions. Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of a new noise reduction algorithm tailored for the multispectral Level-4 product. Therefore, this study seeks to enhance the quality of SDGSAT-1 GLI data and explore its potential for monitoring SDGs by selecting five cities with varying development levels as study cases. First, a novel preprocessing procedure is proposed for SDGSAT-1 GLI data Level-4 products to eliminate the strips and salt-and-pepper noise. Subsequently, NTL-based methods are devised to measure three SDG indicators: Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity), Indicator 11.5.2 (Direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP)), and the achievement of Target 7.3 (By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency). The study then compares SDGSAT-1 GLI data with the NASA's Black Marble product (Hereinafter referred to as BMP BMP) and discusses their potential contributions to monitoring other SDG indicators.  2 Study area and datasets 2.1 Study area Five cities were selected as study areas: Shanghai in China, Mumbai in India, Damascus in Syria, Kigali in Rwanda, and Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso (Fig. 1  ). These cities with different development levels situated in developing or underdeveloped regions and face significant challenges in acquiring high-quality data for SDG indicators measurement (ESCAP-UN, 2017 ; Guo, 2018 ; Hardjono et al., 2019 ). In particular, Shanghai is a typical city in China that is one of the key economic centers with strong socioeconomic activities. Mumbai, India, stands as one of the world's most densely populated cities, with a population density of 33,827 people per square kilometer in 2020 (https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/mumbai-population ), and the dense population in Mumbai presents formidable challenges to achieving sustainable development (Chatterjee and Chatterjee, 2016 ). Considering that war or unforeseen events can significantly impact sustainable development, Damascus, which suffered from the Syrian civil war, was selected as one of our study areas. Kigali in Rwanda and Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso are two underdeveloped cities in sub-Saharan Africa, ranking 124th and 138th among 193 countries globally regarding SDG scores for 2022 (Sachs et al., 2022 ), underscoring a low level of sustainable development.  2.2 Datasets 2.2.1 SDGSAT-1 GLI data The SDGSAT-1 GLI captures NTL intensity at local time 21:30 in four bands: panchromatic (444â910Â nm), red (600â894Â nm), green (506â612Â nm), and blue (424â526Â nm). The spatial resolutions of the panchromatic and RGB bands are 10Â m and 40Â m, respectively. The panchromatic data comprises three bands: panchromatic low, panchromatic high, and high dynamic range. The latter band was obtained via fusing the panchromatic low and high data in a ground system with a 50% weighting. We acquired 21 images of these five cities with a cloud coverage less than 20% from the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development (see Table A1 in the Supplemental Information). In SDGSAT-1 GLI Level-4 images, numerous stripes and salt-and-pepper noise with anomalous pixel values are observed (Fig. 2  ). The pixel values of the stripes and salt-and-pepper noise typically exceeded those of the surrounding pixels. The stripes manifested as unevenly spaced, parallel and oblique lines traversing the entire image. However, these strips displayed irregular interruptions, fragmented into segments of varying lengths. Salt-and-pepper noise comprised clusters of exceptional pixels randomly distributed in an image. Within the three bands of RGB data, unpolluted pixels with light exhibited positive values in all three bands, while noisy pixels consistently had unlit values in any one or two bands. Noise removal algorithms can be designed based on the noise correlation across multiple bands. The panchromatic data of SDGSAT-1 GLI exhibited noise characteristics analogous to those of the RGB data.  2.2.2 Ancillary datasets Four ancillary datasets were used in this study: the BMP (VNP46A2 daily data and VNP46A3 monthly data), Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM data), Population Distribution Data (GHS-POP data), and road network data (OSM data), as shown in Table 1  . In particular, BMP was used to calculate the corresponding indicators as compared to the results of the SDGSAT-1 GLI. The BMP is a nighttime light remote sensing product corrected by Lunar BRDF, cloud, terrain, atmospheric, snow, airglow, stray light, and seasonal effects. It is based on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform (SNPP) (RomÃ¡n et al., 2018 ). The BMP has been available at a 500-m resolution since January 2012. VNP46A2 is the daily adjusted NTL product, and VNP46A3 is monthly composites generated from daily VNP46A2 data.    3 Methods The methodology in this study was divided into two parts: SDGSAT-1 GLI data preprocessing and three applications of SDG measurements. 3.1 Preprocessing of SDGSAT-1 GLI data Preprocessing of SDGSAT-1 GLI data was designed to remove stripe and salt-and-pepper noise and generate denoised composite data. Data preprocessing consisted of three steps: (1) stripe and noise removal, (2) radiometric calibration, and (3) data composition, as shown in Fig. 3  . 3.1.1 Stripes and salt-and-pepper noise removal The algorithms for stripe and salt-and-pepper noise removal comprise four components, illustrated in Fig. 4  . (1) Generally, normal nighttime illuminated areas are characterized by recorded light information in each band of SDGSAT-1 GLI's multi-band data, indicating that normal pixels have values greater than the minimum value in all bands. In contrast, noisy pixels exhibit anomalies in at least one band, with a minimum value in that specific band. Therefore, we labeled pixels with a minimum value in at least one band and with a value higher than minimum value in other bands, as potential stripes and salt-and-pepper noise, generating a binary map of âPotential Noiseâ. (2) In the image, stripe noise appears as parallel lines tilted at a fixed angle Î±, traversing the entire image. Therefore, along the direction of angle Î± on the image, pixel counts were performed on the âPotential Noiseâ binary map. The pixel count at the position of the stripes significantly exceeds that at non-stripe positions. At this point, by setting an appropriate threshold (generally approximately equal to the total number of pixels along a straight line in the image at angle Î±), the stripe noise can be extracted. (3) After extracting the stripes, the remaining portion of the âPotential Noiseâ binary map contains salt-and-pepper noise and some potentially normal illuminated areas. We identified pixels with connectivity of less than 8 in the remaining portion as salt-and-pepper noise (Zhang et al., 2022 ). (4) The focal analysis method using a 3Â ÃÂ 4 rectangular kernel was employed to reconstruct pixels in the regions affected by stripes and salt-and-pepper noise. The reconstructed pixel values were determined using the 75th percentile of uncontaminated pixel values within the kernel. As the stripes are slanted, using the commonly employed 3Â ÃÂ 3 square kernel would include too few pixels in the reconstruction, leading to inaccurate estimates. To involve more uncontaminated pixels in the reconstruction process, the kernel was expanded to a 3Â ÃÂ 4 rectangle. Additionally, the majority of neighboring pixels around noisy pixels are background pixels with a value of zero. Traditional mean or median methods in focal analysis would significantly underestimate reconstructed pixel values. Therefore, the quartile method was employed in this study. To evaluate our stripe and noise removal algorithm, residual noise entropy (RNE) was adopted to test the denoising performance, and mean relative deviation (MRD) was used to measure the amount of information loss (Zhang et al., 2022 ). The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural index similarity (SSIM) (Zhou et al., 2004 ) were used to compare the amount of information and structural similarity between denoised images and noise-free clean images.(1) RNE = â â i = 0  n  P i  log P i     where RNE   is residual noise entropy, i   is the pixel value, n   is the maximum pixel value, and P i    is the proportion of pixels with value of i  . In this study, R N E   was calculated for 100Â ÃÂ 100 windows, which contained only zero or noisy pixels. The lower the RNE, the better the denoising performance.(2) MRD = 1 mn  â i = 1  m  â j = 1  n  y i , j   â x i , j     x i , j          where MRD   is mean relative deviation, x i , j     and y i , j     are the pixel values of the original and denoised images, respectively, at the i -th row and j -th column, and m   and n   are the number of rows and columns of the image, respectively. The lower the MRD, the lesser the information loss in the denoised image.(3) P S N R = 10 log 10 max 2  MSE         where PSNR   is the peak signal-to-noise ratio, m a x   is the highest scale value of image, MSE   is mean square error of the image. The unit of PSNR is dB. The larger the value, the less image distortion. In general, a PSNR higher than 40Â dB indicates that the image quality is almost as good as the original image.(4) M S E = 1 M Ã N   â i = 1  M  â j = 1  N  [ I ( i , j  )  â I '  ( i , j  )  ]  2        where MSE   is the mean square error of the image, M   and N   are the width and height of the image, respectively, I i j    is the pixel value of the original image at i j   , and I â²  i j    is the pixel value of the denoised image at i j   .(5) SSIM ( I , I '   )  = l ( I , I '   )  c ( I , I '   )  s ( I , I '   )        (6) { l I , I '    = 2 Î¼ I  Î¼ I '   + C 1   Î¼ I  2  + Î¼ I '   2  + C 1      c ( I , I '  )  = 2 Ï I  Ï I '   + C 2   Ï I  2  + Ï I '   2  + C 2      s ( I , I '  )  = Ï I I '    + C 3   Ï I  Ï I '   + C 1              where l I I â²     is the brightness comparison function, which measures the average brightness of the two images; and c I I â²     is the contrast comparison function, which measures the closeness of the contrast of the two images; s I I â²     is the structure comparison function, which measures the correlation coefficient between the two images I   and I â²   . Î¼   is the mean of the image, Ï 2    is the variance of the image, Ï I I â²      is the covariance of images I   and I â²   . C 1  = 0.01 K   2   , C 2  = 0.03 K   2   , K   is the highest scale value of the image, C 3  = 0.5 C 2   . The value range of SSIM is in [0,1]. A value of 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the images, and 1 indicates that the two images are identical. RNE and MRD are calculated over the entire image with noise. The calculation of PSNR and SSIM relies on the comparison of noise-free clean images, but there is currently no completely clean and noise-free SDGSAT-1 GLI image. Therefore, we searched for two clean small image patches in urban areas and rural areas, conducted the denoising experiments on the them, and the calculated PSNR and SSIM.  3.1.2 Radiometric calibration The digital number of the denoised SDGSAT-1 GLI data for each band was first converted to the NTL radiance value using the following equation:(7) L = DN Ã GAIN + BIAS       where L   is the SDGSAT-1 GLI radiance value with the unit of WÂ·  mâ2 Â·  srâ1 Â·  Î¼mâ1 , DN   is the original digital number, and GAIN   and BIAS   are the calibration parameters, which can be found in the header file of SDGSAT-1 GLI data. To facilitate comparison with the VNP46A2 data, the radiance unit of the SDGSAT-1 GLI data was converted to the unit of the VNP46A2 data (nWÂ·  cmâ2 Â·  srâ1 ) using the following equation (Wang et al., 2020 ):(8) L S D G S A T â 1   = L Ã W Ã 10 5        where L SDGSAT â 1     is the radiance value of the SDGSAT-1 GLI with the unit of nWÂ·  cmâ2 Â·  srâ1 , and W   is the bandwidth. The bandwidth of red, green, blue, and panchromatic band is 294Â nm, 106Â nm, 102Â nm, and 466Â nm, respectively. To quantify the total radiation of the three RGB bands, the grayscale brightness of the SDGSAT-1 GLI was calculated (Grundland and Dodgson, 2007 ):(9) B r i g h t n e s s = 0 . 2989 Ã Ï R e d   + 0 . 5870 Ã Ï G r e e n   + 0 . 1140 Ã Ï B l u e         where Brightness   is the grayscale brightness of SDGSAT-1 GLI data, Ï Red   , Ï Green   , and Ï Blue    are the radiances of the red, green, and blue bands, respectively.  3.1.3 Data composition To further mitigate the impact of abnormal pixel values in the image, the available data was composited for each city. Traditional NTL composites are based on annual averages and often miss short-term human occupancy (Gao et al., 2022 ). Therefore, in this study, the maximum value composite method was employed to produce the SDGSAT-1 GLI composite data. In April and May 2022, Shanghai implemented lockdown measures owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. When estimating Indicators 7.1.1 and Target 7.3, the composite data excluded imagery from the lockdown period. In the calculation of Indicator 11.5.2, the composite data during the pandemic period comprised information from April 10 and April 21, 2022, whereas the composite data for the non-pandemic period was from February 20 and February 25, 2023. After applying RomÃ¡n's method to eliminate background noise (RomÃ¡n et al., 2021 ), the VNP46A2 data were processed using the same composite method as that used for the SDGSAT-1 GLI data.   3.2 Measurement of population with access to electricity for SDG Indicator 7.1.1 SDG Indicator 7.1.1 concerns the population proportion with access to electricity access. The calculation method for this indicator is outlined in the SDG indicators Metadata Repository managed by UNDESA (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata ):(10) I n d i c a t o r  7 . 1 . 1 = p o p e l e c t r    p o p t o t a l     Ã 100 %       where pop electr    is the population with access to electricity, and pop total    is total population of the city. Here, pop electr    was aimed to be defined using NTL radiance values and a threshold-based segmentation method. Owing to the absence of nighttime lighting in uninhabited areas, NTL values were the same as those in non-electrified areas. NTL values were first randomly selected from uninhabited areas as samples for areas without electricity access based on population distribution data (GHS-POP data). NTL values in urban areas were selected from the GUB dataset as the sample of electrified areas among countries with 100% electricity access in the World Bank Global Electrification Database (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?end=2020&start=2020&type=shaded&view=map&year=2020  (accessed 1 October 2023)). Following the statistical analysis of the samples in non-electrified and electrified area, the NTL values in the non-electrified areas were found to be generally smaller than those in the electrified areas. Therefore, the threshold for distinguishing between electrified and un-electrified areas was determined as the average of the maximum NTL value in non-electrified area and the minimum NTL value in electrified area. Areas with NTL values greater than or equal to the threshold were considered electrified, while those with values less than the threshold were considered un-electrified. The electrified area data were resampled to a spatial resolution consistent with population data using the nearest neighbor method. Spatially overlaying population data with electrified area data yielded the population living in electrified areas (pop electr   ). The pop electr    represents the population with electricity access, thus providing valuable insight into the spatial distribution of electricity access.  3.3 Measurement of economic loss attributed to disasters for SDG Indicator 11.5.2 SDG Indicator 11.5.2 measures the ratio of direct economic losses attributed to disasters in relation to GDP. This study aimed to assess the capability of SDGSAT-1 in estimating pandemic-caused economic losses. Unlike special events such as natural disasters or wars, infectious diseases do not damage infrastructure, but mainly affect human activities to change artificial lighting (Bharti et al., 2011 ; Lan et al., 2021 ). Epidemics can significantly alter the rhythm of urban residents' daily lives and social activities, having an unprecedented impact on a city's natural environment and socioeconomic system (Straka et al., 2020 ). In March 2022, the COVID-19 epidemic struck Shanghai, China, resulting in a two-month citywide lockdown. Using this outbreak as a case study, data on the gross industrial output of 12 districts in Shanghai during the pandemic and post-disaster recovery periods were collected. In this study, we calculated the economic loss using gross industrial product instead of GDP. The most obvious impact of the lockdown measures during the epidemic is on industrial enterprises, which stopped production during the lockdown period, and the gross industrial output value shows significant change (Sulistiyani and Riyanto, 2020 ). In addition, detailed GDP data are currently unavailable. Gross industrial output value is the main component of GDP, and the data update frequency of gross industrial output is faster than that of GDP, which can respond to unexpected changes more quickly. The relationship between SDGSAT-1 NTL intensity and gross industrial output value was analyzed to determine the capability of SDGSAT-1 GLI data to estimate Indicator 11.5.2.(11) I n d i c a t o r  11 . 5 . 2 = E L  G I O   Ã 100 % = N T L l o s s    N T L t o t a l     Ã 100 %       where EL   and NTL loss    are the reduction in gross industrial output value and SDGSAT-1 NTL brightness, respectively, attributed to epidemic disasters, GIO   and NTL total    are the gross industrial output value and total NTL brightness, respectively, in the absence of such epidemics. Economic loss was calculated using the difference in gross industrial output value before and during the epidemic. NTL loss was calculated using the difference in NTL value before and during the epidemic.  3.4 Measurement of streetlight energy consumption for SDG target 7.3 SDG Target 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 and requires a detailed assessment of energy consumption. Because streetlights consume public energy (Mandil, 2006 ), the potential for energy savings in the field of artificial lighting is substantial and the using efficient lighting fixtures in public areas can have significant positive economic and environmental impacts (Hadi et al., 2013 ; Shahzad et al., 2016 ). In general, we paid more attention on the measurement of energy consumption from streetlights. The two primary types of streetlights are high-pressure sodium (HPS) and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, with LED lamps exhibiting superior power quality and energy efficiency (Ahmed et al., 2021 ; Djuretic and Kostic, 2018 ). Measurement of streetlight energy consumption involved two steps: classification of each streetlight type based on the multispectral information from the SDGSAT-1 GLI data and accumulation of total energy consumption from LED and HPS lighting.(1) Streetlight classification.    LED and HPS lamps exhibited significantly different emission spectra in the visible range (Elvidge et al., 2010 ), as shown in Fig. 5  . In the blue band, the LED had high reflectivity, whereas the HPS had low reflectivity. In the green and red bands, the reflectivity of both lamps exhibited similar trends. Therefore, based on different spectral patterns of blue and green bands, the Normalized Difference Index between Blues and Greens (NDIBG) (Guo et al., 2023a ) was proposed to improve NTL variations between LED and HPS lamps.(12) NDI B G = Ï Blue  - Ï G r e e n     Ï Blue  + Ï G r e e n            where Ï Green    and Ï Blue    are the radiance values of the green and blue bands of the SDGSAT-1 GLI data, respectively. Then, a supervised classification, using stacked images of the NDIBG and RGB bands, was performed employing five commonly used classifiers (Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis Distance, Neural Net, Maximum Likelihood, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and field-collected samples of street lighting types to classify street lighting into two categories: LED and HPS. The street light number on each road was calculated according to the OSM road data and regulations of different street lighting layouts in road design standards (quantitative relationship between the number of street lighting layouts, road grades, lengths, and lighting intervals) (China, 2015 ). The number of street lights is calculated on a street level. It is difficult to achieve streetlight classification and energy consumption calculation on a pixel level using SDGSAT-1 GLI data. Previous studies have shown that JL1-3B nighttime light data can be used to identify the type and location of street lamps (Cheng et al., 2020 ; Zheng et al., 2018 ), because of its very high spatial resolution (0.92Â m). However, the spatial resolution of SDGSAT-1 GLI data in the RGB band is 40Â m and it cannot identify a single streetlight, even if the panchromatic band has a high spatial resolution of 10Â m. Therefore, the street level strategy is used in this study, which can also effectively realize the streetlight classification.(2) Calculating the total energy consumption of city street lighting.    Referring to existing empirical research on LED and HPS street lighting (Djuretic and Kostic, 2018 ; Kostic et al., 2012 ), the average energy consumption of each type of streetlight is presented in Table 2  . The total energy consumption of streetlighting was equal to the average power consumption multiplied by the number of streetlights for each type.   4 Results 4.1 Denoised SDGSAT-1 GLI data Our proposed denoising algorithm remarkably eliminated stripes and salt-and-pepper noise in comparison to the original image (Fig. 6  , Fig. 7  , Table 3 , and Fig. A1-A8 in Supplemental Information). The RNE of each band in the denoised image was considerably lower than that before denoising, indicating a significant reduction in residual noise. The information loss of each processed image, measured by the MRD (mean relative deviation), was only around 1%, with virtually no harm to the information of the original image. The denoising experiments on the selected image patches achieved good performance in both visual (Fig. 8  ) and quantitative evaluation (Table 4  ). Fig. 8 (a) and (d) are clean image patches in urban and rural areas, respectively. We added some noise in Fig. 8 (b) and (e) that has the same characteristics as the original image noise. The PSNR of the three bands of the denoised image is greater than 40Â dB, and the SSIM is greater than 0.99, indicating that the denoised image is very close to the clean image, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our denoising method.       4.2 SDGSAT-1 GLI data can identify electrified areas at a fine spatial scale for Indicator 7.1.1 Utilizing the SDGSAT-1 GLI data, electrified areas were accurately identified at a spatial resolution of 40Â m to measure the population with electricity access. The results of Indicator 7.1.1 for the five cities are presented in Table 5 . In Shanghai, almost the entire population (99.87%) had access to electricity (Table 5  and Fig. 9  ). The calculation results based on SDGSAT-1 were slightly lower than the proportion of China's electrified population (100%) in the World Bank Global Electrification Database. Conducting a spatial overlay analysis using land cover data (Zhang et al., 2021 ) and the electrified areas, we found that the remaining 0.23% of the population in Shanghai, not covered by electrified areas, is distributed over water bodies. This discrepancy is attributed to errors in the population data used. However, not all cities exhibit this error, and even when present, it is very minor (see Table B2 in the Supplemental Information). In the other four case cities, we observed population distribution ranging from 0.02% to 3.52% over water bodies. The error in population data has a negligible impact on our results. The electrified areas in Mumbai were compact and contiguous, with almost all people (99.70%) living in electrified areas distributed similarly to the population distribution (Fig. A9). In Damascus, the electrified areas were small and spatially fragmented (Fig. A10), resulting in only 20.36% of the population with electricity access. The result for Damascus was much lower than that of the World Bank Global Electrification Database (89.14%). The Syrian civil war caused a loss of 79% of urban lighting in major human-inhabited areas in Syria (Li et al., 2017b ), and SDGSAT-1 GLI displayed a fragmented distribution of electricity facilities in Damascus on a fine spatial scale. Kigali and Ouagadougou had concentrated electrified areas in the city center with many âhollow areasâ of un-electrified regions (Fig. A11 and A12). The electrification infrastructure quality was low and most of the population resided far from electricity service areas. The results for Kigali and Ouagadougou were higher than the national average in the World Bank Global Electrification Database (46.6% and 18.96%, respectively), because they are national capitals and better developed than other regions in their countries. Owing to its fine spatial resolution and wide spectral range, SDGSAT-1 GLI can capture low nocturnal artificial lighting. The number of identified electrified areas based on the BMP data was generally greater than that of SDGSAT-1 GLI (Fig. 10  ). The rough spatial resolution (500Â m) of the BMP causes a blooming effect (Kyba et al., 2015 ; Levin, 2017 ) and an abnormally overestimated light intensity is recorded in nearby non-illuminated areas (Small and Elvidge, 2013 ). However, the blooming effect has not been adequately addressed (Bennett and Smith, 2017 ). Thus, a significant deviation was observed in the identification results for electrified areas, farmland, fields, and water bodies, with zero population, which are identified as electrified areas (Fig. 10 ). Specifically, in areas that are underdeveloped, such as Damascus, Kigali, and Ouagadougou, the identified results based on BMP data were significantly overestimated, and the indicator results were far superior to the true level.  4.3 SDGSAT-1 GLI data can estimate economic losses resulting from non-natural disasters for Indicator 11.5.2 During the pandemic, the NTL brightness across the entire Shanghai area generally decreased, especially in central urban areas and major roadways, where the NTL intensity was significantly lower than that in the surrounding regions (Fig. 11 (a) ). The construction and operation of temporary mobile cabin hospitals led to a higher NTL intensity than usual (Fig. 11 (b)(c)(d)(e)). The higher spatial resolution of SDGSAT-1 GLI proved effective in monitoring the construction and usage of temporary mobile cabin hospitals. As depicted in Fig. 12 (b), (c), and (d) , a highly significant correlation was found between the gross industrial output value and the sum of SDGSAT-1 NTL intensity during and after the pandemic, with R2  exceeding 0.8. Throughout the pandemic, the gross industrial output value of Shanghai's 12 districts experienced a significant decline (Fig. 12 (a), Table A2), and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 39.26% reduction in total NTL intensity. The VNP46A2 data, collected on the same dates as SDGSAT-1, exhibited an unreasonable negative correlation between the monitored NTL intensity loss and the gross industrial output value loss (Fig. 12 (e)). This could be attributed to differences in pass times of the two datasets or potential anomalies in the VNP46A2 data. To mitigate the possibility of data anomalies in the VNP46A2 daily data, we utilized the monthly composite VNP46A3 data, which still demonstrated a weaker correlation with the industrial output value loss than the SDGSAT-1 data performance (Fig. 12 (f)). In summary, the NTL intensity data from SDGSAT-1 exhibited superior performance in characterizing economic losses caused by the pandemic.  4.4 SDGSAT-1 GLI data can assess the energy-saving benefits from the streetlight for Target 7.3 Owing to the temporary unavailability of survey data in other cities, we conducted an experiment to estimate streetlight energy consumption for Target 7.3 in Shanghai. Through field investigation and visual inspection of street view photos, we collected 460 samples on roads of different grades, distributed as evenly as possible across Shanghai. Seventy percent of the samples were used as training data and 30% were used as validation data (Hong et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2017a ; Li et al., 2021 ). A supervised classification of street lighting into two categories: LED and HPS, was conducted. Among the five commonly used supervised classification classifiers (Mahalanobis Distance, Neural Net, and Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Distance, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)), the SVM classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy at 89.9%, with kappa coefficient of 0.79 (Table 6 ), indicating a good accuracy. Therefore, we chose the SVM classifier. Streetlight numbers were calculated based on road design standards (China, 2015 ). Cheng et al. (2020)  successfully extracted the location of streetlights in Shanghai using JL1-3B NTL data with high spatial resolution (0.97Â m). In the same three sample regions as Cheng et al. (2020) , our calculation results (with recognition accuracies of 90.9%, 89.4%, and 87.3% for the three regions, respectively) align with the results of Cheng et al. (2020)  (with accuracies of 95.5%, 89.4%, and 92.6% for the three regions, respectively). Fig. 13   illustrates the distribution of streetlight types in Shanghai. LED lamps are concentrated in central Shanghai. As of 2023, nearly all roads in the central urban area have been updated to LED lamps, whereas HPS lamps are distributed outside the central urban area. A total of 75,113 streetlights in Shanghai were updated with LED lamps, constituting 31.85% of the total streetlight count, with the remaining 68.15% of roads equipped with HPS lamps. Based on the average power of LED and HPS lamps and the number of streetlamps per road, we calculated the street lighting power consumption for each road in Shanghai. The total electricity consumption for street lighting in Shanghai was 63,251.79 kWh. In 2021, Shanghai initiated a comprehensive road lighting facility renovation and upgrade plan, aiming to replace all HPS lamps with LED lamps by the end of 2023. Before the streetlight upgrade, all streetlights in the city were HPS lamps, and a total hourly electricity consumption of 72,774.35 kWh. Presently, the total electricity consumption of streetlights in Shanghai is 9522.56 kWh less than that before the upgrade, with an energy-saving efficiency of 13.09%. After the upgrade is completed, the total hourly electricity consumption is projected to be 41,610.93 kWh, representing a 42.82% reduction from the previous consumption, translating to a saving of 31,163.42 kWh and indicating a potential 42.82% improvement in energy efficiency.   5 Discussion 5.1 SDGSAT-1 GLI data outperforms NASA's black marble product for estimating SDGs From the experimental results of this study, it is evident that the estimated results for SDGs based on SDGSAT-1 GLI data outperform those based on the BMP. These differences are manifested in three aspects: spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and satellite overpass time. On the one hand, SDGSAT-1 GLI data allow for more precise estimations of SDG indicators at higher spatial resolutions (40Â m and 10Â m) than the BMP data (500Â m). Fine spatial resolution facilitates the accurate identification of electrified areas (Indicator 7.1.1) and local variations in NTL intensity caused by disasters (Indicator 11.5.2). The 500-m spatial resolution of the BMP proves too coarse for recognizing these changes, not only introducing misestimations in the estimated results, but also failing to depict spatial details of the outcomes (Fig. 10  and Fig. 12 ). On the other hand, the rich spectral information provided by SDGSAT-1 GLI enables the identification of streetlight types and offers a novel and convenient approach for estimating energy consumption (Target 7.3). Post preprocessing, the SDGSAT-1 GLI data contained five bands (panchromatic, red, green, blue, and grayscale). The SDGSAT-1 GLI data and BMP daily data (VNP46A2) exhibited high correlations in the red and green spectral bands, followed by the blue spectral band, and the lowest correlation with the panchromatic band at the pixel level (Table 7 ). SDGSAT-1 GLI blue and panchromatic bands had a low correlation with VNP46A2. SDGSAT-1 GLI can separately capture NTL information from four spectral bands (red band: 600â894Â nm, green band: 506â612Â nm, blue band: 424â526Â nm, and panchromatic band: 444â910Â nm), while the BMP can only record one spectral band (505â890Â nm). SDGSAT-1 GLI's spectral detection range in the red and green bands essentially overlaps with the spectral range of the BMP. However, the BMP lacks detection of blue light from LED sources, leading to an underestimation of the radiance from outdoor LED lighting products in urban areas at night (Jia et al., 2020 ). This limitation prevents the identification of different light source types and the assessment of light pollution issues related to blue light, which is a significant distinction from SDGSAT-1 GLI. In terms of grayscale brightness, VNP46A2 exhibited the highest correlation with SDGSAT-1 because the grayscale brightness of SDGSAT-1 is a weighted sum of the RGB bands, where the green and red bands have higher weights and the blue band has the lowest weight, accounting for only 11%. Therefore, leveraging the advantages of the multispectral capabilities and the distinctions in the blue light spectrum of SDGSAT-1 GLI enables the monitoring of a broader range of SDG indicators. Furthermore, the imaging time of SDGSAT-1 GLI is consistent with the regularity of frequent nocturnal human activities, and this can effectively monitor the dynamics of human activities in nighttime cities for precise assessment of urban development status. SDGSAT-1's overpass time is approximately 21:30 local time, whereas the BMP is acquired around 01:30 local time. Because people generally are already resting and sleeping at 01:30 local time, the BMP may underestimate human activity intensity. The same-day SDGSAT-1 and VNP46A2 data has an approximately 20Â h time difference, whereas the SDGSAT-1 and next-day VNP46A2 data have only a 4Â h difference, making them much closer and considered to be the same night. Therefore, we obtained VNP46A2 data taken on the same and next date as SDGSAT-1 GLI data to investigate temporal patterns between the two datasets. After denoising, VNP46A2 daily data were processed using the same composite method as the SDGSAT-1 GLI data to produce âsame-day dataâ and âsame-night dataâ (obtained on the same date and the next day as the SDGSAT-1 GLI data, respectively). We found that the correlation between the five bands of the SDGSAT-1 GLI data and same-night VNP46A2 data was higher than that with the same-day VNP46A2 data in Shanghai (Table 7 ). Combining overpass times of the two datasets suggests that the NTL distribution in Shanghai at 21:30 is more like that at 01:30 on the following day. However, the results for Kigali, Ouagadougou, and Damascus were the opposite, with a lower correlation on the second day (Table 7 ). This could be attributed to more pronounced nighttime human activity variations in Shanghai than in other case cities. Utilizing NTL data from time points with abundant human activity allows for a better understanding of nighttime urban vitality (Bennett and Smith, 2017 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Chen et al., 2019 ) and enhanced monitoring of short-term emergencies (Yuan et al., 2023 ).  5.2 Limitations and prospects 5.2.1 Denoising method for SDGSAT-1 GLI data Currently, there is obvious noise in the SDGSAT-1 GLI images, and denoising operations are required to further put the SDGSAT-1 GLI data into specific applications. Given the characteristics of SDGSAT-1 GLI data noise, we designed an algorithm to remove stripes and salt-and-pepper noise, which achieved good results. Taking into account the characteristics of the image, developing noise suppression technology is of great significance for improving various application capabilities of remote sensing images (Shen et al., 2018 ). For stripe noises, traditional digital image denoising methods mainly include statistics based (Gadallah et al., 2000 ), filter based (Tsai and Chen, 2008 ), decomposition based (Cui et al., 2020 ), sparse representation based (Chang et al., 2016 ), and deep learning based (Zhang et al., 2018 ). At the same time, some state-of-the-art methods (Chu et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2024 ; Maji and Mahajan, 2023 ) have obtained satisfactory results in the field of hyperspectral and time denoising by synergistic use of spatio-temporal-spectral information. However, these methods may not be applicable to SDGSAT-1 GLI images. Unlike daytime remote sensing images, SDGSAT-1 GLI images record artificial lights at night and cannot reflect the reflectivity differences of different ground objects. Human activities change frequently at night, and the degree of change in NTL intensity is much greater than the daytime visible light reflectance of ground objects. The characteristics of SDGSAT-1 GLI images are quite different from daytime images. Moreover, existing SDGSAT-1 GLI images have a short time series, and it is infeasible to add time changes and periodic characteristics to the algorithm that collaboratively utilizes spatio-temporal-spectral domain information. Some researchers have made useful attempts to denoise SDGSAT-1 GLI data. Zhang et al. (2022)  designed a destriping algorithm based on anomaly detection and spectral similarity restoration. Liu et al. (2023)  proposed a method of masking ground object pixels and using âNight-Dayâ orbit images. They have effectively removed the noise from the SDGSAT-1 GLI original image. Different from our algorithm, the above methods are performed on Level-1 products. The Level-4 products currently available to users have undergone relative radiometric calibration and geometric correction based on Level-1 products, but they still retain non-negligible stripes and salt-and-pepper noise, and the data format and distribution of pixel values have changed greatly. The existing algorithm is not applicable to Level-4 products. The denoising experiments in five case cities and the image patches in this study show that the algorithm we proposed can effectively remove the stripes and salt-and-pepper noise of the SDGSAT-1 GLI Level-4 products, providing further support for the full utilization of SDGSAT-1 GLI data. In addition, the SDGSAT-1 GLI data are seriously obscured by clouds. How to remove clouds is also a very important issue for the further application of SDGSAT-1 GLI data. Many researchers have developed cloud mask extraction and cloud-contaminated pixel restoration methods for daytime remote sensing image data and products (Gong et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2017c ; Shen et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). Some scholars have also tried to repair and fill nighttime light remote sensing data (Hao et al., 2023 ; Tan and Zhu, 2023 ; Ye et al., 2021 ). However, whether these methods are suitable for SDGSAT-1 GLI data requires further analysis and experiments. It may be a worthwhile approach to make full use of the spectral and temporal collaborative information between the three SDGSAT-1 sensors (TIS, GLI, and MSI) to identify and reconstruct pixels contaminated by clouds in SDGSAT-1 GLI data.  5.2.2 Further application of SDGSAT-1 GLI data in SDG In this study, we exclusively conducted experimental validations for three indicators (Indicator 7.1.1, 11.5.2, and Target 7.3) in five global cities, owing to data limitations. These experiments demonstrated the capability of SDGSAT-1 GLI data to estimate SDG indicators, highlighting its high spatial resolution and multispectral characteristics. Additionally, SDGSAT-1 GLI data have the potential to support the estimation of at least 8 additional indicators (Table 8 ). SDGSAT-1 GLI data can act as a significant input for indicator calculation models to estimate the extent of poverty (Yu et al., 2023b ) for Indicators 1.1.1 and discern aerosol optical depth (Wang et al., 2023 ) for Indicator 11.6.2. It serves as an urban environmental reference factor and can be analyzed at a fine scale, such as at the community level, to evaluate nighttime public lighting (Lin et al., 2023 ), light pollution (Goal 3), and nighttime lighting safety (Indicator 16.1.4). Utilizing SDGSAT-1 GLI data for change detection enables the assessment of economic losses caused by disasters (Indicator 1.5.2, Indicator 11.5.2,), infrastructure damage (Wu et al., 2023a ) (Indicator 11.5.3), and the distribution of vessels engaged in nighttime fishing (Zhao et al., 2023 ) (Indicator 14.6.1). SDGSAT-1 can effectively be used to extract roads (Chang et al., 2022 ) and also provides auxiliary road condition references for all-season roads to calculate Indicator 9.1.1, as road illumination is crucial for ensuring optimal road traffic capacity (Chu et al., 2016 ; Wanvik, 2009 ; Wood, 2020 ). Furthermore, integrating NTL data with other multi-source remote sensing data can also contribute to SDG assessment (Chen et al., 2021 ; Guo et al., 2021b ; Shi et al., 2023 ; Wu et al., 2023b ; Wu et al., 2023c ). In conclusion, SDGSAT-1 GLI data serve as a direct data source or reference factor for SDG indicator calculations to spatially demonstrate progress towards SDGs at higher resolutions. With additional SDGSAT-1 GLI data and supplementary datasets, monitoring and assessing of multiple SDG indicators across a broader geographical scope can be extended for future studies. Moreover, in estimating Target 7.3, considering street lighting power consumption as a significant component of public energy consumption (Mandil, 2006 ), we conducted street lighting classification experiments to calculate street lighting power consumption and its energy efficiency. However, other sectors such as industrial production also contribute to energy consumption, requiring further development of monitoring methods. Additionally, only two types of streetlights (LED and HPS) were considered in this study. While LED and HPS are the two most mainstream types of streetlights, but there are also a few other types. Although some studies have successfully distinguished between streetlamp types (HPS and LED) using JL1-03B (Cheng et al., 2020 ; Zheng et al., 2018 ), high costs and reduced coverage limit its application. Compared with the spatial resolution of 0.92Â m of JL1-03B, the SDGSAT-1 GLI cannot yet locate individual streetlamps; however, it can identify the lighting type of an entire road. Moreover, the wide swath and high data-acquisition frequency of SDGSAT-1 are useful for identifying lighting types over large areas. Recently, Yin et al. (2024)  also conducted experiments on streetlight classification based on SDGSAT-1. Rapid identification of lighting types can further assist in estimating power consumption and provide auxiliary evidence for global energy efficiency and emission reduction.    6 Conclusion This study investigates the potential of SDGSAT-1 GLI data in calculating SDG indicators across five global cities with varying development levels as study areas. We first performed denoising and composite processing on the SDGSAT-1 GLI data to enhance its quality. The denoising algorithm demonstrated commendable performance in quantitative evaluation. Subsequently, methods for calculating SDG Indicator 7.1.1 (Proportion of population with access to electricity), Indicator 11.5.2 (Direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP)), and Target 7.3 (By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency) were devised. Moreover, the study highlights the advantages of SDGSAT-1 over the BMP and underscores the potential contributions of SDGSAT-1 GLI data to various SDG indicators. The findings are as follows:(1) SDGSAT-1 GLI effectively identified electrified areas with precision at fine spatial scales. The results of Indicator 7.1.1 based on SDGSAT-1 GLI provided more accurate evidence, particularly in underdeveloped areas, supplementing the monitoring of the population with electricity access. SDGSAT-1 GLI data proved effective in accurately estimating economic losses resulting from non-natural disasters for Indicator 11.5.2, such as the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, where a 39.26% total NTL intensity loss was recorded in 2022. Additionally, the multispectral capability of SDGSAT-1 GLI facilitates the classification of street lighting types (LED and HPS lamps) for Target 7.3, achieving an overall accuracy of 89.9% in Shanghai. This led to a 13.09% energy-saving benefit compared with previous HPS lamps.  (2) Leveraging its high spatial resolution, diverse spectral capabilities, and well-timed satellite passes, SDGSAT-1 GLI outperforms traditional BMP in estimating SDG indicators. The precise spatial resolution enables accurate identification of electrified areas (Indicator 7.1.1) and localized light changes resulting from disasters (Indicator 11.5.2). Furthermore, the multispectral capabilities of SDGSAT-1 facilitate monitoring a broader range of SDG indicators (Target 7.3). The consistent transit time for SDGSAT-1 GLI aligns with the regularity of frequent nocturnal human activities, offering effective monitoring of nighttime human dynamics for SDG assessment. The high spatial resolution and multispectral characteristics of SDGSAT-1 GLI data contribute to the estimation of at least 11 SDG indicators.    NTL imagery from the recently-launched SDGSAT-1 has revealed new opportunities for promoting SDGs. This study's experiment demonstrates the applicability of SDGSAT-1 GLI data in supporting SDG indicator monitoring. With global coverage and the accumulation of historical SDGSAT-1 data sequences in the future, the capacity to fulfill data demands for SDG indicators will significantly increase, facilitating global progress in widespread monitoring and assessment of SDGs.
