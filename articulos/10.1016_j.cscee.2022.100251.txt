                  The aim of this case study is to develop a novel freshwater aquaculture organic-process in the Irish peatlands along with adjacent eco-innovation that will support food production and security regionally with a global orientation. This specifically addresses the problem of traditional workforce reliance on burning peat as a fossil fuel by providing alternative green-friendly eco-innovative activities for new employment and social enterprise. Findings show that this system relies upon a naturally-occurring ecosystem of algae, bacteria and duckweed species to achieve effective waste remediation and for water quality. There is no use of artificial compounds including antibiotics, and no discharge of effluent to receiving waters. Peatlands are a unique ecosystem that constitute an important carbon sink, but also represents a novel environment for climate solutions. This novel peatland-site holds the potential to support the sustainable development goals of the United Nations as described herein.

Case Report  Peatland-based innovation can potentially support and enable the sustainable development goals of the United Nations: Case study from the Republic of Ireland Emer A. O'Neill  Michelle McKeon Bennett  Neil J. Rowan ∗   Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (TUS), Athlone Campus, University Road, Athlone, Co.

The aim of this case study is to develop a novel freshwater aquaculture organic-process in the Irish peatlands along with adjacent eco-innovation that will support food production and security regionally with a global orientation. This specifically addresses the problem of traditional workforce reliance on burning peat as a fossil fuel by providing alternative green-friendly eco-innovative activities for new employment and social enterprise. Findings show that this system relies upon a naturally-occurring ecosystem of algae, bacteria and duckweed species to achieve effective waste remediation and for water quality. There is no use of artificial compounds including antibiotics, and no discharge of effluent to receiving waters. Peatlands are a unique ecosystem that constitute an important carbon sink, but also represents a novel environment for climate solutions. This novel peatland-site holds the potential to support the sustainable development goals of the United Nations  as described herein.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Climate change  Sustainability  Eco-innovation  Paludiculture  United nation SDGs    1 Introduction 1.1 Problem statement With the transition away from burning peat as a fossil fuel [1 ], there is a pressing employment gap to fill that can be met by developing green-friendly climate solutions [2 ]. Over a thousand workers directly involved in peat harvesting have been affected by closure of power plants or from the removal of peat as media for supporting horticulture and mushroom-growing industries. Peatland covers 16.2% of Ireland that is equivalent to ca. 134 million hectares; moreover, peatlands cover 17.2% of the land surface within the Republic of Ireland [3 ,4 ]]. Traditional use of peatlands had given rise to a major industry producing about 4 million tonnes of peat fuels per annum. Peat as a fossil fuel had produced 25% of the electricity generated in Ireland with the remainder sold as fuel for heating family homes. Some 1.13 million cu. m. of peat were also produced each year for horticultural use. Since 2020 there has been focus on rewetting peatlands as an important carbon sink along with development of alternative green solutions and enterprises led by the Irish State Body ‘Bord Na Móna’ in partnership with industry, academia and local government [5 ]. Thus, the use of Irish peatlands has altered drastically in the last decade as a result of the need to reduce Ireland's carbon footprint, as well as the fact that many of these peatlands are now protected areas due to their increasing scarcity [6 ]. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food producing industry in the world [4 ]. Its rapid expansion is primarily due to an increased demand as a result of an ever growing global population. Farmed fish is considered to be a more efficient protein use and feed conversion source than other animal products intended for protein production [7 ]. Aquaculture also provides food availability to regions and countries that would have previously been limited, or in some cases non-existent thus providing food security and improved nutrition [8 ]. Although Irish aquaculture production was predicted to increase to 81,700 tonnes per annum by 2023, its growth and development has been hindered with the adoption of important European environmental protection directives that have limited space and resource availability [1 ,5 ]. Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), Ireland's state agency responsible for developing the national fishing and aquaculture industries, undertook a feasibility study to assess the novel use of Irish peatlands for aquaculture diversification, termed ‘Paludiculture’. Thus, there are emerging opportunities to develop new wettable and commercially-viable enterprises in the peatlands including freshwater aquaculture production that will rejuvenate the Irish midlands, which includes transitioning of communities to low carbon economy and creating new employment. Commensurately, there are dual opportunities for developing green-innovation and enterprises in the peatlands (termed ‘Paludiculture’) that can help meet many of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations.  1.2 Proposed solutions 1.2.1 Freshwater aquaculture. One sustainable solution is the development of freshwater aquaculture to meet organic status using an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system (IMTA) approach. This can be used to commercially produce fish where the system does not discharge effluent to receiving water nor does rely on use of chemicals such as antibiotics [6 ]. Specifically, this is a novel peatland-based IMTA process set in the middle of Mount Lucas Wind Farm, Co. Offaly, Ireland (53°17′3″ N - 7°11′45″ W). The aquaculture system consists of four split (pill) ponds connected to an algae and duckweed lagoon with sixteen channels serving as a natural treatment system (See Fig. 1  ). Fish are kept at a density that does not exceed the organic farming standard (e.g. , <20 kg/m−3  for perch), using screens at the D-ends of each split pond. The space between two D-end fish culture areas is also used to treat waste with free living algae in suspension. Flow in each split pond is generated and water is circulated using an airlift. Each D-end fish culture area is equipped with oxygen and temperature probes connected to paddlewheels to provide extra oxygen when necessary. The farm is designed to hold a maximum of 32,000 kg of fish. This trial IMTA system holds European perch (Perca fluviatilis ), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiis ), common duckweed (Lemna minor ) and gibbous duckweed (Lemna gibba ) and exploits use of microalgae for waste removal. Water is only added to the system from a nearby bog river to offset evaporation and only released as a result of overflow during times of excessive rainfall. This IMTA process differs from traditional aquaculture systems that use water from natural sources (rivers, lakes, etc .). Traditional systems must also consider potential pollutants from external sources (agricultural runoff, industry waste, wastewater treatments plants). A nearby wind turbine sustainably generates all electrical needs for the trial fish farm at Mount Lucas, as shown in Fig. 1 . Tables 1 and 2    provide physicochemical parameters from effluent sampled at Mount Lucas site that highlight efficacy of natural ecosystem remediation process. Limitations for the methodology includes a lack of understanding of (a) the dynamic interplay between algae, bacteria and duckweed influencing IMTA production that also considers extreme variance in weather, (b) the water-food-energy-carbon nexus including use of different sustainable tools such as life cycle assessment, material flow analysis, principle component analysis, (c) control and prevention of disease and welfare in farmed fish using natural means aligned with maintain organic status, (d) optimizing of fish production yield to reflect feed rate and other resource requirements that includes costs, and (e) relationship between IMTA process and other adjacent activities on the Mount Lucas site that includes potential for developing aquaponics, ecosystem service management and accelerating green enterprises. Thus, th aim of this case study was to support, develop and define a novel IMTA-based process along with other adjacent green-innovation in the Irish midlands as a means of potentially replicating these innovative processes, products and services across the peatlands regionally with a global orientation. The linked objectives were to:(1) define a functional IMTA process in the Irish midlands including role of microalgae, bacteria and duckweed ecosystem in regulating waste and water quality  (2) generate new green-friendly innovation that can lead to commercialization with industry partners and the co-creation of new employment opportunities for workforce regionally that traditionally had relied upon peat as fossil fuel  (3) consider potential of this Mount Lucas peatland site for supporting and enabling many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.     1.3 Commensurate novel research at Mount Lucas peatland site that aligns with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGS) The international commitment to Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the SDGS is to be achieved by 2030; however, the world overall is not on track to achieve global goals by 2030 due in part to recent conflicts along with climate and biodiversity crisis [63 ]. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has recently called for renewed ambition, mobilisation and leadership for the SDGS to recover better, together. Mount Lucas innovative activities align with Ireland's Implementation Plan that integrates these SDGs into public administration including incorporation into administrative, planning and accountability frameworks [63 ]. This must also embrace research, dialogue, capacity-building, community engagement, and partnerships at both national and international level to progress Policy Coherences for Sustainable Development (SDG target 17.14). Specific policies addressed by this case study includes Ireland's Economic Recovery Plan, Project Ireland 2040 – National Development Plan, Climate Action Plan 2021; National Biodiversity action Plan 2017–2021; Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy; The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020–2025; Healthy Ireland – A framework for Improved Health and Well-being 2013–2025; Wellbeing Framework; The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017–2020; Ireland's National Skills Strategy; Our Rural Future – Rural Development Policy 2021–2025. Ireland is introducing a central repository to map, track and to showcase SDGs activities that will include Mount Lucas paliduculture. 1.3.1 SDG1_No poverty Peatland innovation presents opportunities to regenerate employment and avert poverty regionally through developing novel food and feed production systems along with promoting new social enterprises such as ecotourism and dark-sky tourism (Table 3  ). This also reflects enterprises presented by Ziegler et al. [9 ] who noted paludiculture to be an emerging, science-driven, and collaborative innovation, but have not as yet been seen as directly commercially viable, where these authors focused on fuel, fodder, horticulture substrate and construction material. Current freshwater aquaculture production systems are resource constrained and the production systems are unlikely to meet the increasing demand for aquatic foods, which is foreseen as one solution for feeding the growing world populations that is estimated to reach ca. 10 billion people by 2050 [10 ,11 ]. There has been an increasing interest in enhancing and developing new Irish freshwater aquaculture processes without impacting upon environmental EU directives, nor hindering the process of the water framework directive that will lead to new revenue streams [4 ]. The Mount Lucas site will also act as demonstrator site for economic development by supporting testing of digital technologies to address panoply of operational and risk factors influencing sustainability of green enterprises, which includes connecting living labs to in-field monitoring and production process [1 ,6 ,12 ]. This peatland IMTA process will also support new enterprises for regional economic development such as commercial duckweed harvesting and the biorefinery of microalgae for potential active ingredients used in new food products and packaging. These social and economic activities will also entail reskilling and upskilling for new employment opportunities regionally where there was a strong traditional reliance on harvesting peat as a fossil fuel, or for horticulture purposes. These new activities specifically align with Midlands Regional Development Plan 2024, Ireland's National Economic Recovery and Resilience Plan 2021, and the European Just Transition Programme that will support a fair and just transition of communities to low carbon economy [14 ]. Mount Lucas site also aligns with fair trade and sanctuary, and can be deployed to enable pandemic responsiveness for to prevent food supply chain disruption that has economic consequences. The World Bank forecasted in 2021 that severe poverty would increase to between 143 million and 163 people [Table 3 ]. Mount Lucas site provides established and new demonstrator activities, for aforementioned products and services, that also support and advance eight recognised solutions to poverty; namely, educate children by way of school visits and placements, provide clean water that is plentiful in the peatlands, ensure basic healthcare, empower a girl or woman where the lead author (female) is the first Empowe Eco Research Fellow for Peatlands innovation, improve childhood nutrition that will be informed by workshops linked to academia, support environmental programmes where Mount Lucas will provide training on biodiversity and ecology, reach children in conflict where there is local and regional relocation of Ukranian refugees that have sanctuary status at Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest, and to prevent child marriage that does not occur in Ireland. These align with Housing and Poverty 2022 – Social Justice Ireland that is addressing households in receipt of rent subsidies where the poverty rate after rent payments is 59.1%; this reflects on fifth of the people of Ireland living below the poverty line where housing costs are included. Mount Lucas peatland activities specifically address (a) Advancing the Green Transition, (b) Accelerating and Expanding Digital Reforms and Transformation, and (c) Social and Economic Recovery and Job Creation under Ireland's National Recovery and Resilience Plan, where the country is investing €165 billion over the next decade to support economic along with social, environmental and cultural development. Ireland will use its membership of the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) to advance progress on the SDGs in line with our international development policy of reaching the furthest behind first. 1.2.2 SDG2_Zero Hunger . Current freshwater aquaculture production systems are resource constrained and the production systems are unlikely to meet the increasing demand for aquatic foods, which is foreseen as one solution for feeding the growing world populations that is estimated to reach ca. 10 billion people by 2050 [Table 3 ]. Peatland innovation will potentially mitigate against impact of reduced water supply and environmental impact of intensive plant and livestock production to meet increased animal and human needs for high quality food production that will be by digital technologies to enhance productivity and ensure food safety. Peatlands also presents an opportunity to establish new food production systems that can offset negative environmental consequences of resource constrained conventional terrestrial farming [5 ,13 ]. Mount Lucas site can help fulfil consumer needs to meet zero hunger by both intensifying and diversifying production of new freshwater aquaculture resources and fish species. It is appreciated that hunger was a daily reality for over 811 million people in 2020, 161 million more that in 2019 (https://www.worldvision.ie/our-work/hunger-free-campaign/ ). The frequency and intensity of conflict, climate extremes and economic downturns are driving hunger globally where COVID-19 Pandemic has exacerbated these drivers; educational programmes linked to Mount Lucas can also help ensure that malnutrition is avoided. New technologies including digital transformation can be used at Mount Lucas to address the challenges of low impact paludiculture (such as low-trophic IMTA, RAS, organic) and environmental service that are affected by extremes in climate variance [6 ]. Research, enterprise and commercial production of aquaculture produced perch and trout was also impacted by lockdown strategies introduced to prevent transmission of COVID-19 where there is a need to consider future remote monitoring of processes including use of new mobile phone apps. Thus, Mount Lucas is an appropriate novel demonstrator site for potentially establishing digital solutions to be applied across the value chain to create eco-innovations that balances environmental protection [3 ,13 ,15 ]. This includes end-to-end monitoring of fish production for biomass, feed rate and disease mitigation encompassing use of sensor and drones informed by Internet of Thing (edge computing) and artificial intelligence that has been reported recently to advance related fisheries internationally [13 ,15 ]. Block chain can also be used to inform decision-making and commercialisation of processes [13 ,15 ]. Commensurately, thi new peatland innovation site supports models that integrate biological constraints (microbiome, fish growth and health), system functioning, and effluent outputs in order to improve biomass productivity that represents a real step towards precision aquaculture [5 ]. Mount Lucas will supports commercial harvesting of duckweed as new high-protein feed source (Rowan , 2022). It also supports pollination and ecosystem service management including in-field testing of bee-disease mitigation technologies [16 ]. Mount Lucas activities have been embedded in a European Interreg  Atlantic Area “Neptunus” project that addresses food sustainability and supports MSCA-RISE training for SMEs in food section under “ICHTHYS” project; thus, peatland innovation (Table 3 ) enhances sectoral specific stakeholder engagement including key groups where social marketing will be used to raise awareness and to promote engagement with SDGs linked to Mount Lucas peatland framework.  1.3.2 SDG3_ Good Health and Well-being Mount Lucas site produces nutritious organic fish that are rich in protein and omega 3 [Table 3 ]. The algae in the ponds can also be harvested and bio-refined for bioactives that have beneficial immune stimulation potential [17–19 ] along with incorporation into new food products [20 ]. Mount Lucas is remotely situated in the Irish peatlands that offers potential to promote eco and dark-sky tourism that create environments that can positively impact upon mental health of workers and visitors. In 2021 edition of Eurostat's Monitoring report on progress towards SDGs in an EU context indicated that Ireland is above EU average in respect of 13 of the 15 SDGs that includes Good Health and Well-Being.  1.3.3 SDG4_Quality education Peatland research and enterprise activities inform new educational and training programmes linked to government, industry and community needs [Table 3 ]. Upskilling and educational needs have been met using the Quadruple Helix Hub approach that combines academia, industry, local government and society. For example, Mount Lucas provides a working in-field case study to help support a whole-of-the-government approach to knowledge, understanding and application of Agenda 2030 SDGs and it this can be translated to Civil Service and State Agencies through bespoke on site and eLearning training and guidance [63 ]. This can also be incorporated into SDGs One Learning Policy Makers Gen 2 course as well as specific workshop for officers directly involved in developing national polices. Specific topics will address core sustainability needs and opportunities enabled by digital transformation that includes environmental balance and biodiversity. Outreach activities to regional primary schools and communities are also popular that includes nationally-funded Cell Explorers programme that has reached over 2000 students in more than 50 schools. This also helps to provide specialist training for early-phase researchers in demonstrator upskilling with a focus on highlighting the practical relevance of applied STEM and AHSS to our new generation of potential scientists. Mount Lucas will als0 support and enable Quality Education programmes specific to Ireland include ECO-UNESCO  Youth empowerment and engagement (that delivers the Young Environmentalist Awards programme, ECO-UNESCO  Youth for Sustainable Development Global Youth Leaders for change programme and Learning2Change our World for secondary schools programme), the National Youth Assembly on Climate, and An Taisce Green Schools [63 ]. Mount Lucas site has the potential to support “inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels, [particularly primary, secondary, tertiary technical and vocational training]. All people, irrespective of sex, age, race, ethnicity, and persons with disabilities, especially those in vulnerable situations, should have access to life-long learning opportunities that help them acquire the knowledge and skills needed to exploit opportunities and to participate in society” [2030 Agenda, paragraph 25 [63 ]. Promoting and supporting activities at Mount Lucas such as food sustainability, biodiversity and digital transformation facilitate dialogue and partnerships on SDGs with other bodies and educational institutions across Ireland that has a global orientation. Such SDGs can be used as a framework and tool to support students to develop their research, critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork and communications skills. Mount Lucas aligns with themes litter and waste, energy water and food and biodiversity that is addressed under Green Schools, which is Ireland's leading environmental management and education programme operating in over 94% of schools nationally. Particularly, SDG target 4.7 “to ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development”. Mount Lucas is connected to further and higher education institutions where activities can be developed under 4 themes; (a) research   such as research on all SDGs, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, innovation and solutions, national and local level implementation, capacity building for research; (b) education   such as education for sustainable development, jobs for implementing the SDGS, capacity building, mobilizing young people; operations and governances   aligned with SDGs and incorporating same into university reporting; external leadership   such as public engagement, cross-sectoral dialogue and action, policy development and advocacy, demonstrate sector commitment [63 ].  1.3.4 SDG5_Gender equality Mount Lucas activities supports and enables gender balance in all tiers of research, innovation and education that are aligned with Athena Swan framework [Table 3 ], for example equal pay, and women in management. These activities also align with the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles “for scientific data management and stewardship’ in order to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data. Mount Lucas site will also support youth activism and youth organisation in gender equality. With youth activism rising and increased connectivity through social media, young people have great power to mobilise, communicate, bring about change and act as a dynamic force for social transformation. Young people are playing a key role in tackling climate change, gender biases and inequalities and youth organisations are leading the way on promoting and facilitating innovative projects [63 ]. Subject-matter expert university, along staff with industry stakeholders at Mount Lucas, continued to support and funding of youth projects ensuring gender equality is an important element for empowering young people to engage and contribute to Agenda 2030 (SDGs). This includes a diversity of projects in higher education ranging from undergraduate summer internships to “Empower Eco” Postdoctorate Fellowship, enabled by the Bioscience Research Institute at Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest.  1.3.5 SDG6_Clean Water and Sanitation An advantage of peatland-based aquaculture is that it harnesses water from rivers and lakes and doesn't have the possible threats from potential pollutants in raw, untreated wastewater, such as agricultural run-off [Table 3 ]. The emphasis is on creating a balanced system in the four fish ponds at Mount Lucas, which are created using a natural glacial till (Fig. 1 ). The ecosystem of algae, bacteria and duckweed is such that effluent is naturally treated by same without the need for discharge to aquatic environment. IMTA and future aquaponics also supports the testing of new sensor and robotic technologies for increased performance, efficiency and operation. Clean Water and Sanitation are also topics under linked educational programmes in connected universities that embraces new research and innovation in water treatment and disease mitigation. The Mount Lucas project role in addressing clean water and innovative food systems under a Quadruple Helix Hub concept was presented at Irelands' Environ2022 conference.  1.3.6 SDG7_Affordable and clean energy Mount Lucas is supporting and enabling development of wind energy (Table 3 ). This also includes facilitating upskilling workforce, social enterprises and future entrepreneurship including developing green renewable solutions such as wind turbines and potentially future solar options, that has been championed by Bord Na Mona. This includes opportunities to link with academic providers under ‘Accelerator Green’ initiative under nearby Boora for enabling such entrepreneurs and start-ups such as step-step change physical infrastructure and support system supports for R&D collaborative facilitation, pre-start up including design maturation activities, ideation and design thinking to inform Technological Readiness level (TRL), market research and enterprise support (early-needs analysis, product market fit analysis), early-technical validation (test the technologies, experimentation/validation in the pre-pilot, and scaled to real-life setting). It should be noted that supporting affordable and clean energy is already well established by the State Body ‘Bord Na Mona’ with multiple wind turbines in operation at Mount Lucas; this aligns with Midland Regional Development Plan 2024.  1.3.7 SDG8_Decent work and economic growth Mount Lucas supports the growth of green and digital technologies for new regional employment that will positively impact economic growth (Table 3 ). Paludiculture will also enable the creation of a pipeline of specialist workers for supporting growth of micro-enterprises, SMEs and MNCs that includes informing risk mitigation, corporate governance, technology and business model disruption. Business and industry are recognised as one of Agenda 2030s nine ‘major groups’, which play an important role in sustainable development. Indeed, “Private business activity, investment, and innovation are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation. We acknowledge the diversity of the private sector, ranging from micro-enterprises to cooperatives to multinationals. We call upon all businesses to apply their creativity and innovation to solving sustainable development challenges. We will foster a dynamic and well-functioning business sector, while protecting labour rights and environmental and health standards in accordance with relevant international standards and agreements”. {2030 Agenda, paragraph 67]. Based on the Irish Governments consultation process, Mount Lucas site can help address key objectives in relation to the business sector engagement for inclusion in strategic implementation plan such as developing a means to allow for showcasing, reporting of and sharing of initiatives undertaken to promote and progress the SDGs in the business sector (example, with Emerald SME). Also, to explore the most suitable mechanisms to better facilitate business sector input on the SDGs and which facilitates the linking of work where synergies and overlapping objectives arise. Mount Lucas economic activities also support Chambers Ireland and their network of local chambers that has placed the SDGs at the heart of its long-term strategy that includes developing at toolkit for boosting profit margins and making savings across business, gaining greater trust among customers, improving employee retention by working towards a common goal, increasing feelings of stability by development sustainable plans for the future, growing their customer based by attracting sustainability-minded consumers. Moreover, Mount Lucas activities facilitates the Local Economic and Community Plans Guidelines 2021 that provides support to local authorities and relevant local partners regionally (such as in County Offaly) to help them to develop and to implement comprehensive and flexible 6-year plans that will support the sustainable development of their areas over the lifetime of the plan.  1.3.8 SDG9_Industry, innovation and infrastructure Mount Lucas site aligns with the Quadruple Helix Hub (academia-industry-government-society) framework model for supporting new green technology development, testing and commercialization enabled by digital technologies (Table 3 ). This includes access to specialist infrastructure and living labs (such as bioreactors, bioinformatics/next generation sequencing, ecotoxiological testing, pilot flow-through pulsed UV  disinfection technologies and so forth), to subject-matter experts that caters for a variety of industry needs from grant writing to supporting high-risk/high-gain deep-tech solutions for sustainability, circularity and climate action. This Quadruple Helix Hub also provides specific support functions including test before invest, skills and training, support to find investment, and innovation ecosystem and networking [21 ]; this also promotes Open innovation and knowledge exchange. Core activities at Mount Lucas also align with both Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 –human centric model that includes immersive technologies for training and digital twin.  1.3.9 SDG10_Reduced inequalities Mount Lucas activities support bespoke educational outreach programmes to regional schools to ensure equalities (Table 3 ). It promotes empowerment and leadership. Research ethics is the core, including supporting new Trustworthy artificial intelligence. The Mount Lucas site will provide a timely interdisciplinary framework to foster collaborative engagements between Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS) activities that embraces behavioural change for this effective community transitioning to low carbon economy and employment, which also addresses equality. Civil society played a vital role through the negotiation process for the SDGs and this engagement helped shape Agenda 2030.  1.3.10 SDG11_Sustainable cities and communities Mount Lucas peatland harnesses the power of social marketing to inform behavioural change, such as for communities transitioning to new carbon economy (Table 3 ). Mount Lucas site also is gear to promote and support social enterprise including honey production, vertical farming, aquaponics and other community enterprises [22 ]. It also considers sustainable built environment including living lab concept for the peatlands. Mount lucas activities aligns with Ireland's call “think global, act local” which recognises that universal challenges can only be met through local action. The SDGs, supported by Mount Lucas actvities' allow local action to be placed within a broader global context and become a vital part of the framework to achieve Agenda 2030 [63 ]. Mount lucas aforementioned activities will aid the Government to strengthen and building understanding and capacity in local government and community and voluntary sector; this strategy also recognises the importance of the community and voluntary sector to a healthy, just and prosperous society, and set out how the Government will support and empower this sector to be more sustainable over the coming years and beyond [63 ]. This will also help create a vibrant and active civil society, developing opportunities for all communities to contribute, engage and participate in decision making and policy implementation, such as regional transition to low carbon economy.  1.3.11 SDG12_Responsible consumption and production SDG12_Responsible consumption and production is addressed through research, innovation and education where there are specific linked projects on circular economy, sustainability, water-food-energy nexus, and supply chain (Table 3 ). This is will be informed by specialist workshops for stakeholders regionally and across the island of Ireland such as digital transformation, fish welfare/disease mitigation, green technologies/business development and so forth that includes supporting key enablers such as Ireland's Fisheries Board (Bord Iascaigh Mhara or BIM) and ‘Hatch Blue’ Aquaculture accelerator enterprise programme. Digital technologies will be developed to help inform responsible consumption and production including digital twin (immersive technologies) and end-to-end monitoring. Ireland is below EU average for Responsible Consumption and Production, according to Eurostat's Monitoring Report of 2021 but progress is continuing to be made that will be further enabled by advancing Mount Lucas activities.  1.3.12 SDG13_Climate action The world is not on track to limit warming by 1.5 °C and only a major transition in the energy sector that includes substantial reduction in fossil fuel use, widespread electrification, improved energy efficiency and use of alternative fuels can halt what is becoming an irreversible warming trend [23 ] (Table 3 ). Ireland is below average for this important SDG as established by the 2021 edition of Eurostat's Monitoring Report. Peatlands are a unique system that constitute an important carbon sink globally [6 ,9 ]; but, this setting also represents an environment that my potentially provide a win-win scenario for new activities that could bring economic and social benefits while simultaneously reducing harm to our climate [2 ]. There is increasing anthropogenic-mediated destruction of natural resources caused by increasing frequent extreme weather events that will affect the supply of safe, affordable and nutritious food [24 ]. Mount Lucas presents a dynamic site such as monitoring changing climatic conditions representing high and low stress, altered rained patterns, carbon sink, increased frequency of extreme weather events [4 ] that is aligned with observations made by Mondejar et al. [15 ]. This can inform predictive and disease models for farmed fish welfare. Increased stress has been reported to negatively influence agroecosystem natural resilience that can affect food supply chains for food, feed and energy systems [25 ].  1.3.13 SDG14_Life below water This activity is currently addressed through the development of freshwater aquaculture with future provision for aquaponics (Table 3 ). It has a strongly linked ecotoxicology and biodiversity dimension to ensure an environmental balance. The aquatic microbiome in the aquaculture ponds has been profiled using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics. Fish health and welfare is also addressed through the One Health framework. Life below SDG aligns with multiple related research and innovation projects at Mount Lucas funded by the Environmental Protection Agency , Irish Research Council  and by the State Body ‘Bord Iascaigh Mhara’, which also promote youth, gender balance and voluntary activities including links to schools by way of tech-talks and demonstrations.  1.3.14 SDG15_ life on land Mount Lucas promotes pollination and ecosystem service management that includes a linked Environmental Protection Agency project exploring new sustainable interventions to address loss of pollinators by mitigating bee diseases (Table 3 ). Mount Lucas also promotes rewilding and biodiversity. Life on land topics feature in linked future and higher educational programmes that includes a diversity of projects delivered and supported up to and including level 10 (PhD).).  1.3.15 SDG16_Peace, justice and strong institutions Mount Lucas site supports a fair and just transition of communities to low carbon economies (Table 3 ). Core research at Mount Lucas has been informed by Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest that has been designated with ‘Sanctuary’ status. Mount Lucas also support connected humanitarian activities and networks with African countries (Table 3 ).  1.3.16 SDG17_Partnerships for the goals Mount Lucas supports multidisciplinary projects and networks that are strongly aligned with the core tenets of the United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals (Table 3 ). These range from social enterprises and commercialization of new products and services. These projects support strong partnership with stakeholders including industry, communities and local government regionally with a global orientation. Ireland is below average for this particular SDG as established by the 2021 edition of Eurostat's Monitoring Report. Mount Lucas activities will support Coalition 2030, which is an alliance of civil society organisations working to ensure that Ireland keeps its promise to achieve the SDGs, both at home, and abroad. Its mission is to transform our world through collaborative partnerships that will free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want, and to heal and secure our planet. Showcasing solidarity with those marginalised in society is a key value and organising principle of Coalition 2030, with goal of “leaving non-one behind”., both in Ireland and throughout the world. Coalition 2030 typifies SDG 17 as its membership comprises civil society organisations from the international aid, environmental, domestic equality and anti-poverty sectors, as well as trade unions and academic institutions. Notably, the issue-based expertise across the Coalition includes themes such as humanitarian relief, youth rights, disability rights, education, volunteering, health and environmental sustainability and so forth. Coalition 2030 engages across all 17 SDGs where its activities include policy and advocacy, research and training, public engagement, and communications. To.    2 Conclusion Development of peatland innovation offers the potential to create new employment for communities transitioning to low carbon economies. Freshwater aquaculture production using a closed-loop recirculation process not only supports the organic production of perch and trout, but also enables the commercial harvesting of duckweed as a novel source of high protein feeds. While there is a commensurate need to ensure environmental protection, biodiversity and effective carbon sequestration at this Mount-Lucas peatlands site, this case study reveals the potential of this site to enable a diversity of activities that are aligned with the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Digital technologies will accelerate real-time monitoring and efficiencies of peatland technologies including commercialization. However, there is a requirement to dual need to establish the long term commercial profitability and sustainability of peatland innovations that have the potential to contribute to new Green economy. The IMTA process and adjacent green innovation will support next generation of sustainable researchers trained in different disciplines that will underpin co-creation of new sustainable industries.
