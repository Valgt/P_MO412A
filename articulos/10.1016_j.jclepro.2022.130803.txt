                  Sustainable development goals (SDG) represent one of the pillars of the UN’s 2030 agenda aiming to secure a more sustainable future for all nations. The 17 goals comprising the SDG framework form a transformative action plan that is designed to help nations achieve a more sustainable future focusing on their environmental, social, and economic systems. Achieving the goals within the designated timeframe, however, entails overcoming multiple challenges related to policy design, resources management, and harnessing the synergies and trade-offs among the goals themselves. Recognizing the vital role modeling and simulation can play in facilitating the achievement of the SDG, this paper provides a review of the academic literature published between 2015 and 2021 relating to the models developed to tackle SDG related issues. The main purpose of this review is to explore the modeling practices related to SDG and to determine how aligned those modeling practices are with the priorities of sustainability science. We developed a multi-dimension classification scheme to categorize the models retrieved from the literature based on their main characteristics focusing on characteristics such as the modeling approach used, model uncertainty treatment, model temporal and spatial scales, and which science priority the model focuses on. The results of this research show that most of the models focused on studying policy changes needed to achieve the SDG and monitoring the progress of the SDG. The results also highlight missing important characteristics in SDG models such as cross-scale treatment and advanced uncertainty treatment. While this research can be valuable in informing modelers about the gaps need to be filled in SDG modeling and facilitates the communication between modelers and policy makers, it can be further extended by including an evaluation for the modeling approaches used in SDG contexts as well as adding more characteristics to the model categorization scheme.

Table 1    Model type Type code Type description   System dynamics SD This modeling technique represents the modelled system as a network of cause-and-effect relations between the system variables. The state of the system variables is represented by “stocks”, while the rates at which these variables change are represented by “flows”. SD is mainly suited to simulating the dynamic behavior of a certain system and the feedback reactions between the variables included in the model. This method is particularly useful for understanding and exploring different systems (Elsawah et al., 2017 ).  Agent based models ABM The system is expressed in terms of agents, objects, and environments. Agents are autonomous entities that behave according to a pre-defined set of rules. This type of models considered as a bottom-up approach and is powerful in representing multidisciplinary systems. As this method allows for stochastic representation of agents and objects, it is suitable for managing uncertainty (Epstein and Axtell, 1996 ; Boulanger and Bréchet, 2005 ).  Bayesian networks BN A Bayesian network is an acyclic directed graph, where variables are represented as nodes connected with arrows representing the causal effects between them (Aguilera et al., 2011 ). Due to their probabilistic nature, Bayesian networks are mainly used when uncertainty is a key consideration in the model (Kelly et al., 2013 ). Another strength of BNs is their ability to handle different types of data, as well as their ability to perform in cases in which variables have incomplete data or are latent. Although they don't have the ability to represent feedback loops, nor explicitly represent spatial and temporal dimensions, variations of the method, such as dynamic Bayesian networks and object-oriented Bayesian networks, can be used to overcome such limitations (Benjamin-Fink and Reilly, 2017 ).  Economic models ECON This family includes the models that utilize macro-economic analysis and are considered as top-down models. This family of models include CGE models, input-output models, and growth models (Van Beeck et al., 2000 ).  Econometric models ECT This family of models relies on a suite of statistical methods and techniques such as time series analysis, structural equation analysis, and are best suitable for predicting short to medium term future. These models are also useful in handling uncertainty (Allen et al., 2016 ; Van Beeck et al., 2000 ).  Integrated models IM This approach combines multiple components to leverage the strengths of different modeling techniques. They can be used for a wide range of applications due to their flexibility and customizability. Their ability to combine bottom-up and top-down techniques in one model means that they are able to overcome complex systems modeling challenges (Hamilton et al., 2015 ). Although integrated models can be developed using a single modeling approach or a combination of modeling approaches, their value comes from their focus on the integration of various loci in the modeling process, i.e. integration of multidisciplinary knowledge, integration of process, integration of temporal and spatial scales, or integration with stakeholders (Kelly et al., 2013 ). In the context of this analysis, we categorize a model as an “Integrated model” if the researcher states that integration is one of the model's intentions.  Knowledge based modeling KB Knowledge-based models uses the knowledge elicited from users and experts to make inference. They have the ability to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data, as well as to handle uncertainty through the use of fuzzy logic (Kelly et al., 2013 ).  Mathematical quantitative models MQM This type includes the models that rely on mathematical and analytical methods such as optimization models or linear programming models. One of their main drawbacks is that they require a high level of mathematical knowledge and are hard to communicate to stakeholders (Van Beeck et al., 2000 ).  Network models NM In network models, variables are represented as nodes connected with weighted edges, where the weights represent the levels of association among the nodes. They are mainly used to measure interlinkages, synergies, and trade-offs among system components (Newman, 2006 ).     Table 2 Sub-dimensions of the S1.3 model attributes dimensions.

Handling editor: Mingzhou Jin Sustainable development goals (SDG) represent one of the pillars of the UN’s 2030 agenda aiming to secure a more sustainable future for all nations. The 17 goals comprising the SDG framework form a transformative action plan that is designed to help nations achieve a more sustainable future focusing on their environmental, social, and economic systems. Achieving the goals within the designated timeframe, however, entails overcoming multiple challenges related to policy design, resources management, and harnessing the synergies and trade-offs among the goals themselves. Recognizing the vital role modeling and simulation can play in facilitating the achievement of the SDG, this paper provides a review of the academic literature published between 2015 and 2021 relating to the models developed to tackle SDG related issues. The main purpose of this review is to explore the modeling practices related to SDG and to determine how aligned those modeling practices are with the priorities of sustainability science. We developed a multi-dimension classification scheme to categorize the models retrieved from the literature based on their main characteristics focusing on characteristics such as the modeling approach used, model uncertainty treatment, model temporal and spatial scales, and which science priority the model focuses on. The results of this research show that most of the models focused on studying policy changes needed to achieve the SDG and monitoring the progress of the SDG. The results also highlight missing important characteristics in SDG models such as cross-scale treatment and advanced uncertainty treatment. While this research can be valuable in informing modelers about the gaps need to be filled in SDG modeling and facilitates the communication between modelers and policy makers, it can be further extended by including an evaluation for the modeling approaches used in SDG contexts as well as adding more characteristics to the model categorization scheme.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Modelling and simulation  Sustainability science  2030 Agenda  Uncertainty  Decision support    1 Introduction The sustainable development goals (SDGs) framework is one of the pillars of the United Nations’ 2030 agenda which aims to achieve a better and more prosperous future for Earth and its inhabitants. The set of 17 overarching goals, with their subsequent 169 targets,1  1 For a full list of Sustainable Development Goals, Targets, and indicators, see: https://sdgs.un.org/goals .   represents an ambitious transformative action plan addressing critical grand challenges pertinent to the environmental, social, and economic aspects of modern societies UN (2015) . The United Nation's member states are expected to adopt the SDGs framework as a roadmap to guide their development and investment plans, to keep track of their progress toward achieving the goals during the designated time frame of 15 years (OECD and Paris, 2017 ; Allen et al., 2018 ). National endeavours toward accomplishing SDGs entail overcoming multiple hurdles such as prioritizing goals and targets, tailoring national strategies and policies to conform with the SDGs, managing trade-offs and capitalizing on the synergies among the goals, and securing sufficient resources to facilitate the transformation toward more sustainable development agendas (Plag and Jules-Plag, 2019 ; Messerli et al., 2019 ; Saito et al., 2017 ). These challenges originate from the innate characteristics of the SDGs as an integrated and indivis ible framework that need to be approached in a holistic manner, as well as being intertwined and interconnected with existing conflicts among the goals with environmental focus and those related to economic and social development (Scherer et al., 2018 ; Nilsson et al., 2018 ; Swain, 2018 ). Additionally, the SDGs are designed to be a universal set of goals, that are applicable in all national contexts, i.e. apt for all nations regardless their level of development, however, such universality means that they do not consider the particular conditions of the nation applying them. Consequently, their potential to transform the governance practices of those nations into a more sustainable ones can be questionable (Easterly, 2015 ; Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ; Cuaresma et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the ingrained uncertainty regarding the goals' trade-offs, feedback impacts, or application at different scales and contexts means that attaining the SDGs is a “super wicked” problem that requires unconventional interventions (Allen et al., 2018 , 2021 ; Georgeson and Maslin, 2018 ; Cuaresma et al., 2018 ). In order to manage the different complexities inherent in planning for achieving the SDGs, policymakers will need to rely on a suite of decision support techniques and methodologies that enhances their analytical capabilities as well as increases their confidence in the decisions they make. Acknowledging the inadequacy of traditional techniques such as cost-benefit analysis or macroeconomic modeling in tackling complex sustainability issues in general and SDGs challenges in particular (DeCanio, 2003 ; Scrieciu, 2007 ; Haldane and Turrell, 2018 ; Stiglitz, 2018 ; Meyer and Ahlert, 2019 ), various research activities have sought to develop and apply sophisticated techniques that are more capable of managing the complexities associated with SDGs (Howells et al., 2013 ; Joshi et al., 2015 ; Kumar et al., 2018 ; Almannaei et al., 2020 ). The majority of the techniques deemed effective in guiding policymakers' endeavours to achieve SDGs fall under the umbrella of modeling and simulation and form what is known as “model-based decision support systems” (Allen et al., 2016 ; Abson et al., 2017 ; Arnold et al., 2020 ). These contemporary techniques or the models built using them, however, need to have a certain set of attributes in order to be well-suited to the task of attaining the SDGs and to overcome the challenges associated with them in harmony with long-term sustainability. One of the fundamental attributes that is essential in the approaches and techniques used to inform decision making in the context of SDGs is that they need to utilize systems thinking in order to realize the multiple interactions and contradictions among the economic, ecological, and social components of the SDGs (Liu et al., 2008 ; van Delden et al., 2011 ; Miller et al., 2014 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Spaiser et al., 2017 ; Salling et al., 2018 ; Scherer et al., 2018 ; Allen et al., 2018 ). The Integrated and multi-disciplinary scope of the used models has also been recognized as a key attribute to understand the interactions, trade-offs, and synergies among the SDGs (Allen et al., 2018 ; Moon, 2017 ). Additional highly desirable attributes are capacity of the model's to capture the uncertainties accompanying the analysis, planning for, and implementation of the SDGs (Allen et al., 2019 ), in addition to the models' applicability to multiple temporal and spatial scales, and their ability to measure the impacts on the socio-environmental-economic systems (Elsawah et al., 2020 ; Moon, 2017 ). Comprehending the position of the models currently used in SDGs research of those attributes and delineating their dominant characteristics represent an important step toward enhancing a suite of techniques critical for achieving SDGs and overcoming different issues related to them. Previous reviews mainly tried to describe how scientific literature is concerned with the SDGs by examining a large number of publications that are related to the goals, e.g. Asatani et al. (2020) ; Meschede (2020) ; Armitage et al. (2020) . Apart from those universal reviews, others attempted to include modeling in their review, however, they were either focused on a single type of models, e.g. Pedercini et al. (2018) , or discussed models and sustainability in general such as Boulanger and Bréchet (2005) . To address those issues, this research reviews the literature on SDGs modeling to answer the following questions:1. What are the prevalent modeling techniques currently used in modeling SDGs?  2. Where do the models developed to address SDG issues fit in the priorities of sustainability science?  3. What are the main characteristics of the models currently used in modeling SDGs?    The analysis in this work was conducted on literature that discuss models including single or multiple SDGs. In doing so, we aim to provide a more detailed view of the characteristics of the models pertaining to each SDG and to understand how the scientific community interested in that SDG undertakes modeling efforts related to it. The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we report on a review of the previous research focused on modeling sustainability and SDGs. Second, an overview is provided of the methodology used in this research. Next, we present the analysis and findings of the research. Finally, the implications of the findings are discussed along with highlights of research gaps and potential future research avenues.  2 Methodology The scope of the review presented in this paper is directed toward the SDG framework and the different types of models directly and explicitly related to it. Publications having general sustainability themes or discussing models in sustainability contexts are not within the scope. Prior to applying the research methodology illustrated in Fig. 1  , a couple of assumptions have been made to guide the steps of the methodology. First, as our aim is to investigate the models or the modeling research efforts carried out with the SDGs in mind, we only consider the articles published after the declaration of the SDG framework, i.e. the articles published from 2015 onward. This approach has been followed by multiple reviews related to SDGs, such as Bennich et al. (2020) , del Río Castro et al. (2020), Armitage et al. (2020) , Asatani et al. (2020) , and Bordignon (2021) . The second assumption is related to the SDG focused keywords used in the search query. Research efforts attempting to locate scientific output discussing SDGs usually follow one of two approaches: the first is to use search terms formed by combining keywords and phrases directly excerpted from the UN's SDG documents and textual data such as NETWORK (2020) , Olawumi et al. (2017) , Asatani et al. (2020) , and Jayabalasingham et al. (2019) . The second approach seeks to acquire contextual data regarding the SDGs rather than just the documents referring directly to the goals, e.g. retrieving all the documents discussing the contexts of SDG1 by using terms like “poor households” or “social protection”. Researchers who use subject area terms instead of exact terms claim that this approach returns more relevant results that have a wider scope (Bordignon, 2021 ; Armitage et al., 2020 ). However, using the first approach yields scientific output that is deliberate in including the SDGs in its research agenda, as well as reflecting an awareness of the SDGs and their subsequent indicators (Bennich et al., 2020 ; Allen et al., 2021 ; Meschede, 2020 ). Within the context of this research we adopt the method of excerpting directly from the SDGs texts as this method serves the purpose of this review by limiting the search results to the ones deliberately centered around the SDG framework. The methodology outlined in Fig. 1  comprises six main steps. S1  focuses on determining the classification basis for the literature that will be collected in later steps. In order to answer the research questions raised in the introduction, three classification dimensions, each of which is related to a certain research question, will be applied to the retrieved articles. S2  includes setting the proper keywords that will be used to run the search query in order to retrieve the most relevant papers. S3  is to choose the database to be searched and retrieve the search results. S4  involves screening the retrieved results and selecting the relevant literature. S5  includes applying the classification scheme determined in S1  on the relevant set of articles resulting from S4 . S6  consists of the analysis of the classified articles, both those discussing modeling of multiple SDGs and those whose focal point is modeling a single SDG. Each of the steps is discussed in detail in the following sections. 2.1 Papers classification scheme (S1) This step includes three sub-steps described in the following sections, each of which determines a classification dimension related to one of the aforementioned research questions. It is worth noting that the order of the sub-steps is not of particular significance. 2.1.1 Model typology classification (S1.1) S1.1  aims to determine a typology for the models used in modeling SDGs based on the modeling approach applied. Establishing a models' typology and categorizing the models based on that typology allows comparison of the models and exploring the utility of their subsequent methodologies and techniques for representing SDGs. Such comparison also facilitates exploration of the models’ strengths and weaknesses, as well as indicating which models are most appropriate for the different types of issues associated with each of the SDGs (Nicholson, 2007 ). Despite the increasing use of models in the field of sustainability science, and the realization of the importance of model classification, a standardized model categorization scheme is still lacking Allen et al. (2016) . However, a few efforts have been made to provide a model typology; for instance, Boulanger and Bréchet (2005)  categorized the models used in sustainability sciences based on the five most pressing issues related to that science, and hence recommended six candidate models for sustainable development: macro-econometric models, computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, optimization models, system dynamics models, multi-agent models, and Bayesian networks. Moffatt (2006)  introduced a different classification which included additional types such as database models, GIS models, and entropy maximizing models. A more holistic classification that focused on model families instead of single techniques was suggested by Allen et al. (2016)  and Van Beeck et al. (2000)  who bundled together models with similar characteristics and presented types such as bottom-up simulation models, bottom-up optimization models, top-down system dynamics models, and hybrid models. This latter classification, however, neglects other types of models that can be very beneficial for sustainability sciences, such as network models, Bayesian networks, and knowledge based models (Kelly et al., 2013 ). Based on these classifications and the new trends in modeling issues related to sustainability, we selected the eight sub-dimensions presented in Table 1   to be used for the literature classification.  2.1.2 Sustainability science priority classification (S1.2) The S1.2 classification dimension is related to the role played by science in advancing and accomplishing the SDGs. Since their adoption in 2015, the SDGs have motivated a growing research agenda dedicated to solving global sustainability problems and progressing the goals (Saito et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, the slow progress toward achieving the SDGs, partly caused by the limited human ability to design evidence-based transformative sustainable strategies, has prompted multiple researchers to focus on exploring how sustainability-related scientific output can be more effective in supporting the achievement of the goals (Messerli et al., 2019 ; Schneider et al., 2019 ). Based on a review of this line of research, Allen et al. (2021)  describes these priorities as:• Pr.1  Monitoring and evaluating the progress toward achieving the SDGs.  • Pr.2  Understanding and managing the synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs, and the design of interconnections-aware policies.  • Pr.3  Managing the transformations required to achieve the SDGs, which also entails studying policy changes and exploring different scenarios that can help in expediting the accomplishment of SDGs.  • Pr.4  Ensuring that achieving SDGs is consistent with preserving the planetary boundaries and guaranteeing a safe space for humanity.    The retrieved SDGs modeling literature is classified based on which of the four most relevant priorities in order to evaluate how balanced the modeling efforts are in terms of their relevance to the science priorities. This classification also reflects the potential of models to bridge the gap between academic efforts and policy making for each of the four priorities.  2.1.3 Model attribute classification (S1.3) The third and final classification dimension comprises three sub-dimensions associated with the model's spatial scale, uncertainty treatment, and time treatment. The importance of the first sub-dimension originates from the fact that integration of actions across local, national, regional, and global levels is necessary for the achievement of the SDGs (Stevens, 2018 ; Downing et al., 2021 ). Acknowledging the importance of such consistent cross-scale integration, the 2030 sustainable development agenda requires UN members to set their own national targets to conform with the global targets (UN, 2015 ). Incorporating this multi-scale view in models, however, is a challenging task that requires having different levels of knowledge and data about those sub-systems at the considered scales (Elsawah et al., 2020 ). In order to survey how SDG models handle the issue of multiple scales across the sub-systems, a Cross Scale (CS)  category was added to the Model spatial scale. The second model attribute to be monitored indicates how uncertainty is treated. Since uncertainty is consistently stated as one of the major aspects to be accounted for when studying and modeling SDGs (Allen et al., 2019 ), we are interested in the explicit consideration of uncertainty and not just the statistical error reporting that naturally comes with some economic and econometric models as this error and confidence reporting is more suited for indicating statistical significance without real value in informing decisions under uncertainty (McShane et al., 2019 ; Wasserstein et al., 2019 ; Gelman and Carlin, 2017 ). Uncertainty, herein, is seen as the lack of clarity about the present and future behavior of the social, environmental, and economic systems targeted by the SDGs (Sharif and Irani, 2017 ). This view can be extended to include the effects of the design options made during the model building process, and how those design options affect the model performance and its final outcome (Elsawah et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, an extensive consideration of uncertainty considers the combined effect of the different sources of uncertainty, or what is termed as deep uncertainty  (Maier et al., 2016 ). Based on this view of the different types of uncertainty, three sub-dimensions were defined for model uncertainty treatment, a) the model does not account for uncertainty in anyway, b) the model includes basic error reporting techniques such as confidence intervals or root square error, and c) the model considers an extended view of uncertainty. Various methodologies have been developed for dealing with uncertainty (see for example Refsgaard et al. (2007)  and Elsawah et al. (2020) ), however the methods utilized by the models covered in this research are presented in more detail in the analysis and discussion section. The final sub-dimension indicates whether the model is able to perform analysis over a certain time frame, or whether it is only intended to evaluate a certain point in time, i.e. Dynamic or Static. Table 2   shows the possible values, description, and codes of each of the three sub-dimensions of the S1.3 dimension.   2.2 Search queries design (S2) This second step covers the design of the keywords to be used as search queries to retrieve the documents that discuss modeling of SDGs. The selection of search queries is an important step in the analysis as it has a significant effect on the relevance of the retrieved documents and their ability to answer the research questions. Such a step becomes more critical when tackling topics such as the SDGs that have caused much discussion. This is mainly because terms related to the goals are used “loosely” within research papers, so that the existence of terminology related to SDGs in an article does not in any way mean that the article provide a direct concrete contribution to the topic (Armitage et al., 2020 ). The same concept applies to the topic of “modeling and simulation”, as its terminology is used in several contexts beyond the scope of this research. An effective search query should not be too narrow and complex, nor so broad that it becomes prone to polysemy and false positive results (Bordignon, 2021 ). As stated in the assumptions at the beginning of this section, we limited our search using terminology matching that used in description of each goal writing with the intention to, first, retrieve only documents whose authors explicitly link their work to the SDGs, and second, to retain specificity to the goals. Fig. 2  , illustrates the fields used to run the search. The fields can be divided into three main levels: keywords related to modeling and simulation; SDGs keywords; the conditions define the search temporal scope, document types, and language. The exact keywords used for the search at each level are included in the Appendix Table (A2).  2.3 Selection of database and literature search (S3) In this third step, the search keywords combinations established in step S2  were used to search the title, abstract, and keywords of publications in two different multidisciplinary scientific databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). Previous research analyzing the content of the two databases discovered considerable discrepancies in the coverage of the two databases in terms of the number of publications as well as the covered subject areas (Mongeon and Paul-Hus, 2016 ; Gavel and Iselid, 2008 ). Therefore, including search results from the two databases in the analysis enabled us to draw more accurate conclusions. As shown in Fig. 2 , we limited our search to the documents published between 2015 and 2021 as the SDGs were initiated in 2015. We also designated three types of documents to be retrieved: Paper articles, Conference proceedings, and Book chapters. Finally, only English documents were considered. The Scopus search returned 552 results, and the WoS search returned only 203 documents.  2.4 Search results screening and selection relevant papers (S4) Prior to filtering the retrieved articles and extracting the most relevant ones, the two sets of documents from the two databases \are combined and the duplicate results removed, which resulted in a set of 659 unique documents. Then, the unique search results are reviewed and manually filtered according to the following relevance criteria:1. Only papers that have direct contribution to SDGs were retained. For example, a large number of papers include statements such as “This research will help in achieving the SDGs”  or “The 2030  agenda recommends that … "  without the article topic being directly related to the SDGs, nor contributing to any of the science priorities.  2. Only papers that present a model or discuss a modeling technique are retained. The retained papers include those proposing qualitative and quantitative models as long as they utilized one of the approaches mentioned in Table 1 . Some papers described the use of certain computer software as a model, while others used the terms “model” and “modeling” in irrelevant contexts such as building an information model”  or “topic modeling".     Based on these two filtration criteria, 101 papers were selected. In addition to these 101 papers that discuss modeling of multiple SDGs, the papers that focus on individual SDG were collected in a separate set. This resulted in 17 additional sets each of which related to one of the SDGs. The number of papers included in each of the 17 sets are shown in Table A1  modeling. 2.4.1 Article model classification (S5) After determining the most relevant modeling papers that discusses multiple SDGs and single SDGs, each of the papers was manually classified according to the dimensions presented in step S1 . Table 3   summarizes the number of papers at each of the sub-dimensions and the details of the paper classification are in Table SM2 Paper classification in the supplementary materials.   2.5 Articles analysis (S6) This step concludes the methodology by performing analysis and drawing conclusions based on the retrieved documents and their classification. The following section presents the details of the analysis.   3 Results Application of steps S1  to S5  outlined in Fig. 1  enabled the collection and classification of the literature ad-dressing the utilization of modeling and simulation in SDG contexts. This section provides the results of analyzing the selected papers which discuss modeling the SDGs. While the main focus of this section ison the literature including multiple SDGs in the models (the set of selected 101 papers), it also presents a brief analysis for the literature discussing single SDGs. 3.1 Overview of the retrieved scientific literature An overview of the collected documents indicates that modeling applications for SDGs have grown rapidly from 3 publications in 2015, i.e. the initiation of the agenda, to 28 publications in 2020. In terms of the distribution of the models tackling the different science priorities, as shown in Fig. 3  , most of the modeling efforts have focused on Priority 3  i.e. Managing the transformation required to achieve the SDGs. This trend rises monotonically unlike the trends of the other priorities which fluctuate. Priority 2 , i.e. understanding and managing the synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs was the second which modeling activities focused on. This interest is aligned with the rapidly evolving field of studying the SDG interactions and the increasing amount of literature produced discussing this topic. Science Priority 1,  i.e. monitoring and evaluating the progress toward achieving the SDGs, did not gain traction until recently which can be attributed to the fact that the modeling community needed first to decipher the new framework and understand its dynamics. Science Priority 4,  i.e. ensuring that achieving the SDGs is consistent with preserving the planetary boundaries, was the focus of the least number of models despite the concerns raised in recent years that achievement of the SDGs does not necessarily guarantee the achievement of long-term sustainability. A review of the network of sources of the collected articles (Fig. 4  )2  2 The publications network analysis was performed using the free software tool VOS viewer (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010 ).   shows that they mostly came from multidisciplinary journals or sustainability oriented journals. “The Journal of Cleaner Production” and “Nature Energy” were the most common, followed by “Sustainability (Switzerland), “Ecological Economics”, and “Sustainability Science”. The absence of simulation-oriented publications is an indication that the simulation and modeling community still has significant role to play in advancing sustainability sciences. In addition to the sources of the publications, Fig. 4  also shows additional information about each: the year of the publication represented by the color of the nodes in the network and the number of citations represented by the size of the node. We then looked on the most prevalent modeling techniques applied in the context of SDGs. As Fig. 5   illustrates, 41% of the models included in the considered publications were developed using an integrated modeling approach. The ability of this technique to combine multiple modeling approaches and balance the strengths and weaknesses of such approaches, means that it is an efficient choice to model the complex issues associated with SDGs. Additionally, when used in multidisciplinary research, it allows participating parties from different backgrounds to combine the techniques that are most suitable to each of them, which increases the model's usability. Econometric techniques are also commonly used as well as network modeling and system dynamics as they represented 17%, 10%, and 9% respectively of the developed models. The common use of these techniques, particularly econometrics and network analysis, conforms with the sustainability science priorities in Fig. 3  as they are mostly used for evaluation and modeling of different policies in order to test their impacts on achievement of the SDGs as well as analyzing the interdependencies among the goals. Fig. 5  shows that techniques such as Bayesian networks and Agent based modelingmodeling are under-utilized as they, combined, represent less than 5% of the developed models. The performance of the other two model attributes, i.e. spatial treatment and temporal treatment, is presented in Fig. 6  , which shows that there was little variation in the temporal treatment in the models with the number of static models being 55 and the dynamic models are 46. In terms of spatial scales, global and national models represented the highest ratio. The dominance of modeling applications on national and global scales reflects how SDGs are lacking in the level of detail required for them to be applicable at more aggregate levels, and that aiding indicators are needed for the models to be beneficial for sustainability at finer spatial scales Fioramonti et al. (2019) ; Bahadur et al. (2015) . Moreover, only 5 models attempted to address the cross scale issue  when modeling SDGs. Within the collected documents, only four publications presented models that addressed multiple scales. Aguiar et al. (2020)  proposed a novel approach to develop SDG achieving scenarios that integrate global perspectives with national planning efforts. Their method incorporates a participatory process where stakeholders representing different scales provide insights about alternative pathways for achieving SDGS. Shaaban et al. (2021)  attempted to build an integrated model to measure the impact of different agents’ behavior on achieving the SDGs in agricultural contexts. They handled the cross-scale problem by integrating different modeling techniques, each of which is known to be effective in managing multiple scales in the model. Another model that aimed to use global sustainability conditions to guide local land use patterns was developed by Heck et al. (2018)  who applied a top-down approach to model the synergies and trade-offs among different SDGs at different scales. Finally, Lucas et al. (2020)  utilized a down scaling approach to model the impacts of changes in the critical Earth systems on national plans to achieve the SDGs. In terms of uncertainty, 41.5% of the models did not include any uncertainty treatment as shown in Fig. 7  . For the models that had a view of uncertainty beyond the basic error reporting, we found that seven methods have been mostly used for uncertainty treatment. Scenario modeling was by far the most used technique to account for uncertainty in models as they represented 37% of the models included uncertainty treatment. This method is recognized as one of the most effective methods to handle uncertainty particularly for models serving decision making proposes (Liu et al., 2008 ). Using this method, the modelers investigate a suite of plausible future scenarios to evaluate potential risks and opportunities as well as the implications of different decisions (Allen et al., 2016 ). The other most used methods included Bayesian analysis, multi-model analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Bayesian inference is used to represent model parameters in a probabilistic manner and can also reflect the uncertainty about model structure (Renard et al., 2010 ), multi-model simulation on the other hand focuses on the uncertainty about model structure as assessment is performed using alternative models for the same systems (Butts et al., 2004 ). The three least-used methods were model experiments, expert elicitation, and exploratory analysis. In the final part of this section we draw a holistic picture of the relationship among three of the main attributes measured for the collected models: the science priority targeted by the model, the modeling technique utilized by the model, and the spatial scale incorporated in the model. The relationships among these three attributes are represented by the diagram in Fig. 8  , which shows how the choice of the modeling technique is affected by the science priority targeted by the model, as well as showing how the chosen modeling technique is related to the treatment of space. For science priorities 1, 3  and 4 , i.e. monitoring and evaluating the progress toward achieving the SDGs, managing the policy transformations required to achieve the SDGs, and ensuring that achieving the SDGs in consistent with preserving the planetary boundaries respectively, integrated modeling was the dominant modeling technique, since targeting those three priorities is closely related to dealing with the underlying social, environmental, and economic systems, therefore the used modeling technique needs to be able to incorporate knowledge across different disciplines as well as having the ability to make use of existing models to form a bigger more informative model. In terms of spatial treatment, integrated modeling approaches also proved to be suitable for applications most of the scales, and particularly for cross-scale dimension. We can also see that at national levels, econometric models are extensively used. This can mainly be due to the availability of data used by the models on national levels. In general, the relationships among the three variables indicate the value of integrated modeling in advancing the science priorities and how more efforts need to be directed toward advancing science priorities 1  and 4 .  3.2 How modeling addresses the four science priorities This section focuses on the details of the alignment between the models and the priorities of sustainability science. In order to do so, we map each of the science priorities to the models used to address it, then inspect the characteristics of these models. Fig. 9   gives an overview about the size of representation of each priority as well as the modeling techniques used in relation to that priority. At the very outer level, the figure shows the proportion of the models that considered uncertainty as a core part of the model development process. Although most of the models were not developed around the sustainability science priorities, they help to fulfil the priorities even if they do so unintentionally. The modeling efforts related to each of the four science priorities are discussed in more details in sub sections 3.2.1  , 3.2.2  , 3.2.3  , and 3.2.4  . 3.2.1 Modeling efforts related to science priority 1 The percentage of models in the collected literature that can support science Priority 1:  Monitoring and evaluating the progress toward achieving the SDGs  was found to be only 14%, however, integrated modeling was used in 43% of these models. Reid et al. (2019) , for example, integrated three sub models related to monitoring the environmental and social systems in order to measure the progress in goals#2, #6, #13, #14, and #15. Similarly, Long et al. (2020) , established the key steps for achieving sustainability in an island community, and measured how pursuing these steps contributes to progressing the SDGs. Their model included social, physical, and economic sub-models. In general, researchers who applied integrated modeling under the umbrella of science priority one, benefited from the ability of the technique to deal with multiple systems concurrently, and seamlessly integrate different data collection methods, especially with advances of observation systems such as GIS. Additionally, being able to build a model based on existing sub-models, facilitated the validation of the final product and increased the level of confidence in the results (Kebede et al., 2020 ; Marsh et al., 2016 ; Kostoska and Kocarev, 2019 ). The second most common type of models that was used for the same priority, is econometric models which were used mainly to model applications related to business and their contribution to achieve the SDGs. Those business oriented applications mainly utilized the abilities of econometric models in dealing with vast amount of data that comes from different sources and includes multiple inconsistencies (Heravi et al., 2015 ; Rasoolimanesh et al., 2019 ; Alipour et al., 2019 ). A small portion of the models in this group utilized the technique of system dynamics. They mainly relied on this technique due to the dynamic nature of the system they intended to model, as well as being interested in measuring the feedback effects within their mode (Spaiser et al., 2019 ; Pedercini et al., 2018 ).  3.2.2 Modeling efforts related to science priority 2 ModelingmodelingThe number of papers related to science Priority 2:  Understanding and managing the synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs  is almost equal to those related to the first priority, with priority 1 representing 17% of the models and priority 1 representing 14%. The most used modeling approach for priority 2 is network modeling (41%), which is in fact one of the most favored techniques for studying the interlinkages among SDGs (Bennich et al., 2020 ). Researchers apply network modeling to study the trade-offs and synergies among the SDGs, capitalizing on the technique's ability to produce data-driven models that efficiently handle big-data available at multiple sources (Sebestyén et al., 2019 ; Zelinka and Amadei, 2019 ). Another important feature of network models appropriate to the second science priority is how it can map different types of real life complex systems, e.g. social and environmental systems (Weitz et al., 2018 ; Lim et al., 2018 ). Moreover, unlike other techniques such systems dynamics, the structure of the networks enable its user to investigate causalities in modelled systems, therefore it can be used to unravel complex interactions among a large number of variables (Dörgo et al., 2018 ). Integrated models represented 18% of the models addressed priority 2 because of their ability to model complex systems that include different components that have inconsistent natures was one of the major factors influencing researchers' selection. In addition, researchers also appreciated their ability to comprise trusted and reliable sub-models which reduced the overall uncertainty of the integrated model Forouli et al. (2020) ; Moyer and Hedden (2020) . Integrated models were also used because of their ability to capture the changes in different systems with great accuracy which, when coupled with components to measure the changes in the SDGs, revealed the underlying interconnections among the SDGs (Banerjee et al., 2019 ; Heck et al., 2018 ; Mainali et al., 2018 ).  3.2.3 Modeling efforts related to science priority 3 Science Priority 3:  Managing the policy transformations required to achieve the SDGs  originates from the view of SDGs as a transformative agenda because in their essence they require serious changes to current practices and strategies in order for them to progress at a satisfactory rate (Randers et al., 2018 ). As the scientific community began to understand how drastic and deep those changes need to be, it gave tremendous focus to framing those changes, as a result, our analysis shows that the third science priority is the most researched among the four priorities. Research also put special emphasis on the inadequacy of conventional modeling techniques to handle and manage the policy transformations needed to make meaningful progress toward a more sustainable future (Pedercini et al., 2020 ). This view is echoed in the modeling efforts related to this third science priority. As it appears in Figs. 9  and 45% of the modelingmodels related to priority 3 are developed using integrated modeling. The papers related to this context frequently utilize a combination of existing models that are academically recognized, such as IMAGE (Van Vuuren et al., 2017 ), AIM (Fujimori et al., 2017 ), or WITCH (Emmerling et al., 2016 ). In relation to SDGs, these models either use a single or a group of SDGs as an end target then apply the model to backcast the policy changes needed to achieve this goal (Fujimori et al., 2019 ; Vishwanathan and Garg, 2020 ; Grubler et al., 2018 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ), or develop different scenarios based national contexts and test them regarding their impacts on progressing SDGs (Pedercini et al., 2018 ; Mulligan et al., 2020 ; Grubler et al., 2018 ; Llorca et al., 2020 ; Rao et al., 2016 ; Allen et al., 2019 ). Econometric models represented the second most commonly used models for science priority three as 20% of the models was developed using this technique. Although they are not as effective as advanced modeling techniques such as integrated modeling, they are common in social science and business applications (Zaini and Akhtar, 2019 ; Tiyarattanachai and Chhang, 2019 ; Ul Hassan and Naz, 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2020 ). System dynamics models were also for 9% of the models as they allow policy makers to explore the impacts of their decisions on the long term and how different variables in the system can respond to those decisions at the future.  3.2.4 Modeling efforts related to science priority 4 Science Priority 4:  Ensuring that achieving the SDGs is consistent with preserving the planetary boundaries and guaranteeing a safe space for humanity  is related to the existing contradictions in the SDGs that have been argued by different researchers whose concern was that the frame-work favors economic aspects of development over those that have an environmental focus (del Río Castro et al., 2020 ; Hickel, 2019 ). Evidence from different countries showed that progress toward social and economic goals, such as SDGs 1 & 10, had adverse impacts on the environmentally focused goals (Barbier and Burgess, 2017 ; Scherer et al., 2018 ). These contradictions mean that the achievement of SDGs does not entail following a sustainable development path, on the contrary, it can indicate a deviation from that path due to the unwise use of resources particularly for developing countries (Dasgupta et al., 2021 ). To avoid such a predicament, some researchers proposed using complementary indicators to ensure that by achieving the sustainable development goals, nations do not compromise long-term sustainability (Saito et al., 2017 ; Dasgupta et al., 2021 ; Pothen and Welsch, 2019 ). Moreover, another concern related to how expediting the achievement of the SDGs may have adverse effects on a nation's capital assets, is that eroding the resources base of a country increases their vulnerability to disasters and hazards, and consequently, decreases their resilience (Yonehara et al., 2017 ; Bamberger et al., 2016 ). Balancing the achievement of the SDGs and maintenance of the Earth's stock of resources to ensure a sustainable and safe future for all is the focal point of the fourth science priority. It is suggested that this can be achieved through the integration of the SDGs and other frameworks that put more focus on resources preservation and maintenance of the planetary boundaries (Plag and Jules-Plag, 2019 ; Dasgupta et al., 2021 ; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). This task, however, is not a trivial one (Häyhä et al., 2016 ) and modeling can play an effective role in realizing it (Allen et al., 2021 ). So far, modelingthe modeling efforts that have been made toward this end are scarce. Among the notable efforts is the work of Heck et al. (2018)  in which integrated modeling was used to assess land-use options against their impacts on planetary boundaries. They did also consider the land uses that contribute to achieving certain SDGs. Lucas et al. (2020)  attempted to operationalize the concept of planetary boundaries and apply it on a national scale utilizing scenario modeling to advise SDGs target setting.  3.2.5 Modeling single SDGs Fewer models have been developed to tackle issues related to a single SDGs than the ones developed to handle multiple SDGs, as only 83 models have been located in literature covering the 17 SDGs (see Table A1  for the number of papers related to each SDG). This is mainly because of the nature of the SDGs as an indivisible and universal framework. However, for the existing models in which a single SDG is investigated, SDGs 2 and 6 were the most common with 11 papers for each (as shown in Fig. 10  ). SDG 2 pertains to ending hunger, achieving food security, and promoting sustainable agricultural. The models related to SDG 2 only covered science priorities 1 and 3, with more models covering priority 3. The models focusing on policy issues, i.e. priority 3, attempt to handle issues such the role of investment in developing countries for advances of SDG2, or how farming policies can affect food security (Mason-D’Croz et al., 2019 ; Scott et al., 2020 ; Gyasi et al., 2021 ; Ritchie et al., 2018 ). The models related to monitoring the progress of SDG 2, hence contributing to science priority 1, used mainly econometric models with one model only relying on system dynamics (see Kopainsky et al. (2018) ). SDG 6, related to ensuring the availability and sustainability of water resources, gained a lot of focus as well with applications covering science priorities 2 and 3, however, one of the papers discussing it applied data driven approach to develop a Bayesian network to its interactions with other component of the 2030 UN agenda (Requejo-Castro et al., 2020 ). Most of the papers in this group, i.e. the ones related to a single SDG, fall under science priorities 1 and 3, however, SDG 4, 7, 11, and 12 contained papers relating to priority number 4. Under SDG 7, for example, Tiba and Belaid (2021)  used a suite of econometric models to estimate how renewable energy can contribute to achieving SDG 7 as well as having positive impacts on long term sustainability including its social, environmental, and economic aspects.

First, despite the important role that models play in tackling issues related to SDGs and to sustainability in general (Pedercini et al., 2020 ; Allen et al., 2016 ), research shows that they have a limited impact on decision making and that very few models are directly used to influence legislation (Will et al., 2021 ). Among the main causes of this limited use of models are the lack of a common language between modelers and policy makers and the mismanaged expectations of policy makers concerning the models' capabilities and aspects (Will et al., 2021 ; Gilbert et al., 2018 ). When policy makers cannot understand how the models are developed and what assumptions affect the model output, they, in such cases, see models as black boxes that can only be handled by modelers which reduces their trust and acceptability of the models (Gilbert et al., 2018 ). Communicating models' aspects to decision makers can be a challenging task for modelers as the former do not have much knowledge about the modeling techniques and do not have much interest in knowing the technical details of the model (Harris and Howes, 2005 ). The multi dimension classification of the models used in SDGs' contexts helps in simplifying the communication between decision makers and modelers as the classification makes it easier to discuss the model characteristics and link them to the model purpose. Having that type of model typology can also help in the cases where multiple models are developed for the same purpose as it will facilitate the conversation between policy makers, stakeholders, and the model developers. Additionally, when the model users understand the design decisions that were taken by modelers, they can put the model into better use which will, consequently, increases the model's utility (Mayer et al., 2017 ). That effective communication between modelers and policy makers is particularly important at the early stages of the collaboration between them, i.e. at the agenda setting, problem framing, and conceptual modeling stages (Jann and Wegrich, 2017 ; McIntosh et al., 2007 ). The decisions taken at these stages, either the ones related to policy or the ones related to the model design, are influenced to a great extent by the mental frameworks of the collaborating parties (Moallemi et al., 2020 ). These mental frameworks, or mental models, reflect the parties' perception of reality and their understanding of the problem and how to approach it (Blacketer et al., 2021 ; Gray et al., 2012 ). Having an inconsistent shared mental model between policy makers and modelers can cause conflicts as well as leading to undesirable model performance (Lai et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, having a consistent shared mental model increases the policy makers' inclination toward adopting the model as well as enhancing its performance (Hall et al., 2014 ). Therefore, it is important that policy makers are able to understand, to some extent, the modeling choices made by the modelers and be aware of the model design aspects (Voinov et al., 2018 ; Smajgl, 2015 ). By revealing and delineating some of the SDG models' design aspects, this research implicitly participates in facilitating the communication between policy makers and modelers. Additionally, the results of this research provide another insight related to policy formulation. It is noticed that at the times of crises, such as the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, economic growth is usually prioritized as it is framed as a necessity for social and environmental development. Consequently, policies developed at such times tend to lack environmental perspective as well as failing to have a balanced consideration of the three sustainability pillars (Spangenberg, 2010 ). While the SDG framework aims to help policy makers to keep social and environmental systems at the center of their policies and to foster international cooperation (Ferranti, 2019 ), the framework is also criticized for having an imbalanced representation of the social, environmental, and economic systems (Costanza et al., 2016 ; Fioramonti et al., 2019 ). Such imbalance between the three sustainability pillars does not guarantee that the policies designed to achieve the SDG will contribute to long-term sustainability (Giannetti et al., 2020 ). Another adverse effect disasters can have on achieving the SDGs is that they weaken global engagement and motivate nations to retreat from planetary thinking (DeWit et al., 2020 ). This goes against one of the main principles SDGs aim at maintaining which is to leave no one behind (Willis, 2016 ). These challenges highlight the importance of utilizing the science priorities to inform policy making as well as modeling efforts. In fact, they show that it is becoming more important to jointly consider multiple priorities when devising policies related to the SDGs. Priority 3, for example, needs to be an overarching target that is considered along with any of the other priorities. Considering multiple priorities in SDGs models entails the need for building more advance integrated models and increases the complexity of the challenges modelers need to overcome in order to efficiently accomplish such task (Elsawah et al., 2020 ). Another critical issue that is highlighted in the results of this review is the representation and communication of uncertainty in SDG related models. The models’ uncertainty treatment is among the main factors that affect their acceptance and adoption by policy makers (Will et al., 2021 ; Newcomb et al., 2021 ; Kolkman et al., 2016 ). The results of this research show that uncertainty treatment was mostly either lacking or done using simplified methods that are not suitable for the models targeting SDG issues. In order to robustly support decision making for interacting social-environmental-economic systems, modelers are encouraged to utilize more advance uncertainty treatment approaches such as applying mixed uncertainty treatment frameworks as well as being elaborate in documenting and reporting the uncertainty treatment process and its underlying assumptions (Moallemi et al., 2020 ; Newcomb et al., 2021 ). Finally, the outcomes of this research can be useful for modelers through their attempts to develop SDG related models by presenting the common modeling practices found in literature. In that sense, these common practices encapsulate the knowledge applied by other modelers in this particular context, i.e. the context of SDGs related models (Boissier, 2017 ). Although we do not provide an evaluation for the modeling approaches used for the multi-dimensional classification, their usage trends in literature can be informative for future modeling efforts.  5 Conclusion This paper highlights the role played by modeling in advancing the UN's SDGs. The potential of models to advance the SDGs and sustainability is recognized and emphasized by multiple researchers from different backgrounds. However, the models pertaining to SDGs need to part of an organized research agenda that set the priorities for these models and increases their effectiveness. From this start point, we addressed three research questions regarding the main types of models used in addressing SDGs; how aligned the developed models are with the priorities of sustainability science as decided by the scientific community; and finally the main characteristics of the models developed in SDGs contexts. In order to answer these questions, we performed a literature review and analysis for 101 publications that address the applications of modelingmodeling multiple SDGs as well as 82 publications that address modeling single SDGs between 2015 and 2021. Prior to analyzing the collected literature, we presented a multi-dimensional model classification scheme that enables us to understand how models are contributing to achieving the SDGs, as well as recognizing the prevailing characteristics of the models used in this application. The top level of the scheme benefited from the advances of sustainability science and the efforts made to delineate the gaps that need to be filled with SDGs' models. The classification and analysis of the retrieved literature enabled us to answer the three research questions underpinning this work. The first of the three research questions motivating this work is related to discovering the main modeling methods currently utilized in building SDG models. Based on the reviewed articles, we found nine modeling techniques are consistently used to directly address SDGs related issues, namely, System dynamics, agent based modeling, Bayesian networks, Econometric models, Economic models, Integrated models, Knowledge based models, Network models, and Mathematical quantitative models. Among these types, integrated modeling was the most adopted modeling approach followed by econometric methods, while the least applied approaches are Bayesian networks, agent based modeling, and mathematical quantitative methods. The suitability of integrated models to represent SDGs stems from their capacity to leverage the strengths of different other modeling approaches and provide a more flexible model that overcomes the limitations of other methods. Additionally, mapping the modeling techniques employed to the spatial scales of the developed models revealed that integrated modeling is used for all the possible scales, especially for cross-scale models which proved to be challenging to develop. The second research question is underpinned by defining the current priorities of sustainability research so we can assess if those priorities are sufficiently addressed by SDG models. Locating the gap between the topics SDG models focus on and the priorities of sustainability science will help the modeling community to play a more effective role in achieving the SDGs. According to recent reviews, there are four areas that if addressed properly will greatly boost the implementation of the SDGs. Those areas are: 1) monitoring the progress of the SDGs, 2) understanding and managing the interconnections between the SDGs, 3) studying the policy transformations needed to achieve the SDGs, and 4) evaluating the consistency between achieving the SDGs and preserving the planetary boundaries. According to the analysis of the current SDGs models, 72% of the models focused on studying the policy transformations needed to achieve the SDGs, as well as understanding the interconnections among the SDGs. There is therefore a need to direct more modeling efforts toward studying the coherence between achieving the SDGs and maintaining the long-term sustainability and resilience of communities. Finally, to determine the main characteristics of SDG-focused models, we first defined three main characteristics with which to categorize the models: the model spatial scale, how the model deals with uncertainty, and whether the model is static or dynamic in time. Around 62% of the reviewed models were applied either on a global or national scales, and only 5% of the models applied a cross-scale approach. This can be attributed to the complexity of addressing multiple scales in the same models which highlights the need for developing a more accessible suite of scaling methods that can be applied by researchers from different backgrounds. In terms of the way the models treat uncertainty, we found that, surprisingly, a considerable portion of the studied models (41.5%) do not include any treatment for uncertainty. Those which did account for uncertainty, however, relied mainly on seven techniques, the most common of which is scenario modeling followed by using Bayesian methods. Sensitivity analysis and multi-model analysis were also used. It was also found that almost half (46%) of the developed models were dynamic models relying on a large amount of historical data as well as trying to provide an analysis of future scenarios for achieving the SDGs. There are a number of directions for future research efforts. First, and most important, is the development of models that address the gaps outlined by the sustainability science priorities. Additionally, there is more need to utilize probabilistic methods in building SDG models to be able to address the uncertainty inherent to the social, economic, and environmental systems underlying them. Also, more attention should be given to building a more standardized approach for model categorization as a step toward creating a catalogue of models that allows policy makers to choose optimal models for each application. Moreover, while this research focuses on the models related to SDGs extracted from literature, it is expected that these models reflect only the point of view of researchers and modelers with academic background and missing the direct input of policy makers. One way to increase the applicability and efficiency of models in SDG contexts is to investigate the models that have been already used by policy makers or applied in real life projects. Following this investigation, interviews with parties participating in these projects, i.e. model developers, government officials, and stakeholders from community, can be conducted to extract key lessons that can guide future modeling efforts. In addition, SDG Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) can be investigated to check if they contain any reporting on models’ usage. Finally, while the focus of this research is on the technical aspects of models, it is important to consider the political ramifications of those technical aspects or design choices. Considering the political impacts associated with policy guided by the model can be very helpful in understanding the values guiding the SDG decision process from a policy makers' perspective and compare it to the values that influence the scientists through their efforts to develop SDG models' (or complex systems models in general). While delineating the types and impacts of values and biases that influence the decisions modelers make while building environmental management models have been sought by some research efforts (e.g. Mayer et al. (2017) ; Moallemi et al. (2020) ), comparing the modelers' values to their policy makers’ equivalent can positively affect the usability and efficiency of SDG models.
