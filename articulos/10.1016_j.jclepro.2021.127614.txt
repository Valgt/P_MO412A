                  Crowdfunding offers a new potential source of financing of sustainability initiatives and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular. Such funding support is potentially even more important given the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy. However, little theoretically based work has been conducted on sustainability crowdfunding. Therefore, this study builds and tests an integrated convergence framework to predict crowdfunder behavior for sustainability, through the lens of an extended model of goal-directed behavior (EMGB) and theories of risk as a second-order construct as well as intervention as a moderator. Results indicate that perceived risk and intervention play significant roles within the EMGB model in crowdfunding for sustainability projects related to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. This study offers both theoretical and managerial implications for crowdfunding for sustainable development.

Such funding support is potentially even more important given the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy. However, little theoretically based work has been conducted on sustainability crowdfunding. Therefore, this study builds and tests an integrated convergence framework to predict crowdfunder behavior for sustainability, through the lens of an extended model of goal-directed behavior (EMGB) and theories of risk as a second-order construct as well as intervention as a moderator. Results indicate that perceived risk and intervention play significant roles within the EMGB model in crowdfunding for sustainability projects related to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. This study offers both theoretical and managerial implications for crowdfunding for sustainable development.   Keywords Crowdfunding  Sustainable development goals  Goal-directed behavior  COVID-19  Risk theory  Intervention theory    1 Introduction The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a central multilateral response to the global problem of environmental, economic, and social sustainability (Hall, 2019 ). This response has only become more important as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the urgent need to finance sustainability and SDG initiatives (Perkins et al., 2020 ; Severo et al., 2020 ). Crowdfunding has emerged as a trusted and reliable financial tool to support civic, environmental, and socially-grounded sustainability initiatives even during COVID-19 (Basul, 2020 ; Mediterranean Blue Economy Stakeholder Platform, 2020 ). This role become even more significant given the impacts of COVID-19 on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and community-based organizations that support sustainable development initiatives (Seed, 2020 ; European Crowdfunding Network, 2020 ; Modéer, 2020 ; Snyder, 2020 ). Accordingly, theory informed research on predicting consumer behavior for sustainability crowdfunding is essential and timely. Although a relatively recently developed financial instrument, crowdfunding is considered as a positive step to raising capital for sustainability-oriented development projects, startups, and SMEs (e.g., Bento et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2018 ; Hörisch, 2015 , 2019 ; Slimane and Rousseau, 2020 ; Vasileiadou et al., 2016 ). Crowdfunding has also been recognized as being valuable for raising capital for the attainment of the SDGs (Lam and Law, 2016 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Morell et al., 2020 ; Motylska-Kuzma, 2018 ; Scataglini and Ventresca, 2019 ). However, despite the potential significance of SDG and sustainable development crowdfunding, scholars have generally neglected examining sustainability related crowdfunding in terms of investor consumer behavior. Therefore, this study examines crowdfunder behavior for SDG related projects, utilizing an extended model of goal-directed behavior (EMGB) as well as theories of risk and intervention. Incorporating key variables of anticipated emotion and desire in a theory of planned behavior (TPB) and models of goal-direct behavior (MGB) have served to well explain consumer behavior (Kim et al., 2014 ; Song et al., 2012 ), crowdfunding (Kim and Hall, 2019b ), and various aspects of sustainability (Manca and Fornara, 2019 ; Penz et al., 2017 ). With the inclusion of variables of perceived risk, the EMGB has also proven to be a superior explanatory model of uncertainty risk (Lee et al., 2012 ) as well as adoption in the sharing economy (Yi et al., 2020 ). Importantly, consumer intervention behavior has shed light on whether individuals engage in risky behavior under conditions of uncertainty, including in relation to sustainability (Kuo et al., 2018 ) and financing (Armour and Enriques, 2018 ; deLucia, 2000 ; Gill, 2015 ). Although the EMGB, risk theory, and intervention theory appear potentially significant in helping to explain funding and investment for sustainability-related projects and businesses, little research appears to have been undertaken on crowdfunding behavior for sustainability in relation to the SDGs. The purpose of this work is to create and examine a theoretically comprehensive framework of SDG-related sustainability crowdfunding utilizing the EMGB and theories of risk as the formative second-order construct and intervention as the moderator. The model includes 11 constructs, such as perceived risk of financial, privacy, and performance, attitude, negative anticipated emotion, subjective norm, positive anticipated emotion, desire, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, and intervention. Accordingly, this work provides theoretical and managerial insights on crowdfunding for the SDGs.  2 Literature review 2.1 Theoretical background 2.1.1 Crowdfunding and sustainability development Crowdfunding is the process by which fundraisers obtain capital via online platforms (e.g., electronic markets, digital environments) from public and private funders or supporters for, often innovative, products and/or ideas (Xie et al., 2019 ). Internet-based crowdfunding is an emerging method for funding individuals, start-ups, and SMEs for sustainable development initiatives (Bento et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2018 ; Hörisch, 2015 , 2019 ; Kim and Hall, 2019b ; Slimane and Rousseau, 2020 ; Vasileiadou et al., 2016 ) and renewable energy efficiency projects (De Crescenzo et al., 2020 ). For example, De Crescenzo et al. (2020)  suggest using cooperative crowdfunding models to provide citizen-based funding to green projects that would help foster the transition to renewable energy and carbon-reduction needed for sustainability. Because of its substantial growth (Xie et al., 2019 ), sustainability crowdfunding may also be an innovative financial measure that increases the number of specific SDG related initiatives that receive financial support (Kim and Hall, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2021 ). Researchers, sustainability advocates, non-government organizations and governments have therefore become increasingly interested in crowdfunding as a means of financially supporting sustainable development projects, initiatives, and products, particularly for the UN SDGs (e.g., Chen et al., 2018 ; Hörisch, 2015 , 2019 ; Lam and Law, 2016 ; Li et al., 2019 ; Morell et al., 2020 ; Motylska-Kuzma, 2018 ; Scataglini and Ventresca, 2019 ; Slimane and Rousseau, 2020 ). The expansion of the world-wide web and social network sites has meant that crowdfunding has become an effective way to raise donations and financial resources for sustainable projects and/or services (Li et al., 2019 ), examples of which include low-carbon energy projects (Lam and Law, 2016 ; Vasileiadou et al., 2016 ) and social change ventures (Bento et al., 2019 ). The capacity of crowdfunding to contributes to the micro-financing of sustainable development projects has been identified as being potentially important for SDG funding (Hurley and Voituriez, 2016 ). Significantly, sustainability and SDG initiatives occur across different types of crowdfunding including civic crowdfunding (Morell et al., 2020 ), reward-based (Li et al., 2019 ), and donation-based crowdfunding (Scataglini and Ventresca, 2019 ). From a corporate perspective crowdfunding and sustainable development have become increasingly related (e.g., Fuster Morell, Senabre Hidalgo, and Rodríguez, 2020 ; Kim and Hall, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2021 ; Motylska-Kuzma, 2018 ; Prokofeva et al., 2020 ). For example, some 1383 sustainable crowdfunding campaigns had been published on the Goteo crowdsourcing platform between the time of writing and the start of operations on the platform at the end of 2011 (Fuster Morell et al., 2020 ). In Polish online platforms reward-based and equity-based models of crowdfunding are the most popular types for funding sustainable development projects, products, services, and/or initiatives (Motylska-Kuzma, 2018 ), with Russian sustainable development crowdfunding showing similar characteristics (Prokofeva et al., 2020 ). Despite the increased recognition of the importance of crowdfunding for the UN SDGs (Kim and Hall, 2021 ; Kim et al., 2021 ), such research has often not been conducted from a more theoretical base, especially with respect to crowdfunders’ decision-making process. Hence, this study attempts to better understand sustainable crowdfunding behavior applying the EMGB and theories of risk and intervention in the SDGs.  2.1.2 Extended model of goal-directed behavior The TPB is a widely applied behavioural model in social science research on sustainability (Holdsworth et al., 2019 ) and predicts behavior by expanding the original theory of reasoned action (TRA) to overcome TRA's limitations, by incorporating the concept of perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1991 ). A TPB has previously been used to specifically describe sustainability concerns in terms of pro-environmental behavior and energy consumption behavior, increasing predictive power (Kuo et al., 2018 ), as well as consumers' online purchasing behavior regarding perceived risk and integrating trust (Amaro and Duarte, 2016 ). An extended TPB (ETPB) has also explained eco-friendly food consumption, including key concepts of anticipated pride and guilt as well as climate change awareness and pursing actions (Kim and Hall, 2019a ). Anticipated emotions (positive and negative) and desire included in an MGB has shown significantly increased explanatory power to predict behaviors by broadening and deepening the TPB (Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001 ). The MGB based on goal-directed theory including anticipated regret has highly predicted behavior of searching for information in the context of uncertainty risk (Taylor, 2007 ). In addition, the MGB reveals knowledge gaps as well as insights as to how to encourage both short- and long-term more environmentally sustainable food consumption (Vermeir et al., 2020 ). By the addition of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations in the mobile settings, an EMGB has significantly explained digital device usages (Kim and Preis, 2016 ), while an EMGB incorporating infectious disease perception and non-pharmaceutical interventions has predicted international travel consumer behavior in a pandemic environment (Lee et al., 2012 ). More importantly, with respect to sustainable development concepts, an EMGB has been applied to a number of areas, such as sustainable tourist consumption behavior (Kim et al., 2014 ) and environmentally friendly perceptions on festival visitors' decision-making process (Song et al., 2012 ). Researchers has also shed light on consumer behavior in relation to sustainable development projects, applying the EMGB to sustainable transport and using a conceptual framework provided by the elaboration likelihood model (Manca and Fornara, 2019 ) and sustainability labels based on the goal-directed model (Penz et al., 2017 ). The EMGB has shown high prediction on consumers’ decision-making process relevant to revisit intention in an ecotourism destination (Jin et al., 2020 ). Significantly greater amounts of variance are explained in intentions and behaviour by the MGB in comparison to the TPB and variants of the TPB that include either anticipated emotions and/or past behaviour (Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001 ; Taylor, 2007 ). Overall, the EMGB appears to better predict consumer behavior (e.g., Jin et al., 2020 ; Kim et al., 2014 ; Manca and Fornara, 2019 ; Penz et al., 2017 ; Song et al., 2012 ) than an ETPB does (e.g., Kim and Hall, 2019a ) in the context of sustainability. Thus, drawing upon the literature review cited above, this study considers the EMGB as suitable research model to know sustainable consumer behavior. Moreover, due to the importance of the EMGB in identifying consumer behavior related to SDGs rather than ETPB or MGB, we aim to investigate sustainable crowdfunder behavior based on the EMGB by adding risk and intervention theory during the COVID-19 pandemic.  2.1.3 Risk theory There are a number of different notions of risk that are related to risk taking behaviour (Bran and Vaidis, 2020 ; Inthorn, 2018 ). Perceived risk refers to the consumer's subjectively determined expectation of potential losses with probabilities attached to each possible outcome (Dholakia, 2001 ; Taylor, 2007 ). Specific aspects of risk have been verified within an online adoption framework, that indicated performance risk is critical (Featherman and Pavlou, 2003 ). Consumer risk can include financial, privacy, performance, physical, social, and/or time risk in terms of probable loss (Quintal et al., 2010 ) and MGB contexts (Yi et al., 2020 ). From a TPB, perceived risk significantly affects behavioral intention to buying travel online (Amaro and Duarte, 2016 ). Moreover, the TPB is an appropriate model with which to gain important insights into human behaviors in dangerous situations (Gstaettner et al., 2017 ). Therefore, this work considers perceived risk as a second-order construct consisting three formative sub-constructs of financial, privacy, and performance risk in crowdfunding for sustainable development.  2.1.4 Intervention theory Intervention theory is applied to understanding the role of intervention behaviors on decision-making processes in order to secure desired outcomes. Interventions therefore provide a causal tool for producing new information needed for change and can assist in promoting desired goals (Garcia, 2007 ). For example, intervention behavior has been conceptualized within the EMGB as an adaptive consumer intention to mitigate risks of overseas travel during an epidemic (Lee et al., 2012 ). Since consumers can have increased risk as well as anxiety because of inadequate information on the origins of diseases and epidemic and appropriate treatments, non-pharmaceutical interventions that occur during a pandemic can substantially affect consumer travel behaviour (Hall et al., 2020 ). In order to promote sustainable dining out, eco-intervention practices are important for complementing the interests of customers and restaurant businesses in sustainable dining out (Kim and Hall, 2019a ; Kim et al., 2020 ). Interventions can also help leverage finance, such as for sustainable water and energy projects (deLucia, 2000 ) and may be able to support venture funds (Gill, 2015 ). Importantly, in the context of the rapidly-developing crowdfunding market, interventions relating to credibility and information provision could help provide increased protection for funders (Armour and Enriques, 2018 ). In addition, interventions (e.g., goal setting, commitment, provision of information) have been shown to benefit household energy conservation through the development of new sustainable consumer behavior practices (Kuo et al., 2018 ).   2.2 Hypotheses development Perceived risk means “a combination of uncertainty plus seriousness of outcome involved” (Bauer, 1967 , p. 8), “the expectation of losses associated with purchase and acts as an inhibitor to purchase behavior” (Peter and Ryan, 1976 , p. 185), and/or “commonly thought of as felt uncertainty regarding possible negative consequences of using a product or service” (Featherman and Pavlou, 2003 , p. 453). Individuals’ attitudes toward sustainability, including their concerns over sustainable behaviors, can predict environmentally friendly actions (Kim et al., 2020 ). In addition, the perceived risk of Internet purchasing negatively affects attitude towards Internet commerce (Amaro and Duarte, 2016 ). Then, we propose a hypothesis:H1  Perceived risk significantly influences attitude toward sustainability crowdfunding.   From a financing context, desire (also sometimes referred to as willingness) refers to the sponsors’ hope to crowdfund, which is an influence by attitude, affecting their behavioural intention in the EMGB setting (Kim and Hall, 2019b ). Consumer and performance risk associated with the acceptance of Airbnb significantly affects usage of Airbnb in EMGB environments (Yi et al., 2020 ). In the context of uncertainty risk, the anticipated regret of not searching for enough information (e.g., perceived risk) statistically and significantly influences the desire to search for information in the context of EMGB (Taylor, 2007 ). Hence, we posit a hypothesis:H2  Perceived risk significantly influences desire for sustainability crowdfunding.   Behavioral intentions refer to a substitutional action in which “a single act is predictable from the attitude toward that act, provided that there is a high correlation between intention and behavior” (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1977 , p. 889). In e-service adoption, perceived risks (performance, privacy, time, psychological, financial, and social risk) significantly negatively influence users' adoption behavior of e-services (Featherman and Pavlou, 2003 ). The perceived risk of Internet purchasing also negatively affects Internet commerce (Amaro and Duarte, 2016 ). In an EMGB, customers’ perceived risks (i.e., financial and privacy risk) influence their participation behavior in the sharing economy (Yi et al., 2020 ). Hence, the current study proposes:H3  Perceived risk significantly influences behavioral intentions for sustainability crowdfunding.   In an EMGB for use of digital devices, consumers' attitude toward smartphone usage has a significant impact on desire to use smartphones (Kim and Preis, 2016 ). Funders’ attitude toward crowdfunding also substantially affects their desire to participate in crowdfunding (Kim and Hall, 2019b ). Therefore, we suggest a hypothesis:H4  Attitude significantly influences desire for sustainability crowdfunding.   Subjective norms are perceived social pressures “to perform or not to perform a particular behavior” derived from normative beliefs (Ajzen, 1991 , p. 188). Using an EMGB, international consumers' subjective norms positively influence desire for overseas travel during a pandemic (Lee et al., 2012 ). In term of sustainability labels and goal-directed behavior, consumers' subjective norms are closely related to desire for enhancing sustainable behaviour in goal-directed behavior contexts (Penz et al., 2017 ). Moreover, consumers' positive subjective norms exert a positive influence on desire towards voluntary carbon offsetting and participation in UNICEF's Change for Good program (Kim et al., 2014 ). Therefore, we submit a hypothesis:H5  Subjective norms significantly influences desire for sustainability crowdfunding.   Anticipated emotions signify “important determinants of a range of intentions toward goals and actions with salient affective outcomes” (Conner and Abraham, 2001 , p. 1553). Positive anticipated emotions related to goals have been found to play a significant effect on desires (Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001 ). In inducing sustainable consumption, airline customers' positive anticipated emotion on voluntary carbon offsetting programs significantly influences their desire for participating in such programs (Kim et al., 2014 ). Funders’ positive anticipated emotion on crowdfunding also provides a considerable effect on their desire for participating in crowdfunding (Kim and Hall, 2019b ). Therefore, this study assumes the following hypothesis:H6  Positive anticipated emotion significantly influences desire for sustainability crowdfunding.   Negative anticipated emotions associated with goal failures have been found to play significant roles in desire (Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001 ). For example, students' negative anticipated emotion influences willingness to engage in campus recycling as part of on campus sustainability engagement (Cho, 2019 ). Airline consumers’ negative anticipated emotion on the Change for Good programme (whereby individuals donate the loose change in their possession to UNICEF work with children in developing countries) was found to be significantly related to their desire to participate in the programme (Kim et al., 2014 ). Therefore, we suggest a hypothesis:H7  Negative anticipated emotion significantly influences desire for sustainability crowdfunding.   Perceived behavioral control refers to “the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior and it is assumed to reflect past experience as well as anticipated impediments and obstacles” (Ajzen, 1991 , p. 188). Mobile device users’ perceived behavioral control positively affects their desire to use smartphones for travel purposes among senior consumers (Kim and Preis, 2016 ). Furthermore, perceived behavioral control for environmental liking on social media, money donation, and volunteering positively and significantly influences the desires to engage in sustainability activities (Büssing et al., 2019 ). Hence, this work proposes a hypothesis:H8  Perceived behavioral control significantly influences desire for sustainability crowdfunding.   In terms of sustainable consumer behavior, the perceived behavioral control on waste reduction has a significant impact on intention to reduce waste while dining-out (Kim and Hall, 2019a ). With regard to sustainable energy consumption behavior, consumers' perceived behavioral control is closely related to intentions to engage in pro-environmental action (Kuo et al., 2018 ). Moreover, funders’ perceived behavioral control significantly influences their intention to invest in crowdfunding for sustainability (Kim and Hall, 2019b ). Therefore, we posit the following hypothesis:H9  Perceived behavioral control significantly influences behavioral intention for sustainability crowdfunding.   Desire (willingness) significantly influences behavioral intentions in a range of settings (Taylor, 2007 ; Wei et al., 2016 ). Consumers' desire for overseas travel has been found to be related to overseas travel intentions during a pandemic (Lee et al., 2012 ). Additionally, travel consumers’ desire to participate in the sharing economy has been found to positively contribute to their behavioral intentions to use Airbnb (Yi et al., 2020 ). Hence, this work postulates the following hypothesis:H10  Desire significantly influences behavioral intentions for sustainability crowdfunding.   Small-scale investments in sustainability projects (e.g., sustainability crowdfunding) are affected by different interventions (deLucia, 2000 ). High and low intervention behavior have different effects on adaptive actions of consumer intention in the EMGB (Lee et al., 2012 ). Emerging forms of finance, such as crowdfunding, are moderated by levels of funders' intervention behavior (Gill, 2015 ). More importantly, the levels of consumers’ interventions may moderate consequences in terms of sustainability and crowdfunding (Armour and Enriques, 2018 ; Kuo et al., 2018 ). Hence, this work suggests:H11  Crowdfunders' interventions significantly moderate the relationships between perceived risk and the components of MGB for sustainability crowdfunding.   The current study is grounded in the TPB and MGB to propose an EMGB, with the intent of better understanding crowdfunders’ decision-making for sustainability. It further suggests that perceived risk and intervention will play key roles within the model. The proposed hypotheses are guided by past research which has been applied in different contexts. The resultant research model is displayed in Fig. 1  .   3 Methods 3.1 Measurements This work employed an Internet survey of 46 indicators to assess 11 constructs including: financial, privacy, and performance risk, attitude, positive as well as negative anticipated emotion, subjective norm, desire, perceived behavioral control, intervention, and behavioral intention. All items have been adopted from previously validated scales reworded for sustainability relevant to crowdfunder behavior. Four questions of financial risk were derived from Lean and Smyth (2009) , Gstaettner et al. (2017) , and Roehl and Fesenmaier (1992) , with an example statement being: “Participating in crowdfunding for sustainability is more expensive than normal crowdfunding.” Privacy risk is evaluated by four questions based on Quintal et al. (2010) , and Yi et al. (2020) . An example of a privacy risk is: “The privacy of payment information when participating in crowdfunding for sustainability may be uncontrollable.” The four items addressing performance risk were slightly modified from Dholakia (2001)  and Featherman and Pavlou (2003) , with an example statement being: “I am worried that I could not receive the expected benefits from participating in crowdfunding for sustainability.” The items related to the TPB included: attitude (four questions), subjective norms (four questions), and perceived behavioral control (four questions) were also derived from previous work (Amaro and Duarte, 2016 ; Kim et al., 2020 ; Kim and Preis, 2016 ; Kim and Hall, 2019a ). Positive anticipated emotion (four questions), negative anticipated emotion (four questions), and desires (four questions) have been generated according to prior research (Kim and Hall, 2019b ; Lee et al., 2012 ; Perugini and Bagozzi, 2001 ; Taylor, 2007 ). Behavioral intentions for sustainability crowdfunding are assessed by five questions modified from Kim and Hall (2019b) , Lee et al. (2012) , and Yi et al. (2020) . Five questions were adapted from Garcia (2007)  and Lee et al. (2012)  to measure intervention. General information related to sustainability crowdfunding (participation length, overseas funding, platforms for sustainability, experienced fields, frequency, investment amount, reason of crowdfunding for sustainability, projects in the 17 SDGs, characteristics of crowdfunding for sustainability, and non-crowdfunding for sustainability) were included. Seven socio-demographic questions are also included in the survey instrument. Importantly, in this study sustainability has been defined in terms of the 17 UN SDGs: to end poverty and hunger, ensure healthy and education as well as well-being, achieve gender equality, ensure water as well as sanitation and sustainable energy, promote decent employment, build resilient infrastructure, reduce inequality, ensure sustainable consumption, combat climate change, conserve oceans, seas, and marine resources, protect ecosystems, promote peaceful societies, and strengthen global partnership (UN, 2015 ). Defining sustainability-related crowdfunding in terms of the SDGs was regarded as providing a clear focus to the notion of sustainability in crowdfunding and may also shed light on the relative interest in different SDG categories. The questions have been evaluated by seven-anchor Likert-types as they provide high discriminant and reliability validity (Cicchetti et al., 1985 ; Preston and Colman, 2000 ). The original survey tool was in English, then translated into a Korean language version with the assistance of three language professionals fluent in both English and Korean. The instrument was then subsequently back-translated into English in order to check possible variations in meaning (Brislin, 1970 ; Douglas and Craig, 2007 ). These translation processes led to revisions of some wording in the Korean version, particularly with respect to key concepts (financial risk, privacy risk, performance risk, and intervention). Three researchers familiar with crowdfunding and sustainability conducted the content validity of the survey instrument. Three managers of sustainability crowdfunding also evaluated the suitability of the questionnaire. Based on feedback, one behavioural intention item and one intervention item were deleted due to overlapping meanings between items (i.e., “I would like to participate in crowdfunding for sustainability” and “I have preparations for problems when participating in crowdfunding for sustainability”). Several items of financial, privacy, and performance risk were also edited to better capture meanings. A pilot test has been performed by five doctoral students at a Korean university who have been experience in sustainability crowdfunding and who then provided further feedback to the researchers. Grounded on these notes, five questions from attitude, positive anticipated emotion, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and negative anticipated emotion have been revised. A pre-test was implemented on 50 people who have crowdfunded sustainability projects in Korea within the prior twelve-month time period with respondents requested to provide feedback on questions as appropriate. As a result of these steps, questions relating to desire and behavioral intention with respect to sustainability projects were revised in order to ensure clarity.  3.2 Data collection Internet surveys are generally conducted because of speed of responses, target population access, and cost-effectiveness (Fricker and Schonlau, 2002 ; Wright, 2005 ). In Korea, an online survey is deemed to be appropriate because crowdfunding is undertaken through Internet sites (Kim and Hall, 2019b ; Kim and Petrick, 2020 ). In order to best manage the survey process, a Korean Internet survey company with over three million panel members and which adhere to strict protocols to ensure response efficiency (Embrain, 2020 ), was contracted to deliver the survey. The online survey was conducted from 11 to 23 March 2020. The invitation to participate in the study was sent to 16,762 Korean panellists. This was because the online survey firm that was used generally gets useable questionnaires from an average of three per cent of panellists after the initial invitation to participate, and it has been suggested that multi-group analysis (MGA) models like the one used in this study need over 400 cases for structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis to be used (Hair et al., 2019 ). The sample was also matched with the age and gender ratio of mobile online users in Korea (Supplemental A) (National Information Society Agency, 2020 ). Participants who successfully answered the selecting question (who had participated in crowdfunding for the SDG topics in the previous year) have been asked to provide a name of a SDG related crowdfunding venture that they had funded in the prior 12 months. The SDG crowdfunding project stated by each respondent has then appeared on each following question. The multiple-selecting questions have been rotated to reduce response bias. Participants who used less than five seconds per item have been not incorporated because response times of less than five seconds tend to be associated with unreliable answers to Internet surveys (Lee et al., 2008 ). In addition, automated procedures deleted respondents that answered too quickly or used repetitive patterns in their responses because it is likely that they had not fully read a question. The email invitation was received by 4335 panellists and 4264 individuals opened the questionnaire. Following an opening explanation as to the survey and the SDGs, each respondent had the selecting item (“In the past 12 months, have you had any experience with crowdfunding for the 17 UN SDGs?”). From the 1380 qualified subjects who answered ‘yes’, 614 subjects went on to completely answered to the survey. Once outliers as well as subjects who did not provide the name of the SDG crowdfunding that participated in were removed, 465 completed questionnaires were coded for analysis. Accordingly, the response rate is 33.7 percent as the final 465 respondents came from 1380 qualified panelists (American Association for Public Opinion Research, 2016 , p. 59).  3.3 Data analysis In order to test the proposed research model, partial least squares (PLS)-SEM was applied. PLS-SEM has been argued as being more suitable for MGA and/or comprehensively integrated models than covariance-based (CB)-SEM approaches (Chin et al., 2003 ; Hair et al., 2012 , 2017 ). Consequently, SmartPLS 3.2.9 has been utilized (Ringle et al., 2015 ) in this work. In order to confirm the moderating effects of high and low interventions in sustainability crowdfunding, we employed MGA according to the PLS-SEM analysis from Chin et al. (2003)  and Keil et al.

This research tested common method bias since responses to exogenous as well as endogenous variables were examined on the same subject at a once, utilizing the same methods (Podsakoff et al., 2003 ). To confirm common method variance, Harmon's single-factor exam was performed using exploratory factor analysis. Podsakoff et al. (2003)  contended that if more than one variable appears, and/or the first variable has less than 50% variance, common method bias does not matter. Additionally, single-factor model and hypotheses models were compared. Korsgaard and Roberson (1995)  suggested that when the hypotheses model is better than the single-factor model, common method bias is not an issue. The results from the two tests suggest that common method bias was not a problem in this study (see Supplemental B).   4 Results 4.1 Grouping check Intervention has been measured by four items, resulting in a suitable Cronbach's α (0.844). The factor loading for each question is over 0.7, indicating that all questions reliably measured each construct (Hair et al., 2017 ). In this work, the K-means cluster method has been utilized to separate intervention clusters by dividing observations as a collection of nonhierarchical clustering procedures (Hair et al., 2019 ). Subjects have been divided into two sets demonstrating a high intervention group (n = 245; mean = 5.74) and a low intervention group (n = 220; mean = 4.13). The variances between the two clusters revealed that the two clusters are suitable to compare. See more details in Supplemental C.  4.2 Sample profile A majority (55.5%) of high intervention subjects were male and the majority (55.0%) of low intervention subjects were female. Little less than a third of high intervention respondents were in the 40–49 years old group (29.3%), while almost a third of low intervention respondents were in the 20–29 years old bracket (30.5%). A majority of subjects have attended a university or higher in the high (84.0%) and low intervention (80.4%) groups. The majority of the high intervention group are married (49.8%), while a slight majority of the low intervention group are single (50.4%). The majority of crowdfunders had a monthly family income of four million Korean Won (KRW) and over for high (73.4%) and for low intervention (65.5%) subjects (US$ 1 = KRW 1197). A majority of subjects have full time employment in the high (82.9%) and low cluster (78.2%), and over a half of subjects have been living in metropolitan districts in the high (64.5%) and low (67.6%) groups. The high intervention group appears to participate more in overseas crowdfunding, frequently participated in sustainability crowdfunding, are bigger sponsors, better support public health and well-being, climate change, and global partnership projects, and are for profit investors with more experience of non-crowdfunding for sustainability than the low intervention group. See more details in Supplemental D.  4.3 Measurement model Since an item was found to have non-normal distribution, as shown in Supplemental E, PLS-SEM was appropriate for data evaluation. Results of the measurement model have been presented in Table 1  . An attitude question (“Participating in crowdfunding for sustainability is an essential behavior”) received lower than a 0.7 factor loading. Accordingly, it has been removed (Hair et al., 2019 ). As illustrated in Supplemental F, Cronbach's α as well as the Rho_A of constructs have larger than 0.70, signifying that the concepts met internal consistency requirements (Stevens, 2009 ). Additionally, the average variance extracted (AVE) of concepts is greater than 0.5, and the composite reliability as well as the factor loadings of each question greater than 0.7 (Hair et al., 2019 ), signifying convergent validity. The Heterotrait–Monotrait (HTMT) value was utilized to examine discriminant validity (Hair et al., 2017 ). It is recommended that the HTMT value is the more precise standard for investigating discriminant validity (lower than 0.90) than generally applied Fornell–Larcker (Hair et al., 2017 ; Henseler et al., 2014 ). All HTMT values were less than 0.9 in Supplemental F. Therefore, there is substantial support for the measurement framework to have met conditions of discriminant validity. Q2  figures of greater than zero from endogenous constructs were identified. These results signify an appropriate assessment standard for cross-validated prediction (Geisser, 1974 ; Stone, 1974 ).  4.4 Structural model Fig. 2   displays the findings of the PLS-SEM that evaluated the hypothesised relationships (Ringle et al., 2015 ). For the four endogenous constructs, the variance explained (R 2  ) are: attitude (0.3%), perceived risk (100.0%), desire (55%), and behavioral intention (54.6%). The evaluated t-statistics and path coefficients have been applied for the relationships by PLS bootstrapping (5000 resampling) (Chin et al., 2003 ; Hair et al., 2012 ; Stevens, 2009 ). The findings revealed that perceived risk positively influences desire (γ = 0.090, t-value = 2.482, p < 0.05) as well as a negative impact on behavioral intention (γ = −0.115, t-value = 3.710, p < 0.001). Desire is found to be positively influenced by subjective norm (γ = 0.214, t-value = 3.703, p < 0.001), positive anticipated emotion (γ = 0.334, t-value = 6.437, p < 0.001), negative anticipated emotion (γ = 0.228, t-value = 5.310, p < 0.001), and perceived behavioral control (γ = 0.086, t-value = 2.125, p < 0.05). Behavioral intention has been significantly influenced by perceived behavioral control (γ = 0.338, t-value = 7.581, p < 0.001) and desire (β = 0.566, t-value = 13,194, p < 0.001). Hence, H2 , H3 , H5 , H6 , H7 , H8 , H9 , and H10  have been supported. However, the relationships between perceived risk and attitude (γ = 0.053, t-value = 0.982, p > 0.05) as well as between attitude and desire were insignificant (γ = 0.098, t-value = 1.869, p > 0.05), thus H1  and H4  were not been supported. With regard to three sub-constructs of the second-order construct, perceived risk is highly relevant to financial risk (λ = 0.399, t-value = 17.692, p < 0.001), privacy risk (λ = 0.493, t-value = 16.790, p < 0.001), and performance risk (λ = 0.431, t-value = 16.982, p < 0.001).  4.5 Moderating and mediating roles Regarding the ten hypotheses, the moderating effect of high and low intervention have been examined in Table 2  . Variances between high and low intervention subjects are compared applying explained variance (R 2  ) (Hair et al., 2019 ). The high intervention cluster had greater R2's  than the low intervention cluster with regards to desire (high cluster = 54.0%; low cluster = 40.3%) and behavioural intention (high cluster = 51.8%; low cluster = 42.3%) The high and low intervention groups showed that six relationships for the high and low clusters statistically differed. Thus, H11c , H11e , H11f , H11g , H7i , and H11j  have been supported. Magnitudes of the impacts of perceived risk on behavioral intention (high intervention = −0.122 > low intervention = −0.141, p < 0.001), positive anticipated emotion on desire (high intervention = 0.381 > low intervention = 0.278, p < 0.001), and desire on behavioral intention (high intervention = 0.589 > low intervention = 0.484, p < 0.001) are bigger for the high cluster than for the low cluster. However, magnitudes of the influences of subjective norm on desire (high intervention = 0.168 < low intervention = 0.225, p < 0.001), negative anticipated emotion on desire (high intervention = 0.191 < low intervention = 0.279, p < 0.001), and perceived behavioral control on behavioral intention (high intervention = 0.277 < low intervention = 0.369, p < 0.001) are bigger in the low cluster than in the high cluster. The four hypotheses (i.e., between perceived risk and attitude, between perceived risk and desire, between attitude and desire, and between perceived behavioral control and desire) revealed non-significant differences between high and low intervention groups because path coefficients in one or both groups were insignificant. Hence, H11a , H11b , H11d , and H11h  were not supported. PLS bootstrap with 5000 re-samplings has been utilized to examine the mediating impacts in the study framework (Table 3  ). Perceived risk positively indirectly influences behavioral intention (γ = 0.054, t-value = 2.624). Behavioral intention was found to be positively and indirectly influenced by subjective norm (γ = 0.121, t-value = 3.464), positive anticipated emotion (γ = 0.189, t-value = 5.425), negative anticipated emotion (γ = 0.129, t-value = 5.049), and perceived behavioral control (γ = 0.049, t-value = 2.117). Thus, attitude and desire had mediating effects in this study.   5 Discussions and conclusions 5.1 Discussion Crowdfunding is recognized as a potentially important form of finance for sustainability projects and sustainability-oriented SMEs, which may become even more significant given the economic effects of COVID-19 (Basul, 2020 ; European Crowdfunding Network, 2020 ; Mediterranean Blue Economy Stakeholder Platform, 2020 ; Modéer, 2020 ; Seed, 2020 ; Snyder, 2020 ). This theoretically informed study developed and tested an integrated comprehensive framework to shed more light on sustainability related crowdfunding behavior, applying an EMGB and theories of risk and intervention. Sustainability in this study was defined in terms of SDG related crowdfunding projects. The results showed that perceived risk had a positively significant influence on the desire to crowdfund sustainability projects. This implies that potential funders' perceived financial, privacy, and performance risk on sustainability crowdfunding positively and significantly stimulated their desire for participating in crowdfunding for sustainability. However, perceived risk negatively and significantly leads to crowdfunders' intention to fund sustainability projects. It suggests that supporters’ perceived financial, privacy, and performance risk on sustainability crowdfunding is very critical for their behavior intention not to participate in an SDG related project. Subjective norms positively lead to desire for sustainability crowdfunding, showing that crowdfunders' social pressure has a critical influence on willingness to invest in crowdfunding sustainability projects. Positive anticipated emotion substantially influences desire for participation in sustainability crowdfunding, indicating that backers' positive anticipated feeling leads to their wanting to participating in SDG crowdfunding. Negative anticipated emotion significantly influences desire for sustainability crowdfunding, suggesting that supporters' negative anticipated feeling affects their eagerness to participate in SDG crowdfunding. Perceived behavioral control has an effect on desire, indicating that investors’ perceived behavioral control on sustainability crowdfunding influences their enthusiasm for investing in SDG crowdfunding. Behavioral intention is greatly influenced by perceived behavior control, meaning that crowdfunders' volitional control could be crucial for their intention to fund in SDG crowdfunding. Desire has the greatest influence on behavioral intention in this study, implying that funders' desire for invest in sustainability crowdfunding is the most important to their actual investment in SDG-related crowdfunding. From the three sub-constructs of the second-order factor, privacy risk is the most related to perceived risk, followed by performance risk and financial risk in descending order. These results suggest that crowdfunders tend to worry about security and privacy, followed by the project failing, project quality, fundraisers' promises, and expected benefits. However, the associations between perceived risk and attitude as well as attitude and desire (i.e., Hypotheses 1 and 4) are not significant, and it is assumed that consumers’ concerns in terms of perceived risk and attitude are not important for sustainability crowdfunding. A possible reason is that sustainable consumers may already be highly oriented towards the SDGs and pro-environmental behavior so their perceived risk on sustainability crowdfunding could have little impact on their attitude. With regard to the moderating effect of intervention, six are significantly different between high and low groups, while four paths are insignificant with one or both groups. For example, the associations between perceived risk and behavioral intention, positive anticipated emotion and desire, and desire and behavioral intention are greater in high intervention group than their counterparts. This infers that crowdfunders with high intervention are more likely to have the stronger perceived risk and behavioral intention, the greater anticipated emotion and desire, and the larger desire and behavioral intention compared to their counterparts. However, associations between subjective norm and desire, negative anticipated emotion and desire, and perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention are greater in the low intervention group than their counterparts. It indicated that crowdfunders with low intervention are more likely to have higher subjective norms and desire, greater negative anticipated emotion and desire, and stronger perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention compared to their counterparts.  5.2 Theoretical contribution This work provides several theoretical insights into sustainability crowdfunding behaviors. First, this study is the first to apply EMGB to understand investors' decision-making process in the context of sustainability crowdfunding. Specifically, from the MGB constructs, subjective norm, positive anticipated emotion, negative anticipated emotion, and perceived behavioral control on sustainability crowdfunding were found to have a significant effect on desire, which leads to consumers' behavioral intention to crowdfund sustainable initiatives. Recent studies on sustainability crowdfunding have utilized value-attitude-behavior (Kim and Hall, 2021 ) and an extended theory of planned behavior (Kim et al., 2021 ) to explain crowdfunding behavior, but this research is the first to examine crowdfunders’ decision-making processes using an extended goal-directed model in the context of crowdfunding sustainability initiatives. The theoretical approach used in this study extends previous research on consumers’ decision-making process with the EMGB in terms of co-creation and crowdfunding (Kim and Hall, 2019b ). As such, extends the findings of previous work on EMGB with respect to sustainable mobility (Manca and Fornara, 2019 ) and sustainable tourism (Kim et al., 2014 ; Penz et al., 2017 ; Song et al., 2012 ). The EMGB theory in this work was found to provide far improved explanatory power with extended variables, such as perceived risk as a second order factor by financial, privacy, and performance. These EMGB findings extends those of prior studies on financial, privacy, and performance risk as perceived risk in the TPB in the context of e-tourism (Amaro and Duarte, 2016 ), nature-based tourism (Gstaettner et al., 2017 ), and risk behavior (Quintal et al., 2010 ) as well as the MGB in the sharing economy (Yi et al., 2020 ). This research contributes theoretically to recognizing the moderating effect of funders’ high and low intervention behavior in sustainability crowdfunding. For example, these findings expand previous literature on interventions in terms of small-scale natural resources in the financial investment environments (deLucia, 2000 ), risk venture funds for consolidating the gains of government intervention in risk capital (Gill, 2015 ), crowdfunding risk between corporate finance and consumer contracts (Armour and Enriques, 2018 ), and sustainable consumerism in relation to energy (Kuo et al., 2018 ). Regardless of their degree of significance, the 11 hypotheses show statistical variances between the high and low intervention clusters, with the association between desire and behavioral intention having the greatest difference (t-value = 18.280), suggesting theoretical implications for future sustainability crowdfunding research. That is, the moderating effects of high and low intervention groups are highly significant among 11 hypotheses with a p-value <0.001.  5.3 Managerial contribution This study also offers several practical contributions to business. First, sustainability related SMEs should work on improving potential crowdfunders' subjective norm, negative anticipated emotion, positive anticipated emotion, desire, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention of MGB constructs. In particular, positive anticipated emotion has a strong total effect (γ = 0.523) on desire, which also highly leads to funders' actual behavior so creators should stimulate backers' excitement, satisfaction, and happiness in order to increase their participation in crowdfunding. This could be done by digital storytelling on online and mobile websites as well as on social media via advertising and promotion. In addition, supporters' desire for sustainability crowdfunding brings the greatest effect on their participation in crowdfunding for sustainability. Thus, fundraisers should encourage funders’ likes, wants, and hopes for SDG crowdfunding. This could be implemented by holding events for sustainability issues that related to crowdfunding project campaigns. Importantly, findings revealed that perceived risk highly and negatively influences behavioral intention, which is closely related to actual investment in crowdfunding for sustainability although perceived risk has a significant impact on desire. Those findings suggest that fundraisers should focus on mediating funders' privacy risk, followed by performance risk and financial risk to boost their investment in crowdfunding for SDGs. That would be conducted by informing potential investors as to the security measures in place to protect payments and personal information. More importantly, because of the significant moderating effect of interventions, sustainability businesses should create market segment strategies depending on consumers' high or low intervention behaviors for crowdfunding. That is, in order to save resources and efforts as well as get effective results, crowdfunding marketers should design different promotion plans for different segments. If marketers want to gain high intervention supporters they should concentrate on highlighting funders' enthusiasm. On the other hand, crowdfunding managers should stress funders’ volitional behavioral control if they wish to attract low intervention investors.  5.4 Limitations and future directions This research has provided theoretical as well as practical implications for sustainability crowdfunding, but this work is not free from some limits. In particular, the authors conducted research on consumers from only one country. Therefore, the findings cannot be readily generalized to other countries or cultures. In addition, because we applied an MGB with an extended construct of perceived risk, future studies should examine other variables, such as crowdfunding constraints for sustainability, in order to enhance additional explanatory power. Further research on consumers who do not have a plan to invest in crowdfunding for SDGs would be valuable to understand the reasons for non-participation.
