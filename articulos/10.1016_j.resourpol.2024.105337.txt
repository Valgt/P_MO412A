                  This paper aims to evaluate the volatility of precious metals, specifically Palladium, Gold, and Platinum, within the context of the global minerals market. The research focuses on understanding the price dynamics of these metals and their implications for sustainable development, particularly in the Global South. The study employs a comprehensive approach, utilizing advanced machine learning and deep learning models such as GRU, Huber, Lasso, LSTM, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, SVM, ANN, and XGBoost. These models are assessed based on their forecasting accuracy for different time horizons, using metrics such as RMSE and MAPE. The findings reveal that the ANN, XGBoost, and LSTM models exhibit robust performance in forecasting the volatility of precious metals across various time horizons. The research highlights the unique volatility patterns of each metal and underscores the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in capturing these dynamics. The study acknowledges limitations such as the exclusion of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors in the forecasting models. Future research is suggested to integrate these factors to enhance forecasting accuracy. The study's findings are pivotal for investors, policymakers, and market regulators, especially in the context of the Global South and sustainable development. The research offers valuable insights for risk management strategies, investment planning, and policy formulation aimed at promoting market stability and sustainable economic growth. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate forecasting models based on specific time horizons and market requirements.

Minerals and rare earth elements (REEs) play a crucial role in contemporary society, finding extensive utility in several sectors such as electronics and renewable energy (RE). Furthermore, their importance encompasses other domains such as national security, breakthroughs in medicine, agriculture, and environmental cleanup. From powering industrial revolutions to fuelling technological innovations, minerals such as copper, cobalt, gold, platinum, diamonds, and REEs have played pivotal roles in driving progress on a global scale (Du et al., 2022 ) (see Figs. 3 and 4 ). In an era dominated by the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, the global reliance on minerals has reached unprecedented heights. The global shift towards sustainable energy solutions is both a mandate and a necessity, the demand for minerals has attained unprecedented significance. In 2023, the World Bank released a report titled " Minerals for Climate Action: The Mineral Intensity of the Clean Energy Transition," which asserted that minerals are indispensable for achieving a low-carbon future. This latest report reinforces that argument, highlighting the increasing significance of technology advancements and recycling in influencing mineral demand through 2050. Minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel are indispensable minerals that play a crucial role in the construction of rechargeable batteries utilized in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. These minerals are vital in aiding the transition away from transportation systems reliant on fossil fuels, as well as permitting the storage of RE at the grid level (Davies et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the utilization of REEs such as neodymium and dysprosium is crucial in the production of magnets with exceptional efficiency, which are employed in wind turbines and electric motors. This, in turn, contributes to the widespread acceptance and implementation of clean energy generation. Essential components in the diversification of energy sources towards carbon-neutral alternatives include minerals, which play a crucial role in the creation of photovoltaic cells for solar panels and catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells (Cullen et al., 2021 ). Enhancing the sustainability of the transition to RE can be significantly advanced through initiatives like mineral resource recycling and the utilization of ethically sourced clean energy technologies. Sun et al. (2024)  indicate that addressing the burgeoning demand for raw mineral resources necessitated by the energy transition will involve significant experimentation within the top ten global metal demand and supply economies. These economies are steering towards a more metal-intensive trajectory, aligning with net-zero carbon objectives and cleaner technology adoption. The escalating global demand for RE and mineral resources is closely tied to the International Energy Agency's target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Bridging the gap between clean energy demand and supply requires a corresponding increase in mineral resource availability, which, in turn, entails heightened investments and advancements in mining technology (Calderon et al., 2024 ). The pricing dynamics of mineral resources are intricately linked to the prevailing demand levels. Typically, when demand for a mineral resources surge, its price ascends, while during periods of diminished demand, prices tend to decline. This phenomenon is underpinned by the principles of supply and demand, which exert significant influence on pricing dynamics within free market systems. Notably, economic expansion emerges as a pivotal catalyst driving heightened mineral requirements (Srivastava et al., 2023 ). The expansion of economies engenders an augmented necessity for raw materials to sustain industrial activities and facilitate infrastructure development, such as the construction of roads and bridges. Likewise, the burgeoning population and its associated demands necessitate mineral resources to produce housing and various consumer goods (Huang et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, technological advancements play a crucial role in amplifying mineral demand. The proliferation of technologies reliant on specific minerals can fuel an increased demand for said minerals. Concurrently, the supply dynamics of mineral resources significantly influence market prices. The scarcity of a mineral resource has the potential to propel its market price upwards. Conversely, if the costs associated with extraction or production escalate, it can elevate the final market price (Watari et al., 2020 ). Concerns regarding supply security have arisen in industrialized nations due to fluctuations in prices and underlying market imbalances. Lists of critical minerals, particularly minor metals, are curated and subject to ongoing evaluation. This evaluation process considers various criteria, including the concentration of production within specific countries and governance indicators. This paper critically examines the narrative surrounding price volatility, supply security, and ethical sourcing. The stability of mineral supply chains, which are frequently concentrated in specific countries with differing governance standards, is a concern for industrialized nations. This intricate situation necessitates a more profound comprehension of the market dynamics, forecasting models, and risk management strategies associated with these essential resources. This research paper delves into the intricate web of interconnections within the minerals market, placing a magnifying glass on the key elements of volatility spillover, precise forecasting, and the development of robust risk management strategies. The spotlight is particularly focused on minerals crucial for RE, exploring the challenges and opportunities inherent in their market dynamics (Chen et al., 2023 ; Xiao and Wang, 2022 ). The primary objective of the study is to analyze the volatility spillover in the global minerals market through forecasting models such as GRU, Huber, Lasso, LSTM, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, SVM, ANN, and XGBoost for Palladium, Gold, and Platinum prices. The research primarily aligns with existing resource dependency theory and the sustainable development theory. Resource dependency theory emphasizes the critical role of resources, such as minerals, in shaping the development and functioning of societies and economies. The literature discusses how minerals have been integral to human civilization, economies, and industries throughout history, highlighting their significance in driving progress and technological advancements (e.g., powering industrial revolutions). It underscores the reliance of societies on minerals for economic development and technological innovation, aligning with the principles of resource dependency theory (Zhu et al., 2022 ). Alternatively, the literature also reflects the principles of sustainable development theory, particularly in the context of the transition to RE. It discusses the global shift towards sustainable energy solutions as a mandate for achieving environmental sustainability. The emphasis on enhancing the sustainability of the transition through initiatives like mineral resource recycling and the utilization of ethically sourced clean energy technologies aligns with the objectives of sustainable development theory, which seeks to balance economic growth with environmental protection and social equity. The literature contributes to these theories by highlighting the evolving role of minerals in sustainable development agendas, the implications of mineral demand for RE transitions, and the challenges associated with ensuring resource security and governance in a globalized economy (Beylot et al., 2019 ). The study contributes to the current corpus of knowledge by offering a thorough examination of the interconnections within the minerals market. This study underscores the efficacy of machine learning models in predicting the volatility of precious metals. The ANN, XGBoost, and LSTM models were found to be particularly robust across a variety of metals and forecasting horizons. The capacity to accurately predict the volatility of precious metals, including Palladium, Gold, and Platinum, is of the utmost importance in the development of effective risk management strategies. These forecasts can be used by financial institutions and investors to protect their portfolios from unforeseen market movements by hedging against price fluctuations. Additionally, the knowledge acquired from this investigation can be used to guide investment strategies by identifying the most dependable forecasting models for various time frames. This study also drivers its originality from the comprehensive integration of them explained in the literature review section. The study is distinguished by its comprehensive integration of multiple themes, including commodity market analysis, volatility forecasting, risk management, collateral effects, price manipulation, and crisis management, within the realm of the global minerals market. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness and complexities that are inherent in mineral markets, a topic that has not been extensively investigated in previous literature. The study also utilizes a strategic map to organize and illustrate research themes according to their centrality and density. This visualization technique provides a clear representation of the motor, basic, emerging, and niche themes in the global minerals market, thereby facilitating a more profound comprehension of the research landscape and informing future research orientations. The outcomes of this study promise to provide invaluable insights for shaping policies, fostering responsible corporate practices, and steering the minerals industry toward a more sustainable and equitable future. As we embark on this research journey, we draw inspiration from the pressing need to reconcile economic activities with environmental stewardship and social equity, creating a blueprint for a resilient and sustainable global minerals market. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section provides the literature review. The third section presents the data and empirical methods used whereas the fourth section explains empirical results and discussion. The fifth section displays conclusion and policy implications.  2 Literature review The researcher's latent biases have been identified as a source of criticism for the reviewing methodology in the social sciences, encompassing both empirical and review articles (Snyder, 2019 ; Tranfield et al., 2003 ). Keeping this limitation in consideration, we approach the literature review for this investigation with prudence. We employ a systematic, objective, and rigorous approach to examine the literature that is pertinent to the research subjects, employing a clearly delineated methodology (Rowe, 2014 ). By mapping and analyzing current intellectual understanding, we conduct a literature review in order to provide comprehensive resources for identifying research gaps and subsequently addressing specific research topics (Ameen et al., 2022 ; Rao et al., 2023 ). Talan et al. (2023)  underscores the importance of methodological advancements in the literature review and emphasizes the value of computational approaches in enhancing analytical and information-processing capabilities. They further specify that bibliometric analysis reveals the temporal evolution of interest in a particular theme, identifies significant studies and authors, and underscores critical aspects of the research topic. In accordance with the approach taken by Talan et al. (2023) , we commence by conducting bibliometric analysis utilizing the Bibliometrix R package, an increasingly well-liked package in recent times (Dervis, 2019 ). A literature review was undertaken, employing the Scopus database and pertinent keywords associated with our conceptual framework. Prominent academic institutions select Scopus as their primary database due to its efficacy in mitigating predatory publication practices and streamlining the research process (Burnham, 2006). The search query yielded 116 records, which were subsequently filtered in alignment with the objectives of our study. The publications deemed pertinent were at first assessed using the Bibliometrix R package, and then a manual review was conducted; this process culminated in the implementation of an integrated approach (Callahan, 2010 ; Elsbach and van Knippenberg, 2020 ). The strategic map within our area of research is illustrated in Fig. 1   .   A strategic map utilizes a Cartesian plane to depict important components of a conceptual system. The strategic diagram categorizes the subjects in accordance with their degree of centrality and density (Cobo et al., 2015 ; Nangia et al., 2023 ). Centrality quantifies the extent of interconnection among subjects, whereas density assesses the strength of internal connections within a given topic (Aparicio et al., 2019 ; Sharma et al., 2023 ; Srivastava et al., 2023 ). The upper right quadrant symbolizes the motor theme, which is characterized by high centrality and density. The upper left quadrant represents the peripheral theme, which is characterized by high density but low centrality. The lower left quadrant symbolizes the emerging or disappearing theme, which is characterized by low density and low centrality. Lastly, the lower right quadrant represents the transversal, general, or basic theme, which is characterized by low density but high centrality (Sharma et al., 2023 ) (see Fig. 2 ). The first theme on the map is “Commodity Market Analysis ” which focuses on subthemes such as historical trends in mineral markets, sentiment in commodity markets, investment trends, excessive fluctuations, hedging strategies, environmental regulations, precious metals, and energy transition (Althaf and Babbitt, 2021 ; Bielak et al., 2021 ; Renner and Wellmer, 2020 ; Shafiee and Topal, 2010 ; Su et al., 2023 ). It is crucial to analyze historical trends in mineral markets to gain useful insights into the temporal patterns and changes in commodity prices (Mensi et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, the volatility of prices in commodities markets is significantly impacted by the sentiment of society. Fan et al. (2023)  mention that market sentiment has been identified as the cause of the excessive movement of commodity futures. In addition, Han et al. (2017)  in his paper analyzed the influence of investor attention on commodity futures markets in order to understand investment patterns in commodity markets. Hu et al. (2020)  examined the effects of irrational traders' zealous reaction to news on commodity market returns, in relation to the issue of excessive fluctuations in commodity prices. Market participants employ hedging strategies in order to alleviate the risks that are linked to price volatility (Gao and Süss, 2015 ; Wang et al., 2024). Commodity market analysis is also influenced by environmental regulations, which have the potential to affect the interplay between supply and demand for specific goods (Sockin and Xiong, 2015 ). In commodity markets, precious metals, including gold, have been a popular investment option; research has investigated the correlation between news sentiment and gold futures market returns (Smales, 2014 ). In conclusion, the transition to RE sources may impact the demand for conventional energy commodities, which has ramifications for commodity markets (Ferrer et al., 2018 ). Concurrently, commodity markets have been significantly influenced by environmental regulations, which have had a profound effect on the valuation of precious metals and accelerated the energy transition; thus, the environment of these critical markets has been profoundly reshaped. The second theme on the map is “Volatility forecasting”  which includes subthemes such as Implied vs. Realized Volatility, market manipulation detection, mineral market psychology, sensitivity analysis, credit default swaps (CDS), forecasting evaluation, geo-political risk, and mineral price future (Althaf and Babbitt, 2021 ; Hu et al., 2020 ; Redlinger and Eggert, 2016 ; Shafiee and Topal, 2010 ; Su et al., 2023 ; Tapia et al., 2020 ; Xue-Hong et al., 2019 ; Yazdani-Chamzini et al., 2012 ). Comparing various volatility forecasting models is one area of study. In out-of-sample forecasting, realized volatility outperforms well-known models like Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and stochastic volatility models (Andersen et al., 2011 ; Guo et al., 2024). Furthermore, there has been a comparison of the conditional predictive capability of realized and implied volatility measures, and the body of literature in this field is expanding rapidly (Shi et al., 2020 ). An additional critical element pertains to the assessment of volatility prediction models. In order to assess the predictive capability of these models, the extant literature have devised techniques such as calculating the cumulative discrepancy between the predicted volatility and the forecast errors derived from the historical mean model (Li and Zakamulin, 2019 ). This assessment aids in determining the efficacy of various models and their capacity to generate precise predictions. Additionally, research has been conducted in the domain of mineral price volatility to examine the influence of diverse factors on the prediction of volatility. An investigation has been conducted to examine the impact of industry returns on the prediction of volatility in the commodity and stock markets. The heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility (HAR-RV) model has been extensively utilized in this research (Demirer et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, scholarly investigations have focused on the informational value of volatility spreads, given that they offer valuable insights into the anticipations of future volatility among market participants (Kang et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, the correlation between volatility forecasting and external variables, including geopolitical risk and the trade war, has been investigated in the literature (Bouri et al., 2021 ). Considering the potential substantial influence that these factors may have on market volatility is imperative when developing forecasting models. Furthermore, scholarly investigations have explored the existence of long memory in the volatility of emergent fixed-income markets. These findings underscore the criticality of incorporating autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity into volatility prediction models (Thupayagale, 2011 ). In summary, empirical investigations pertaining to volatility prediction have yielded significant knowledge regarding a multitude of sub-areas—sensitivity analysis, CDS, realized volatility, the influence of external factors including geopolitical risk and the trade war, and sensitivity analysis on industry returns. Scholars strive to construct precise and dependable models for volatility prediction—critical for well-informed decision-making in financial markets—through the comparison of various models, evaluation of their performance, and consideration of external factors. The third theme is “Risk management”  which encompasses key areas such as predictive risk models, liquidity risk management, supply chain risk, historical price variability, geopolitical risk analysis, currency exchange risk, and environmental risk mitigation (Fan et al., 2023 ; Jones et al., 2023 ; Shafiee and Topal, 2010 ; Thupayagale, 2011 ; Xue-Hong et al., 2019 ). Predictive risk models are of paramount importance in the realm of supply chains as they facilitate the detection and reduction of potential disruptions (Pietukhov et al., 2023 ). Research from various sectors, including the chemical industry in the United States, informs these models (Kleindorfer and Saad, 2005 ). In addition, supply chain risk management is critical for ensuring that products and services continue to circulate efficiently (Sodhi et al., 2023 ). In order to bolster their resilience, organizations must establish risk mitigation strategies and integrate their supply chains (Yu et al., 2015 ). In addition, for risk management to be effective, it is critical to comprehend the influence that supply chain risks and mineral price volatility have on the performance and profitability of a business (Wagner and Bode, 2008 ). It is essential to observe that risk management encompasses other domains in addition to supply chains. An illustration of the critical nature of liquidity risk management in the financial sector is its influence on the stability of financial institutions (Chukwuka et al., 2023 ). An additional critical component of risk management is geopolitical risk analysis, which assists businesses in navigating the complexities of global markets and their effects on mineral (Brik and El Ouakdi, 2024; Pfohl et al., 2010 ). Multinational corporations must implement effective risk management strategies in order to mitigate potential losses from currency exchange risk (Remko, 2020 ). In conclusion, environmental risk mitigation is crucial for minimizing the negative environmental impact of business activities and promoting sustainability (Cho et al., 2022 ). In its entirety, risk management constitutes a multifaceted discipline that necessitates empirical investigation and the formulation of efficacious approaches to confronting diverse categories of risks across various domains. The fourth theme is the “Spillover effect ” which majorly includes subthemes such as Volatility spillover, price determination, inflation, energy market, currency markets, mineral prices, supply and demand shocks, speculative trading, cross-commodity spillover, and geopolitical events. The spillover effect is a phenomenon wherein disruptions or shocks propagate from one sector or market to another, resulting in the interdependence and interconnectedness of various markets. Geopolitical risks exert a more significant influence on the stock market and commodity market volatility than on returns. The impact is especially pronounced at return quantiles lower than the mean (Balcilar et al., 2018 ; Cui and Maghyereh, 2024). Specifically, the bond and mineral price market's volatility spillovers to other markets were exacerbated by the financial crisis (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012 ). The US stock market has been observed to be influenced by oil price shocks (Kilian and Park, 2009 ). The US economy has been profoundly affected by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil shock, which have yielded valuable insights for research on contagion and spillover effects in different regions and countries (Sharif et al., 2020 ). An additional approach to examining volatility spillovers is through the examination of cross-country real activity and inflation, in addition to other financial markets (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2009 ). The relationship between crude oil and China's agricultural futures has been found to have spillover effects, which encompass both mean and volatility spillover effects (Jiang et al., 2022 ). The magnitude of spillover effects is greatest in times of political and economic turmoil, and it is smallest during times of relative stability (Balash et al., 2021 ). The volatility of oil, mineral, and gas company stocks has been observed to have substantial volatility spillover effects (Antonakakis et al., 2018 ). The analysis of volatility contagion effects in the currency markets of Belt and Road Initiative countries has also been conducted (Wei et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, the examination of volatility spillover dynamics between foreign exchange markets and alternative currencies such as Bitcoin has received scant attention (Qarni and Gulzar, 2021 ). In its entirety, the spillover effect is a multifaceted phenomenon comprising a multitude of components, which may yield substantial ramifications across diverse sectors and markets. The next theme is “Mineral Price Manipulation”  which includes subthemes such as Insider trading in mineral markets, price-fixing cartels, mining company collusion, HFT (high-frequency trading) impact, government intervention, speculative bubble creation, supply chain vulnerabilities, impact on stock prices, and whistleblowers in price manipulation. The issue of insider trading in the mineral markets has become a subject of public concern (Ali et al., 2020 ; Litvinenko et al., 2023 ) Additional types of manipulation that disrupt equitable competition and manipulate market prices include collusion among mining companies and price-fixing cartels (Buckley, 2022 ). Mineral markets have also been affected by HFT, as demonstrated in literature the interactions between HFT traders and the effect they have on market quality (Benos et al., 2017 ). The implementation of regulatory and preventative measures against price manipulation, such as the Limit Up-Limit Down rule designed to tackle flash crashes, demonstrates the critical role that government intervention plays in this regard (Dalko, 2016 ). An additional facet of manipulating mineral prices is the formation of speculative bubbles; studies have established the existence of bubbles in housing markets (Case et al., 2003 ). Price manipulation can also be facilitated by weaknesses in the supply chain, as evidenced by the examination of variables that impact mining industry stock prices (Antono et al., 2019 ). Price manipulation has repercussions that transcend the mineral market, influencing stock prices and mining companies' susceptibility to fluctuations in mineral prices (Tufano, 1998 ; Wang and Wang, 2024). The critical function of whistleblowers is to expose and expose price manipulation schemes, thereby assuring market accountability and transparency (Brogaard et al., 2019 ). Mineral price manipulation is an intricate matter that necessitates the implementation of regulatory strategies, vigilant market oversight, and the engaged involvement of relevant parties to preserve equitable and effective markets. The final theme “Crisis ” belongs to the emerging theme and encompasses subthemes such as mineral price, supply chain disruptions, sovereign debt crises, labour strikes, financial crisis, COVID-19, geopolitical tension, trade war, and leverage effect. A significant global financial market reaction has been prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has depleted wealth by approximately 25% within a month (Ali et al., 2020 ; Goodell, 2020 ) It has become more difficult for individuals and businesses to obtain credit and make payments due to the financial crisis, which was marked by a collapse of the financial system (Georgievski and Mostert, 2017 ). Salisu et al. (2020)  argue that the ability to accurately forecast commodity prices in times of crisis is vital for the purpose of minimizing ambiguities and risks. According to Gong et al. (2022) , significant crises amplify the interdependence and pure contagion effects between energy and non-energy commodity markets. The financial crisis has also influenced the risk tolerance of financial investors towards commodities, which were previously considered unrelated assets (Tang and Xiong, 2012 ). This has resulted in the financialization of commodities. Analogous to an economic crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated turmoil in commodity markets and a decline in worldwide economic activity (Magalhães et al., 2022 ). Agricultural commodity markets and crude prices have been influenced by the COVID-19 crisis's spillover effect (Hung, 2021 ). Additionally, research has investigated the interdependence between financial and commodity markets in times of turmoil, including the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic (Adekoya and Oliyide, 2021 ). Consumer behaviour has been impacted by the pandemic as well (Bansal et al., 2022 ; Wells et al., 2023 ). Initially, there has been a surge in demand for critical goods, but this is quickly followed by a reaction to the new regulations. In general, the crises and the associated elements have exerted a significant impact on commodity prices, underscoring the necessity for exhaustive investigation and evaluation to comprehend and manoeuvre through these intricate dynamics. Therefore, (Liow and Song, 2022) highlight the interactions between different markets and the significance of the interconnectedness of volatility in cross-asset market relationships. Their study emphasizes the importance of conditional volatility and volatility interconnectedness for market stability during times of extreme volatility. This research provides useful insights into the relationship between correlation structure and volatility spillover effects within a multi-portfolio system. (Marín-Rodríguez, González-Ruiz, and Valencia-Arias, 2023) highlights the need of taking sustainability-related advancements into account when evaluating market volatility. The research suggests that policymakers and investors should consider sustainability considerations in order to have a deeper understanding of and effectively handle market volatility. In addition, (Jain et al., 2023) prioritizes sustainable investments and evaluates their influence on financial results. Their research examines the correlation between ESG indices and MSCI indices to investigate the mutual dependence between the two sets of indices. To summarize, prior research has explored several facets of market linkages and volatility. While several studies highlight the interrelationships between markets and the interconnectedness of volatility, others concentrate on the consequences of sustainability for market volatility. It is essential to comprehend these distinctions and subtleties in order to place the present research within the existing body of literature and emphasize its distinct contributions to the subject, which focuses on Sustainable Development in the Global Minerals Market. This will be achieved utilizing the most dependable and accurate approach, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Also, the implication provided in the above available literature are unidirectional, but our study has comprehensively utilized the policy, managerial, and social implication of the study looking at all the stakeholders.  3 Data and empirical methods 3.1 Data The study collected daily open, high, low, and close prices for Palladium, Gold, and Platinum were collected from January 5, 2000, to November 30, 2023. The dataset comprises 6053 observations for Palladium, 6182 observations for Gold, and 6056 observations for Platinum. We have sourced the data from Refintiv Eikon.1  1 https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/products/eikon-trading-software .   These metals play a crucial role in various industries and are key indicators of economic health and investor sentiment. Palladium, for example, is essential in catalytic converters for automobiles, while Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset. Platinum is used in jewelry, catalytic converters, and industrial applications. The study's primary focus is on the volatility of these metals, particularly in the context of sustainable development in the Global South. Understanding the volatility of these commodities is essential for promoting sustainable economic growth and achieving development goals in these regions.  3.2 Methodology To forecast the volatility of crude oil and natural gas, we selected the well-known machine learning and deep learning methods as mentioned below. 3.2.1 Elastic Regression Elastic Regression is a type of linear regression that integrates techniques to minimize overfitting and enhance model performance by reducing the influence of unnecessary features. This model combines two regularization techniques: L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge). The L1 component helps in feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively removing less important features. The L2 component reduces the impact of correlated features by distributing their weights more evenly. This dual regularization makes Elastic Regression particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing numerous and potentially correlated features, ensuring that the model remains robust and interpretable.  3.2.2 Ridge Regression Ridge Regression is another linear regression model that includes a mechanism to penalize large coefficients. This penalty, known as L2 regularization, adds a term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the coefficients. By doing so, it discourages the model from assigning excessively high weights to any single feature, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Ridge Regression is effective for datasets with many features, especially when some of these features are correlated. It helps in producing more stable and reliable predictions by maintaining a balance between fitting the training data and keeping the model generalizable to new data.  3.2.3 Lasso Regression Lasso Regression applies a penalty to the model by summing the absolute values of the coefficients, known as L1 regularization. This approach not only reduces the risk of overfitting but also performs automatic feature selection by shrinking some coefficients entirely to zero. As a result, Lasso Regression is particularly beneficial for high-dimensional datasets with many features, some of which may be irrelevant. By eliminating unnecessary features, it simplifies the model, making it more interpretable and often improving its predictive performance on new data.  3.2.4 Huber Regression Huber Regression is a robust regression method that combines the principles of least squares regression and least absolute deviations. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to other regression models. Huber Regression modifies the cost function to be quadratic for small errors and linear for large errors, providing a balance between minimizing errors and being resistant to outliers. This makes it a good choice when the dataset contains anomalies that could skew the results. It offers robustness while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world datasets where outliers are common.  3.2.5 Random Forest Regression Random Forest Regression is a tree-based method that aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the data and features, which are randomly chosen. By averaging the predictions of these individual trees, Random Forest Regression provides robust and accurate predictions. This method is particularly effective when dealing with complex, non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. It also reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees and provides insights into feature importance, helping in understanding which features most influence the predictions.  3.2.6 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a versatile model used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal boundary, or hyperplane, that best separates the data into distinct categories or predicts continuous values. SVM operates by maximizing the margin between the closest data points and the hyperplane, which enhances the model's ability to generalize to new data. This method is useful when dealing with datasets where the relationship between features and the target variable is non-linear, as it can be extended using kernel functions to map the data into higher-dimensional spaces, enabling it to capture more complex patterns.  3.2.7 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model sequential data. LSTMs are capable of retaining information over long periods, which makes them suitable for time series forecasting where past observations influence future outcomes. They achieve this through a structure of gates that regulate the flow of information into and out of the memory cell. These gates include the input gate, forget gate, and output gate. LSTM networks are effective in capturing non-linear dependencies in sequential data and are particularly useful for tasks where the order of data points is crucial, such as predicting future values based on past trends.  3.2.8 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is similar to LSTM but with a simpler architecture that reduces the number of parameters. GRUs also use gates to manage the flow of information, but they combine the input and forget gates into a single update gate, simplifying the model while maintaining its effectiveness. GRUs are helpful for modeling sequential data with dependencies between observations, making them suitable for time series forecasting. Their reduced complexity compared to LSTMs can lead to faster training times and lower computational requirements, making them a practical choice for many applications.  3.2.9 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are inspired by the structure of biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers, which work together to process data and learn complex patterns. ANNs are versatile and can adapt to new data over time, making them powerful tools for both classification and regression tasks. They are particularly effective in capturing intricate non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. ANNs can be designed with various architectures, including feedforward networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks, each suited for different types of data and tasks. While ANNs can achieve high performance, they also require substantial amounts of data and computational resources to train effectively.  3.2.10 eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is a powerful machine learning algorithm for time series forecasting. It builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by previous ones. XGBoost handles both sparse and dense data efficiently and includes mechanisms to prevent overfitting, such as regularization terms in the objective function. This method is capable of modelling complex non-linear interactions between variables, making it particularly suitable for datasets with intricate relationships. XGBoost is known for its scalability and high performance, making it a popular choice for a wide range of predictive modelling tasks.  3.2.11 Choice of methods The selection of these methods for forecasting the volatility of crude oil and natural gas is based on their ability to handle various challenges presented by the data. Linear models like Elastic, Ridge, and Lasso regressions provide strong baselines and are effective in managing high-dimensional data with regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Huber Regression offers robustness against outliers, ensuring reliable performance in real-world scenarios. Tree-based methods like Random Forest and XGBoost capture complex non-linear relationships and provide insights into feature importance. SVM is versatile and can model non-linear relationships with kernel functions. Sequential models like LSTM and GRU are specifically designed for time series data, capturing dependencies over time. ANNs offer flexibility in learning complex patterns and adapting to new data. This diverse selection ensures a comprehensive approach to modelling and forecasting, leveraging the strengths of each method to achieve accurate and reliable predictions.  3.2.12 Calculation of volatility The GARCH model is a widely used time series model that estimates the conditional variance of a financial asset's returns over time. The GARCH model is useful because it accounts for the volatility clustering, which means that periods of high volatility tend to be followed by periods of high volatility and vice versa. This model is particularly relevant for financial time series data, such as the returns of stocks, bonds, or commodities. The basic model assumes that the conditional variance of the asset return, denoted by sigm a t 2     follows an autoregressive process of past squared errors and past conditional variances. In other words, the conditional variance of the asset return depends on its own past values and the past values of the errors. The model can be written as:(1) sigm a t 2  = omega + alph a 1 epsilo n t − 1  2    + … + alph a pepsilo n t − p  2    + bet a 1 sigm a t − 1  2    + … + bet a qsigm a t − q  2        where.sigm a t 2     is the conditional variance of the asset return at time t  omega is the intercept term  alph a 1     to alph a p     are the autoregressive parameters of the squared errors  bet a 1     to bet a q     are the moving average parameters of the past conditional variances  epsilo n t     is the error term at time t    The model is usually estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, which involves finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. The likelihood function is based on the assumption that the errors follow a normal distribution with mean zero and variance equal to the conditional variance of the asset return. To estimate the GARCH model, one needs to specify the number of lags for the autoregressive and moving average terms, p and q respectively. These parameters can be determined using various statistical tests such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Once the GARCH model is estimated, the conditional variance of the asset return can be predicted for future periods using the estimated parameter values and the past information on squared errors and conditional variances. The GARCH model can be useful for predicting volatility in financial markets, which can help investors and risk managers to make informed decisions.    4 Empirical results and discussion This section presents the results for the study. In Table 1  , the analysis of Palladium prices reveals a market with considerable variability and non-normal distribution. Palladium's mean price of 828.596 and median of 670.000 indicate a positively skewed distribution, with prices ranging from 150.000 to 3158.120 and a standard deviation of 645.405. The high kurtosis value of 4.010 suggests heavy tails, indicative of extreme price movements. The Jarque-Bera test statistic of 2138.024 with a probability of 0.000 confirms significant deviation from a normal distribution, highlighting the unique price dynamics of Palladium. Furthermore, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests indicate that differencing the series is necessary for stationarity, suggesting the presence of trends or seasonality in the data. Gold, on the other hand, exhibits a more symmetric distribution compared to Palladium. With a mean price of 1080.044 and median of 1207.580, Gold prices range from 255.050 to 2063.020, with a standard deviation of 540.657. The skewness of −0.102 indicates a slight left-skewed distribution, while the kurtosis of 1.743 suggests lighter tails compared to Palladium. The Jarque-Bera test statistic of 417.805 with a probability of 0.000 confirms significant deviation from a normal distribution. Similarly, the ADF and PP tests suggest that differencing the series is necessary for stationarity, indicating potential trends or seasonality in gold prices. Platinum's price distribution falls between Palladium and Gold in terms of skewness and kurtosis. With a mean price of 1069.127 and median of 980.785, Platinum prices range from 405.000 to 2275.000, with a standard deviation of 363.317. The skewness of 0.534 indicates a slightly right-skewed distribution, while the kurtosis of 2.767 suggests moderate tails. The Jarque-Bera test statistic of 301.077 with a probability of 0.000 confirms significant deviation from a normal distribution. As with Palladium and Gold, the ADF and PP tests suggest that differencing the series is necessary for stationarity, indicating potential trends or seasonality in Platinum prices.

These findings can be rationalized based on the inherent characteristics of the models and the nature of the data. 5.1.1 1-Day horizon The Random Forest model demonstrated superior accuracy in the short-term (1-day horizon) with an RMSE of 0.0002. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the Random Forest model's ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between variables effectively. Its ensemble nature, which aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees, helps in capturing the intricate patterns in the data, making it highly suitable for short-term forecasting where immediate market reactions and fluctuations need to be accurately predicted. The LSTM model followed closely with an RMSE of 0.0024. LSTM's strength lies in its ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in time-series data. While it may not have outperformed the Random Forest in the 1-day horizon, its performance indicates that it effectively captures short-term trends and volatility. Remarkably, the XGBoost model achieved an RMSE of 0.0000, indicating potential overfitting or an anomaly. XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its high accuracy and efficiency. However, the perfect score suggests that the model might have memorized the training data rather than generalizing well to unseen data, a classic sign of overfitting. This highlights the need for careful validation and potential regularization to prevent overfitting in practical applications.  5.1.2 7-Day horizon As the forecasting horizon extended to 7 days, the ANN model significantly improved, recording an RMSE of 0.0134. ANNs are known for their flexibility and ability to model complex relationships in data. The improvement in performance at this horizon suggests that the ANN model is adept at capturing patterns that emerge over a slightly longer period, making it effective for weekly volatility predictions. The Random Forest model maintained good performance with an RMSE of 0.0021, demonstrating its robustness and versatility across short-term horizons. The model's ability to aggregate multiple weak learners continues to provide reliable predictions, even as the forecast period extends slightly. The GRU model emerged as the best among deep learning models with an RMSE of 0.0709. GRUs, like LSTMs, are designed to handle sequential data and can efficiently capture dependencies over time. Their performance at the 7-day horizon indicates that they can effectively manage intermediate-term volatility patterns.  5.1.3 14-Day horizon For medium-term forecasts (14 days), the ANN model continued to excel with an RMSE of 0.0106, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing volatility patterns over two weeks. The ANN's performance underscores its ability to learn and generalize from the underlying data structure, making it a powerful tool for medium-term forecasting where the data might exhibit more stable trends compared to very short-term fluctuations. The Random Forest model's RMSE slightly increased to 0.0185, but it remained competitive. This increase is expected as the complexity and uncertainty of the forecast horizon grow. Nonetheless, the model's performance remains strong, reflecting its capacity to handle non-linear patterns even over extended periods. The GRU model maintained a relatively strong performance with an RMSE of 0.1605. GRUs are effective in capturing longer sequences and dependencies in data, and their performance at this horizon suggests they can still provide valuable forecasts for medium-term volatility, although not as precise as ANNs or Random Forests.  5.1.4 21–30 Day horizon In the long-term (21–30 days), the ANN model sustained its lead with RMSEs of 0.0346 and 0.0703, respectively, reinforcing its robustness in long-term forecasting. The ANN's ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data allows it to effectively model and predict long-term trends and patterns, which is critical for strategic planning and investment decisions. The Random Forest model exhibited exceptional short-term accuracy but experienced a slight decline in longer horizons. This decline is understandable, as Random Forests, while powerful in handling immediate and short-term predictions, might struggle with the increased uncertainty and complexity inherent in long-term forecasts. The ensemble approach that works well for capturing short-term noise may not be as effective when predicting longer-term trends. The GRU model demonstrated strong performance in short to medium-term forecasts but showed a slight weakening in longer-term forecasts. GRUs, while effective in capturing sequential data over intermediate periods, might face challenges with longer horizons due to the accumulation of prediction errors and the increased difficulty in maintaining long-term dependencies accurately.  5.1.5 Overall performance Overall, the ANN model emerged as the top performer across various horizons, particularly excelling in medium to long-term forecasts. This can be attributed to the ANN's flexibility and capability to learn from complex patterns in data, making it highly adaptable to different forecasting horizons. The Random Forest model's exceptional short-term accuracy underscores its strength in handling immediate, non-linear relationships, but its performance declines slightly in longer horizons due to increased complexity. The GRU model shows a balanced performance, effectively handling short to medium-term forecasts but facing challenges in maintaining accuracy over longer periods. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate forecasting models based on the specific requirements of different time horizons. The superior performance of ANNs in medium to long-term forecasts makes them invaluable for strategic planning and investment decisions, while Random Forests and GRUs provide reliable short to medium-term predictions, offering a comprehensive toolkit for volatility forecasting in precious metal markets.   5.2 Discussion of gold volatility forecasting results The analysis of gold volatility forecasting across different horizons revealed that the XGBoost model consistently outperformed other models, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.
