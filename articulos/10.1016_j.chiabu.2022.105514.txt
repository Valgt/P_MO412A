                  Background
                  For children living in a village near Angkor Wat, Siem Reap, Cambodia, selling low cost goods to tourists supplements family incomes and progresses familial social and educational aspirations. However, the Cambodian Government has legislated to remove children selling on the streets in order to project a modern, orderly society. Simultaneously, the tourist campaigns of local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) discourage tourists from purchasing goods from children, based on the premise that work prevents school attendance.
               
                  Objective
                  To explore the lived experiences of street-selling children focusing particularly on formal and non-formal education within a human development framework and compare and contrast this to the positions of the Cambodian Government and local NGOs.
               
                  Participants and setting
                  The research participants comprised 22 Cambodian street-sellers aged 8–15 years in central Siem Reap, Cambodia.
               
                  Method
                  Rights-based, participatory research was conducted over two periods totalling five months, between 2013 and 2015.
               
                  Results
                  The child street-sellers were initially able to work and attend school with their selling financing their schooling costs. During the research, 14 participants (64%) were forced from their selling activities and unable to pay schooling costs, subsequently left school. However, the successful child street-sellers devised strategies to continue selling, remain in school, learn English through tourist interactions and fulfil their familial and cultural obligations.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Contrary to Government policy and NGO campaigns, many child streets-sellers in Siem Reap work to finance their own schooling and progress their own human development and are adversely impacted and have their rights violated when removed from the street.

However, the Cambodian Government has legislated to remove children selling on the streets in order to project a modern, orderly society. Simultaneously, the tourist campaigns of local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) discourage tourists from purchasing goods from children, based on the premise that work prevents school attendance.  Objective To explore the lived experiences of street-selling children focusing particularly on formal and non-formal education within a human development framework and compare and contrast this to the positions of the Cambodian Government and local NGOs.  Participants and setting The research participants comprised 22 Cambodian street-sellers aged 8–15 years in central Siem Reap, Cambodia.  Method Rights-based, participatory research was conducted over two periods totalling five months, between 2013 and 2015.  Results The child street-sellers were initially able to work and attend school with their selling financing their schooling costs. During the research, 14 participants (64%) were forced from their selling activities and unable to pay schooling costs, subsequently left school. However, the successful child street-sellers devised strategies to continue selling, remain in school, learn English through tourist interactions and fulfil their familial and cultural obligations.  Conclusion Contrary to Government policy and NGO campaigns, many child streets-sellers in Siem Reap work to finance their own schooling and progress their own human development and are adversely impacted and have their rights violated when removed from the street.   Keywords Cambodia  Street-sellers  Capabilities approach  SDGs  Tourism and development  UNCRC    1 Introduction Our tour guide told us not to buy goods from street children because then they don't go to school. I have also seen pamphlets that say the same thing. It's terrible that children are denied an education because they have to make money for their parents. (Janice, Australian tourist in Siem Reap, aged early 40s)   Tourists who visit Siem Reap in Cambodia receive multiple warnings not to buy any items from Cambodian children, because it is said that this can prevent children from acquiring an education. This message is communicated through pamphlets (Figs. 1 & 2   ) and tourist operators and is a common subject of discussion among tourists whose Western ideas about childhoods are challenged when faced with the many children who approach them to sell souvenirs and practice their English. This paper problematizes that notion, demonstrating that children's work and education are not mutually exclusive in developing countries like Cambodia. The research enriches previous studies on barriers to education in Cambodia, where caring for younger siblings, grandparents or sick parents, and working at home, are common challenges to school attendance (Kim, 2009 ). The data herewith indicates that despite the position taken by many NGOs, street-selling can generate funds for school and associated expenses and preventing children's part-time selling work can constitute yet another kind of barrier to schooling and learning. Street selling to tourists can contribute to aspects of quality education. The paper draws on Sen's (1999)  capabilities approach which constructs development as freedom by considering where street selling sits on the freedom - unfreedom continuum of development. In efforts to address Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, quality education , the “key to escaping poverty” and SDG 8 , “decent work and economic growth ” (United Nations, 2020 ), the research explores barriers to education for Cambodian child street-sellers. The United Nations Development Programme (2021 n.p.) SDGs are a “universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity”. The paper contributes to understandings around why children work on the streets in this tourist area of Cambodia, from the perspective of the children themselves. The research concludes that consideration of children's voices is vital in tourism development planning as the income and skills that child street-sellers generate through their work can fund their education and thereby simultaneously remove the “unfreedom” of inability to access education (Sen, 1999 ) and contribute to achieving SDGs 4 and 8: quality education  and decent work and economic growth . The term children in street situations was adopted by the “UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in UN General Comment No. 21 (2017) on children in street situations (UNCRC, 2017, p.3) to comprise children who “depend on the streets to live and work … or who have formed strong connections with public spaces and for whom the street plays a vital role in their everyday lives and identities”. Children in street situations are found on every continent in unknown numbers. The absence of data renders these children “invisible, which leads to policies not being developed or measures that are ad hoc, temporary or short term … and the persistence of multiple rights violations” (OHCHR, 2017: 9 ). This Cambodian research therefore also informs the broader global issue of children in street situations and the development of a child rights approach. Cambodia experienced recent improvement in development indicators as a result of strong economic growth in tourism and the garment industry. In 1992 Angkor Archaeological Park near Siem Reap, Cambodia was declared a World Heritage site. Pre COVID-19 the site enjoyed increasing popularity; in 2018, 2.5 million international tourists visited (Spiess, 2018 ) generating US$116 million in income (Vannak, 2019 ). Between 1990 and 2019, “mean years of schooling increased by 2.3 years and expected years of schooling by 4.8 years” (UNDP, 2020: 2 ). However, inequality in life expectancy, education and income measured by the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) indicates 45.8% of the population experience multidimensional poverty (UNDP, 2020 ). The poor do not have access to a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living (ADB & ILO, 2015 ). Malnutrition causes 45% of child deaths, 32% of children to be stunted and 10% wasted (too thin for their height) (UNICEF, 2019 ). Gender based inequality, measured by reproductive health, empowerment and economic activity, places Cambodia 117th of 162 countries (UNDP, 2018 ). Gender inequalities feature through everyday life from childhood. For example, only 15.1% of adult women, compared to 28.2% of men reach secondary education (UNDP, 2018 ). Period poverty further impacts girl's education because without hygienic facilities, menstruation is a barrier to school attendance. Many Cambodian government schools do not have the facilities to support menstruating girls; 50% of schools do not have a reliable water supply and an additional 33% do not have toilets (The Borgen Project, 2020 ). A further barrier for girls is the cost and inaccessibility to sanitary pads; a pack of six costs $3, approximately three times the national poverty level of $0.93 per person per day (The Borgen Project, 2020 ). Sexual health education, including menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is limited or absent in Cambodian schools while parental knowledge is based on “embedded traditions and stigmas” (Ministry of Education's Department of School Health, cited in The Phnom Penh Post, 2016 ). Historical, political and cultural factors also impact educational attainment in Cambodia. The education system continues to recover from the Khmer Rouge period (1975–79) that destroyed the education system and resulted in the deaths of 96% of university students and 67% of school students (Benveniste et al., 2008 ). Spending on education remains low and Cambodia ranks 183 of 197 countries with a GDP allocation of only 1.9% (The World Bank, 2019 ). Systemic corruption (ranked 162 of 180 countries, Transparency International, 2020 ) in the authoritarian government and a traditional patronage system have left Cambodia among the least developed of the ASEAN Nations (UNDP, 2013 ). Further inequalities exist because benefits derived from tourism are largely distributed among big foreign and local companies such as airline companies and hotels, while only 6% of people living in the Angkor Archaeological Park (where the research participants live) have tourism related work (Chheang, 2010 ). Since 1992, many children from Sokhem (a pseudonym translated as ‘hope’ in Cambodian) village near Angkor Wat supplement family incomes by approaching tourists on the streets of Siem Reap and in the car park opposite Angkor Wat, selling books, postcards and homemade goods. However, street-selling children are deemed “out of place” in the touristscape (Cresswell, 1996 ) because they defy Western sensibilities about whether children “should” work, and also defy the image the Cambodian Government seeks to promote of a modern society. Thus, Cambodian lawmakers and mainstream society influenced by Western values and elite discourses adopted by NGOs all discourage street-selling children from tourist spaces, efforts which (inadvertently) exclude children from opportunities of social and economic mobility. This participatory research reveals how children can find multiple and resourceful ways to remain selling to finance their schooling, improve their own non-formal educations and accrue knowledge on the streets, which they could not otherwise achieve. Despite social and spatial oppression, child street-sellers in Siem Reap exert their agency to either hide from the local police or appease them via regular payments (bribes). These practices are viewed here through Freire's (1972)  “pedagogy of the oppressed” that treats the learner as a co-creator of knowledge and enables the poor to find freedom through education. Therefore, child street-sellers operating at tourist sites in Cambodia are framed as co-creators of knowledge and thus as active agents in their own education. When children use income and knowledge generated through the tourism economy to fund education, they support Cambodia edge toward SDG 4: acquiring education . The research highlights two main findings: 1) street selling work can enable children's schooling and can lead directly to good jobs, and 2) schooling in Cambodian government schools does not provide the skills required for careers in the globalised economy. These conclusions undermine two key assumptions of the anti-child street selling discourse: 1) street selling prevents children from going to school, and 2) government schools provide for children's current and future wellbeing and the skills necessary to participate in a globalising Cambodia. To fully understand and assess the impacts of the global economy in developing countries, it is important for researchers to examine the interpretations of children and childhood with respect to the production of the tourist space (Buzinde & Manuel-Navarrete, 2013 ). Children are often neglected in tourism planning and as a result, suffer exclusion from the development process and the benefits that stem from tourism growth. This research illuminates how children who sell on the streets of Cambodia aim to overcome multiple and intersecting oppressions that result in their marginalisation and disempowerment in the face of the international development of tourism economies.  2 Conceptual framework The theoretical framework is two-fold, combining an intersectional analysis to understand multiple barriers to empowerment, and a capabilities approach that posits development as freedom and improved social and economic outcomes. Intersectionality is a framework to help understand how aspects of a person's identity and various forms of inequality often operate together in a synergistic effect to increase discrimination or privilege and thus empower or oppress (Crenshaw, 2017 ). Intersectionality usually focuses on race, gender and class, however, the disempowering status as a child is one aspect of identity often omitted from analysis. In Cambodia's collectivist and hierarchal society elders have authority and status and “children traditionally do not have rights, but only responsibilities” (Gourley, 2009, p. 18 ). The patriarchal society further disempowers girls. Amartya Sen's (1999)  concepts of ‘unfreedoms’ and human development through the capabilities approach and children's rights as defined by the UNCRC (1989)  can be applied to this context to argue for the inclusion of children in the development of tourism economies because this can improve educational attainment and the quality of work and economic development. Sen (1999, p. 5) , a Nobel prize-winning scholar argued “the enabling conditions of development are good health, basic education and the encouragement and cultivation of initiatives”. Similarly, the UNDP (2010)  identified three components of human development, physical and mental well-being; empowerment and agency; and justice and equity. This aligns with Sen's (1999)  Capabilities Approach which focuses on the actual opportunities or freedoms that people have to access the processes that result in the ability to lead lives they value. The denial of any substantive freedoms are therefore considered “unfreedoms” (Sen, 1999 ). This freedom-centred approach to development is agent oriented explaining that “with adequate social opportunities, individuals can effectively shape their own destiny” (Sen, 1999, p. 11 ). Adequate social opportunities exist when there is “1) political freedom, 2) economic facilities, 3) social opportunities, 3) transparency guarantees and 4) protective security” (Sen, 1999, p. 10 ). The child street-sellers use their limited agency to escape the unfreedoms of poverty, inadequate nutrition and inability to access health and education. These outcomes align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1: no poverty; 2: zero hunger; 3: good health and well-being; 4: quality education; 5: gender equality; 8: decent work and economic growth and 10: reduced inequalities  (United Nations, 2020 ). 2.1 Social and spatial exclusion on the streets of Siem Reap Working children are excluded from the official Siem Reap touristscape. The Government of Cambodia legislated to prevent children from selling on the streets of Phnom Penh and Siem Reap in 2006. This was part of an ongoing process to project an image of “Cambodia as a modern, orderly society” (Springer, 2009, p. 152 ). Street-sellers were believed to occupy public land and disturb order (Kusakabe, 2006 ). According to a Government official, the children had “become bothersome to tourists and problematic for police” (Phnom Penh Post, 2007 ). However, the practice of removing children from the streets was common prior to the enactment of the 2006 legislation and the Cambodian Government has been accused of a series of human rights violations of people deemed undesirable (Human Rights Watch, 2016 ). Human Rights Watch (2016, n.p.)  reported that street-children are routinely detained in “detention centres (jails) around the country … for ‘social rehabilitation’”. When interviewed by the Phnom Penh Post (2007) , street-selling children claimed they “have always been allowed to work in restricted areas provided they pay bribes to police and officials”. Most of these children are less than 14 years of age (the legal age for work) and disempowered by the unfreedoms of poverty. These unfreedoms include lack of legal infrastructure and transparency (Sen, 1999 ), for example where children that are visible to tourists are subject to police scrutiny, while underage workers not visible to tourists are ignored by authorities. Cambodian children who sell on the streets to fund their education display active agency and assert their right to work, be educated and engage with the international economy through tourist exchanges. This diverges from dominant social constructions that consider street-children ‘out of place’ and as delinquents or victims that have become embedded in Western perceptions and subsequently imposed on street-connected children everywhere (Ansell, 2005 ). This attitude is reinforced and given momentum by tourist operators, NGOs and Government and international agencies in Cambodia who discourage tourists from buying from children.  2.2 NGOs and the earn or learn dualism The prevailing discourse espoused about child street-sellers is that they are “trapped in a Fagan-type relationship, exploited by a middleman or parents who capitalise on the children's ability to engage with tourists with a combination of engendered sympathy and cuteness” (Beazley & Miller, 2015, p. 14 ). Within this discourse, an earn or  learn dualism promotes the view that children who sell on the streets do not go to school. Furthermore, an International Labour Organization et al. (2006, p. i)  report on Children's work in Cambodia  states that: child labour constitutes a key obstacle to achieving universal primary education (SDG 4 ) and other Millennium Development Goals in Cambodia … [and children] are denied the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills needed for gainful future employment (SDG 8 ). These discourses omit any notion of children as active agents in accumulating wealth and investing in their own education. These discourses also underplay the value of Cambodia child-international tourist, healthy (not sex tourism) transactional engagements.  2.3 Western and Cambodian perceptions of childhood and work In Cambodia, globalisation and time-space compression have brought together different cultures with different ideas on childhood. In Cambodian collectivist society, the contributions of all family members are regarded as equally important and each person is expected to share the load according to their means (Gourley, 2009 ). A child's work effort also has cultural importance, confers respect and provides skill acquisition and a path toward adulthood (Gourley, 2009 ). However, Western societies provide children with a “prolonged period of social immaturity and dependence,” which is thought to provide the best environment for emotional and physical development (Boyden & Gibbs, 1997, p. 22 ). This childhood includes not being burdened with responsibility and work (Walkerdine, 2004 ). This has become an ideal Western developmental view of the child and used to categorise all children (Waller & Davis, 2014 ) despite most children living in the majority world. The State and some NGOs have constructed the ideal family as one where children do not work, although the urban poor have no input into these policies which do not reflect Cambodia's poor collectivist society. The Children's work in Cambodia  report states that:children's work does not appear to play a role in helping families afford children's schooling [and] … the relation between school and economic activity becomes more negative with age, particularly among girls. (International Labour Organization et al., 2006, p. iv )   This report also states that “children's work has a significant detrimental effect on learning achievement as measured by literacy and numeracy test scores” (International Labour Organization et al., 2006: 31 ). Due to the status of these organisations, this report and its findings have been the basis of many intervention strategies and the exclusionary discourses of a number of NGOs. This has perpetuated the myth that all street-selling children do not go to school. However, there are many different types of children operating on the streets in Cambodia and they cannot be seen as a homogenous group. Cambodia ratified the UNCRC (1989)  Article 32 and International Labour Organisation (ILO, 1999 ) Minimum Age Convention at 14 years. As a result, Western public discourse and policy problematizes the issue of under-age child work, rather than distinguishing between various types of work or labour that may be beneficial or harmful (Aufseeser et al., 2017 ; White, 1999 ). In contrast, child labour is mentally and or physically dangerous and or interferes with a child's attendance at school (Aufseeser et al., 2017 ). Child work is safe, age and size appropriate and can have many positive effects including the ability to finance schooling, increased nutrition and additional total household income and well-being (White, 1999 ). Ratifying the Minimum Age Convention is useful in a more ideal society, however the Cambodian context challenges this ideal. Furthermore, education and work can enhance other aspects of social and economic development, in line with Sen's (1999)  holistic view of development that recognises for example that without food security and good governance, education is not effective.   3 Methodology: rights based, participatory research The research was conducted on tourist-occupied streets in central Siem Reap including Street 08, colloquially known as Pub Street to reflect the number of pubs and restaurants. At the end of the day the street is open to foot traffic only and tourists converge here after a day visiting the temples. The research group comprised 22 Cambodian street-sellers, ranging in age from 8 to 15 years. The research occurred daily in two phases; phase one for four months and a follow up phase nine months later for one month (2013–2015). The rights-based research methodology is unique from previous studies conducted in Cambodia because it employs participatory approaches to explain children's lives from their own perspectives. Child Led Research (CLR) as a participatory approach involves researching with  children rather than obtaining data from  them and sees children as active agents in their own lives, involved in meaningful, ethical and rights based data collection methods (Ansell & van Blerk, 2005 ; Beazley & Ennew, 2006 ). Ennew's (1995)  process was followed, which requires child participants be given sufficient information to enable them to make an informed decision as to whether they will participate or not. As a white woman in a tourist location in Southeast Asia, I was easily identifiable as a tourist. This facilitated recruitment of street-seller participants through conversation initiated by the sellers as part of their well-rehearsed method of engaging with potential customers to either sell goods or develop their English language skills. After a brief initial conversation, informed consent and the option to participate in the research were discussed. Building rapport and progressively gaining the children's confidence and trust is central to the participatory approach. I was able to achieve this through my extended time in the area and daily conversations with the children. Each day or evening I positioned myself at a restaurant owned by a local Cambodian who happily agreed to allow my conversations with the children when I explained the research. My regular table fronted Pub street and provided a familiar and safe environment for the children to stop for a chat and share stories. This followed on from Kraftl's (2013)  assertion that a safe environment is conducive to allow children to tell their stories and also share their emotions. This cross- cultural setting is unique because it promotes connections that diverge from Cambodia's traditional hierarchical and gendered society which precludes children from discussion with adults (Gourley, 2009 ). Walking around the tourist sites or eating a meal provided further opportunity for data collection. I regularly drew on my thirty years-experience as an educator in school and non-school settings in Australia and Cambodia. Data was collected from the children during Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), individual and small group communication and observations which occurred for a few hours at varying times of the day or evening over the five-month research period. Varying times enabled interaction with the children based on the Cambodian school day with attendance required in either the morning (7–11:30 am) or afternoon (1–5 pm), which revealed they were not selling during their school hours. FGDs enable children and young people to be active agents and explain the diversity of their own experiences, perceptions and perspectives (Reas, 2015 ). Individual and small group conversations were the sellers favoured form of communication and by necessity informally structured, which allowed children to run off to pursue a sale and then return to continue the conversation. Helping the children with their homework provided opportunities for further discussion and my status as a native English speaker was a welcomed resource to develop English language skills. For example, one day as I helped Rotha (girl 12) with her NGO English homework on family relationships, mother, daughter etc., she asked if I had arranged my daughter's marriage. This flagged a child-initiated discussion on female access to education and marriage age in Australia and Cambodia. Child initiated topics therefore provided expression for their interest and concerns. Observation provided opportunities to view behaviours and tactics used when children negotiated with potential customers or the authorities who challenged their presence. Observations of tourist's body language and expressions also provided a more complete picture of the exchange. To ensure behaviours of tourists and authorities were unaffected by my presence, I easily distanced myself from the scene by blending into the touristscape by for example, writing in my research journal, talking to and obtaining information from other tourists or photographing scenes. This is regarded as a highly effective research technique to obtain information from target groups who are behaving normally; that is, as though the researcher is not there (Punch, 2003 ). I utilised local networks to recruit two tuk tuk (motorcycle taxi) drivers, who provided the useful services of transport and translation when required. Vanny, an education student at university and Rutah also provided an introduction to the tuk tuk driver network and therefore further insight into social and cultural relationships and norms. As local drivers, they were known to the children and their presence further developed an environment of trust. Most data are from the children themselves, who preferred to progress their English language skills. Conversations with adults from Sokhem who were once street-sellers provided a valuable historical context. The children and tuk tuk drivers also provided information on former sellers who had been forced from the streets into other forms of employment. I also interviewed and conducted informal conversations with workers from a variety of NGOs and a social worker from Angkor Hospital for Children who provide further background and context. One of the sellers (Eam, boy 15) introduced me to his school principal and facilitated a school tour during school hours which provided proof of the children's regular school attendance. The research informs and was informed by both Western and Cambodian perspectives of childhood and was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University where I am employed.  4 Research findings 4.1 The children and the developing tradition of street selling to tourists The book, bracelet, flower and postcard selling children who sell to tourists in Siem Reap and outside the temples all lived with their families in the same village, Sokhem near Angkor Wat. This tradition had developed since Angkor Wat's World Heritage status was conferred in 1992. Prior to 1992, parents of these sellers endured the horrors of the Pol Pot regime and the civil war that followed, which instilled a fear of angering the authorities. This older generation quietly keep their heads down, avoiding the gaze of the police and get on with life. They “just want to be left alone” (Brinkley, 2011 ), and adhere to a passivity and culture of silence associated with the pedagogy of the oppressed. It was their children that took the initiative and began selling to tourists. “It is a tradition in Sokhem to sell to tourists, children have been selling since the tourists started to visit Angkor Wat” (Sary, girl 15). In contrast to their parents, this new generation of Cambodians living in poverty perform a new self-awareness and drive to access funds that will increase their educational attainment, despite coming into opposition to the authoritarian regime. Thus this post-Pol Pot, post World Heritage conferral generation of street-selling children forge new oppositional relationships to authority. They challenge the culture of silence perpetuated by authorities, and actively pursue economic and social mobility. This is in line with Freire's (1972)  notion of challenging this pedagogy of the oppressed, through asserting a right to participate in the economy, be educated and investing in themselves and more actively participating in social and economic development. Therefore, the increased education of child street-sellers is part of broader social change that is indicative of a shift in relations between individual and state in Cambodia. The children began their selling careers at about seven when they joined a slightly older mentor from the village. Over time and as a result of the instruction of older mentors and interaction with tourists the younger children developed English language, entrepreneurial and personal interaction skills. The mentors also taught the importance of addressing and approaching tourists in a way considered acceptable by Western standards. The attainment of these skills through self and peer education is testament to the children's resourcefulness and resilience. In the collectivist society of Cambodia, the peer group is an extension of the family (Gourley, 2009 ) and the children spend “most of their time together” (Sary, girl 15). Authority within the group was the result of age and perceived selling success. The older children were treated with additional respect because they had increased agency and the knowledge and skill to interact with tourists and often outsmart the police.  4.2 Hierarchy on the street influences capacity to fund education from profits generated through street selling A street hierarchy or social scale is evident among the street-connected children who work in a number of money-earning activities (refer Table 1  ). This hierarchy is influenced by spatial territory and is reciprocally related to children's ability to access education - children who are placed higher in the hierarchy have better access to schooling, and having better access to schooling places them higher in the hierarchy. The hierarchy informs codes of behaviour within and between groups of street-selling children. This hierarchy is well known and referred to within the community, including tuk tuk drivers, restaurant and pub owners and a number of local NGOs. The hierarchy is based on the values considered most important in the Cambodian collectivist culture; polite and honest, contribute to and support community and family and behaviour that brings honour to the family. Respect is earned by having a good character and behaving in ways that conform to cultural norms and religious precepts (Gourley, 2009 ). The children who sell to tourists on the main streets of Siem Reap are at the top of the locally developed street hierarchy because of the social capital associated with developing English (and other) language skills from interacting with tourists, their neat appearance, managing their own small business and importantly, financing their schooling. The street-sellers were careful to differentiate themselves from other groups considered to be lower on the street hierarchy. This was achieved through their tightly controlled and protected collective identity that included appropriate behaviour and smart dress. Consequently, the sellers did not access the territory (the western end of Pub Street) occupied by “the children that beg for milk money” [milk scam kids, described in detail later in this section] (Chuk, girl 12).We do not like this scam and do not go there. The tourists will think that we are all like this and it gives us a bad name. Perhaps this is why the tourists don't like to buy from us anymore … We don't go there, the men who control the children and pay the police would tell us to go away. These children look dirty and steal the wallets of the tourist and do not go to school. The overlord (the term used by the street-sellers, tuk tuk drivers and local NGOs) is very rich and drives an expensive car. (Srey Pan, girl 12)   Next on the street hierarchy are the child cleaners in the undercover Old Market or Psah Chas ; employment here has legitimacy but is seen as a last resort. The authorities do not challenge these underage children because they work after the market has closed at 11 pm and are therefore out of the tourist gaze. The children experience limited agency and the night work prevents their attendance at school (SDG 4 , UNCRC Article 28). These children do not interact with tourists and therefore do not develop any English language or the skills to engage with the international economy. Next in the street hierarchy are children who collect recyclable rubbish, a job considered lowly and dirty. These children, well below the legal working age of 14, have more status than those who beg. As explained by a NGO social worker, they remain on the touristscape unchallenged by the local authorities because the collection of rubbish is a valuable service and supplements the inadequate collection provided by the Government. However, the Ilo (1999, n.p.)  includes “waste scavenging or rubbish picking” in the “worst forms of child labour, category 2: hazardous forms” because of the associated dangers to the child's health. The children were also observed collecting items of discarded food to consume themselves, a common practice among street-connected children. Their work prevents attendance at school which additionally perpetuates their unfreedoms of poverty. The Minimum Age Convention is not applied to the children who clean the market or collect bottles for recycling which suggests a lack of transparency guarantees, argued by Sen (1999)  as a precondition for development. The lowest status, because it is regarded as begging, was assigned to the children with babies on their hips (Fig. 3  ) who approach tourists and plead for “milk for my baby”. These children are referred to colloquially as the “milk scam kids” and ask tourists to buy powdered milk for their babies from a complicit store. The child then hands the donated milk to a managing ‘overlord’ who sells the milk back to the shop at a reduced price. This practice has been identified and challenged as a scam by the Childsafe Network NGO (Fig. 4  ). Local Cambodians call these children kheng somtean , or “beg milk from tourists and sell back for money”. Appealing to the emotions of female tourists was a successful strategy as explained by Sandra (late 50s); “I couldn't resist buying milk for the babies despite the warnings (see Fig. 4 ). I am a mother!” The power of the group involved in the scam is expressed in their monopolisation of a particular location, achieved by alleged payments to police by the overlord. Social workers from Angkor Hospital for Children confirmed the milk scam children do not attend school. The social workers had tried on many occasions and in multiple ways to connect with the group to ascertain their level of well-being and provide free bottled milk for the babies. These offers were rejected and hospital management determined that attempts to connect must be discontinued in the short term after threats of violence. For this reason, the social workers advised against my attempts to connect with the milk scam kids. Street-selling children are not a homogenous group. The NGO campaigns that problematize child street-selling (Figs. 1–4 ) and Government policy do not make any distinction between the milk scam kids and the children who sell goods to tourists nor accurately account for the diversity of childhood experience in developing contexts.  4.3 “Don't be like the frog in a well”: strategies to achieve funds for education through street-selling Kong Keb Knong Ondong , or “frog in the well”, is a commonly used Cambodian proverb that suggests not having an open mind. Engaging with tourists to generate funds and to learn about the world is one strategy to “not be like the frog in a well”. Street-sellers like Proen consistently demonstrated how engagement with tourists expanded knowledge. Asserting a right to sell and thereby fund their education, the successful street-sellers demonstrated strategies to increase the likelihood of a sale. The most successful sellers immediately refuted the NGO marketing message that child street-sellers do not go to school by promoting their status as students and showcasing proof of their attendance;I love school and want to be a teacher. I carry my school report with me all the time when selling and show it to the tourists. When tourists see my report they talk to me and ask questions about my school. These tourists will often buy a book. (Srey Pan, girl 12)   Srey Pan with obvious pride, showed me her NGO school report. In all subjects she was in the top five of the 60 in her year, with grades for all subjects above 90%. Srey Pan and selling partner and mentee Dan (girl 10) both attend government school in the morning although as Srey Pan explained “often the teacher does not come to school because they have another job”. This is a common and accepted situation (and one I observed on my visits to the children's school) because it is acknowledged within poor communities that teacher salaries are not sufficient to support a family. Each afternoon from 1 to 3 pm (children attend Cambodian government schools six half days per week) the girls attend a local NGO English school, financed by their selling. NGO school was required to learn written English. Between 3 pm and 8 pm Monday to Saturday and all-day Sunday, the girls wander the tourist frequented streets of Siem Reap selling books and postcards to tourists. Challenging authorities and thinking critically were espoused through their common practice of carrying their items in a small shoulder bag to hide their wares from the police and their strategies to engage with tourists. When asked about the claims there is a middle-man involved (as suggested by the NGO campaigns), Srey Pan (girl 12) disagreed and emphasised that this was her own self-managed business, “we buy books from the market or the book store for USD5.00 and then add a mark-up”. If an item was requested that they did not own, the girls would run back to the bookstore and make the purchase and on-sell to the tourist. This practice was validated when I made the unusual request of a Cambodian map. I watched the girls run off to the book store and return with the map. The children considered themselves independent, small business owners and had learnt the management skills associated with purchase and negotiating with a supplier, profit, mark ups, margins, arithmetic etc. supporting SDGs 4  and 8  around education and decent work. Chuk's (girl 12) strategy was to quickly engage in conversation and write a postcard (Fig. 5  ) to give to a tourist, “so they know that I go to school. Then people buy my books”. Chuk spoke very good English and it was common to observe her in extended conversations with a variety of English-speaking nationalities. Chuk was in grade 7 at government school in the morning and paid using the proceeds of her selling to attend an NGO school between 1:30 and 4:30 pm. A Cambodian teacher and friend who taught at this school confirmed Chuk was an enthusiastic student. She travelled with her mother into town after school and worked until 10.00 pm when her mother finished work selling at the market. Chuk's work financed her own and her brother's schooling and supplemented household food expenses. Her 14-year-old sister's role within the family was to look after the younger siblings and her grandmother and help with cooking. She does not attend school or speak any English. Traditional family roles can also undermine school attendance and educational attainment. Proen (boy 15) impressed tourists with his identification and knowledge of country accents and geography. After overhearing my conversation at a restaurant, Proen approached and said “you are Australian. The Great Barrier reef is the world's largest coral reef system and is over 2,300 kilometres long”. Proen had very good spoken English and an excellent geographical knowledge learnt “from talking to tourists”. His strategy worked; our group immediately connected with him and all purchased books. Proen sought to further his knowledge and was very interested in my first-hand account of snorkelling on the reef and asked many questions including impacts of climate change. I supplemented this conversation with internet photos of the reef on my phone. Proen further explained:I like selling books to the tourists because that is how I learnt to speak English. It's a good job and I learn many things about other countries. My friends sell at the night market and finish after 11pm; it's a very long day and they are too tired for school. I like speaking and studying English and one-day I will travel to other countries to learn more. I know about climate change; it is why the rice crop often fails because of floods or it is too dry. I want to know things and don't want to be like the frog in the well. (Proen, boy 15)   Proen therefore utilised talking to tourists to expand his knowledge, progress global citizenship and an understanding of SDG 13: climate action  and SDG 14: life below water . While increasingly rare (because of the NGO discourse), some children reported they were given gifts by tourists, including “clothes, things for school or sometimes a meal”. For Srey Pan (girl 12) a Christmas present from a “nice English lady” followed a conversation after she had shown the tourist her report. Srey Pan was excited to show me her new school bag, containing clothes and items for school to share with her class, including pens, pencils and exercise books. Therefore, tourists are often proactive in supporting education when they know the children attend school.  4.4 Tourist interactions finance schooling, provide English language instruction and cross cultural skills and understanding Globalisation and tourism have resulted in English growing in importance in Cambodia. English teachers are in short supply and access to instruction favours those with the financial means to attend private and commercial NGO schools (Nathan, 2014 ). The sellers' understanding was that to be accepted into a modernising Cambodia they needed to complete government school and also develop Western behaviours and English language skills which could be learned from watching and interacting with tourists and if financially able, paying for lessons at a commercial NGO. This was the most important reason for street-selling. Street-selling work was therefore a stepping stone to obtaining a broader education than was available in government schools and the long-term goal of stable employment and possibly university. The capabilities approach explains aspirations as a series of forward looking life projects in which individuals attempt to respond to their structural obstacles in order to imagine and achieve better lives (Powell & McGrath, 2019 ). Selling is therefore a proactive and constructive development initiative that enables these children to develop and realise aspirations to, according to Sen (1999) , lead lives they value. It is also the interaction with tourists that provides access to the soft skills necessary for work in modern Cambodia and progress SDG 8: decent work and economic growth . Cambodia's traditional education system is based on rote learning, a system that does not provide the relevant skills for the modern world; critical thinking, emotional intelligence, soft skills, lifelong learning and adaptability (Phannaro, 2016 ). ‘Soft skills’ are non-technical skills, such as leadership, teamwork, conflict management, problem solving, creativity, communication skills and personal hygiene (Phannaro, 2016 ). Street-selling children develop these skills through their own resourcefulness and interactions with tourists. For example, Ean (boy 16) asked “why do Western people eat with their mouth closed?”. I replied that in Western culture, chewing with your mouth open is considered impolite. The sellers then watched me as I ate and adopted my example. As well as acquiring vital cross cultural behavioural traits, Ean's selling had also enabled him to speak Thai and Vietnamese very well and even “a little bit of Korean and Japanese”. Vocational training in hospitality is yet to reflect the growth in tourism since 1992. Only 1% of Cambodians have received vocational training because it is prohibitively expensive due to course, relocation and accommodation costs and a lack of income during training (ADB, 2018 ). However, street-sellers, through interaction with and the demonstration effect of tourists and the advice of mentors have become conversant with other cultures. They therefore have the required skills to work, for example as a waiter, which was the sought after next step when a child had attained the legal working age of 14. Sonith (girl 13) explained her future plans and aspirations;When I am 14 I will be able to get a job as a waiter and earn USD70-80 per month plus tips. You must be able to speak English very well and know the correct way to interact with tourists. In Cambodia a child must not look at an older person, it is very rude, but tourists think it is rude if you do not look them in the face. You must know these things to work in a good restaurant. This work will also pay for university so I can study to be an accountant.   Selling work was also regarded as enjoyable and preferable to the other forms of employment available to under age children: cleaning at the market; working on the family or other farm, caring for younger siblings or grandparents, washing dishes at a restaurant, carting building materials on a construction site, collecting recyclable bottles. Srey Pan (girl, 12) explained:we enjoy selling and being with our friends. The money means that all my family have enough food (SDG 2 & 3 ) and my younger sisters and brother can go to school (SDG 4 ). We are lucky to have this good job, selling is fun and better than the hard and dirty work that many of our friends must do. We learn English and know how to be with tourists.   The street-sellers expressed pride in their personal presentation and invested in “nice clothes so we look smart for the tourist. We do not beg or ask for gifts” (Tola, girl 14). The children's adoption of conservative Western dress enabled them to “belong” or blend in to the touristscape which provided both a short and long-term competitive advantage. Thus, it was understood that the street-sellers dressed to align with their market and express their transition to citizens of a modern Cambodia. Their self- developed education therefore progressed beyond SDG 4: quality education  to also contribute to SDG 8: decent work and economic growth  and SDG 10: reduced inequalities . Cambodian minimum marriage age is not enforced and girls often marry young as required by cultural tradition. The demonstration effect of tourists provides an example of gender equality to which the girls aspired (Miller, 2020 ), that differs from traditional female roles to “serve and respect” (Gourley, 2009 ). One girl seller expressed with pride:We can now talk and express an opinion. Our parents did not go to school so they do not know many things but most parents are accepting change. Our parents will now ask us questions because they understand that we know more things. My parents are proud that I am at school and hope to go to university. Many girls in my village who no longer go to school will be married soon. (Tola, girl 14)   Period poverty provides a further barrier to girl's education because girls cannot afford or access safe sanitary products or are unable to receive information about safe period practices due to cultural stigma. However, street-selling provided the means to address period poverty. Informal and regular meetings with the girl street-sellers occurred in the laneway stall of a woman from their village who is a former street seller. Chea (early 20s) had purchased books on sexual health to instruct the girls and was comfortable answering my questions on the girl's understanding of personal hygiene. The books, usually purchased by NGOs, were costly by Cambodian standards and only available in English, thereby inaccessible to most. Chea explained that:without facilities, girls cannot go to school when they are menstruating and so they might miss one week per month and then fall behind in their school work. I take the girls shopping and help them buy menstrual pads (using the girl's money) and explain how to use and dispose the pads. Now the girls do not miss school.   The NGOs the girls paid to attend for English lessons also provided sex and hygiene education. Chea further explained that the girls also shared their knowledge and menstrual supplies with their sisters and friends. Street selling in this example has therefore provided access to SDG 3: good health and well-being; 4: quality education; 5: gender equality; 6: clean water and sanitation . Chea's street stall received street lighting under which the children could do their homework. Electricity supply in the village was inconsistent and not connected to all homes. Study sessions developed when the girls asked me to test them with questions from their NGO school books or practice pronunciation. Therefore, contrary to the NGO campaigns against child street-sellers, the children also use their selling time to work on their homework. Social facilities or opportunities (electricity) are one of the instruments of development (Sen, 1999 ). Two of the street-sellers (Tola, girl 14 and Vitay, girl 13) had started a small “school” in Sokhem and taught the younger children basic English for 1 h each evening. The girls spent considerable time with me discussing how to improve the various lessons they had prepared. The children demonstrated their solidarity through such practical displays of mutual support by passing on their English language skills to others within their village. It is this group identity and self-awareness that assists in their construction of a new, positive self-image; the pedagogy of the oppressed. It also exemplifies agency and the collectivist way to share and to transition the community to a modern Cambodia where even basic English language skills provide opportunity in the tourist sector beyond the most menial of work. The children's street-selling therefore has a multiplier effect providing benefits to the wider village community.  4.5 Street-sellers in Pub Street and exclusion In Siem Reap, exclusion is imposed on the child street-sellers on multiple levels. Their selling activities are illegal because of the 2006 Government legislation and because the children are under the legal working age of 14 years. Aligned with the patronage system, the street-sellers pay the police USD5.00 a month to be permitted to remain on the street, although harassment still occurred. Tourists have also been complicit in this exclusionary stance because they have been persuaded by local NGO discourse and marketing campaigns. The street-sellers reported, and I regularly and increasingly observed that they were shunned by tourists.  4.6 Valorisation and barriers to education and social opportunities Overwhelmingly education was highly valued by the sellers and their families as the way out of poverty and toward a better life with food security. While schooling is theoretically free, prohibitively expensive informal fees impede access to education. Teachers generate additional income by, for example charging fees for additional classes to receive the curriculum content necessary to complete the subject, receive examination papers or for students to park their bikes at school. This type of “forced corruption” is supported by the patronage system and acknowledged at the community level as the only means by which teachers are able to survive financially on the chronically low salaries paid in the public sector (Dawson, 2009 ). The inability to pay informal fees was the most common reason parents gave for their children dropping out of school (Brehm & Silova, 2014 ). Income from the children's street sales contributes to these ongoing fees. Ean (boy 16) in year 10, hoped to go to university and become an English teacher. Using his very good English, he explained the costs of small group tutoring which is necessary to obtain the full examinable curriculum.I pay [from the proceeds of street-selling] for additional maths tutoring at my high school with my usual teacher for one hour on Saturday at a cost of USD5.00 per month and extra classes for Khmer, chemistry and physics for two hours on Sunday at a cost of USD6.00 per month.   As is common in Cambodian collectivist society, the children's families decided on the role taken by each child including which child or children (usually boys), based on available funds, would continue their education. All family members ultimately benefitted from the increased earning capacity of the educated child/children. Ean's widowed mother decided in conjunction with her sons, that based on aptitude for learning, Ean would be the street-seller and educated child. His elder brother (18) drove a tuk tuk and his younger brother (13) had left school to walk and care for the families' two buffalo, a necessity without land ownership. Kim (young woman 23) also from Sokhem had worked as a seller outside Angkor Wat since she was eight. Kim had learned excellent English by conversing with tourists, who had often given her extra money to finance her schooling;When I was young, Western tourists often gave me extra money for schooling, once as much as USD300 in a day. The money was good back then and many children were able to stay at school because they could pay for their schooling. (Kim, girl 23)   The good years of selling to which Kim referred had also financed Kim's husband Pich's engineering degree. However, neither Kim nor Pich were able to gain employment commensurate with their educational qualifications and standard of spoken English because, “we do not know anyone”. The patronage system often proves prohibitive in gaining employment despite qualifications (Brinkley, 2011 ). This is not uncommon in developing countries, and is connected with SDG: 8 , economic opportunity , which only becomes available according to Sen (1999)  with transparency and good governance.  4.7 The Government, police and NGOs as barriers to education The result of the NGO campaigns and police operations was that over the year from when my research began and my return nine months later, only eight of the 22 original participants were still selling. The tuk tuk drivers also confirmed that as a result of the campaign by NGO Think Twice Cambodia , they observed tourists avoiding and shunning the sellers and an increased police presence, reduced tolerance and punishment for children selling. Punishment could include clear violations of child rights. Na (girl 11) explained she was grabbed by the arms and taken away from the immediate area by two policemen who very roughly shaved her head before releasing her. Na's very short hair supported her claim that this had recently occurred. Cambodians regard the head as “the location of one's being [which] must be treated with the greatest respect … and not touched by another person” (North, 2008, p. 80 ). This public display of punishment was therefore also intended to be demeaning both culturally and religiously. The children provided further explanation of the punishments and consequences of police action against their selling.Once the police took me to the police station for selling, this punishment happens to the boys only. I had to sit for most of the day and I was very scared. My parents had to pay USD25 to get me out. This is much money and my parents had to borrow from many people in the village. (Proen, boy 15)  It is difficult to keep selling. There are more police now and although we pay one policemen the USD5.00 if another one sees us he will take our books as punishment. Sometimes we can buy the books back for $1 or $2, but it is very difficult to make money and we have to pay for the books. Sometimes the police make us sit on our own near them for an hour. I am scared when this happens. (Rachana, girl 13)  Some children cannot afford this money so they don't sell anymore. Champei (girl 12) is now cleaning at the market and Maly (girl 11) is collecting bottles to sell. Anchaly's (girl 14) stepfather made her go to the karaoke. Vimean, (girl 12) has gone to Thailand to work as a domestic. None of these girls go to school any more. (Chuk, girl 12)   This demonstrates how Government policy and police responses contribute to oppression of child street-sellers. Rachana and Chuk had explained how many of the girls who had originally been part of the research group had been forced into alternate, more dangerous and less financially rewarding work that was lower on the hierarchy. Furthermore, these girls, were no longer attending school for various reasons. Champei (girl 12) was too tired to continue school after her cleaning shift which began at 11 pm when the market closed. Maly (girl 11) was sorting through rubbish to collect bottles for on-selling, an activity the ILO (1999: n.p.)  categorises as “worst forms of child labour, hazardous form, category 2”. Anchaly (girl 14) was working in a karaoke bar. While prostitution is illegal in Cambodia, karaoke bars have become the known location for purchasing sex from girls and women (Soma, 2012 ). Child prostitution is defined as one of the “worst forms of child labour, unconditional worst form, category 1” (ILO, 1999 : n.p.). Vimean (girl 12) joined the undocumented, large scale migration to Thailand. Migration is perceived as a proactive response to poverty and up to two million Cambodians were working pre COVID-19 in Thailand as unskilled labourers in construction, household domestics and fishing (Savi, 2019 ). However, low skilled Cambodian migrants working in the informal sector in Thailand are not covered by social benefits during COVID-19 lockdowns and therefore additional hardships exist. Families no longer receive remittances and workers risk spreading the disease as they attempt to return home despite migrant camps being sealed off and international borders closed (Sophea, 2021 ). Unofficial visa status is an extra layer of intersectional oppression for these children who migrate. Those that remained selling on the street expressed dissatisfaction toward Government and police regulations they believed created major and deliberate obstacles to improve their circumstances;The Government does not care about us, they only care about themselves. Selling to tourists is a tradition in our village and it is why so many children could go to school. Now because of the police it is difficult to sell and now many children cannot go to school. It also means often there is no money for food. (Proen, boy 15)   Most families grow rice although the number of children and inconsistent weather has resulted in insufficient food;All my family help with the rice crop. This year there have been floods and so we will not have enough rice for the year, maybe only six or seven months. This is why selling is so important. (Phirun, boy 13)   As well as facing oppression from police, child street-sellers note the barriers posed by the brochures that discourage tourists from buying from child street-sellers.It is more difficult to sell books than when you were here last time. Some NGOs are telling tourists that if you buy from children they do not go to school and their parents will keep the money, but this is not true. Sometimes tourists tell us to “go away”. (Srey Pan, girl 12)  Some children, only a few, are told by their parents that they cannot continue their schooling and must work either at home or maybe on a building site because they are very poor. In my village most parents want their children to go to school and can see the benefit for the family in the future. Parents are very proud if their children learn to speak English because this means that they can get a very good job. (Sonith, girl 13)   Government policy and the resultant police action have effectively denied the street-sellers their right to an education, through intercepting the children's ability to make money, demanding payment and limiting contact with tourists. These actions have compromised the children's ability to pay for their own (and potentially siblings) schooling and associated costs (SDG 4  and Article 28 of the UNCRC, 1989 ). Families also experienced inequalities and oppressions resulting from the child's lost income and schooling (SDGs 2, 3, 10 ) because of insufficient justice and strong institutions (SDG 16 ) that inhibit an enabling requirement of development, transparency guarantees and protective security (Sen, 1999 ). Unable to access the new tourist economy, the poor have become poorer and the increasing development gap has become an issue of social justice.   5 Conclusion The children's expression of agency is toward improved long-term well-being, particularly by focussing on the broader opportunities speaking English and formal and non-formal education provides. The practices developed by the children within their tradition of selling have provided a holistic education and social capital not usually accessible by those living in poverty. Selling has expanded the children's freedoms and provided the drivers for their personal development (physical well-being, empowerment through education, agency and justice) through the capabilities approach as defined by UNDP (2010)  and Sen (1999) . Realising personal aspirations for a place in modern Cambodia also provided the girls with options beyond traditional young marriage and parenthood. The opportunities for learning provided by tourists also developed cross cultural understanding, essential attributes as Cambodia progresses aspirations for economic development and a place in the globalised world. The findings from this research contradict reports from the International Labour Organization et al. (2006)  and the wide held belief that children's work has a detrimental effect on access to school and learning achievements. Street-selling is not only a route to fund education, but an important part of education that scaffolds onto the traditional locations of education, being school and home. This undermines the Western ideal that suggests child work and education are mutually exclusive. The child street-sellers of Siem Reap work to finance their schooling and thereby enhance attainment of SDGs 4 and 8 , as well as fulfil their traditional cultural and familial obligations. Sentiments expressed by the children indicate the advantage of street-selling work for their personal and family economic and social well-being and long-term future. Street-selling to tourists may be a more feasible and immediate approach en route to an ideal Cambodia where access to free and quality education is available for all. This research has shown a clearer picture of the relationship between street-selling and education. Though divergent from Western ideals, this research illuminates an interim where child street-selling work provides access to a quality formal and informal education that supports the children's human development to “lead lives they value” (Sen, 1999 ) and in support of SDGs 1: no poverty; 2: zero hunger; 3: good health and well-being; 4: quality education; 5: gender equality; 6: clean water and sanitation; 8: decent work and economic growth and 10: reduced inequalities . Education by any measure can enhance critical thinking and human development. In this context, street-sellers who use profits to fund their schooling and expand their cross-cultural understanding and global knowledge evidence a new generation of Cambodians, who despite their multiple and intersecting oppressions, espouse an invigorated sense of self, that includes a right to be heard and be educated by whatever means is possible. The children enthusiastically engaged with the participatory methodology and were empowered to express their lived experience and provide deeper insight into the phenomenon of children's interaction with tourism in Cambodia's rapidly changing economic, cultural and social context. Importantly, the research also serves as a conduit for the children's own perspectives about their lives. COVID-19 has caused the cessation of tourism in Cambodia. Post COVID research must include the lived experiences and voices of children in order to identify genuine barriers to education. The findings are pertinent to countries where marginalised young people and tourists interact. This research contributes to a growing body of literature related to the rights and agency of children in street situations worldwide and their ability to actively construct their own lives.
