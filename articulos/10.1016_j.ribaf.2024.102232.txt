                  The goal of this study is to examine the interdependencies between the banking sector and shadow banking sector in selected European economies through the lens of sustainable development. Using a node-theoretic structure and a network GVAR model, we investigate the relationship between these sectors in a Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. With this in mind, we examine the interlinkages between the various economies, using a network GVAR model so as to examine the potential dominance of some entities in the system. We conclude that in Europe there are two important financial systems operating simultaneously: one is the European system, where Germany plays a leading role, and the other is the United Kingdom. Analytically, a shock to the banking sector of the European economies will have an impact on the shadow banking sector of the other European economies, whereas shocks to the shadow banking assets of the individual European economies will not have a statistically significant impact on the banking assets of the other European countries. Moreover, shocks in the British banking system significantly impact the European shadow banking assets, while shocks in the shadow banking assets of European member states do not significantly affect the British GDP, suggesting the importance of cross-border collaborations in SDG efforts. By exploring the interdependencies between European banking and shadow banking sectors, this study contributes to the understanding of how financial systems can influence sustainable development. The findings emphasize the significance of fostering innovation across borders and leveraging international interactions to achieve the SDGs.

G. Michaelides is f. Head of the Laboratory of Theoretical and Applied Economics and Law, at the School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences of the National Technical University of Athens, Greece.      The goal of this study is to examine the interdependencies between the banking sector and shadow banking sector in selected European economies through the lens of sustainable development. Using a node-theoretic structure and a network GVAR model, we investigate the relationship between these sectors in a Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. With this in mind, we examine the interlinkages between the various economies, using a network GVAR model so as to examine the potential dominance of some entities in the system. We conclude that in Europe there are two important financial systems operating simultaneously: one is the European system, where Germany plays a leading role, and the other is the United Kingdom. Analytically, a shock to the banking sector of the European economies will have an impact on the shadow banking sector of the other European economies, whereas shocks to the shadow banking assets of the individual European economies will not have a statistically significant impact on the banking assets of the other European countries. Moreover, shocks in the British banking system significantly impact the European shadow banking assets, while shocks in the shadow banking assets of European member states do not significantly affect the British GDP, suggesting the importance of cross-border collaborations in SDG efforts. By exploring the interdependencies between European banking and shadow banking sectors, this study contributes to the understanding of how financial systems can influence sustainable development. The findings emphasize the significance of fostering innovation across borders and leveraging international interactions to achieve the SDGs.

Drawing from the insights provided by our empirical findings, we aim to establish a connection between the banking system and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research on sustainability, gained momentum with the introduction of the UN SDGs in 2015. These goals have become integral to the design and development of business models, products, services, and technologies, as organizations and individuals increasingly recognise the significance of sustainability. The paper at hand seeks to explore the interaction of banking organisations and individuals across borders within the context of a global system to effectively work towards achieving the SDGs. We acknowledge that international interactions encompass various factors such as trade, capital flows, multinational corporations, and migration, all of which can significantly impact sustainable development. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the nature of the impactâwhether positive or negativeâof these interactions. With a finance perspective, we shed light on the relationship between international interactions, and the achievement of SDGs. By bridging the insights from the paper on European banking and shadow banking with the theme of banking interaction across borders for SDGs, we aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of the interplay between finance and sustainable development. Our paper could serve as a platform for researchers to explore the transformative potential of cross-country collaborations and the role of innovative financial products in shaping a sustainable future, just like the work by Ordonez (2018)  that discusses the sustainability of shadow banking through a system that transforms risky assets into money-like securities. In this framework, a number of well-established banking systems as well as a large and rapidly expanding shadow banking sector exist in Europe, making the interplay between these two sectors particularly important. Shadow banks have created a parallel intermediation network, in which, they are interconnected vertically and provide credit through a variety of products. The shadow banking system has become more vital since mid 1980s, initially in the United States (US). The main reason for that was the absence of regulation on three directions. Firstly, on mutual funds which are used as a way to access deposits; secondly, securitization; and, thirdly, repos which are used in order to securitize bonds as money. Shadow banks have been blamed several times in the past for their responsibility in the creation of âbubblesâ, mainly in real estate markets, where they compete with commercial banks for the credit intermediation regarding households and businesses. Nonetheless, a valuable lesson of the US financial crisis is the fact that the shadow banking sector played a role both in the magnitude as well as in the expansion of the crisis (Brunnermeier, 2009 ). Although the shadow banking system might be less significant than in the US, in some European Union (EU) member states it cannot be ignored. As a result, despite the fact that the EU shadow banking system is smaller than the American, there is no guarantee that its role is less important, especially in turbulent macroeconomic environments. This is due to the fact that in periods of stress, the increased interconnection of the official banking system with the non-regulated shadow banking system is expected to generate liquidity problems very quickly, followed by sudden stops of funding in several markets leading to a higher risk of contagion across sectors or even countries. This interconnection of banks in the Euro area with unregulated banks includes mainly securitisation activities, as unregulated entities are used as special purpose vehicles (SPVs). As expected, the increased integration of equity and bond markets since the EMU formation could deteriorate the effects of contagion (Palaiodimos and Tzavalis, 2015 ). Moreover, the new regulatory framework of Basel III which introduces more strict capital and liquidity requirements for commercial banks, is expected to offer new incentives for these heavily regulated banks to shift part of their activities towards the unregulated part of the financial system and therefore increase shadow banking activities, making the situation even worse. It is worth mentioning that the Commissionâs Green Paper (2012) states the need to establish a permanent process on a European level, in order to collect information and exchange it among the relevant authorities for the shadow banking activities. To adequately model the dynamic interconnections among economies and between the banking and shadow banking sectors, we employ a network structure. This approach allows us to systematically capture the dual dynamic dependencies among various European economies. Furthermore, in line with modern macroeconometric and financial econometric literature, it is crucial to account for specific units within our sample. To achieve this, our paper builds upon the methodologies introduced by Michaelides et al. (2018)  and Tsionas et al. (2016) , extending their work to examine the dominance of the banking sector in the network. Other extensions of the traditional approach include, among others, the seminal contributions by Dees et al. (2007) and Daglis et al. (2023) . Finally, to comprehensively model the macroeconomic effects and dynamic interconnections across banking and shadow banking entities operating in different economies, we employ the Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) framework. This approach is consistent with the macroeconometric literature, as demonstrated by Pesaran et al. (2004), Chudik et al. (2016). For recent macroeconometric applications see, among others, e.g. Drivas et al. (2022) , Konstantakis et al. (2022) , and Economidou et al. (2023) . Our work contributes to the literature in the following ways: (a) It models the dominant characteristics of each economy using a network structure; (b) It acknowledges the dynamic interconnections among the banking and shadow banking sectors within each EU economy in our dataset; and (c) It is the first in the literature to uncover spillover effects across both traditional banking and the shadow banking sector, both domestically (within the same economy) and internationally (across borders). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section two provides an overview of the existing literature; Section three outlines our methodological and modeling framework; Section four presents the econometric and quantitative findings of our approach; Section five offers a detailed discussion of the findings; and Section six concludes.  2 Background literature The theoretical contributions on shadow banking enabled a new strand of empirical literature on the banking and shadow banking activities. Klimenko and Bromberg (2016)  used a structural model to investigate the optimal liquidity management. They examined the role of repos as they are a cheap way of funding, but at the same time they hide an exogenous rollover risk. They showed that banks limit the use of repos for financing as it has two types of âshadowâ costs. Bhimjee et al. (2016)  employed a panel regime-switching model to examine the performance of the banking sector before and during the global financial crisis of 2006. Dungey and Gajurel (2015)  identified international contagion in the banking system during the 2007â2009 crisis for 54 economies. Walter (2012)  explained how and why some banks are considered âsystemically important financial institutionsâ (SIFIs) and identifies their economic and strategic drivers. Using a sample of Chinese listed companies from 2007â2017, Yan et al. (2023)  found that firms headquartered in regions with a stronger Confucianism atmosphere can obtain more trade credit than their peers elsewhere, in a shadow banking environment. The study by Si et al. (2022)  examined the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on shadow banking activities of nonfinancial enterprises (NFEs) in China. Analyzing data from 2007 to 2019, the authors found a positive relationship between EPU and NFEs' involvement in shadow banking. A one standard deviation increase in EPU corresponds to a significant standard deviation rise in firms' shadow banking business. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and firms with high external financing dependence are particularly affected. Financing constraints and yield spreads between financial and real investments served as key channels through which EPU influences shadow banking. In another study for one of the biggest economies in the world, Si and Li (2022) , using firm-level data spanning 2003â2019, investigated the relationship between the shadow banking activities of non-financial firms and their risk-taking behavior. The findings revealed a significant positive association between firms' involvement in shadow banking and their risk-taking tendencies. This effect was particularly pronounced in firms facing greater financing constraints and weaker corporate governance, as well as during periods of loose monetary conditions and financial stress. Their study identified increasing commercial credit, declining main business performance, and compromised information disclosure quality as the channels through which shadow banking influences firms' risk-taking behavior. These results highlight the importance of enhancing external supervision and internal governance mechanisms to mitigate firms' short-sighted engagement in shadow banking and the resulting financial risks. The study by Ren and Shao (2022)  investigated the role of non-state shareholder governance in the growth of shadow banking in Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Analyzing data from Chinese A-share listed state-owned manufacturing enterprises (SOMEs) between 2008 and 2018, their study revealed that non-state shareholders contribute to the expansion of shadow banking in SOMEs, leading to higher profits and increased rewards for managers. This involvement is influenced by a larger return gap between financial and productive investments and a tightening monetary policy. Moreover, non-state shareholders support the growth of shadow banking by diverting resources away from operating activities, particularly innovative investments. The paper by Foglia and Angelini (2020)  examined the tail risk spillover among banks, insurance companies, and the shadow banking system in the Eurozone context. These interdependencies within the financial market have contributed to the propagation of instability in the system, emphasizing the need for policymakers to understand and address these connections through supervisory tools and macroprudential policies. Using the Tail-Event driven NETwork (TENET) risk model, their study maped the interconnectedness and systemic risk measures among the three sectors, considering the concepts of "too big to fail" and "too big to interconnected." Their findings revealed significant impacts among the sectors, with banks being the primary source of risk emissions, but also highlighting the systemic importance of shadow banking firms due to their high level of connection. Their research provides valuable insights into risk spillovers and interconnection dynamics during crises. The empirical study by Diallo and Al-Mansour (2017)  examined the relationship between the insurance sector, the size of the shadow system, and financial stability across countries, prompted by the financial crisis and the near collapse of AIG. Utilizing the Z-score as a measure of financial stability and analyzing the ratio of insurance assets to GDP for 26 countries from 1998 to 2011, their findings revealed that (i) the insurance sector is negatively and significantly associated with financial stability, and (ii) when the shadow banking system is considered as a channel, the insurance sector has a detrimental effect on financial stability in countries with high levels of shadow banking assets. Furthermore, Li and Lin (2016)  investigated the bank interest margin when banks perform lending and shadow-banking assigns lending that is subject to regulation. They discovered that an increase in shadow banking loans raises the bank's interest margin, equity risk, and deposit insurance obligation, but reduces the bank's stability. They also discovered that when a bank assigns lending activities through shadow banking, the margin is reduced and equity risk is increased due to capital restrictions. They concluded that by reducing regulatory capital limits, a bank engaged in shadow banking entrusted loans may achieve improved return performance and more safety. In chapter 12 of Academic Press (2016)  the authors considered liability management and deposit insurance as a way to reduce a possible run on banks and they also discussed the relationship of shadow banking with the traditional commercial banking. As they considered deposit insurance as a way to create moral hazard, they showed empirical evidence for the crisis in the 1980Â s to conclude on how moral hazard could lead to systemic risks. It is demonstrated by Duca (2016)  that capital regulation and risk, among others, have changed the relative usage of short-term business debt that is funded by shadow banking since the 1960s. According to the author, over the long-run, the share of bank credit was affected by shifts in the relative regulation of bank and non-bank credit, most notably resulting from the implementation of Basel III regulations over time. Shadow banking grew in share in the short term after deposit interest rate ceilings on traditional banks were implemented, according to the auhtor's findings. As GÃ³rnicka (2016)  recognized, a bank can purchase risky assets either through a regulated bank or through an off-balance special purpose vehicle (SPV). The author found that the decision-making process of bank managers depends on their ability to lower SPV funding costs by guaranteeing the return of the SPVs with bank proceeds. SPV funding may displace bank financing if there are no guarantees, since SPVs are more lucrative in circumstances where the minimum capital requirement is high. Alternatively, when banking managers guarantee SPV returns, bank and SPV intermediation become complementary, since the bank operating for the SPV can make use of recourse even in cases where capital requirements are high. Lu et al. (2015)  investigated shadow banking in China in order to find out whether it threatens the financial system as it is largely unregulated. They discussed issues of shadow banking in China among which the type, size, risk, and reasons that have increased this market. They also examined the reasons for which Chinese SMEs on shadow banking and suggest to policymakers to implement financial reforms in order to control and monitor better this unregulated market. Li et al. (2014) investigated possible financial risks coming from shadow banking institutions in China. They used bank stress tests to examine solvency risk for the systemic financial institutions and found that there is some risk of bankruptcy and liquidity shortages, for which though they cannot run a stress test due to lack of sufficient data. Moshirian (2014)  argued that it is important to collect data to oversee not only banks but also non-banks to avoid global or regional global systemic risk and financial instability. The author explained that as regulation for systemic banks is increasing, more innovative the shadow banking will become. The paper concludes that a banking system should be created where regulations will not strangle innovation. As the paper argues, in reality, there is a tradeoff between the present scheme of fragmented systems and a globally integrated financial system that can be created to reduce global systemic risk. If the present fragmented scheme can be shaped in an integrated financial system the investorsâ confidence will increase and the result will be a more stable and safe environment for investors where financial innovation will increase. The subprime market appeared rapidly in the European Money Market Fund (MMF) industry after 2007 as a result of asset price declines and investor redemptions. In a study of the subprime market, Bengtsson (2013)  examined the developments that occurred after 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, financial instability suffered on a global scale due to MMF difficulties spreading to the banking sector. The author presented an analysis of the primary events that took place in the European MMF industry during the crisis, as well as possible pathways for financial instability to spread between the MMF and the financial system. As noted by the author, financial intermediaries and shadow banking may have a role to play in influencing financial instability. Pozsar et al. (2010)  were among the first to examine the developments in financial intermediation since the mid-1980Â s in detail. Shadow banks have played a significant role in the financial system over the last three decades. The writers addressed the institutional characteristics of shadow banks, as well as their economic importance and relationship to the main banking system. They also employed "shadow banking maps" to depict the shadow banking system's funding flows.  3 Methodology 3.1 The GVAR Framework Pesaran et al. (2004) created the GVAR approach which has been a popular method for modeling global economies and other multidimensional systems, with numerous extensions (e.g. Chudik and Pesaran 2016). GVAR, in particular, assumes NÂ +Â 1 countries or sectors, referred to as entities. For each entity, we create a VARX* model with the section's macroeconomic indicators as endogenous variables and a weighted average of the remaining sections' economic indicators as exogenous variables. The other variables are thought to be weakly exogenous. Additional indications that serve as transition channels can be used. These factors can also be used to supplement exogenous variables. Let X  t   = X  0 t  â²   , X  1 t  â²   , â¦ , X  Nt  â²      â²      be a ( k x 1 )    vector with:k = â i = 0  N   k  i        where X  it    = ( x  i 1 t   , x  i 2 t   , â¦ , x  i k  i   t   )    is a ( k  i   x 1 )    vector, k  i     is the number of macroeconomic indicators we use for modeling the specific section. Following the GVAR modeling scheme, we define for each section a VARX* model as follows:(1) X  it   = h  i 0   + h  i 1   t + Î¦  i 1   X  i , t â 1   + Î  Î¹ 0   X  it  *   + Î  Î¹ 1   X  i , t â 1  *   + e  it       where: X  it  *     is a weighted average such that X  it  *   = W  i  â²    Ì  X  t      where W  i  â²    Ì    is a country specific k x k  *      matrix of weights constructed from other known inter-section linkages, such as foreign trade, capital flows or input-output matrices and k  i  *     the number of the X  it  *     variables; i = 0,1 , â¦ , N    denotes the section and i = 0   is the dominant section, if any; Î¦  i 1     is a k  i   x k  i      matrix and Î  Î¹ 0    , Î  Î¹ 1     are (k  i   x k  i  *     ) matrices for lagged coefficients; Î¦  i 1   = Ï  ijm      j , m = 1 , â¦ k  i       , Î  Î¹ 1   = Î»  ijm      j = 1 , . . 1 , â¦ k  i   , m = 1 , â¦ k  i  *       Î  Î¹ 0   = Î»  ijm      j = 1 , . . 1 , â¦ k  i   , m = 1 , â¦ k  i  *       ; h  i 0     and h  i 1     are k  i   x 1    matrices of the trend term coefficients with t = 1,2 , â¦ , T   i = 0,1,2 , â¦ . , Î   . Note that in this specification, ( Î + 1 )    is the number of sections, and T   is the number of observations. Finally, e  it      is a vector with dimesion ( k  i   x 1 )   and e  ijt   â¼ N ( 0 , Ï  eij  2   )    with: E e  i , t   e  i , t + h   Î    = Î© h = 0   0 h â  0          and det ( Î© ) â  0   . Eq. (1)  is the form of the model with 1 lag for the endogenous variables and 1 lag for the Xâ* variables. For the more general case of any number of lags p and q the form will be(2) X  it   = h  i 0   + h  i 1   t + â k = 1  p   Î¦  ik   X  i , t â k    + â k = 0  q   Î  Î¹ k   X  i , t â k  *    + e  it        where p are the lags for the endogenous variables and q the lags for the augmented variables. This reduces to (1) for (p, q) =â(1, 1). Furthermore, if we consider a dominant section, the model becomes:(3) X  i , t   = h  i 0   + h  i 1   t + â j = 1  p   Î¦  ik    X  i , t â k    + â k = 0  q   Î  Î¹ k   X  i , t â k  *    + â l = 0  s   N  0 t   X  0 , t â l    + e  it        in which we consider iâ=â0 as a dominant section with s number of lags. We can also take into account a greater number of dominant economies. In this work, the transformed Input-Output matrix is used to pick the number of dominant entities, whilst network metrics are used to identify the dominant entity.  3.2 Network theory for identifying the dominant economies Based on the relevant literature, the dynamic interconnections among the various economies can be captured by the eigenvalues of the transformed IO matrix for the EU-12 economies (Tsionas et al. 2016 ). Following Michaelides et al. (2018)  and the works of Mariolis and Tsoulfids (2014)  and Brody (1997) , in this set up, dominant could be considered the entities that exhibit a normalized eigenvalue that exceeds 0.4. Next, we determine which economies act as dominant. (i) Bonacich (1987)  proposed the so-called eigenvector centrality  method, which considers the distance of a node's neighbors when determining its centrality power. This can be calculated using the formula below:(4) EC  i   = Î»  â 1   â j = 1  Î   A  ij   e  j        where: Î»  â 1     is the inverse of the Perron-Frobenious eigenvalue of the adjacent matrix A  ij   = z  ij      , i , j â { 1 , â¦ , N + K }   , and e  j     its respective eigenvector. (ii)  Basically, the value of closeness centrality  reflects the distance between a node and any other node in the network based on the average weighted distance between them. A minimum distance between nodes reflects the (closeness) centrality of node i. According to the following formula, closeness centrality can be calculated as:(5) CL  i   = N â 1  â j = 1  N   d  ij           (iii)  Following (Freeman, 1979 ), we make use of the degree centrality  measure. The centrality of a node (Ying et al., 2014 ) as expressed by its degree centrality degree shows the connection of a node with the rest of the entities in the network. The degree centrality c  i    , is calculated using the equation:c  i   = d i    â j = 1  N   w  ij          (6). where, following Fagiolo et al. (2008) , d ( i )    is the degree of each node and w  ij     are the weight. To conduct the empirical investigation, several standard time series tests should be implemented, such as unit roots tests.   4 Empirical analysis 4.1 Sources Data are in monthly frequency and fully capture the debt crisis in Europe. Our sample consists of the economies of: (a) Italy and Spain that faced adverse macroeconomic conditions during the period of investigation, (b) UK and Germany that have the largest banking systems in the EU; and (c) Netherlands and France that faced the indirect hit of the financial crisis more severely because of their banking system exposure. We use the following variables: (a) Bank Assets, Shadow Bank Assets and Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) in billions of Euros in 2005 prices from ECB; (b) Long term interest rates, Regulatory Bank Index and PSI from ECB; (c) GDP, Net Credit World Credit and Net Trade World Trade in bn of Euros (2005 prices) from OECD. Global net credit and global net trade are the transmission channels according to Eickmeier and Ng (2015) . Furthermore, we included exogenous dummy variables in all VARX models to account for the 2006â2009 credit crunch, including country-specific crises, such as the Spanish crisis, during the period under investigation. In our specification, both PSI and Regulatory Banking Index, are country-specific exogenous variables. Finally, the weights are equal to the transformed Input-Output Leontief weights following Tsionas et al. (2016) , and come from the World Input-Output Organization database, which is freely accessible, online. An overview of the data is presented in  Table 1 , below.  4.2 The network We depict the weighted network of the model in  Fig. 1  below. We can see that the German economy appears to be the most crucial node in the network.  4.3 Dominant entities The Input-Output matrix was employed based on the methodologies described earlier that build on Michaelides et al. (2018)  so as to to confirm the existence of a dominant economy based on the eigenvalues of the weight matrix. As a first step, we investigate whether the dataset contains any dominant economies in  Table 2 . Based on the findings from the study, it is clear that there is only one dominant economic system, where Ï(iâ*â)>â0.4. After analyzing the various metrics of centrality, we use them to select the dominant economy.  Table 3  presents the various metrics of centrality. By applying all the aforementioned measures, it has been determined that the German economy occupies the most central position and can therefore be considered to be dominant. It is important to note that the choice of Germany as a dominant economy is very reasonable, since Germany is the largest economy based on production, and the largest economy based on trade.  4.4 Relevant tests Detailed results of the various tests are presented in what follows. By using the Phillips-Perron test, we first determine whether our time series data contain any unit roots. In  Table 4 , the null hypothesis is rejected, and we have I(0) variables in respect of Bank Assets, Shadow Bank Assets, and Regulatory Index, in our GVAR model. As can be seen in  Table 5 , the remainder of the variables tested were I(1). The next step consists of testing for cointegration using the method described by Johansen and Juselius (1990) , since I(1) variables were present in the model. None of the variables showed cointegration properties, as illustrated in  Table 6 . Following this, we used BIC to determine the lag length ( Table 7 ). To summarize briefly:â i = 1 , . . 5    small open economies, namely i = { FRA , ITA , NTH , SPA , UK }     â k = 1    dominant economies where k = { GER }     â y  j , t   = ( GDP  j , t   , Long Term Interest Rate  j , t   , Shadowbanks Assets  j , t   , Bank Assets  j , t   , NPLs  j , t   }    where j = 1 , â¦ N + K     â g  j , t   = { Credit  t   , Regulatory Index  j , t   , Global Crisis  t   , Regional Crisis  j , t   , PSI  j , t   }    where j = 1 , â¦ N + K       We calculated the GIRFs based on Pesaran and Shin (1998) . As shown in each GIRF, each economy's Bank Assets, Shadow Bank Assets and GDP dynamically respond to changes in the rest of each economy's Bank Assets, Shadow Bank Assets and GDP for the previous sixteen (16) months.  4.5 Study of the GIRFs The GIRFs are generated according to the bootstrapped bands (10,000 iterations) so as to prevent structural instability. In this study, we describe the influence of a unit shock on the German Bank Assets and German Shadow Bank Assets (  Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively) as a result of a unit shock in the Shadow Bank Assets and Banks Assets of the selected economies. In light of the GIRFs, it is evident that a unit shock in the Shadow Bank Assets of either economy in the model can't statistically significantly affect in the short run the German Bank Assets, therefore all deviations are statistically insignificant and disappear within five (5) months. Considering that German banks comprise the backbone of the EU banking system, this result is not surprising. A unit shock in the Bank Assets of Germany, appears to have a positive and statistically significant short-run influence on the shadow bank assets of Germany, but the effect fades away after three (3) months, when the Shadow Bank assets of Germany return back to their original equilibrium state. The next part of this paper focuses on the effects of a unit shock in the Shadow Bank Assets on the German GDP and vice versa (  Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively). Fig. 4  shows that a shock in the GDP of the UK has a negative and statistically significant impact on the Shadow Bank Assets of Germany, which disappears in the short run, when the Shadow Bank Assets of Germany return back to equilibrium. However, based on the findings of Fig. 5 , the German GDP is affected positively and statistically significantly only by a shock in the Shadow Bank assets of Germany. Nevertheless, this effect has a short run character that lasts for less than three (3) months, when the German GDP returns back to equilibrium. Next,  Fig. 6  shows the response of the Bank Assets of the French economy to a shock in the Shadow Bank Assets in the rest of the economies, while  Fig. 7  presents how an unexpected shock in the Bank Assets of the other economies will affect the Shadow Bank Assets of France. We find no statistically significant variation of French bank assets from an unanticipated unit shock in the Shadow Bank Assets of the other economies in our model. The Bank Assets of Germany, the Netherlands, and France, on the other hand, have a statistically significant effect on the Shadow Bank Assets of France. Nonetheless, all effects have a short-run character because they vanish and the Shadow Bank Assets of France return the bank to its initial equilibrium position. We continue by presenting the impact of GDP ( Fig. 8 ) and Shadow Bank Assets ( Fig. 9 ) of the selected economies to the Shadow Bank Assets and GDP of France, respectively. Statistically significant impacts are seen on the Shadow Bank Assets of France, following a unit shock in the GDP of either Spain or the UK. The Shadow Bank Assets of France return to their initial equilibrium position, after a short-run period of time, generally less than three (3) months. However, all shocks to the Shadow Bank Assets do not impact the French GDP. As a next step, we study Italy's Bank Assets ( Fig. 10 ) in response to unit shocks in the shadow banks of the rest of the economies, as well as Italy's Shadow Bank Assets ( Fig. 11 ) in response to unit shocks in the Bank assets of the other economies. Based on our findings, neither the Bank Assets nor the Shadow Bank Assets of Italy are affected by an unexpected shock in the Shadow Bank Assets and Bank Assets of the other economies in the universe of our model. The impact of a unit shock in either the GDPs ( Fig. 12 ) or the Shadow Bank Assets ( Fig. 13 ) of the selected panel of the European economies on the Italian GDP and Shadow Bank Assets, respectively, are presented in the following Figures. Based on the GIRFs, a unit shock in the GDP of Italy has a negative and statistically significant, short run effect on the Shadow Bank Assets of the Italian economy. Nevertheless, no long-lasting effect is present since the Shadow Bank Assets of Italy return back to equilibrium soon. The Italian GDP seems unaffected by all shocks in the Shadow Bank assets of the other economies. Next,  Fig. 14  presents the response of the Bank Assets of the French economy to a shock in the Shadow Bank Assets in the rest of the European economies, while  Fig. 15  presents how an unexpected shock in the Bank Assets of the European economies will affect the Shadow Bank Assets of France. Based on the respective GIRFs, the Bank Assets of Netherlands are unaffected by all shocks in the Shadow Bank Assets of the rest of the economies in our model. On the other hand, the Shadow Bank Assets of Netherlands are positively and statistically significantly affected by a shock in the Bank Assets of France. Nevertheless, this shock has a short-run character since it lasts for less than three (3) months, when the Shadow Banks Assets of Netherlands return back to equilibrium. Next, we illustrate the impact of a shock in the GDPs ( Fig. 16 ) and Shadow Bank Assets ( Fig. 17 ) of the selected economies to the Shadow Bank Assets and GDP of Netherlands, respectively. According to the GIRFs, a shock in UKâs GDP has a negative and statistically significant short-run effect on Netherlandsâ Shadow Bank Assets. The effect fades quickly when Netherlands' Shadow Bank Assets return to their initial equilibrium level. Furthermore, Netherlandsâ GDP is unaffected by shocks in the Shadow bank Assets of the other European economies. Following that, we show the response of Spain's Bank Assets ( Fig. 18 ) to unit shocks in the Shadow Bank Assets of the other economies, as well as the response of Spain's Shadow Bank Assets ( Fig. 19 ) to a unit shock in the bank assets of the other economies. Based on the GIRFs, both the Bank Assets and the Shadow Bank Assets of Spain are unaffected by all the unit shocks examined. The effect of a unit shock in either the GDPs ( Fig. 20 ) or the Shadow Bank Assets ( Fig. 21 ) of the selected panel of European economies on the Spanish GDP and Shadow Bank Assets, respectively, are presented in the following Figures. According to the GIRFs, all shocks in the GDPs of the other European economies have no effect on the Spanish Shadow Bank Assets, however a shock in the UK Shadow Banks has a negative and statistically significant impact on the Spanish GDP. In fact, the Spanish GDP shock appears to be of a short-run nature, since it dissapears in less than three (3) months and the Spanish GDP returns to equilibrium. Next, we focus on the impact of a unit shock in the Shadow Banks Assets and the Bank Assets of the selected panel of EU economies to the UK Banks Assets ( Fig. 22 ) and the UK Shadow Bank Assets, respectively ( Fig. 23 ). A shock in the Shadow Bank Assets of Spain does not seem to have a significant impact on the Shadow Bank Assets of the UK, but appears to have a significant impact on the Bank Assets of the UK. The effects, however, are temporary, short-term in nature since they cease to persist in less than three (3) months after the Bank Assets of the UK return to their initial equilibrium.  Fig. 24  shows the response of the British Shadow Bank Assets to unit shocks in the other European economies' GDPs, while  Fig. 25  shows the response of the British GDP to unit shocks in the other European economies' Shadow Bank Assets. Based on the GIRFs, a shock in the GDPs of Italy and France seems to have a negative and statistically significant short-run effect on the Shadow Bank Assets of the UK, that does not seem to have a long term effect on the final equilibrium position of the Shadow Bank Assets of the UK, since they return back to their initial equilibrium position. On the other hand, the British GDP remains unaffected by shocks in the other European economiesâ Shadow Bank Assets. We also find that all the employed VARX/VECX models are stable, since all the eigenvalues lie within the unit circle, as shown in       Figs. 26 through 31 , below.   5 Discussion Our model finds that the impact of the shadow banks' assets is statistically non-significant for the German banks' assets, in the short-run. This result can be justified by the strong political and economic position of the German economy in the European economic system. Still a shock in the assets of the shadow banking system of Germany has a positive and statistically significant impact on the German GDP. This effect takes place only in the short-run, for less than three (3) months, after which the German GDP returns back to equilibrium. According to Bengtsson (2013) , the German banking regulative framework has opted in for the ECBâs definition of what constitutes an MMF, which differs from other European MMFâs. However, the findings of our research show a negative and statistically significant impact on the German Shadow Banking Assets, as a result of a shock in the GDP of the UK. Such a result is advocated by the fact that the UK financial system was considered as one of the most stable and sustainable systems globally, which is supported by the Bank of England . Consequently, the interactions between these banking systems are related to a significant degree in such a way that oneâs policy decision may significantly affect the others. Regarding the French Banking Assets, we find that no significant evidence exists for deviations with the other economies of the model, regarding unexpected shocks. This result can be justified by the status of the aforementioned economies, which operate under the same banking regulatory framework and apply a common monetary policy under the ECB as members of the euro system. It is also important to mention that shocks in the British GDP have a significant negative effect on Netherlandâs Shadow Bank Assets, whereas shocks in the Shadow Bank Assets of the other European economies of the model have no significant effect on Netherlandâs Banking Assets. In general, any shock to the UK Banking Assets has a statistically significant impact on the Shadow Banking Assets of the other European economies, whereas shocks to the other European economies' Banking Assets have no significant effect on the UK Shadow Banking Assets, while shocks to the UK Banking Assets have a significant impact on the Shadow Banking Assets of the other European economies. Furthermore, we confirmed that two major financial systems dynamically coexist and operate in Europe: i) the European system, which Germany leads, and ii) the British system. According to our findings, shocks in European economies' Banking Assets affect the other Shadow Banking Assets. However shocks in individual European economies' Shadow Banking Assets have no substantial effect on the Banking Assets of the other economies. Last but not least, shocks to the British banking system have a major influence on British Shadow Banking Assets, whereas shocks to European economies' Shadow Banking Assets have no meaningful impact on British GDP. Generally speaking, our findings are in agreement with the remarks of various ECB reports that the level of interconnection between the official and the shadow banking systems, respectively, has increased over the past few years. Because of this fact, a variety of economies find themselves in a state of financial instability. Of course, the presence of strong economies in a monetary system can help to limit the risk of contagion that can occur as a result of this interconnection between these two types of systems: regulated and unregulated. There are several reasons why our findings are important. The first significant benefit derived from this work is that it provides valuable insights into the complex interdependencies between the banking and shadow banking sectors in a few European economies. Based on a network GVAR model, the study demonstrates that shocks to the banking sector of European economies directly impact the shadow banking sector in other European countries. As such, policymakers, regulators, and market participants should understand the dynamics of the financial system. Further, the study identifies two dominant financial systems in Europe, one under the control of Germany and the other under the control of the United Kingdom. Investors and participants in the financial markets who wish to understand the relative importance of different economies and financial systems may find this information useful. Identifying these dominant financial systems provides insight into the sources of systemic risk in the European financial system, thus shedding light on potential sources of systemic risk. Moreover, the findings have important implications for the stability of the financial system. As the study demonstrates, shocks to the banking sector can have significant effects on the shadow banking sector. To ensure financial stability, it is essential to monitor and regulate the banking and shadow banking sectors effectively. In order to reduce the potential for systemic risk and promote financial stability, policy makers and regulators can use this information to formulate effective policy measures.  6 Conclusion and future research The central focus of this paper is a comprehensive examination of the dynamic linkages and interdependencies between two major financial actors categorized into distinct groups. The first group comprises the official banking sector of an economy, while the second group encompasses all activities and firms that operate in a manner often identified as the shadow banking sector within an economy. In this context, recognizing the pivotal role played by dominant entities across these sectors and among the various European economies included in our analysis, we employ a network-theoretic GVAR model that accounts for dominant entities. This approach allows us to capture dynamic interconnections and spillover effects both within and between sectors and economies. Based on our findings, we observe that unforeseen shocks to the banking sector of European economies have direct repercussions on the shadow banking sector in other European countries. Additionally, our study identifies two dominant financial systems in Europe, one centered around Germany and the other around the United Kingdom. These findings underscore the critical importance of effective monitoring and regulation of both the banking and shadow banking sectors to ensure financial stability. The results of this study provide a number of ideas for future research. As a first step, expanding the analysis to include additional countries would provide a better understanding of the interdependencies between the banking and shadow banking sectors in the global financial system. By carrying out this analysis, a more robust assessment of potential sources of systemic risk as well as the relative importance of various economies and financial systems would be possible. Furthermore, future research should examine the impact of regulatory changes on the relationship between the banking and shadow banking sectors. According to the study, regulatory changes, such as the implementation of Basel III, do not explicitly address the impact of such changes on these interdependent relationships. In order to better understand the potential impact of regulatory reforms on the financial system, policymakers and market participants should examine the impact of regulatory changes. Additionally, future research could examine the role played by market sentiment in the relationship between the banking and shadow banking sectors. Policymakers and market participants would benefit from understanding how changes in market sentiment affect the interdependencies between different sectors of the financial system. The relationship between the banking and shadow banking sectors could also be examined in further detail in light of other macroeconomic factors. This study does not explicitly consider the impact of all these factors, but understanding their impact on the interdependencies between different sectors of the financial system is essential to assessing the stability of the system as a whole. Furthermore, research could analyze the impact of different types of shocks on the relationship between the banking sector and the shadow banking sector. Understanding potential sources of systemic risk and designing effective policy measures to mitigate these risks will require an examination of the impact of different types of shocks, such as idiosyncratic shocks as opposed to systemic shocks. Specifically, to advance the understanding of the intersection between European banking, shadow banking, and cross-border collaboration in the context of sustainable development, several areas warrant further investigation. First, exploring the role of cross-border innovation is crucial. Future research could delve into the practices that enhance the resilience of European banking and shadow banking systems in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By analyzing innovative approaches, technologies, and collaborations that promote sustainability, researchers can identify strategies to address financial and environmental risks while driving positive social and environmental outcomes. Second, studying innovations in sustainable financing mechanisms within European banking and shadow banking sectors can provide valuable insights. This research could examine the effectiveness of green financing, impact investing, and other sustainable financial instruments in facilitating SDG-aligned initiatives. By evaluating the impact of these mechanisms on environmental sustainability and social development, researchers could offer recommendations for optimizing sustainable financing practices. Third, investigating the transformative potential of technology and digital innovation in European banking and shadow banking is essential. Research in this area can explore how technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms could be harnessed to promote transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in financial systems. By assessing the impact of these innovations on achieving SDGs, researchers could identify opportunities to leverage technology for positive societal and environmental change. Additionally, understanding the influence of regulatory frameworks on the intersection of innovation, banking, and sustainable development is crucial. Research could evaluate the impact of existing regulations and policies on fostering sustainable innovation within the financial sector. By identifying regulatory barriers and proposing recommendations for creating an enabling environment for sustainable finance and innovation, researchers can contribute to the development of effective and supportive frameworks. Finally, assessing the social and environmental impacts of European banking and shadow banking activities is vital for sustainable development. Research in this area could examine the positive and negative externalities associated with these financial systems, considering their implications for the SDGs. By exploring ways to enhance positive impacts and mitigate negative ones, researchers could provide valuable insights into promoting sustainable practices within the sector. These areas of further research could offer opportunities to deepen the understanding of the intersection between European banking, shadow banking, and cross-border collaboration in the context of sustainable development. By addressing these research gaps, scholars could contribute to the development of strategies and policies that align financial systems with sustainable development goals.
