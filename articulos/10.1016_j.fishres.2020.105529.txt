                  The importance of the oceans is highlighted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through SDG 14, that aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable use. Regional Fisheries Organizations (RFOs) play a key role in managing fisheries on the high seas and therefore are vital for supporting the successful implementation of SDG 14. SDG 14 is intrinsically linked with SDG 13 (the need to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). As biophysical impacts arise from human-induced climate change affect oceans, and fisheries therein, it is important that RFOs take account of such impacts on the management of fisheries. This paper examines the engagement of RFOs with SDG 14 and climate change through an analysis of interviews with 36 RFO stakeholders. The results show that even though there is consensus concerning the importance of climate change and SDG 14, most of the RFOs are not directly engaging with these two SDGs. However, it was stated that the work done by RFOs, to end overfishing, positively contributes to the realization of climate change and SDG 14, although the actions taken by RFOs need to increase in scale and speed if they are to fulfil their responsibility to effectively manage human impacts on ocean resources. Furthermore, member countries play a key role in supporting or resisting progress. This paper contributes to a gap in the literature concerning current perceptions of stakeholders of the issues RFOs are facing concerning the SDG 14 and climate change.

Keywords Fisheries management  High seas  Stakeholder perception  Sustainability    1 Introduction The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established in 2015, provide social, economic, and ecological value-based goals directed at achieving global sustainable development. The SDGs are separated into 17 goals, supported by 169 targets. The SDGs are, however, non-binding (Biermann et al., 2017 ), but apply to all United Nations members, both developed and developing economies (Sachs, 2012 ). Of the 17 goals, three are targeted towards ecological issues; SDG 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts), SDG 14 (conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development) and SDG 15 (life on land). SDG 14 is particularly important due to the importance of the oceans for the realizations of other SDGs (Singh et al., 2017 ). SDG 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development and the fishing industry can play an important role in achieving this goal (Brooker et al., 2016 ; Haas et al., 2019 ). The time frame for achieving the SDGs is between 2020–2030. However, global progress towards the SDGs is currently too slow to be on track to achieve the SDGs by 2030 (United Nations, 2018 ). Thus, more urgent and significant actions are necessary (United Nations, 2018 ). Climate change is likely to further impact meeting the SDGs (Singh et al., 2019 ) and the need to take action to combat climate change and its impacts have been emphasised in SDG 13. The impact of climate change on the marine ecosystem and the availability of resources will have major effects on human society (Allison and Bassett, 2015 ; Weatherdon et al., 2016 ), and because the ocean is linked to many other goals, the achievement of several SDGs will be challenged. Due to the important role of the oceans in the global climate system and human adaptive capacity, it is imperative to mitigate and adapt to climate change (Galland et al., 2012 ). Climate change is likely to have many negative impacts on marine fisheries but also, potentially, some positive impacts. (Lam et al., 2016 ). For example, marine species are already range shifting due to temperature increases (Cheung et al., 2010 ; FAO, 2016 ; Pecl et al., 2017 ). The unpredictable impact of climate change, for example in relation to extreme events, may complicate already existing challenges (e.g. overfishing or habitat degradation) facing fisheries managers (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010 ; Sumaila et al., 2011 ). Overall, climate change is likely to have extensive consequences on fisheries and will impact the livelihoods and security of millions of people. Implementing actions concerning climate change is necessary to achieve other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (poverty reduction) and SDG 2 (zero hunger) (Lawrence-Samuel et al., 2017 ). Climate change will especially impact developing countries, which are not the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions (Sumaila et al., 2019 ). The targets of SDG 13 are directed at both climate change mitigation and adaptation. SDG 13 also recognizes the importance of the global community in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement (i.e., to limit climate change to less than 2 °C above pre-industrial levels), which was established after the SDGs and thus, contains details regarding nationally determined commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions would benefit fishing countries since it would decrease further impacts of climate change on fish stocks (Sumaila et al., 2019 ). To effectively address climate change, fisheries management has to become more adaptive and resilient by increasing the capacity to learn and to experiment (Ojea et al., 2017 ). This would allow RFOs to consider uncertainties and vulnerabilities of climate change in their fisheries management frameworks (Pentz and Klenk, 2017 ). The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the ability of selected Regional Fisheries Organizations’ (RFOs) to address SDG 14 and SDG 13 (henceforth addressed as ‘climate change’) and to a lesser extent the agreement for biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). The SDGs are an important international initiative and achieving them would be an enormous global achievement. Climate change is one of the largest human threats to the marine ecosystem and thus needs attention at many different levels. RFOs are key organizations for fisheries management at the high seas – areas beyond national jurisdiction – and these organizations play an important, although often overlooked role in supporting the implementation and reporting of SDGs 14 (UNDESA et al., 2014 ). There are 13 RFOs which have the mandate to enforce legally binding measures on their members and manage high seas areas (Table 1  ; Fig. 1  ). This paper, therefore, determines and analyses the perceptions of RFO stakeholders including scientists, government officials, industry, environmental non-government organizations and employees of secretariat, which are linked to four case study RFOs, namely the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (SPRFMO), and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). These four organizations were chosen due to the geographic location of the secretariats, which are in Australia, New Zealand or surrounding countries, which is close to the location of the researchers. Even though it can be argued that four RFOs are not presenting a complete picture of all existing RFOs, they cover many views relevant to other similar organizations since all RFOs follow a similar design and are based on the United Nations Law of the Sea and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (United Nations, 1982 , 1995 ). Furthermore, the participants also shared their knowledge concerning other RFOs, which enhanced the results of this analysis. Stakeholders are “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of an organization’s objectives” (Freeman, 1984 , p.46) and play an important role in RFOs (Beddington et al., 2007 ). Industry and companies regularly participate in the meetings of these organizations (Petersson et al., 2019 ). The perception of these stakeholders thus provides valuable insights into the work of the RFOs.  2 Methods To assess the perception of different stakeholders, 34 semi-structured interviews were conducted with scientists, government officials, industry, environmental non-government organizations and employees of the relevant RFO secretariats (University of Tasmania approval, Ethics Reference Number H0017184). The participants were selected due to their knowledge regarding RFOs, especially CCAMLR, WCPFC, CCSBT, and SPRFMO, rather than due to their knowledge concerning the SDGs. Most of the participants were familiar with SDG 14 and the issue of climate change but were less aware of the other SDGs. We interviewed 36 stakeholders, resulting in 34 interviews because three stakeholders chose to be interviewed together. This was done over a timeframe of six months in 2018–2019. During the interviews, we asked 15 semi-structured questions (see Online Supplementary Table A1), which were tested beforehand in two pilot interviews held with colleagues. The questions targeted interviewee knowledge and views on SDG 14, climate change and the future of the RFOs. The questions also addressed the BBNJ agreement, an agreement that is currently being negotiated under the UNCLOS. The negotiation of the BBNJ agreement is yet to be concluded but it potentially will impact on RFOs regarding climate change and SDG 14, or components relevant therein. The interviews were between 15 min–45 min long, depending on the participant's engagement with the topic and available time. With the approval of the participants, the interviews were audio-recorded. The interviews were transcribed, coded (see Fig. 2   and Online Supplementary Table A2) and analysed using the qualitative data analysis software QSR NVivo® (QSR international, version 11). The codes were re-assessed after each round of analysis, to assure consistency and with the research question concerning the engagement of RFOs with the SDGs and climate change. The final codes were analysed, divided and summarised under higher-level categories (Online Supplementary A2), which are more abstract than the codes (Corbin and Strauss, 1998 ). These categories helped to better understand the data and to identify connection points. After grouping the codes into categories and sub-categories, the categories were organised into six themes to obtain an overview of the potential topics playing an important role in RFOs day-to-day work and concerning their engagement with SDG 14 and climate change. Fig. 2  presents the themes and categories and their frequency, which is still seen as a qualitative marker to indicate approximate size, as they are subjective and not absolute counts, which helps a high-level understanding of the data. There is a wide range among the frequency of the themes, which is due to the number of codes which are covered by these themes, but also due to the way participants talked about a certain topic. For example, the theme ‘decision-making’ received a very low number of responses as participants mentioned this issue without necessarily elaborating upon it. This theme was, however, highlighted as very important with regard to RFOs potential to engage with certain topics.  3 Results The six themes identified issues which impact the linkages between the RFOs and SDG 14, climate change, and also the proposed BBNJ agreement. The theme with the highest number of references (441, Fig. 2 ) was external drivers . This theme summarized the opinion of the stakeholders concerning the SDG 14 and climate change (category ‘perception of the impact of external factors’), which formed the basis of the interviews and thus was mentioned in all of them (100 %, Fig. 2 ). This theme gives insights into how the participants have perceived these two issues in the context of RFOs but also addresses the potential impact of other international agreements on these organizations. The second theme need for progress and change  highlighted the need for the organizations to change and to perform better. Generally, fisheries management occurs in a dynamic environment. However, most of the RFOs adapt only slowly to new circumstances. For example, the CCSBT has adopted a management procedure, which is “a pre-agreed set of rules that can specify changes to the total allowable catch based on updated data” and which takes environmental fluctuations into account (CCSBT, 2020 ). This theme highlighted that the people working in these organizations or collaborating with them, are aware of their flaws and problems, but do not feel capable to change them. Some of these flaws and problems are explicitly addressed in the remaining four themes. For example, the themes impact of values  and convention & mandate  show how the institutional setup and the member composition restrict the ability of the RFOs to make more impactful changes. The themes pressurised workload  and decision making  are highlighting aspects which were frequently mentioned during the interviews, for example, participants stated that these organizations are already dealing with a lot of work and do not have the time to address SDG 14 and climate change. The decision-making models applied in RFOs also make it difficult to address issues which might not be of high priority for the members, which links back to the importance of the members in these organizations. While these themes and categories might not be the only aspects, they stood out for stakeholders as most important. How often each of the different categories of the six themes were mentioned is shown in Fig. 2 . The following sections provide a description of each theme and the associated categories. 3.1 External drivers External drivers  had the highest number of references (441, Fig. 2 ), with two categories linked to it, ‘perception of the impact of external factors’ and ‘impact of agreements’. The first category addressed the stakeholder’s perception concerning the link among the RFOs and SDG 14, climate change and the BBNJ agreement, in more details and was mentioned in each interview (Fig. 2 ). All participants (36) stated that there is no consideration, involvement or action concerning SDG 14 (codes ‘no consideration’, ‘no action’, and ‘no involvement’). However, interviewees also indicated that these organizations are already doing work related to the SDG 14 (if for other reasons) and participants explained that the targets of SDG 14, such as sustainable management and fisheries, are part of the basic work of these organizations (Participant 13, code ‘already do that’). Contrary to these findings, many participants thought that SDG 14 has the potential to positively influence RFOs (code ‘potential to influence’) and RFOs could play an important role in achieving SDG 14, even though this opinion was not shared by everyone (i.e., codes ‘will not influence’, ‘nothing will change’ or ‘no acknowledgement of SDGs’). Concerning the negative perception of the ability of RFOs to address SDG 14, an interesting code was ‘negative impact’, saying that for example the general discourse of food security due to SDG 2, zero hunger, might be used to justify higher catch quotas (Participant 12). Contrary to the SDG 14, climate change receives more attention during the RFO member meetings, and it was stated that some members are getting increasingly concerned about the possible impacts of climate change on the marine ecosystems (code ‘concerned about impact’). Although climate change is seen as important (category ‘high importance’), no specific actions have happened so far (code ‘no action’) and it is often described as one problem among many (Participant 27). It was also mentioned that RFOs do not see climate change as an immediate problem (code ‘not an immediate issue’) and RFOs are probably waiting until something concrete is happening (code ‘wait and see approach’), as described by one of the participants:“everyone is startled by the information that comes forward, but no one is really thinking about how they might go about addressing that decline, it is more, they more want to take it from the perspective let’s wait and see ”   Generally, members of these organizations acknowledge the impact of climate change (code ‘acknowledgement of impact’) and participants highlighted the need to respond to climate change (code ‘need to respond to CC’). One reason why actions for climate change are still missing might be the uncertainties linked to the impact of climate change on fisheries (code ‘unknowns’), for example, species movements or the potential impact of acidification. These uncertainties make it hard to agree on certain measures and to start addressing the problem. Climate change was generally described as a difficult issue (code ‘difficult issue’), which is impacted by the political will of members, and the availability of resources and time. The second category, ‘impact of agreements’, describes the potential of international governance initiatives such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, United Nations Fish Stocks Agreements, United Nations General Assembly resolutions, several agreements from the Food and Agriculture Organizations, the SDGs in generally and eventually the BBNJ agreement to impact members of these RFOs. Even when an organization does not mention these agreements in their founding convention, or do not officially refer to them during meetings, most of the members have signed those agreements (code ‘Members signed agreements’) and for example, most of the member countries have agreed to the SDGs and have them on their national agendas. In the long term, this has the potential to influence the policy of these countries and the way they approach fisheries management (code ‘influence members’).  3.2 Need for progress and change The category ‘need for improvement’, one of three categories listed under this theme, describes areas and issues that need to change according to interviewees. It was generally acknowledged that RFOs need to perform better, especially in the way they manage their fisheries (28). This aspect was also frequently criticised in the scientific literature (see for example Cullis-Suzuki and Pauly, 2010 ). In the context of climate change, it was stated that RFOs can and need to do more. Climate change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed by RFOs and their individual member countries but also by other organizations. Participant 35 summarized that climate change is an issue which requires long term actions.“So, these are all issues which everyone, it is pretty much status quo management at the moment, and no one is really thinking more than a few years ahead. But in the longer term, there need to be more sort of consideration, more engagement and probably more focused research in that area too.”    To reduce the potential impacts of climate change on the fish stocks, a good management system is needed (code ‘need good management’). For example, a management framework, management procedures or harvest control rules are needed to make management more stable. It was emphasised that stocks need to be rebuilt to make them more resilient to biophysical changes driven by climate change. RFOs need to start acting on the precautionary and ecosystem approach, which means for example that members need to act on much less evidence for an impact than they would usually do, especially in the context of climate change (code ‘need precautionary and ecosystem approach’). Besides the need to improve their management approaches, there is also an increasing need for more cooperation (category ‘need for cooperation’), especially with other RFOs to deal with issues such as species redistribution due to climate change (code ‘more cooperation with other RFOs’), which is likely to have consequences for existing rules and boundaries. Moreover, there is a rising need to cooperate with other institutions. Topics such as labour safety are getting more attention among the members of RFOs and thus it is relevant to start working with the International Labour Organization (code ‘more cooperation with different institutions’). Other institutions and frameworks such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Migratory Species might become important for RFOs as well, to tackle problems related to shark and seabird bycatch. The last category, ‘further issues impacting RFOs’, combines several problems which were raised by participants during the interviews. For example, participants mentioned the relationship between these organizations and the UN (code ‘Relationship to the UN’), which was described as ‘tense’ by one participant. While CCAMLR does see itself as separate from the UN system and thus does not officially deal with UN-related initiatives such as the SDGs, four participants stated that there is a lack of trust between the UN and the other RFOs. This is important as it may be linked to the low consideration of SDG 14 and climate change in these organizations. The 17 SDGs cover many different issues, which makes it hard to break them down to regional requirements.“It’s just, they  (SDGs) are very ambitious and when it comes to implementing that at a regional level, there are obvious challenges, the challenges of institutions, the human factor, it is just people speak different languages .”   Further issues which were listed under this category were, for example, the impact on non-target species, the issues of accountability and the lack of economic aspects.  3.3 Impact of values The theme impact of values  is made up of three categories, ‘membership’, ‘developing countries’ and ‘politics’, and in general emphasises the key role of the member countries in RFOs. The category ‘membership’ deals with different aspects of membership, such as the differences among members, or the influence of members on RFOs. For example, CCSBT has a much smaller number of members (8) compared to the WCPFC which has a higher number of members (26), with a high proportion of small island developing states (14). Another important influence in these organizations are the key players, such as the European Union in SPRFMO or Australia and Japan in CCSBT. All those different constellations make each organization unique. This is further enhanced by the different interests of those member countries and the reasons they engage with the RFO (code ‘different reasons and interests’). The members bring different cultural values and economic interests to the table, which make it difficult to agree on a common view. The member countries are the key players in RFOs and thus have a great influence on the way these organizations are dealing with SDG 14 or climate change (category ‘the influence of members on RFOs’). Depending on the interest and economic value of the specific fishery these members adapt their behaviour (code ‘behaviour of member states). Some members are more led by their economic interests while other members apply a more conservative approach during the discussion of, for example, new conservation measures or the total allowable catch. Those interests play an important role regarding what members put forward during the commission meetings and which topics get addressed or not (code ‘members putting things forward’). This was especially highlighted by participant 30 who emphasized the role of members in RFOs.“So, if there is a sense that RFOs could and should be doing more in either relating to the SDG goals or climate change, the way to do that would be in encouraging members to build that into how they are thinking about the RFOs and build that in the priorities they take into the RFOs.”    An important part of membership is the role of developing countries (category ‘developing countries’). Fish is an important resource for livelihoods and economic aspirations for developing countries, small island developing countries and least developed countries. However, due to the lack of money, knowledge, and technology, these countries struggle to participate in RFOs and in some cases it is difficult for them to implement the basic principles of fisheries management (code ‘issues of developing countries’). During the interviews, some participants pointed out that SDG 14 is more important for developing countries than for developed countries, due to the higher dependence on fish for food, economy, and livelihood (code ‘more important for developing countries’). Several participants stated that SDG 14 is, therefore, more important for the WCPFC than for other organizations (code ‘more important for WCPFC’) since the WCPFC has the highest participation of small island developing states among all RFOs. The Pacific islands played a significant role in developing SDG 14 (Quirk and Quentin, 2015 ), and they may also need to take a leadership role in increasing the awareness of SDG 14 in RFOs. The last category under the theme impact of values  was ‘politics’. An important aspect in analysing RFOs are the underlying national and industrial agendas which direct how member countries behave. Many participants emphasised the political impact in those organizations (e.g., code ‘lack of political will’ or code ‘internal impact’) and the importance to understand the political background of those members. The political nature of RFOs can either stagnate processes or drive change. However, those political influences are not only coming from their interests in fisheries but also from unrelated geopolitical events, such as elections or the relationship between countries, which impact decisions in RFOs (code ‘external impact’).  3.4 Convention/ mandate Another theme was convention & mandate , which comprises four categories. The convention of an RFO plays an important role and can profoundly influence the RFOs framework (‘importance of convention’). The convention determines the RFOs mandate which influences the ability to tackle certain issues, such as the establishment of MPAs for example (categories ‘influence of the mandate’ and ‘example of mandate’). Mandate considerations and discussions are often used by members to influence the outcome of certain discussions. The mandate also influences the way RFOs deal with new emerging areas such as SDG 14 or climate change. Many participants stated for example, that the influence of SDG 14 on the RFOs depends on the mandate of those organizations (codes ‘SDGs – discussions concerning mandate’ and ‘SDGs – influence depends on mandate’). Depending on their mandate, which is determined by the convention, the members of the RFOs feel more or less able to address SDG 14 or climate change. Overall, RFOs are a product of relationships, time and the circumstances of their foundation (codes ‘RFOs products of relationships and time’ and ‘Different reasons to found an RFO’). Therefore, the age of a convention is related to the ability of RFOs to tackle new emerging issues such as the precautionary approach (code ‘age’). While older RFOs such as the CCSBT have quite loosely worded issues around bycatch species, newer RFOs such as SPRFMO clearly state their mandate concerning ecosystem consideration and protection in their convention.  3.5 Pressurised workload Another theme, which emerged during the interviews was pressurised workload . This theme is made up of three categories, ‘availability of resources’, ‘high workload’, and ‘lack of time’ and summarize three barriers RFOs have regarding their ability to deal with SDG 14 and climate change. For example, it was mentioned that these organizations have insufficient resources to address SDG 14 or climate change (code ‘lack of resources’). Some of the RFOs have only a small secretariat and many developing countries as members, which influences the availability of money. Participants stated that the value of the fishery plays an important role in RFOs (code ‘economic value’) and also influence the availability of money (code ‘Differences among organizations’). For an effective management system, more resources need to be available (code ‘more resources needed’). The two other categories ‘high workload’ and ‘lack of time’ describe two constraints, which make it hard for RFOs to deal with new things. The people who are working for the country’s delegation already have a high workload and do not have the capacity to tackle other issues outside their day-to-day work. In addition, RFOs meet only a few weeks a year and there are already many topics on the agenda which need attention. Summarized, participants stated that RFOs do not have enough time and capacity to address SDG 14 and climate change.  3.6 Decision-making The last theme was decision-making,  and it is made up of two categories, namely, ‘issues of decision-making’ and ‘decision-making and members’. Issues around decision-making, especially problems linked to the decision-making models were mentioned by half of the participants. Participants agreed that the consensus-based model makes it hard to get members to agree on certain topics (code ‘difficult to get members to agree on things’) and one participant also mentioned that even if a majority model is in place, these organizations still work towards a consensus.“And international agreements tend to always, even if they have capacity to vote, so they have majority, they still tend to want to have consensus. And that is very much a case globally with any form of international agreement, they are always looking for consensus.”    Due to the previously mentioned aspects such as the role of members and political influences, underpinned by different values and interests, the way RFOs make decisions by consensus negatively influences their ability to address SDG 14 and climate change.  3.7 The future The last few interview questions dealt with future outlooks, and participants were asked how they see the future of RFOs. Overall, there were positive perceptions concerning the future of RFOs among the participants (category ‘Perception of RFOs’) and it was highlighted that RFOs are a “positive example internationally of shared governance of shared resources ” (Participant 30). Participants shared the opinion that RFOs are important frameworks for fisheries management at the high seas (code ‘important framework’). It was noted, for example, that despite all the critiques concerning RFOs, there are currently no better models to manage fisheries at the high seas (code ‘no better model’).“RFMOs are just a multilateral construct and you can say they are good, you can say they are bad, but there really is no other recipe but some sort of multilateral construct .”   Overall, these organizations are slowly evolving, enhancing their management strategies and learning from each other (code ‘learning from each other’), thus improving their performance and are still the best mechanism available for managing the high seas.   4 Discussion RFOs are key organizations to support the achievement of SDG 14. However, little has been done to understand their position or to support them. Moreover, the achievement of SDG 14 will be negatively influenced by climate change, which has not received much attention from RFOs so far. The aim of this paper was to increase our understanding of RFOs perceptions of their ability to address external factors by highlighting barriers to RFOs engaging with SDG 14 and climate change. 36 stakeholders were interviewed and overall 6 themes were identified as shaping and influencing RFOs’ ability to engage with SDG 14 and climate change. These themes cover topics that are related to the RFO’s framework, such as the convention and their mandate, but also to administrative and logistical aspects. It is important to acknowledge that all these themes are related to each other, even though they have been described separately. Although participants emphasised that each RFO is unique, due to their geographical area, the managed species and fisheries, and their framework, these themes are likely to apply to all RFO organizations. Generally, participants shared the opinion that SDG 14 and climate change are important topics which should be considered in RFOs (theme external drivers ). RFOs have been influenced by international agreements throughout the time, for example by the FAO Code of Conduct for responsible fisheries or the agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas. However, the impact of these agreements also depends on the age of these RFOs, which agreements existed at that time, and the way the convention was set up. The convention text guides RFOs and thus impacts their ability to deal with certain issues (theme convention & mandate ). One of the categories was ‘factors which influence convention’, which deals for example with the age of the convention and it was noted that depending on the age of the RFO, as previously mentioned, different aspects are included in the convention text. While older conventions do not mention the precautionary and ecosystem approach, these aspects are clearly stated in newer RFOs such as SPRFMO. Generally, it is acknowledged that newer RFOs react better to newer governance approaches, such as ecosystem approaches (Cullis-Suzuki and Pauly, 2010 ) and there is a general need to update the conventions of the RFOs to adjust to current international ocean governance and to new emerging issues (Rochette et al., 2015b ). Even though two RFOs, the General Fisheries Commission of the Mediterranean and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, have adopted a new convention that included a broader environment focus (GFCM, 2019 ; IATTC, 2018 ), it is time-consuming and difficult to adopt a new convention. Therefore, it is important that the members and other stakeholders acknowledge and consider the influence of the convention text and adapt their treaty interpretation to current and future problems. The way how RFOs take decisions and operate needs to change and the members need to think more widely about issues rather than being constrained to restrictive interpretations of the conventions. Another theme that summarized barriers RFOs are facing was pressurised workload . Even though the three categories listed under this theme were not mentioned as much as other categories (30.4 % on average), they highlight an important topic that has not received much attention in the peer-reviewed literature. The categories ‘lack of time’ and ‘high workload’ summarized the restrictions to address new problems at the yearly meetings of the committee and the scientific commission. This problem is complicated since more and longer meetings also require more resources, which leads to the last category ‘availability of resources’ and also impacts RFOs capacity to address new issues or support SDG 14 and climate change. McCluney et al. (2019)  found that the economic revenue member states gain from their catch is influenced by the end market, for example, tuna sold at local markets has a lower value than a tuna that was sold at the international market, and this, in the end, influences inter alia  the availability of resources in RFOs. Also, the number of developed, industrialized fishing nations impacts the funding of RFOs, since, for example, the European Union can afford to provide more resources than a developing country (McCluney et al., 2019 ). The lack of resources, for example for the RFO’s secretariats, is one of many challenges these organizations have to face and it is important to have a sustainable funding mechanism in place (Rochette et al., 2015b ). The availability of resources and the capacity to drive change is highly influenced by the member countries since they are the key actors in RFOs. Each RFO consists of a different member composition, who all have different objectives to meet through participating in these organizations. As highlighted by one participant, if there is the perception that RFOs need to do more, it is important to acknowledge that the member countries need to do more. Countries can introduce new topics in the meetings and set topics which are important for them on the agenda. This leads to the conclusion that the countries do not currently see SDG 14 and climate change as topics that need to be addressed in these fora. Achieving SDG 14 relies on the actions taken by existing institutions, but as shown in the context of RFOs here, most of the members of such institutions do not acknowledge their role and only focus on their agenda and the reasons why the institute was established (Underdal and Kim, 2017 ). Achieving SDG 14 will not only benefit the marine ecosystem but also the people who are dependent on these resources. Developing countries are often more dependent on marine resources than developed countries, thus more impacted by overfishing. Small islands in the Indian and the Pacific Ocean are especially reliant on fish as a source of food and nutrients and economic revenue (Golden et al., 2016 ; Tidd et al., 2018 ). Moreover, developing countries often do not have enough capacity to implement measures adopted by RFOs (Pons et al., 2018 ), and organizations with higher participation of small island developing states, such as in the WCPFC, are already challenged to manage fisheries in an equitable and sustainable way (Weng et al., 2015 ). A critical view of the performance of RFOs concerning fisheries management is prevalent in the scientific literature, see, for example, (Cullis-Suzuki and Pauly, 2010 ). The need for progress is linked with the need for more cooperation among RFOs (category ‘need for cooperation’). RFOs cooperate with each other for example via Memorandums of Understanding (Rochette et al., 2015a ), such as the renewed Memorandum of Understanding between the CCAMLR and SPRFMO. The need for cooperation includes also different stakeholders, which play an important role in sustainable fisheries management (Beddington et al., 2007 ; Bundy et al., 2017 ; Jentoft and McCay, 1995 ; Pomeroy et al., 2001 ). Generally, industry and companies are well presented in RFOs, while civil society organizations are not (Petersson et al., 2019 ). In the future, more engagement of civil society may be one way to drive forward broader social issues. Generally, RFOs need to become more progressive in the way they manage fisheries and engage with other institutions and organizations. All these factors not only impact the way RFOs are dealing with SDG 14 and climate change but also how they are dealing with the BBNJ agreements. The current negotiations for the BBNJ agreement are a great chance for RFOs to contribute to this new agreement and to present their view. Especially since the outcomes of the agreement are very likely to affect RFOs through the implementation of tools such as area-based management (Barnes, 2016 ).  5 Conclusion The aim of this paper was to increase our understanding regarding the ability of RFOs to address new emerging issues, such as SDG 14 and climate change (i.e., SDG 13) through an important, rare and timely qualitative analysis of stakeholder views. We analysed the perceptions of 36 stakeholders regarding factors which hinder engagement with SDG 14 and climate change. Six themes were identified, describing several factors which influence RFOs and their engagement. Participants mentioned the importance of the member composition, for example, the number of developing countries, but also areas such as time pressure and the lack of resources. Even though most of the participants thought that SDG 14 and climate change are important, not a lot of work was considered to be directly done for either of those topics. Concerning SDG 14, most of the participants held the view that the work of RFOs already contributes to SDG 14 and that there is no need to officially address it. Contrary to SDG 14, climate change was discussed in several fora. However, no direct responses have happened so far. The results of this study will help to address areas which hinder RFOs to effectively engage with SDG 14 and climate change. However, these findings also showed the key role of the RFOs’ member countries in engaging with SDG 14 and climate change. Even though most of the participants agreed that the work of RFOs already contributes to SDG 14, it is important for them to officially acknowledge SDG 14 to better align their work towards the specific targets of SDG 14. The member countries must be willing to engage with these topics and to provide adequate resources to do so. These member countries also have to acknowledge that there is an increasing need for fundamental changes in how RFOs make decisions. Summarized, there are several factors which hinder the RFOs to effectively engage with SDG 14 and climate change and addressing these issues will help RFOs to better manage their fisheries in an uncertain environment.
