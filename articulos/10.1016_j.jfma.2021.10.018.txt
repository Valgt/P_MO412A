                  The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations Agenda 2030 plan of action to achieve peace, prosperity, and well-being for all by 2030. SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well–being for all at all ages. However, oral health is not specifically mentioned and targeted in SDG 3. Numerous studies have demonstrated a connection between oral health and general health. Oral disease and the common non-communicable diseases have the co-existing modifying risk factors. In addition, oral health is associated with social, economic, cultural, and environmental problems. By the implementation of oral health care, oral health promotion, and universal health coverage, these could not only be good for oral health but also benefit for general health and well-being. Taken together, oral health is the first step to SDG 3.

Keywords Oral health  Sustainable development goal 3  Good health and well-being    Introduction The 17 United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a universal political 2030 agenda adopted in September 2015, and became effective in January 2016. The contents call for a collective action to achieve peace, prosperity, and well-being for all including (1) No poverty, (2) Zero hunger, (3) Good health and well-being, (4) Quality education, (5) Gender equality, (6) Clean water and sanitation, (7) Affordable and clean energy, (8) Decent work and economic growth, (9) Industry, innovation and infrastructure (10) Reduced inequality (11) Sustainable cities and communities (12) Responsible consumption and production (13) Climate action (14) Life below water (15) Life on land (16) Peace and justice strong institutions, and (17) Partnerships to achieve the goal.1   Given their interconnected nature, SDG 3 is health-related aimed to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all by setting national agendas and policies to improve public health. It aims to improve global healthcare through targets ranging from reducing poverty and non-communicable diseases to achieving universal health coverage.1   However, SDG 3 dose not focus on a specific disease, healthcare system, or financial assessment. It also does not provide a comprehensive goal-oriented strategy to prevent, diagnose, and even treat any disease. As defined by Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI) World Dental Federation, oral health is multi-faceted and includes the ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow and convey a range of emotions through facial expressions with confidence and without pain, discomfort and disease of the craniofacial complex.2   Oral health means the health of the mouth. No matter what your age, oral health is vital to general health and well-being. However, oral health is not specifically mentioned and targeted in development agenda for SDG 3. There is a Chinese saying that goes “The illness comes from the mouth”. Oral health is essential for the general health and well-being. Therefore, the authors proposed that oral health is the first step to SDG 3 as illustrated in Fig. 1  . In this article, the connection of oral health and systemic conditions, the similar risk factors existing in oral diseases and the common non-communicable diseases, and oral health impacted by social determinants were discussed as follows. Oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis are prevalent worldwide.3   However, oral health care still remains a low priority in many countries without adequate financial investment to offer prevention and treatment. The global burden of untreated dental caries for primary and permanent dentition has remained relatively unchanged over the past 30 years.3   With good masticatory function, it is easy to chew food and dietary intake for maintaining life quality and well-being. Numerous studies have supported the evidences that periodontal inflammation really affects the systemic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, metabolic syndromes, psoriatic diseases, digestive system diseases, and neuropsychiatric disorders.4   The life-threating oral cancer located in lip and oral cavity is found to be among the top 15 most common cancers worldwide.5   The prevalence of oral potentially malignant disorders and their malignant transformation rate are also significantly increased during the past 18 years.6   The aforementioned findings raise the alert of the hazard of oral health and pose a major public health challenge in the world. Taken together, oral health plays an important role in general health as a goalkeeper. Improving oral health may have good systemic implications and may facilitate individual life quality. Primary prevention of oral disease is the best approach but is often difficult to achieve. Traditionally, dental professionals make great efforts in correct diagnoses and precision treatments. However, oral diseases have been reported as the fourth highest cause of financial burden from diseases.7   It is estimated that the direct treatment of oral diseases costs worldwide up to US$298 billion yearly, corresponding to an average of 4.6% of global health expenditure.7   Oral diseases are the most prevalent non-communicable diseases worldwide and are estimated with consuming one-fifth of health expenditure.3   Fortunately, most oral diseases are preventable and treatable. Early detection of oral diseases is essential and easy to approach. Most of oral diseases can be improved by health-promoting behaviors, like oral hygiene instruction or oral health literacy. In addition, oral diseases and the four leading non-communicable diseases, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes share the same risk factors such as cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and sugar consumption. Modifying these co-existing conditions can be efficiently to prevent both oral diseases and potential life-threatening systemic conditions. These well-known risk factors can be effectively retarded by preventive strategies and policy taken. In addition, dentist may be aware of patient's systemic conditions before a physician. The collaboration between physicians and dentists is important for patient's general health. Regular dental checkup not only prevents oral diseases but also helps patients who are exposed to high risk factors for more serious systemic conditions. The social determinants can really impact oral health.8   Oral diseases are more common among poorer and marginalized population. It is very important to reduce oral health inequities. Strengthening oral health for universal health coverage is quite important for decision maker to deliver the essential health care. Indeed, the essential health care system should include oral care service. Oral health examination is integrated into a regular part of the conventional physical examination. Sugar free, fluoridation, oral hygiene instruction, and dental prophylaxis seem the cost-effective approaches to deliver oral care services to all. Nowadays, health care system is severely hit by current COVID-19 pandemic. Oral health disparities are deepening and impacted by broad social, political, and economic status. There is a need for greater financial investment by the countries to improve health care system and promote healthy lifestyles. In addition, adopting a patient-centered oral care that addresses the impact of social, economic, body, and mind is essential to promote oral health and general health.9   There is a great need for development of the healthcare workforce in terms of quality education and training around the world. Under the narrative medicine competency, primary care workers can pay more effort to eliminate oral health inequities in the most vulnerable groups. On SDG 3, Taiwan government run an insurer with a single-payer insurance system established in 1995 with the goal of ensuring health coverage for the entire population.10   The awareness of oral health in Taiwan, the health insurance system offers topical fluoridation for children under 6 years old, pit & fissure sealant for first permeant molars, dental prophylaxis twice a year to people above 12 years old, and oral mucosal screening for high risk population. Taiwan has set the good example for providing universal national health insurance including oral care. As the model of the world, some strategies or policies in oral health promotion, prevention, and surveillance still need to strengthen such as low-carbohydrate diets, abstain from betel nut, and the establishment of local oral epidemiology data. In conclusion, oral health is not only traditionally tooth-oriented oral epidemiology. Systemic conditions are really impacted by oral health. The interactions among oral health, general health, and well-being cannot be neglected and ignored. It is important to increase global health awareness within dentistry and related oral sciences for oral health care, oral health promotion, and universal health coverage. Having good oral health is not only good for teeth, but also good for the general health and well-being of whole body. Taken together, oral health is essential to good health and well-being as the first step to SDG 3.
