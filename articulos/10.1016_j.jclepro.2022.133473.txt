                  Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are important actors in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. As agents of knowledge, HEIs maintain a critical role in contributing to a socially fair, economically viable, and environmentally protected world. This study aimed to understand how SDGs and the 2030 Agenda are being incorporated into HEIs around the world. We conducted a systematic review of the literature and analyzed experiences developed by the HEIs across different fields of activity (teaching, research, outreach, and management) related to the SDGs. Forty-five articles with empirical cases were selected from the Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases, and the International Conference on Sustainable Development (ICSD) website. Focusing on scientific production analysis, we examined the evolution of the number of publications, the countries of origin of publications, the most cited journals and articles, as well as other characteristics related to the experience of implementing SDGs reported by the institution. In addition to these analyses, a set of initiatives developed by the HEIs was systematized that can be understood as good practices for implementing the SDGs. We provide a discussion of the main barriers that hinder the integration of HEIs with sustainable development guidelines. These elements were structured in such a way to best understand the impact on the various organizational levels in universities. The results indicate the need to align strategic planning with all hierarchical levels of an institution in order to best inform higher management's decision-making.

Leal Filho et al. (2019)  Research with 167 researchers linked to universities in 17 countries The research aimed to characterize the current situation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and its integration with sustainability teaching in universities Most respondents have some knowledge about the SDGs and agree on their integration into higher education institutions beyond institutional commitment or teaching. However, the main issue is the concrete and practical integration of the SDGs, since the research results showed much lower levels of application  Teaching for a better world. Sustainability and Sustainable Development Goals in the construction of a change-maker university Zamora-Polo and Sánchez-Martín (2019)  University of Extremadura in Spain The objective of this work is to deepen the contribution of higher education institutions to the promotion of sustainability in the context of the SDGs This work is part of a broader project that seeks to promote the SDGs in a transversal way to the university curriculum.

A realistic approach to the reception of this UN program amongst the youth population Zamora-Polo et al. (2019)  4 universities in Spain The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge that university students have about the SDGs The results obtained show that university students generally claim to be unwell of the sustainable development goals and that the information they receive in various media, including university education, social media, social networks, is significantly scarce  Planning and implementing sustainability in higher education institutions: an overview of the difficulties and potentials Leal Filho et al. (2018)  5 universities located in South Africa, Nigeria, the United States, Brazil, and Germany This article explores the challenges for planning sustainable development in higher education, also highlighting potential lessons learned that can help improve education efforts for sustainable development in higher education institutions Universities working on the implementation of sustainable development face many problems, ranging from limited resources to lack of trained staff. As a result, integrated approaches to sustainability become difficult to implement     Table 6 Approaches used in the studies.

Handling Editor: Dr. Govindan Kannan Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are important actors in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 . As agents of knowledge, HEIs maintain a critical role in contributing to a socially fair, economically viable, and environmentally protected world. This study aimed to understand how SDGs and the 2030 Agenda are being incorporated into HEIs around the world. We conducted a  systematic review of the literature and analyzed  experiences developed by the HEIs across  different fields of activity (teaching, research, outreach, and management) related to the SDGs. Forty-five articles with empirical cases were selected from the Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases , and the International Conference on Sustainable Development (ICSD) website. Focusing on scientific production analysis, we examined  the evolution of the number of publications, the countries of origin of publications, the most cited journals and articles, as well as other characteristics related to the experience of implementing SDGs reported by the institution. In addition to these analyses, a set of initiatives developed by the HEIs was systematized that can be understood as good practices for implementing the SDGs. We provide  a discussion of the main barriers that hinder the integration of HEIs with sustainable development guidelines. These elements were structured in such a way to best understand the impact on the various organizational levels in universities. The results indicate the need to align strategic planning with all hierarchical levels of an institution in order to best inform higher  management's decision-making.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Sustainable development goals  SDGs  2030 agenda  Higher education institutions  Universities  Systematic review   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction Sustainable development is a constantly evolving topic, able to provoke changes in society behavior and institutions concerned with balancing social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. This theme has advanced significantly since the 1980s and, in 2015, gained great notoriety when the 2030 Agenda and sustainable development goals (SDGs) were launched. Adopted by government leaders from 193 countries at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development establishes a new global framework to redirect humanity towards  a sustainable path, contemplating a set of 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators proposing an action plan for people, prosperity and the promotion of peace, through the establishment of partnerships between various sectors and countries. Among the agents responsible for implementing this Agenda, it is observed that UN guides that several actors are protagonists of this process, being notorious for the role played by governments, companies, academia, and civil society in the scope of SDGs. There is a prominent role of the higher education ecosystem for all engaged stakeholders. Several studies (Torres, 2021 ; Leal Filho et al., 2019 ) emphasizes the importance of this sector for Sustainable Development Goals. For sustainable development, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are strategic through the dimensions of education, research, outreach and management (Bhowmik et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, HEIs are responsible for citizens being aware of their responsible role and provide skills and competencies for future professionals to respond to challenges of sustainable development (García-Feijoo et al., 2020 ). Jorgensen (2019)  states that universities are moving forward to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Initiatives are being developed in institutions around the world to reach the SDGs (Leal Filho et al., 2021 ). A guide prepared by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Australia/Pacific and The Australian Campuses Towards Sustainability (ACTS), “Getting started with the SDGs in Universities” argues that “it is likely that none of the SDGs can be fulfilled without the involvement of this sector” (SDSN, 2017 , p. 3). These perceptions indicate that the functions and experiences of educational institutions can be configured as important allies for social, economic, and environmental transformation. However, such institutions need to be encouraged to align their actions with the SDGs. McCowan (2016)  emphasizes that the role of universities to achieve the SDGs is something relatively new. This fact reinforces the importance of mapping research that identifies how these institutions are involved in the theme. The literature on SDGs in universities includes three studies with different types of systematization. García-Feijoo et al. (2020)  proposed a systematic review on implementation of the SDGs focused exclusively on business schools. Romero et al. (2020) , in turn, conducted a systematic review of the literature on SDGs and engineering schools. Murillo-Vargas et al. (2020)  proposed a bibliometric analysis of 871 articles, in the period from 1998 to 2019, questioning the integration of the SDGs in universities, with a quantitative approach. Based on these aspects, this article has several contributions through the following pillars: (1) identify the main journals and universities that stand out in publications on the Sustainable Development Goals, considering the annual evolution of these publications; (2) recognize the main countries discussing SDG internationally and level of case studies (world, regional and local); (3) emphasize how previous studies were designed, classifying approaches used in the studies and theirs data collection instruments; (4) establish how institutions should incorporate the SDGs in various dimensions of their activities, including management, teaching, research and outreach; (5) systematize roadways to implement the SDGs in HEIs evaluating initiatives and barriers. With this review, universities and academic communities can use this research as a guideline to manage the engagement with sustainable development. In addition, the present study is justified when it contributes to understanding how some studies are addressing the theme of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda. In this perspective, the systematic review observed the literature connected with the discussion on sustainable development associated with an agenda of cleaner production methods, observing the protagonism of HEIs. Cleaner production had been a discussion and a theme introduced in the universities by many reasons: (1) the HEIs are pulsars on knowledge about sustainable development; (2) absence of qualified professionals on the market in this theme; (3) adequacy for cleaner technologies in companies and industries; and, (4) demands to promote economic and social development of a country to a cleaner production approach strengthening more environmental awareness. Giannetti et al. (2020)  showed new and smart technologies, new ways to help policy development and organize supply chains, sectors and individual companies to meet the demands of the current economic context. To address this initial discussion, a useful framework with the development of global initiatives was recently published by authors Leal Filho et al. (2021)  demanding academic discussions aligned with the theme of the SDGs and scientific community. With further studies later, Sonetti et al. (2021)  discuss conceptualization of sustainability among students, administrative and teaching staff of a university community. Sánchez-Carracedo et al. (2021)  focus on the direct discussion which skills will be obtained from the engineering course to the SDGs. With this contextualization, this article contributes to filling the research gap with further discussions on the following aspects: (1) how the barriers occur inside of HEIs and which factors internal and external that can affect the implementation process and (2) how to discuss this topic in strategic planning of HEIs. The novelty of this research is the construction findings on barriers in six dimensions from the macro and micro perspectives clusters. After this, this research details the main factors that impact universities through a framework of analysis on the actions impacting society. The structure of this article is based in six sections—including this introduction (Section 1 ) —that propose general questions of the theme and the importance of mapping studies focusing on how SDGs are being applied to Higher Education Institutions. Section 2  presents the method to define the database, search criteria and eligibility of articles for this systematic review. These steps described in this section allow other researchers to replicate the study, conferring reliability to the results obtained. Section 3  discusses the results of the study, systematizing in subsections the quantitative and qualitative analyses that could be performed from the reading of the selected studies. Section 4  indicates notes on the possibilities and challenges of implementing the SDGs in the HEIs, bringing an overview on evidenced experiences studied in different countries. Section 5  presents barriers to SDG implementation according to the following dimensions: human resources; financing; government; organizational; social; and communication. Finally, Section 6 , the conclusion, emphasizes how selected articles allow to generate a contribution on the importance of the HEIs to adhere and disseminate the 2030 Agenda to the academic community. Also in this last Section are also shared good practices that have already been adopted by academic institutions.  2 Materials and methods The choice of systematic review, as proposed by Felizardo et al. (2017) , identified the knowledge of the area, following a study protocol that started from a research question, following the sequential steps of selecting the articles, data extraction, understanding their methodological nature, synthesizing the main results, writing, and publication of the analyses. In this process, a well-defined selection criterion is important, allowing other researchers to reproduce the study. Regarding the systematic review, Roever (2017)  considers that this translates into a more rational and less biased method of organizing, evaluating, and integrating scientific evidence, being a valuable mechanism to provide knowledge. It is also pointed out that a systematic review follows a specific protocol, seeking to provide logic to a large documentary corpus (Galvão and Ricarte, 2020 ). From adopting this method, this research structured and systematized the existing literature on the SDGs in the HEI—enabling the systematic review on this topic to add value to the studied theme and gather experiences of implementing the SDGs in several HEIs. Through this process, relevant articles on the subject were identified, applying explicit and systematized methods of search, evaluation, and validation of the studies that are available in the selected databases, including Science Direct, Scopus, and the Web of Science, in addition to the proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Development (ICSD), the main global event in the area. Regarding the methodological protocol, other systematic reviews were considered, providing guidelines to choose the PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses): a script aimed to improve the quality of systematic reviews through a checklist that considers several verification items (Moher et al., 2016 ). This methodology uses a combination of keywords as an initial step. Then, specific criteria are applied for identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion of studies. From these procedures, a mapping of experiences of higher education institutions was conducted regarding the implementation of the SDGs in different dimensions of management, teaching, research, and outreach. Therefore, empirical studies were selected that presented some case studies—a case study is characterized by broad research on a specific subject, allowing a deepening of knowledge about it and, thus, offers subsidies for further investigations on the same theme (Yin, 2015 ). The articles were selected in May 2021 from Science Direct, Scopus, web of science (WOS), and the site da International Conference on Sustainable Development (ICSD). The choice of these research platforms is justified because they are referred to in databases of multidisciplinary scientific literature, having wide acceptance by researchers, and contemplating high-impact articles in the most diverse areas (Franco et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the ICSD Conference is the most renowned event in the area, bringing together publications on the SDGs since 2017. 2.1 Research question The fundamental question for selection and analysis of studies was elaborated considering other studies presenting a clear structure to facilitate literature evaluation. For this was adopted the PICO strategy: a methodology proposed by Santos et al. (2007) , a guide that assists to construct research questions of various themes and which is commonly used in systematic reviews. The acronym is related to P (patient, problem, or population), I (intervention), C (comparison, control, or comparator), and O (outcomes) (García-Feijoo et al., 2020 ). Based on these parameters, the research question asked was: How are Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda (problem-outcome) being incorporated (intervention) into Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the world (population)? The objective, based on this question, was to verify which actions were being explicitly accomplished in HEIs to contribute to the implementation of the SDGs in general. Thus, it began to investigate experiences that the HEI are developing in different fields of activity (teaching, research, outreach, and management), evidencing the priority role that the university acquires in achieving the objectives and implementation of 2030 Agenda in the management itself, professors training, or in university students awareness promotion of actions on this matter.  2.2 Research strategies For the definition of the keywords inserted in the search platforms, consultations were made with specialists, also adopting readings of previous research and a pilot test. A search string was defined that identified works contemplating the terms “Higher Education” or “Universit*“, as well as “Sustainable Development Goals” or “2030 Agenda” or “SDGs” in their titles, abstracts, and keywords. This research returned a total of 888 papers. For the elaboration of this string, the protocol indicated by Felizardo et al. (2017) , was used; the use of truncation symbols with Boolean operators being combined as follows: (“Higher Education” OR University*) AND (“Sustainable Development Goals” OR “2030 Agenda” OR SDGs). A multiple-step deletion process, which will be described below, resulted in 45 documents included in this systematic review. The results of this study provide information on the role of HEIs to disseminate and incorporate the SDGs, highlighting case studies of implementation of these guidelines to management, teaching, research and outreach activities. Furthermore, from these studies, it was possible to identify actions to increase the sustainable awareness in the academic community. The diagram presented in Fig. 1   illustrates the searching and selecting articles process, following the phases suggested by the PRISMA protocol and frequently adopted in this kind of study. 2.2.1 Literature inclusion and exclusion criteria This step involved locating the preliminary articles in research databases. Having previously presented the bases used, as well as the defined search terms, the process returned a total of 888 papers classified as open access, 469 from the Scopus database, 382 from the Web of Science, 21 from Science Direct, and 16 from the ICSD proceedings. From the previously selected articles, a screening process was necessary—applying filtering that brings greater feasibility to the research. Initially, papers published prior to 2015 were withdrawn. Since this year, when the 2030 Agenda was launched, 11 papers were excluded, and 877 articles included in the next phase. After this first filtering, duplicated studies were removed from comparison of the bases, resulting in 298 articles excluded that were repeated, thus leaving 579 papers to be analyzed in this research. Another filtering process was necessary: in the language analysis, 12 papers not based in English, Portuguese, or Spanish were excluded, because possible difficulties on full reading and analysis. After applying these screening filters, a total of 567 papers were selected to read the titles, abstracts, and keywords, initiating the eligibility phase. Eligibility implies excluding papers that, after reading the titles and abstracts, do not fit the research theme. Were elected only articles adherent to the central objective of this systematic review to proceed to the next stage. This process resulted in the exclusion of 498 articles that, although presenting the search terms, did not address a specific case of implementation of the SDGs in the context of higher education. These works were excluded because presented the following situations: (i) the word HEIs or related terms were mistakenly included, during abstract reading it was identified that the work did not address the theme under study; (ii) the work it is not referred to SDGs in general, considering only one of the specific SDGs, referring, for example, to health, poverty, immigration, gender issues, etc.; (iii) the work focused on another area, not allowing to generate a general contribution on the theme of SDGs in the HEI; or, finally, (iv) the study consisted of a secondary study (systematic review or bibliometric study), so that it did not fit the parameters of the research, which requires for analysis only primary studies. The last step adopted in this study was inclusion and started from the 69 papers full reading. During this phase, adjustments were made to solve errors and inconsistencies in the database. For example: homogenizing the spelling of keywords. A full reading of articles was performed, and a careful investigation was necessary to build the summary of variables contemplated in the research. From this point, some new studies were excluded from the final analysis, because they were not aligned with the study's inclusion criteria. In this case, it was identified that 13 articles should be excluded from the research core because they are only theoretical studies and do not report specific experiences of HEIs with the SDGs. Furthermore, 11 other articles were excluded after reading to identify that the work did not focus on an experience of the SDGs, but rather addressed a sustainable development action in a general context, so that it would not be possible to perform the analyses proposed in this research. After these new exclusions, a total of 45 articles attended the inclusion criteria in several stages and were considered for data extraction and analysis. These selected studies were independently performed by two researchers to increase the reliability and safety of the process. From this final quantity of selected papers, it is noteworthy that 36 articles (80%) come from the Scopus database, four articles (9%) from the Web of Science (WOS) database, and five articles (11%) were extracted from the annals of the ICSD conference. It is noteworthy that no science direct article was included because when performing the analysis of repeated studies between the databases, a significant amount of Scopus' papers was repeated in the bases of WOS and Science Direct. Therefore, it was decided to keep a single record from this article associated with the Scopus database.    3 Results To present the results of the studies, was developed an analytical framework seeking to systematize relevant information from the 45 studies included in this systematic review and distributed the analyses in three main sections: (i) Analysis of scientific production; (ii) Analysis of keywords, network of authors and citations; and (iii) Methodological aspects of research. To generate such analyses, were examined the articles independently, aiming to identify the main ideas, and proceeded to read with the marking of the relevant parts of the texts, allowing to contribute dynamically to the elaboration of the research findings. 3.1 Scientific production analysis This subsection presents general information from the 45 studies analyzed and, in a systematic review, characterizing scientific production is useful to identify how the theme has been addressed from a temporal and geographical perspective. Considering the temporal evolution (Fig. 2  ), higher education institutions had a greater number of publications in 2020 when it reached a total of 17 published articles. This evolution in the number of publications has only recently increased, with a jump from 2018 to 2019 of more than 100% of publications. It is observed that in the years 2015 and 2016, no case study that addresses SDGs experience in the HEI, in general, was identified. In 2017, 4 articles were identified that related to the theme, and this number expanded to 6 articles in 2018, reaching 13 articles in 2019 and 17 articles in 2020. In a more specific analysis, it is observed that a greater number of experiences began being reported more recently, due to the popularization of the theme, especially considering the publication of guides and documents that emphasize the need for universities to adhere and implement the SDGs (SDSN Austrália/Pacific, 2017 ). Until May 2021 (the month of this systematic review), just 5 articles were published, being subject for databases under analysis. Regarding the publication of these studies, 78% of the articles were identified as published in journals and 22% of the articles are from conferences. In the analysis of the 35 articles published in journals, it is verified that two journals represent 57% of all journal scans, with the sustainability journal, which has a list of 15 articles published in this theme, followed by the International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education with 5 articles. Table 1   presents the studies published in these journals. Observing the countries that have been dedicated to producing research on the Sustainable Development Goals in Higher Education Institutions theme—from the perspective of the SDGs, in general, in the institution—it was identified which countries are leading such studies. Thus, the territorial area where the study was developed was identified, showing the continent where the research was conducted, in which country and the level of coverage of the study (global, national, or local). According to the studies by continent, it is observed that the vast majority of the studies were conducted in Europe, comprising a total of 21 studies (47%) included in this systematic review. Asia occupies the second position, having participated with 5 works (11%), followed by South America in the third position with 4 articles (9%). Africa, North America, and Oceania are tied, and each of these continents participated in 2 studies (4%). Central America and Eurasia participated in only 1 study (2%). In a total of 7 articles (16%), it was not possible to establish a single continent of experience, considering that it was a study involving countries from different continents. Specifically analyzing the countries where the case studies were developed, the location indicated in the 36 studies that presented a specific country of the study. From the analyses, it is verified that Spain participated with a total of 9 papers, which corresponds to 20% of all articles included in the systematic review. Brazil occupies the second position with 4 studies (9%), being the only country in South America in which case studies were identified that address the implementation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in higher education institutions (HEIs). The other countries included in the research participated in 2 or 1 studies. Fig. 3   shows the distribution of countries for case studies on the SDGs in higher education institutions. This result demonstrates how the theme has been developing in various educational institutions around the world, highlighting the main countries that are publishing actions to implement the SDGs in higher education institutions. With this information, the results indicate that this discussion is still very embryonic in the global aspect. These results disclose that Spain has presented itself as one of the greatest exponents and precursors of this theme. One of the reasons for this is the interest for social investigations and more recently the applications to promote sustainable development. Expanding the analysis to understand the scope of the case studies, it was verified that 22 studies (49%) emphasized some experience at the local level, that is, addressed some case for a specific institution; a total of 14 studies (31%) brought a national perspective so that the case studies described experiences of more than one educational institution in the same country; and nine papers (20%) brought initiatives from different countries (Table 2  ). Among the studies that presented experiences at the global level, studies were developed that conducted primary data collection, considering research with professors and specialists around the world (Pacher et al., 2020 ; Perović and Kosor, 2020 ) as well as research with university networks (Kioupi and Voulvoulis, 2020 ; Ruiz-Mallén and Heras, 2020 ; Leal Filho et al., 2018 ). These studies, in general, sought to characterize the situation of the SDGs and their integration with teaching in universities, allowing to raise potential lessons learned that can help in expanding the efforts of education for sustainable development. Through questionnaires, documents, and reports, the research concludes that there are varying levels of incorporation of the SDGs in the HEI, having a strong relationship with the context and institutional support that these institutions receive. Furthermore, they point out that the integration of the SDGs in the curriculum of universities constitutes the great lever of incorporation of these guidelines in the daily life of professionals who are being trained, and it is necessary that this integration is beyond the institutional dimension and advances to the practical dimensions (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, the work with the global scope that was based on secondary data (De La Poza et al. (2021 ; Chowdhury and Koya, 2017 ; Freidenfelds et al., 2018 ; Perović and Kosor, 2020 ) sought to develop comparisons of indicators between several institutions, characterizing how they have been evolving in the incorporation of the SDGs. The work of De La Poza et al. (2021 , p. 23) proposed an assessment of the alignment of the SDGs based on the overall ranking score developed by the Times High Education (THE), that there is “growing interest of the HEIs in reporting their achievements on SDGs”. In the 22 local studies that addressed experiences of a single educational institution, the majority of 18 institutions (86%) are of the public type, while only 3 institutions (14%) are private (Table 3  ). The universities that were considered, and the respective studies developed in these institutions, were important repositories of consultation for future research that signals that most of the reported experiences have occurred in public HEIs. With the results of Table 3 , the list of research developed in a specific university was identified, but few works that were developed at a global level are not included in this systematization, for example: the work developed by Chowdhury and Koya (2017) ; Freidenfelds et al. (2018) , Leal Filho et al. (2018) , Leal Filho et al. (2019) , Perović and Kosor (2020) , Pacher et al. (2020) , De La Poza et al. (2021) ; Kioupi and Voulvoulis (2020) ; Ruiz-Mallén and Heras (2020) . As shown in Table 2 , the different experiences that took place in different institutions in different countries in nine studies are confirmed.  3.2 Analysis of keywords, network of authors and citations After having performed the general characterization of the studies included in this systematic review, this topic analyzed such articles from information extracted from the research bases, identifying the co-occurrence of keywords, the co-citation network of authors, and the works that are most cited in this theme. VOSviewer software was used to perform the analysis of keywords and network of authors, which is a data mining tool widely used in systematic review studies and allows visualizations of how a particular area of research has been developing. Considering that the Scopus database provided the largest number of studies included in this systematic review research (80%), it was decided to perform the analysis of keywords and network of authors with the 36 articles that were derived from the Scopus database. Starting with an analysis of the keywords that appeared most frequently, it was identified that a total of 113 profanity were mentioned in the studies, and after treatment and homogenization of terms, 98 words were considered for analysis. The VOSviewer software grouped these terms into 4 clusters, showing that the words “Sustainable Development Goals”, “Higher Education”, and “Sustainability” stand out with, respectively, 29, 16, and 7 occurrences (Fig. 4  ). From this network of keywords, the connection between the terms and the studies was perceived, demonstrating a number of studies that express information about the role of higher education institutions in the implementation of the SDGs in various ways, whether focusing on the dimension of the institution itself (red cluster), the dimension of the curriculum base and learning based on the SDGs (blue cluster), the dimension of engagement and teaching in the SDGs in the HEIs (green cluster), and, finally, the dimension of sustainability practices on campuses (yellow cluster). Another relevant analysis is the one that allows understanding the network of authorship and co-citations, which is a useful type of analysis for the identification of groups of authors who exchange information on the same. Fig. 5   presents the map for analysis of the co-citations, and the references are represented by rectangles that, the larger the rectangles, the more often cited the work. For the proposed analysis, the criterion adopted was to identify all authors who were co-cited at least 5 times, generating 53 references grouped into 5 clusters. In addition to the information presented above, it was verified how the studies included in this systematic review behaved regarding the number of references made by other researchers to these studies. In this sense, from the information disclosed in their respective databases, the number of citations of these studies was identified, and Table 4   shows information from the studies that were cited by other researchers at least 10 times. The studies extracted from the ICSD conference were not included in this analysis, because this database did not provide information on the number of citations of the work. It is observed that Journal of Cleaner Production is one of the publications contributing more in terms of connections about Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and higher education institutions (HEIs). This can be seen as in the publication done by Leal Filho et al. (2019) , Sánchez-Carracedo et al. (2021) , Sonetti et al. (2021)  and Giannetti et al. (2020)  with different perspectives and in-depth levels of discussions. This paper is totally aligned with the thematic of sustainable development. The list that emphasizes this research and others can be seen in Table 4 . Cleaner Production it is also covering the topic about sustainable development in HEIs (Giannetti et al., 2020 ). From this information, it is evident that the works produced by the authors Leal Filho et al. (2018 ; 2019) ; Zamora-Polo and Sanchez-Martín (2019)  and Zamora-Polo et al. (2019)  have the highest number of citations, constituting as guide works of the discussion of the implementation of the SDGs in higher education institutions. Table 5   details some important information about these works, highlighting their objectives and main conclusions. As it turns out, the works produced by Leal Filho et al. (201) stand out for having a global approach, serving as references to several countries in the guidelines for incorporating the SDGs. On the other hand, the studies by Zamora-Polo were produced from Spain, a country that also emerges with the largest number of studies developed on the subject.  3.3 Methodological aspects of research Addressing the methodological aspects of the analyzed articles, studies based on the research approach used (quantitative or qualitative), the data collection instrument (documents and reports, questionnaires, interviews), and the target audience of the research (students, professors, managers, academic community) were classified. This information is pertinent because it allows us to understand the methodological nature of the procedures that were used to obtain the results of each case study listed in this systematic review. 3.3.1 Approach Firstly, the research was grouped according to its quantitative or qualitative approach. This definition is expressed in most analyzed studies, the authors revealing the objectives to be fulfilled through data collection, whether primary or secondary data. In this sense, a total of 22 studies (49%) were identified that are classified as qualitative information that not only seeks to measure a theme, but describe it, using impressions, opinions, and views. Another 19 studies (42%) are classified as quantitative, which use numerical data to understand, among others, the preferences and behaviors of certain individuals or groups. In 4 articles (9%), the authors identified that the study used a quantitative and qualitative approach. Table 6   presents the articles grouped according to the respective methodological approach used. To exemplify these approaches, the work of Zamora-Polo and Sánchez-Martín (2019)  is an example of a qualitative case study; the study of Leal Filho et al. (2018)  represents the quantitative approach; Aleixo et al. (2020)  is an example of a study that used the qualitative and quantitative approach. These studies have great relevance, considering that they are the most cited, as presented in Tables 4 and 5  In the case of one study (Zamora-Polo and Sánchez-Martín, 2019 ), that used the qualitative approach, the objective was to deepen the contribution of higher education institutions to promote sustainability in the context of the SDGs, the importance of including the SDGs in the university's mission and promote a series of actions for implementation in their daily lives. The study used a hermeneutic methodology to understand reality through reading and analyzing other texts, analyzing the concept of sustainability within the SDGs, and allowing to develop critical reflections on various dimensions, considering that for teaching SDGs in the university context, it is necessary to integrate students, competencies, professors, teaching methodologies, and alliances with other actors, to promote the integration of the 2030 Agenda guidelines. As a general contribution, the authors reinforce that:“The work incorporates a conceptual framework that will allow future researchers and professors to develop and implement activities aimed at promoting the SDGs in the university. In the future, the structure should be evaluated in terms of practical implementation in the classroom” (Zamora-Polo and Sánchez-Martín, 2019 , p. 11).   In the quantitative approach, Leal Filho et al. (2018)  point out that universities are engaged in the search to incorporate the SDGs, which is an incomparable opportunity in terms of both teaching and research. However, the authors stress that “few universities have realized this, and many are falling behind” (Leal Filho et al., 2018 , p. 285). In order to explore the advantages of introducing the SDGs, the study presents data describing the degree of priority of the theme in the learning process, based on a survey with institutions around the world conducted through a questionnaire developed to collect data on the SDGs and the teaching of sustainability in universities. The questionnaire was answered by 167 university representatives from 17 countries, spread across five continents, and provides an important vision for these institutions to align their curricula and research to the SDGs, develop new content and transformative learning methods, and involve more actively the student community to commit to acting in support of the SDGs. The author also points out that:Universities as a whole and university staff should try to take more advantage of the many opportunities that the SDGs offer, not only with regard to teaching and research, but especially with regard to their outreach activities (the so-called “3rd mission”) and act as public defenders in support of the SDGs. Universities should be ahead of the package, not behind it (Filho et al., 2018, p. 294).   As an example of a study that used the quantitative and qualitative approach, the research of Aleixo et al. (2020)  was identified, developed with 33 Portuguese public higher education institutions aimed at examining the vertical integration of the SDGs into 2556 undergraduate and master's courses, determining whether they promote at least one of the SDGs. Content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze information obtained through the websites of the institutions participating in the research, classifying them into different categories that represent the integration to the SDGs through a classification system elaborated by the authors for this purpose. The study presents several variables of analysis and concludes that the integration of SDGs in the HEI varies considerably, and in Portugal, it was observed that 198 courses directly and explicitly address at least one SDS, and most of these courses in the areas of social sciences and humanities and natural and environmental sciences. The authors point out that “the small number of courses that directly and explicitly address the SDGs may be because the Portuguese HEIs have not yet had time to respond to the publication of the SDGs launched by the United Nations in 2015” (Aleixo et al., 2020 , p. 348).  3.3.2 Data collection tools and target audience In terms of the instruments used for data collection, it is noteworthy that several tools were described, such as 25 studies that used documents and reports (56%), 10 papers that used questionnaires (22%), 2 papers that chose the interviews (4%), and, finally, 1 study used the workshop technique (2%) to collect data from their target audience (Fig. 6  ). There were also 7 studies (18%) in which it was not expressed which instrument was used to collect the research data. Regarding the target audience of the research considered in the studies under analysis, it was identified that 19 articles (42%) delimited some actors who were considered for the development of work, being possible to identify students (16%), the academic community in general (13%), professors (4%), and other managers/researchers of these institutions (9%) (Fig. 7  ). In 26 studies (58%), no specific public was identified that has been delimited to carry out the research. Considering that the studies involving questionnaires and interviews are most near to a target audience, the 12 studies that used such methods were chosen to perform a more in-depth analysis, highlighting how the interaction took place through questionnaires and interviews. Specifically, considering the 10 studies (22%) that used the questionnaire as a method of data collection, a depth in the description of the results is emphasized, since these studies are based on data collection to support certain behaviors. In the studies included in this systematic review, it was verified that the questionnaires were applied to a set of actors, including 4 articles with students (40%), 3 articles with the academic community in general (30%), and 3 articles developed with managers and researchers of the HEI (30%). Considering the 4 studies that applied questionnaires with students, it is noteworthy that the research of Zamora-Polo et al. (2019)  sought to estimate the level of knowledge of the students regarding the SDGs, identifying the importance attributed to this theme by this audience. The authors developed a case study in Spain that was part of a project to promote and teach the SDGs throughout the university curriculum, and a survey of primary data was carried out through the application of a questionnaire with students who were attending the 3rd and 4th year of graduation. As pointed out in the study, the authors reinforce that, from what is known, this was the first questionnaire prepared for this purpose. Another study based on the application of a student questionnaire was the study developed at the University of Giresum by Çimşir and Uzunboylu (2019) . The research considered the application of a questionnaire with 72 students, aiming to develop, implement, and evaluate a mobile application to raise awareness among university students about the sustainable development goals. The results of this study pointed out that there is great potential in the use of educational technologies and training techniques to increase awareness about the SDGs in educational institutions. The paper by Ibáñez et al. (2020)  was based on a descriptive and quantitative methodology that allowed the collection of data from students enrolled in 5 universities in Seville on the environment and environmental education for better sustainable development in achieving the SDGs. A non-probabilistic sample resulted in 1471 respondents to a questionnaire with 40 questions that addressed various knowledge related to this theme. The authors point out that the students’ opinion underlies the need for course programs to include an alignment with the SDGs to raise awareness of the importance of education for sustainable development. Smaniotto et al. (2020)  also applied questionnaires with students from 9 Italian universities, obtaining answers from 1676 participants. The study aimed to evaluate awareness, knowledge, and attitudes towards SDGs and sustainability among students enrolled in the first year of the universities contemplated in the research, through 70 items that were listed by the team, drawing on concepts, indicators, documents, and models funding in the existing literature on the SDGs. The results highlighted that general knowledge about sustainable development was low in almost all universities participating in the research, with few exceptions, although good practices may also have been identified. Focusing on the academic community in general, 3 studies that applied questionnaires with this audience were analyzed, highlighting the research of Omisore et al. (2017)  which aimed to assess the level of awareness, knowledge, and attitudes towards the SDGs among members of the academic community of Osun State University in Nigeria. The questionnaire, given to 450 students and staff, showed that 56% had a positive attitude towards the SDGs, but only 43% of the public was aware of the subject and only 4.2% reported having a good knowledge of the subject. In general, the research indicates that through this method of data collection it was possible to perceive a low level of knowledge in relation to the SDGs; this has negative implications for the achievement of global goals. The authors also reinforce the fact that the research stimulates efforts to improve awareness, knowledge, and positive attitude towards SDGs mainly within the university. The study by Nwogbo (2019) , also developed in Nigeria, focused on examining the implementation of the sustainable development goals at selected Nigerian universities, identifying the challenges affecting the implementation of the SDGs in these institutions. The research was conducted with 340 academic representatives, including administrative staff, professors, and students from the institutions selected according to sample criteria. Among the topics addressed, the questionnaire allowed measuring the level of awareness of the SDGs, the area of research activity that collaborates with the 2030 Agenda, the development of a strategic plan for the SDGs, and, finally, the measures suggested to assist in the implementation of the SDGs, having the year 2030 as a parameter. The conclusions of the study consider that:The Nigerian higher education system is flooded with debilitating challenges that limit its ability to accelerate compliance with the SDGs. […] there is no search guidance to achieve the SDGs. Nigerian universities are also not prepared to review the curriculum for compliance with the SDGs. Furthermore, the strategic plans have not yet been developed as a framework of action for the fulfillment of the SDGs. There is also apathy in raising awareness and disseminating information to communities, students, and the public about the SDGs and the imperative to achieve them. […] There are no links with local research institutes, foreign companies and universities and international agencies on the need to achieve the SDGs as a sustainable framework for poverty eradication, increased access to education and better service delivery (Nwogbo, 2019 , p. 17).   Eppinga et al. (2020)  brought the perspective that incorporating sustainability into higher education curricula and practices remains a challenge. Based on a case study developed at the University of Aruba in the Caribbean, the authors reinforce ways for the SDGs to be addressed in educational institutions, comparing this bias from the perspective of students and university staff. To this end, the research proposes the application of a questionnaire with the academic community, including questions for students and collaborators who sought to measure three main dimensions: (i) knowledge about sustainable development; (ii) personal worldview on sustainable development; and (iii) the expected role of the university and its community in promoting sustainable development. In the analyses, the authors highlight that university employees obtained higher scores than students in the three dimensions analyzed, signaling the importance of implementing sustainability in higher education institutions by offering courses that allow students to expand their knowledge and interests in sustainability issues. Considering the 3 studies that applied questionnaires with managers and researchers from universities, Pacher et al. (2020)  conducted a survey of 65 participants to evaluate university curricula. The study was composed of 17 criteria defined for curriculum evaluation, using the Likert scale method. The study's main conclusion is the evaluation of the current curricula of three universities in Greece, Poland, and Slovakia in relation to the incorporation of sustainable development principles and their ability to provide the skills to graduates to achieve the SDGs. Another study that contemplated the application of questionnaires with higher education institutions was developed by Serafini et al. (2020)  having conducted research with the Brazilian Federal Universities to estimate how they are dealing with the incorporation of the SDGs. A form directed to 63 universities through the Law on Access to Information evaluated aspects related to the incorporation of the SDGs in institutional documents, as well as actions for training and dissemination of the SDGs to the academic community. The results show that there is still much to uncover on how these institutions align and disseminate the SDGs. The research of Leal Filho et al. (2019) , already mentioned above, concluded that the respondents of the questionnaire indicated that they have some knowledge about the SDGs and agree to the integration in higher education institutions. However, the author stresses that the main issue is the concrete and practical integration of the SDGs since the research results showed very low levels of application. Reflecting on the 2 studies that used the interview as an instrument for collecting information, the work of Ndubuka and Rey-Marmonier (2019)  was considered, which aimed at investigating how responsible management education (EMR) can support the promotion of SDGs in UK business schools, thus contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. The authors conducted interviews with 15 professors, identifying that some academics in the area of MSC believe that business schools can raise awareness on all 17 SDMs through the RME. Xiong and Mok (2020)  contemplated the vision of managers of 8 Hong Kong universities, critically examining how these public institutions are responding to the SDGs and how they are striving to create sustainable campuses. The authors conclude that although these universities have successful experiences, it is necessary to make the university system more transparent.    4 Roadways and challenges for implementing the SDGs in HEIs The final balance of the reading of the 45 studies analyzed indicates that higher education institutions are important actors for the implementation of sustainable development goals. These institutions should incorporate the SDGs in various dimensions of their activities, embedded in management, teaching, research, and outreach (Fig. 8  ). Furthermore, students, professors, and the entire staff should be sensitized and trained to understand the SDGs beyond a formal agenda, allowing to build a strong understanding that their performance contributes to social transformation. This means that the governing body of these institutions must include the SDGs, first, in a strategic dimension, aligning its institutional documents and establishing initiatives to integrate this theme. The curriculum of the disciplines can also be updated, awakening a complementary training that reinforces the role of individuals in the face of social, economic, and environmental issues that advocates sustainable development. To this end, the training of the faculty is a fundamental initiative to bring about this change in mentality and offer a new process of training to students. Regarding the research and outreach activities, the central role of the HEIs in aligning their actions to the guidelines of the 2030 Agenda was also evidenced. Thus, academic research and other actions involving the community undoubtedly contribute to the achievement of one or more SDG, and it is essential that institutions perceive this link and are committed to achieving global goals. Considering the articles analyzed in this systematic review, a group of reported experiences were identified, prioritizing in which dimension the proposal is most related, to the following: management, teaching, research, and outreach. In this sense, the results presented in Fig. 9   were identified. As observed, 22 articles (49%) addressed experiences of incorporating the SDGs in the dimension of the institution's management. These studies emphasize several actions that the HEIs must implement to integrate the SDGs into their strategic management, suggesting, for example, the inclusion of the Guidelines of the 2030 Agenda in the mission of the institution and in institutional plans and documents. On this topic, Sonetti et al. (2020)  conducted a broad study considering the performance of Italian universities and highlighted that HEIs generally manage large-scale city sections, in which sustainability principles can be “practiced after turbot”. However, the authors' analysis shows that when institutions were questioned about the presence of cross-reference sustainability in the university's statutes, only 29.27% answered affirmatively. Serafini et al. (2020)  considered an analysis with 53 Brazilian universities and identified that 42% of them already included the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs in some institutional documents. Ruiz-Mallén and Heras (2020)  on the integration of the SDGs into the mission of universities reinforce that the HEIs have the moral imperative to incorporate the SDGs as part of their mission and essential functions. In this work that addresses experiences of integration of the SDGs in the teaching dimension, 18 articles (40%) show, above all, initiatives for the integration of the SDGs in the curricula of courses and disciplines offered by the HEI. It is worth mentioning among the experiences, Torres (2021)  examined how education has been configured as the dimension with the greatest potential to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. The author systematized several educational experiences, producing an array of initiatives for the integration of the SDGs in teaching actions, pointing out that this initiative can be carried out from the incorporation of the SDGs in the existing disciplines to the updating of contents, contextualizing them according to the academic and disciplinary profiles offered in the different undergraduate or graduate courses. Research developed by Chaleta et al. (2021)  aimed to map the SDGs in the curricular units of 7 departments of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Évora, Portugal. From the research, the authors identified that, despite the advances, it is still necessary to develop integrative approaches to implement the SDGs in higher education. The results showed that only half of the curricular units were related to the SDGs, with SDG 5 and SDG 10 being the most prominent. In the research dimension, three articles (7%) described experiences of a research project that sought to strengthen the institution's alignment with the 2030 Agenda. It is worth noting the research of Körfgen et al. (2019) , which presented a cooperative process of developing a project with the aim of supporting political decisions for the realization of the SDGs. Involving university members participating in the Alliance of Sustainable Universities in Austria, the study compelled the report of experiences of universities that were driven to address the SDGs in research and education. A platform known as UniNEtZ was developed, with the objective of developing a catalog of options on how the SDGs can be achieved in Austria, adopting a systemic approach to achieving measures compatible with all SDGs, and addressing the SDGs in universities in research, teaching, learning, and university management. The research project also identified that Austrian federal government support as well as SDG mapping are the key success factors. Another study that emphasizes research in the SDGs consists of the work of Marín et al. (2019)  that described the research titled ODSesionesTM, which aimed to increase knowledge about the SDGs among students, professors, and other university employees, and facilitate regional development through courses of action aimed at having a clear social impact in the geographical area where the university is located. The project was conceived at the University of Murcia in Spain and, according to the authors, the seed that originated the project is the current conviction that “the university represents a platform where different stakeholders can work together and comfortably, because the university is a neutral actor that promotes social change and encourages the development of society” (Marín et al., 2019 , p. 2). Considering the 2 articles (4%) emphasizing outreach actions developed by HEIs that collaborate with the dissemination of SDGs, it is noteworthy that the two studies reported Brazilian experiences. Van Kaick and Porto Alegre (2020)  presented the experience of the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR), which advised that all university outreach projects must meet up to three SDGs, which is an institutional policy to achieve alignment with the 2030 Agenda. In turn, the study of Menezes and de Minillo (2017)  also deals with an experience of aligning the SDGs in the outreach highlighting the experience of a project of the Federal University of Paraíba that also proposes the dissemination of the SDGs to civil society organizations. Reading these and other selected works allowed the construction of a database of institutions that should be incorporated by higher education institutions that seek to align themselves with the SDGs, as shown in Table 7  . These research findings are the result of several experiences of institutions that are attempting to integrate into the sustainable development goals themes, representing a way for other HEIs to join this movement and to align their actions in favor of the 2030 Agenda. With this initiative, Leal Filho et al. (2021)  built a framework divided in three steps: 1. item; 2. relevances; and 3. Outcomes. Each step is aligned with different initiatives for the inclusion of the SDGs in Higher Education Programs. Collectively, it is necessary to reinforce that there are still many paths to be explored, and the set of experiences allows to establish guidelines of how the HEIs can and should work with the SDGs. Moreover, from this overview that reports several case studies, the main barriers and challenges that hinder the treatment of SDGs in the HEIs can be perceived, identifying what can be achieved to overcome obstacles and increase the level of integration of HEIs to the SDGs, as listed in Table 8  . According to Table 8 , the authors identified several barriers in the process of implementing the SDGs in universities through the studies presented. These elements have different origins and can influence both a macro and a micro perspective. However, it is very difficult to understand the causes of the emergence of these barriers, because there is a lack of combination between them and the effects caused at different organizational levels of universities. These hierarchical levels can be subdivided in most universities into: course, department, center and rectory. To expand this discussion, these barriers were structured in different dimensions, understanding their impact imposed on each organizational level present in universities.  5 Discussions With the results obtained in the systematization, the authors developed new reflections on the subject, as the process of discussions and implementation of the SDGs in universities, including several barriers that can be classified in various ways. These obstacles can occur externally and/or internally in each institution. External barriers can be correlated with the economic, political and social environment, especially when referring to the stages of development of each country (developed, emerging and underdeveloped) (Chang and Lien, 2020 ). Each economic system can provide a different environment due to bureaucracies, government regulations and legislation, political actions and funding sources (Belke, Zenkov and Sazanova, 2020). Internal barriers, on the other hand, can be delineated by the human nature of managers, infrastructure and resources available to institutions. With this systematization, the authors search to build and concatenate different approaches with the macro and micro barriers emerging in the institutions summarized in the previous topic (Ndubuka and Rey-Marmonier, 2019 ). These barriers were extracted from the literature because they are isolated as a negative impact on the process of disseminating the SDGs in institutions. For a better overview, we grouped these barriers in different dimensions to cover, in a coordinated way, the effects of these internal and external obstacles. Fig. 10   presents an overview of the macro barriers in the process of implementing the SDGs in higher education institutions. In this process of analysis and construction, Table 8  systematizes key elements to propose a framework to analyze the macro perspective barriers to SDG implementation according to the following six dimensions: (1) Human resources; (2) Financing; (3) Government; (4) Organizational; (5) Society; (6) Communication or Information. In another perspective, the micro barriers analysis are described in detail. Each dimension will be further detailed in this step.1) Dimension Human resources    When SDG implementation policies begin in institutions, projects include: (1) resources, (2) teams, (3) assistance centers, and (4) infrastructure. The implementation process is designed concentrating many efforts at the initial stage to obtain greater dissemination in the institutions, but over time, depending on the general coordinator (head), strength is lost in the process of dissemination and repercussion of the post-graduation programs throughout the university. In summary, it is observed that within universities there are many interesting isolated actions, but many of these actions are poorly coordinated by research groups and not aligned with managers, which results in failures of these actions and the project's extincion. This means that there is a lack of senior researchers (or leaders) to lead the SDGs as a driving force of their research. Otherwise, there is a lack of priority on the meeting agenda of university directors (Prieto-Jiménez; López-Catalán; and Domínguez-Fernández, 2020). Without this priority, university outreach projects should homogeneously empower the university community about SDGs. This type of action could develop effects to obtain a standardized equality of knowledge among everyone in the community. As the university has different areas, each department has its autonomy and needs to fulfill its mandatory content. In this case, the content of the SDGs has been presented and disseminated in universities through workshops, training and isolated events. Such actions are developed in a punctual way, which does not require much dedication from students and professors, as they are random events that occur to fulfill the workload. Other universities have offered the SDGs as a mandatory curriculum subject with a defined workload, as well as some works reveal some courses that require them in their curricular components. These SDG components often appear in curricula due to institutional demand or to meet specific projects. The effective and consistent performance of these SDGs is when the university management adopts them as mandatory for everyone in a homogeneous way. However, standardized documents are lacking in the national teaching environment that governs this entire institutional process. It is observed that there are isolated experiences that develop documents entitled as: manuals, recipes or experience reports to stimulate the individual process of each establishment in meeting these goals (Körfgen et al., 2019 ). With this lack of priority, university outreach projects should homogeneously train the university community on SDGs. Actions should develop effects to obtain equality of standardized knowledge among all members from the community. As the university has different areas, each department has its autonomy and must comply with its mandatory content. In this case, the content of the SDGs has been presented and disseminated in universities through workshops, training and isolated events. Which does not require much dedication from students and professors, as they are random events that occur to fulfill only the workload. Otherwise, some universities: 1) have offered the SDGs as a mandatory subject of the curriculum with a defined workload; 2) some works reveal some courses that require SDG in their curricular components; 3) courses should promote the social, humanistic and moral values of education. Institutions must provide to students an education that actively engages them to participate in solving social problems. De La Rosa Ruiz; Armentia; Maldonado. (2019) consider that it is necessary to initiate actions to improve our environment and society. These components of SDGs often appear in curriculum due to an institutional demand requirement (López et al., 2019 ) or to meet specific projects. The effective and consistent performance of these SDGs is when the university management adopts them as mandatory for everyone in a homogeneous way. However, standardized documents are lacking in the national teaching environment that governs this entire institutional process. It is observed that there are isolated experiences developing documents entitled as manuals, recipes or experience reports to stimulate the individual process of each establishment in the fulfillment of these goals. Despite all worldwide efforts, each institution has peculiar characteristics which makes it very complex to develop a standard document. Despite all worldwide efforts, each institution has peculiar characteristics, which makes it very complex to develop a standard document. To narrow these realities, research has emerged that report global experiences as shown in Table 2 . Some professors lead this knowledge competition, as they are interested in the subject and start research alone, often without financial resources. Sometimes, the beginning of some research is based only on personal motivation and engagement.2) Dimension Financial    Financial barriers can be identified by the lack of resources within universities, as well as the lack of funding from government and private institutions. This scarcity of resources can, in many cases, turn the execution of projects unfeasible, damaging competitiveness of universities worldwide. Another current financial barrier is the lack of specific internal notices for the development of programs and practices aimed at the SDGs (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). When a research group receives funding, depending on the funding agent, the project is concluded not receiving funds. With this, all this previous efforts will be lost due to the lack of resources. When the SDGs are well-aligned with research lines and strategic planning, the credit availability is more easily available. Many universities, especially those located in developing countries, have very limited financial resources (Crespo et al., 2017 ). When a research group receives funding for the development of a project, depending on the type of resource and the funding agent, the project must be closed if it no longer receives this money (Hamzah et al., 2018 ). This implies that an entire team is trained on SDG, but with the project interruption there will be no research continuity, wasting all knowledge built and damaging to be replied to new team members. In addition, the disarticulation of these projects brings frustration to researchers and students.3) Dimension Governamental    Depending on the country's political and economic system, each institution contemplates bureaucratic aspects to develop new communication. This is due to the lack of experience of funding research foundations, which take a long time to adapt and align institutions' internal rules. Execution project rules are different from institution to institution, mainly according to: 1) the size of university; 2) amount of resources and 3) quantity of projects. Studies by El-Jardali, Ataya and Fadlallah (2018) discuss these problems that discourage integration and new partnerships with researchers from partner institutions. Depending on the economic systems, taxes and fees are excessive to raise funds for projects, as a part of the total financial value of the researchers' project budget is subtracted. With reduced budgets, researchers become discouraged to develop new projects. These obstacles are caused by some factors: 1) overload activities to register the research project; 2) lack of experience of research foundations; 3) lack of experience of researchers; and 4) lack of awareness about not well-done accountability. At this stage it takes a long time to adapt and align the internal norms of institutions with other funding agencies. Depending on the institution, the standards are so demanding that they often leave these institutions blocked to be flexible in relationships. These problems discourage the integration and development of new partnerships with researchers and external partner institutions. With the 2030 agenda, cooperation networks are essential to promote growth and share successful experiences in institutions (Leal Filho et al., 2018 ). This action should be effective in governments to stimulate the integration of the SDGs and encourage research. Another financial perspective depending on each university, taxes and fees are excessive internal factors to project's funding, because a part of the overall value of the researchers' project budget is removed. With budgets reduced, researchers become discouraged to develop new projects.4) Dimension Organizational    The organizational dimension has been presented as one of the main barriers, because this dimension outlines what impulses the work environment can offer to everyone in the community. Organizational barriers are structured in two axes: horizontal and vertical. These barriers can be classified into different levels 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each level can be defined as: Level 1, refers to the operational level, the base of the organization, consisting of professors, students and subjects; Level 2, the department brings together several disciplines from the same area of knowledge; Level 3, the center's management dialogues and brings together all the courses from different departments, forming a center; Level 4, head of university (dean) is responsible for managing all directors of different knowledge centers. The organizational structure can be evaluated from two perspectives: macro and micro. It is possible to identify barriers in the organizational structure of universities at all hierarchical levels (Fig. 11  ). Horizontal barriers are defined as obstacles imposed by the same sector of work. These obstacles occur on the same level of institutional hierarchy, as can be seen in Fig. 11 . For example, at Level 1, when a department distributes its workload to all professors. Those who are interested in teaching an SDG subject, if it is optional in the curriculum.The professors will teach according to personal interest, but it will probably result in a work overload beyond mandatory workload determined by the academic department. Lack of incentives are a barrier imposed in a horizontal perspective. In the horizontal perspective, when the theme of the SDGs is conducted internally, few researchers link their research to the SDGs due to the lack of institutional strategic planning. When this alignment occurs, it is caused by requirements from universities or research calls for fundings. This lack of alignment occurs mainly when there is a lack of internal integration between them in the organization, as the research developed by professors from their own department is not always known. Otherwise, this problem occurs by transforming some research groups into isolated islands of knowledge, which increases the fragility of the need to build collaborative networks between professors from the same department, as well as from departments of the same center and new areas of knowledge at the same university and with external partnerships. These barriers can be analyzed at different levels (1,2,3,4) in universities horizontally, as there is still a lot to be done in these collaborative networks. Vertical barriers occur when changes in institutional hierarchies are classified in levels 1, 2, 3 and 4. These obstacles can also occur between different institutions. So, when conducting internal processes in universities, employees can cause obstacles between university levels, not always each academic employee analyzing processes with the same priority. This means that universities do not have a leader in their structure to coordinate the research process in a formal way. Depending on the organizational structure, many employees may adopt a more resistant culture to implement new themes and content demanded by the 2030 Agenda. According to the lack of internal alignment in the university, each center (or area of knowledge) can lead the content of the disciplines directed only to its course and is not always presented as an overview of the SDGs (Oliver Su et al., 2018 ). There is a lack of standardization between course's contents offered on SDGs within the same institution, as the substitution of professors also can bring difficulties in this execution. These barriers can be classified in two axes: horizontally  at Level 1 and vertically  at Level 1 and 2. In a macro way, this is a major barrier that can be analyzed at Level 3, as it does not include a standardization of content to be taught between universities. To mitigate these problems, universities should delegate departmental leaders to be able to conduct actions in a more coordinated manner among all hierarchical levels of the institution, as the lack of strategic alignment with the SDG themes occurs in many universities described by the authors. By minimizing these divergences in content and implementation processes, universities should primarily adopt in their strategic planning the alignment of the SDGs in all organizational spheres to reduce barriers on the horizontal and vertical axis, both in the micro and macro perspectives. This research identifies how the SDGs can influence the strategic planning of HEIs. It is verified as important to observe political, economic, social and technological aspects. The alignment of strategic planning with the SDGs brings a discussion from different threes perspectives:1. For university presidents and directors,  the SDGs are disseminated in the management plan, outlined with institutional goals, which becomes a published guide to the academic community. However, this guide is not always present in all universities because, depending on the organization and institutional size, private and public configuration, this document is usually absent.  2. For professors and researchers , the implementation and dissemination process can be approached in different ways, as it depends on the professor's engagement and the course that professors offer in the period and your motivation in this tematic. In addition, some institutions do not provide flexibility in the curriculum, which causes inflexibility to be taught in the classroom. In this case, institutions that have a standardized document with phases defined through a roadmap become more accessible to professors and researchers. The motivations of professors and researchers can be raised by funding when they open internal calls in institutions and/or external call for funding with governmental and business partnerships. These directions can re-engage professors by helping with monetary effects to start new research in line with the SDGs with their research group.  3. For students , the SDGs related to them involve the dissemination of this discussion in the subjects offered in the class period or events, such as conferences, webinars and seminars. This discussion brings an initiative to disseminate an awareness on the subject and depends on the level of discussion offered by the classroom groups and the professors' motivation. From another perspective, students can access lectures given at universities by different research groups. When students receive funded research grants, these community members are motivated to study the topic in greater depth.    Thus, universities need to have a digital environment (or infrastructure) that can demonstrate all this dynamism of knowledge of all courses, department and centers inside of university. In the digital age, professors can follow the dynamism of knowledge from all departments, which would minimize horizontal barriers and still motivate arousing interest in new themes that emerge in the researcher's daily life. The key element of these initiatives is to bypass the horizontal and vertical barriers imposed on university processes. For this to happen, institutions need to use mapping tools to standardize all processes. Thus, strengthening the strategic planning of universities. The importance of horizontal and vertical networks in institutions (and between institutions) are essential to promote the development of products/services, exchange of knowledge and information, as initiatives to generate new and smart technologies, according to Giannetti et al. (2020) . Therefore, procedures to reduce vertical and horizontal barriers need to be considered in any educational system, regardless of country. Therefore, procedures to reduce vertical and horizontal barriers need to be considered in any educational system, regardless of country.5) Dimension Social    Discussions on SDGs are becoming a global issue/demand. To achieve sustainable goals, companies and universities need to redesign and adapt their production processes to align their supply chain and customers. However, the market performs its activities at a very different speed from universities. The social barriers can be defined by the lack of alignment of the internal process of universities with the different organizational processes inherent to each institution. In this case, social barriers occur with the lack of alignment from the content taught in the classroom with the real problems demanded by the economic market. Students often learn the content obtained only by books (textbook) without the dynamism and practical experience adopted by companies. With this bias, the introduction of these researches with active methodologies approaches has spread to a greater extent within some universities, as analyzed in Table 3 . Active methodologies have helped the propagation of the SDG theme through case studies (Beynaghi et al., 2016 ). This can be translated with the result of Table 6 . These 45 articles are described as case studies in different countries. Depending on demand, some projects have broader skills than others within institutions. This often occurs due to the volume with which the projects are associated, the size and number of students in each institution. Many universities are not aware about the importance of aligning their syllabus of all subjects of all courses to the themes of the SDGs. Universities have already awakened this interest, which has acted as leaders in the subject, as seen in Table 2 , mainly because it has become a prerequisite for developing partnerships with external institutions and has helped to capture government and private resources.6) Dimension Communication    The university is an environment composed of students, professors, directors, service providers from different fields of knowledge, being an organization labeled for its multifaceted knowledge. With the diversity of knowledge and processes, the dimension of communication needs to be discussed in all spheres. Thus, many institutions contemplate integrated information systems contributing to circulate news quickly. In this case, the dissemination of internal communication needs to be managed and coordinated. This communication, in many cases, is not developed by professionals, which weakens the implementation and dissemination of SDG programs. This communication usually becomes an assigned task for a professor and/or researchers who are already overloaded with other demands. Thus, the SDGs campaign and/or program may or may not be a priority of the professor's activity, which makes this activity very dependent on the researcher's interest and not on the organization as an institutional goal. For the conduction and dissemination of internal communication, universities should adopt internal procedures to implement indicators in order to signal the stages of development for everyone in the community. Körfgen et al. (2019)  agreed that indicators are an important and useful tool to measure progress, but it must be ensured that the appropriate criteria are applied. Besides these indicators, the team could track the progress and evolution of the project implementation. Developing university management based on indicators is not always an easy task, mainly depending on the size and number of employees and students, making the system increasingly complex. According to the authors Sonetti et al. (2020) , to map these initiatives from a holistic perspective, must be seen as a complex and multifaceted element embedded in a multi-layered network of relationships. However, this type of implementation demands a large team of professionals, engaged and with time availability to dedicate themselves fully to the project. To circumvent these problems, management tools emerge to try to introduce new internal procedures and reduce cultural resistance. Given this sequence of barriers, the complexity of the process of disseminating and implementing the SDGs is at different levels of the organization, as analyzed in Figs. 10  and 11 . From this systematization, this analysis serves for university managers to identify that each university is inserted in a different context that can affect the dissemination of SDGs. Depending on where the university is located, the national education system can be influenced by the barriers discussed earlier such as the norms, legislation and bureaucracies of each country. More deeply, these barriers were presented in the previous section, as they can be caused by internal factors to the university and external factors from market and society. The factors (internal and external) can be defined as variables that drive or delay initiatives to disseminate the SDGs. These differences of factors are dynamic from country to country and have been necessary examined especifically. To meet this dynamism, we built a framework to discuss all the factors that can affect the implementation process with a detailed structure. Fig. 12   presents the relationship between internal and external factors that influence the organizational structures of universities. The framework includes all factors (internal and external) that influence the SDGs in three pillars: (1) countries, (2) market and industry, and (3) universities. In the country pillar, factors are highly dependent by the national education system, as norms, resources and incentives are established in a top-down manner. With this public policies can be better established to encourage and promote companies and universities on the subject. As a result of governmental political policies, the government establishes special funding (internal calls) to promote research in the countries and without this support there is no research at the national level. To analyze market and industry, geographic location can be a determining factor depending on the economic environment where the university is inserted to promote dissemination, as in economically poorer states it may not provide necessary resources, which weakens collaboration networks and the characteristics of companies in the region. This limitation impacts the development of technology transfers from universities to the market. With companies with low economic development, the search for new and intelligent solutions is not required and stimulated (Giannetti et al., 2020 ). Considering the factors that impact universities, it is noteworthy that, initially, there are elements that refer to the size of the institution and its availability of resources. This implies that some institutions have greater projection and, therefore, may have a more favorable environment for the implementation of the SDGs. In universities, projects are supported by resources from financial sources (internal or external). To promote research in the academic community, universities periodically open internal funding calls to encourage teaching, research and extension. After the submission of the project by the researchers, the process goes on for evaluation, which requires an external evaluator so that they can validate the merit of each submitted project, according to the criteria, objectives and areas of knowledge previously mentioned in the public funding call. When these projects are approved, each project has its execution time according to the presented schedule that meets the universities' future strategies. From this execution, the project obtains results to meet the demanded needs as a return on investment for society, but not always a satisfactory result is obtained. Because applied research depends on several factors to develop a new technology (or innovation), mainly the time, the maturity stage of the project and the alignment of the researchers' experience in the execution. Thus, scarce resources need to be allocated to projects that aim to contribute to the transformation of society (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ; Zamora-Polo and Sánchez-Martín, 2019 ). New models of sustainable education emerge with the aim of changing the mindset of future generations starting at an early age, then promoted through education at undergraduate, graduate and in the market environment. The alignment between all links in the country, university and market and industry chain (see Fig. 12 ) has a direct impact on the pillar of quality of life for all those involved in the environment, since the result of research advances, education models and factors (internal and external) of the university. Other pertinent factors deal with the organizational culture for performing better communication between the members of the institution, facilitating and providing a harmonious and collaborative work environment. The union of these internal factors need to be expressed and disseminated through communication and institutional marketing, because today no university can survive without this tool as it is a requirement of the global market. The speed of this demand has emerged more and more in this period of the pandemic where universities need to adapt to new technologies and align research with market needs.  6 Conclusions The studies analyzed in this systematic review elucidated the importance of the HEIs implementing the 2030 Agenda, addressing experiences of incorporating the SDGs in the context of these educational institutions. This theme has gained more attention in the research agendas, as guides are published and disseminated that stimulate and engage debates on how universities are arenas for the formation of knowledge and practical application of guidelines for sustainable development. Around the world, actions aligned with the 2030 Agenda are multiplying, and universities are more attentive to the incorporation of the SDGs in university environments since experiences were observed from several universities that address the SDGs both in their management, as well as in teaching, research, and outreach. Furthermore, the systematic review identified that in some HEIs specific SDG implementation. Meanwhile, other HEIs operate the SDGs implementation as a network movement that seeks to promote the SDGs not only for a single university, but dialoguing between them, with several exchanges of experience within these institutions. This brings more maturity about how to implement and manage the SDGs in academic institutions. In the majority of analyzed studies, the results from these articles reflect only specific experiences not reflecting a broader view of SDGs implementation and management. Was observed that the studies used quantitative and qualitative approaches and mainly employed documentary analyses and questionnaires, developing analyses that reflect how students and the academic community, in general, articulate the theme (SDGs). In addition, a significant number of studies addressing the incorporation of SDGs in the dimension of university management and integration with teaching have also been identified, with a smaller number of studies that are interested in aligning SDGs with research and outreach projects. The literature points out that there is no consensus on where to begin implementing the SDGs in HEI. Although, the final balance sheet shows that there is a large repository of practices to be investigated, translating a critical role played by Higher Education Institutions that assumed the prerogative to be implementing and disseminating agents of the SDGs, as recommended by the sustainable development solutions network (SDSN). Was observed that a set of initiatives can be adopted by HEI to: 1) systematize the implementation of SDGs, 2) start actions aligned with institutional documents and strategic mission; 3) integrate the SDGs with curriculum and learning; and 4) disseminate the awareness through training in university community. Otherwise, the research path also identified a set of necessary good practices to effective incorporation of the SDGs in HEIs: 1) Develops a guideline on SDGs awareness and how to be more sustainable in academia; 2) Change the organizational culture, observing how specific actions can be aligned with each 17 SDGs; 3) Support of presidents and directors from HEIs to implement institutional SDGs actions; and 4) Creates a tool to identify and guide the adderence of all actions, projects and documents to SDGs. All these aspects suggest the possibility of future research considering a more deep exploration in this theme, especially in two main aspects: 1) Case studies on best practices and evaluations of specific interventions in institutions that have exceeded in the incorporation of the SDGs; 2) Analytical indicators can also establish comparative parameters for examining HEI experiments in the SDGs. It is worth questioning how this process of incorporation occurred, understanding the emergence of the initiative and the current level of maturity of these HEIs about their alignment with the guidelines of the 2030 Agenda. The post-COVID pandemic moment demands rethink how the SDGs can be important guidelines to accelerate and restore levels of efforts to bring gains to society in a moment of health recovery on a micro and macro level. Thus, HEis should demonstrate commitment not only to the impacts of COVID in society, but also collaborate to identify strategies and guidelines to boost public policies of regeneration of health conditions identified previously. During the period of the pandemic, institutions needed to adapt to online classes, which made it more difficult to disseminate the actions of the SDGs in the institutions, as this implementation process became remote. Regarding the limitations of this systematic review, it is necessary to emphasize that the approach was generalist and not focused on any SDGs, which may have eliminated some experience developed by an HEI on one of the specific SDGs. Another point is that the interpretation of the research was hampered by the fact that many of the studies did not make explicit some information about the context of the experience, making it difficult to fill the analytical framework elaborated by the researchers. Other future research would: 1) Identify specific SDGs more frequently mentioned by HEIs; 2) Develop a framework to HEIs with all steps to SDGs implementation; 3) Develop performance indicators to evaluate the success on implementation; 4) Develop a information system to HEIs on SDGs benchmarking; and 5) SDG stamp on certification on HEIs alignment with SDGs. The present study collaborated with a vision about implementation of the SDGs in HEIs. This research can be a useful instrument for professionals and managers of these educational institutions on SDGs knowledge that have been implemented in these organizations, observing main initiatives and barriers influencing the SDGs management performance. Finally, it is emphasized that the general contribution of the article can stimulate the support of other HEIs in the implementation of the SDGs, besides being a relevant source of consultation for researchers who seek to understand the state of the art of the theme of Sustainable Development Goals in Higher Education Institutions.
