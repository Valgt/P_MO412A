                  The present study determined the community characteristics, structural composition, and regeneration status of street trees in two major Indian cities viz., Ranchi and Delhi. A total of 96 species of 86 genera belonging to 34 families were documented in the urban streets of Ranchi (of which 59 spp. were in the IUCN Red-list), while 64 species of 56 genera belonging to 28 families (of which 47 spp. were in the IUCN Red-list) were reported in Delhi. The study reported a very high species diversity index (H′) in both Ranchi (3.98) and Delhi (3.47), with similar species evenness (0.85). Fabaceae and Ficus were the predominant family and genus, respectively in both cities. The similarity of street trees of Ranchi and Delhi is quite low in terms of all the β-diversity indices (SI = 38.75% and dissimilarity = 61.25%; Cj = 0.24 and dissimilarity = 0.76; BCij = 0.61 and similarity = 0.39). The total street tree density in Ranchi (217 ind. ha−1) and Delhi (637 ind. ha−1) varied significantly, while the dominance (basal area) of both cities were quite similar (20.67 m2ha−1 and 21.70 m2ha−1) due to the predominance of young and adult individuals (GBH ≥30–90 cm) in the street tree community at Ranchi and pole and young individuals (GBH ≥ 10–60) in Delhi. The regeneration potential of street trees in both cities was quite concerning because the majority of street trees at Ranchi (62.5% of 96 spp.) and Delhi (57.38% of 64 spp.) had shown no regeneration. It is advised that re-greening, planting a variety of native tree tracts in urban niches, and tree planting in a ratio of one to three be implemented to counteract artificial urban land, maintain urban biodiversity and achieve UN SDGs.

The present study determined the community characteristics, structural composition, and regeneration status of street trees in two major Indian cities viz., Ranchi and Delhi. A total of 96 species of 86 genera belonging to 34 families were documented in the urban streets of Ranchi (of which 59 spp. were in the IUCN Red-list), while 64 species of 56 genera belonging to 28 families (of which 47 spp. were in the IUCN Red-list) were reported in Delhi. The study reported a very high species diversity index (H′) in both Ranchi (3.98) and Delhi (3.47), with similar species evenness (0.85). Fabaceae and Ficus  were the predominant family and genus, respectively in both cities. The similarity of street trees of Ranchi and Delhi is quite low in terms of all the β-diversity indices (SI = 38.75% and dissimilarity = 61.25%; Cj = 0.24 and dissimilarity = 0.76; BCij = 0.61 and similarity = 0.39). The total street tree density in Ranchi (217 ind. ha−1 ) and Delhi (637 ind. ha−1 ) varied significantly, while the dominance (basal area) of both cities were quite similar (20.67 m2 ha−1  and 21.70 m2 ha−1 ) due to the predominance of young and adult individuals (GBH ≥30–90 cm) in the street tree community at Ranchi and pole and young individuals (GBH ≥ 10–60) in Delhi. The regeneration potential of street trees in both cities was quite concerning because the majority of street trees at Ranchi (62.5% of 96 spp.) and Delhi (57.38% of 64 spp.) had shown no regeneration. It is advised that re-greening, planting a variety of native tree tracts in urban niches, and tree planting in a ratio of one to three be implemented to counteract artificial urban land, maintain urban biodiversity and achieve UN SDGs.

Overexploitation of natural resources has created a big gap between the demand and supply of natural resources [4 ]. Poverty, population pressure, infrastructural development, and agricultural expansion as well as intensification are the major threats to natural resources [5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ] which causes an increase in the movement rate of rural population towards urban areas. Urbanization has several advantages for Asian countries [9 ], in particular, India and other South Asian countries can change their economies by better utilizing the opportunities provided by urbanization [10 ]. On the contrary, urban development harms urban ecosystems and surrounding environmental conditions including the urban heat island (UHI) effects, air pollution, and changes to hydrological systems [11 ]. To cope with this situation, plantations of fast-growing tree species and other plant species are being established in the global scale to meet the increasing demand for ecological goods and services, believing that a large amount of biomass can be harvested within short span and can improve the overall environmental conditions [12 ,13 ]. In addition to these, the presence of roadside trees and urban greenery, can promote psychological and physiological regrowth by improving mental health, lowering blood pressure and anxiety, reducing death rates, and lowering physical inactivity while encouraging active lifestyles with greater cardiovascular benefits [14 ]. Street tree diversity and composition in urban landscapes are becoming increasingly important for scientific research [15 ], urban design and enforcement [16 ], climate change adaptation and mitigation [17 ], as well as for overall sustainability of urban areas [18 ]. There are many different kinds of trees in urban environments, both native and non-native [19 ], with notable levels of species richness in the streets [20 ]. Street trees serve as key natural elements of urban ecosystems offering a range of ecological and social benefits, such as carbon retention and sequestration, maintaining biodiversity [21 ], better air quality, stormwater runoff management, noise suppression, and UV-B radiation abatement [22 ]. Green spaces in urbanised areas can improve clean air and water, maintain energy flow, reduce the UHI effect, and offer recreational possibilities and economic benefits to city people [23 ]. These benefits can improve both the mental and physical well-being of city dwellers [24 ]. Integrated analysis of plant species composition and diversity offers a chance to quantify the impact of disruption on vegetation, habitat patterns, and the propagation of invasive species [25 ]. In urban areas, species richness is quite high due to a combination consisting of a high prevalence of exotic species, socioeconomic factors, heterogeneity in land use and land cover, and variations in soil and climatic parameters [26 ]. Tree species are pillars of urban ecosystems help to maintain plant species composition, mitigate environmental changes, and benefit a wide range of services to mankind [27 ]. Extreme industrialization can hinder alpha diversity due to unsuitable environmental conditions, whereas introducing new species with minimal to average levels of urbanization can boost alpha diversity [25 ]. Contrarily, beta diversity in urban vegetation often declines as a result of native species becoming extinct due to rivalry with invasive species or because native species cannot withstand the stresses that are often inherited in urban areas [25 ]. Exotic invaders, environmental damage, road salts [28 ], and restricted spacing [29 ] are significant streetscape components that can jeopardize the wholesome development and vitality of urban street trees [30 ]. A greater diversity of species corresponds with improved psychological and aesthetic advantages, and can also lessen the havoc caused by blizzards, drought, health issues, and other stresses [31 ]. Globally, studies regarding urban green spaces (UGSs) focus mainly on recreation, physical and mental health, and modulating services [32 ]. Scholars have continued to recommend integration of UGSs in urban planning and development [33 ]. In context to India, urban planning and forestry initiatives still lack in small cities due to absence of multidisciplinary evaluation and government policies, hindering compatible sustainable development [34 ,35 ]. The accomplishment of sustainable management initiatives including United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (specifically SDGs 11, 13, 15, and 16), requires the implementation of comprehensive plans for enhancing the density of UGSs, and the improvement of existing ones, relying on governmental actions, approaches, and regulations on UGSs [36 ,10 ]. Under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), the Government of India introduced the National Mission of Green India and the National Mission on Sustainable Habitat to increase the carbon sink capacity of metropolitan areas by establishing afforestation schemes [37 ]. The National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) associates growing diversity with higher resilience in urban and community tree populations and promotes the introduction of site-appropriate species tolerant to insect and disease pests and climate change [38 ]. Urban planning and management must undergo a considerable transformation to achieve UN SDGs [39 ]. City's sustainability can be achieved through integration of all the three basic pillars of sustainability, viz., environmental, socio-economic, and cultural aspects as well as integrating pollution tolerant, highly productive, fast-growing trees in the urban streets [40 ]. Therefore, the present study focused on determining the street tree diversity of two randomly selected Indian cities and their associated ecological parameters to suggest most adaptable street trees according to the prevailing environmental conditions of the cities. It also highlights the importance of street tree communities for the development of urban greenery to achieve UN SDGs. It also addresses the knowledge gaps in distribution and species composition of street trees, management approaches, environmental conditions, and anthropogenic pressure.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The study was carried on and led in two randomly selected Indian cities viz., Ranchi and Delhi to determine the street tree diversity and related ecological characteristics. Ranchi is the capital city of the Indian state of Jharkhand, while Delhi is one of the metro cities located in the national capital (Fig. 1  ). Delhi is located on the banks of the Yamuna River, with latitudes of 28.24 to 28.53° N and longitudes of 76.50 to 77.20° E covering a total area of 1483 sq. km. Delhi is a small strip of northwest Indo-Gangetic plains surrounded by the Thar Desert, the Aravali Mountain, and the Himalayas [41 ]. Monsoon season in Delhi begins in the last week of June or the first week of July with a cumulative annual rainfall of 790 mm. Delhi has a mean annual maximum temperature of 46 °C and a minimal temperature of 4 °C, with December the coldest and June the hottest month. Delhi's vegetation is thorny scrub, which grows in arid and semi-arid areas classified as a ‘Tropical Thorn Forest’ and more specifically as a ‘Semi-Arid Open Scrub’ [42 ]. Conversely, Ranchi is the capital of the Indian state Jharkhand, located at 23.13° to 23.21° N latitude, 85.51° to 85.54° E longitude with a spatial extent of 5097 sq. km [43 ]. It resides on the eastern border of the Deccan Plateau, becoming the southernmost region of the Chhotanagpur Plateau and lies at an elevation ranging from 400 to 700 above mean sea level [44 ]. The combination of hilly terrain and dense tropical trees (primary and secondary tropical moist deciduous and dry deciduous forests) create a warm and modest climate throughout the year with an average of 1430 mm annual rainfall [45 ].  2.2 Vegetation sampling and data analysis A sampling of street trees was performed during 2022 using random belt transects of 0.10 ha size in Delhi (18 transects) and Ranchi (20 transects) cities, where the girth at breast height (GBH i.e., 1.37 m above the ground) and the height of each adult tree (≥10 cm GBH) were measured using measuring tape and a rangefinder, respectively. Tree saplings and seedlings were sampled in 3 random quadrats of 5 m × 5 m and 1 m × 1 m size, respectively. Species were identified up to species level following regional flora, published literature, consulting botanical survey of India and field taxonomists. The population structure and vertical stratification were analyzed by grouping all of the individual trees following Saikia et al. [46 ] (Table 1.1  ). The regeneration status of trees was evaluated by quantifying the overall population density of seedlings, saplings, and adults by following Shankar [47 ] (Table 1.2  ) . On the other hand, the quantitative analyses of vegetation were performed following ecological indices as summarized in Table 1.3  . The species dispersion pattern was determined by using abundance to abundance-to-frequency ratio [56 ], which implies regular distribution if A/F < 0.025, random if A/F = 0.025–0.05, and contagious propagation if A/F > 0.05 [57 ]. Raunkiaer's law of frequency [58 ] was implemented to put the tree species into one of five groups for their frequency distribution (Table 1.4  ), while the species were categorized into different rarity classes following Pragasan and Parthasarathy [59 ] ( Table 1.5  ) .   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Street tree diversity and distribution A total of 96 species of trees of 86 genera belonging to 34 families were documented in the urban streets of Ranchi, while in Delhi, a total of 64 species were reported belonging to 56 genera and 28 families (Figs. 2  and 3 )  . While the earlier studies reported comparatively less plant species richness in Chengdu city, China (57 spp. of 28 families) [22 ], Bhubaneswar (44 spp. of 22 families) [60 ], and the urban-rural area of Jaunpur (54 spp. of 23 families) [61 ] in India, but higher species richness in Zomba City of Malawi (168 spp. of 47 families) [62 ], the northern part of mega-city Bengaluru (93 spp. of 39 families) [63 ], and Pasighat (103 spp. of 45 families) [64 ] in India (Table 2  ). Comparatively higher species richness in Ranchi City as compared to Delhi metropolis may be due to the differences in management approaches, planting history, development patterns, edaphic factors, and spatial variation in floral composition [65 ]. The high species richness in a region signifies healthier ecosystems than the regions with poor species richness [66 ,67 ]. Similarly, among Nordic cities, Malmo has the highest urban tree diversity (113) flourishing, after Turku (74) and Copenhagen (66) [68 ]. On the other hand, Fabaceae was the predominant family in both the cities, and in Ranchi, it has 16 different species (17%) followed by Moraceae with 13 species (12%), and Rubiaceae with 6 species (6%), while in Delhi it has 18 (28%) different species followed by Moraceae with 7 (9%) and Myrtaceae with 4 (6%) species. Fabaceae was also found to be a predominant family in other parts of Indian cities like Bilaspur [69 ], Coimbatore [70 ], and Puducherry [71 ] due to ecological adaptivity, selective utilization, and conservation by government and private ownership [72 ]. Out of the total 96 species in Ranchi, 70% (59 spp.) were IUCN Red-listed of which 88% (60 spp.) were Least Concerned (LC), 4% (03 spp.) Near Threatened (NT) (Aegle marmelos  (L.) Corrêa, Dypsis lutescens  (H.Wendl.) Beentje & J.Dransf, and Eucalyptus camaldulensis  Dehnh.), 3% (02 spp.) Vulnerable (VU) (Jacaranda mimosifolia  D. Don and Litchi chinensis  Sonn.), and 1% (01 sp.) Endangered (EN) (Tectona grandis  L.), while 3% (02 spp.) Data Deficient (DD) (Carica papaya  L. and Mangifera indica  L.). On the other hand, in Delhi, out of 64 plant species, around 74% of species were IUCN Red-listed, of which 86.6% (39 spp.) LC, 2.2% (1 sp. each) NT (A. marmelos ), VU (J. mimosifolia ), and EN (T. grandis ) and 6.6% (3 spp.) DD. A higher proportion of IUCN Red-Listed tree species has significant consequences for human accessibility, conservation, management policy suggestions, and future protection and isolation improvements. In general, a higher percentage denotes a greater concern for the conservation of biodiversity, while a decreasing trend of IUCN red-listed tree species suggests a negative influence of people on biodiversity. The presence of IUCN red-listed tree species is vital for managers, conservationists, and city planners since they are crucial for the protection and management of biodiversity in urban areas [73 ]. On the other hand, the percentage of native species in Ranchi and Delhi is 64% (62 spp.) and 69% (44 spp.), respectively, while the percentage of introduced species is 36% (35 spp.) and 31% (20 spp.), respectively. There are more introduced species in cities than in rural regions because of factors including government and private ownership favouring non-native trees for ornamental, shelterbelt, and development of UGSs [74 ]. Similar trends of indigenous and introduced species were also reported in Karwar, Karnataka, India [75 ]. The higher percentage of introduced species signifies the transformation of homogenous habitat towards heterogeneity [76 ] that hinders species composition, local climate filtration, and monitoring of all species within that community [65 ]. The majority of the street trees were contagiously distributed in both Ranchi (97.29%) and Delhi (100.00%), while only 2.71% species (Araucaria columnaris  (J. R. Forst.) Hook, Monoon longifolium  (Sonn.) B.Xue & R.M.K.Saunders, and Morus alba  L.) were randomly distributed tree species in Ranchi. The distribution of species is contagious in naturally occurring vegetation, but random in highly homogeneous ecosystems [77 ]. This is because contagious distribution is heavily influenced by factors such as seed dispersal, mode of reproduction, local habitat, and the daily and periodic weather in a given area [78 ].  3.2 Street tree composition The height distribution of street trees was documented to understand their established age, unique ecological significance like distribution of light and potential to receive precipitation in different strata [80 ]. The height of trees ranged from 2 to 22 m with a mean height of 10 m ± 0.08 (SE) in Ranchi, while it ranged from 1.5 to 16.5 m with a mean height of 6 m ± 0.06 (SE) in Delhi. The majority of individuals (44.39%) on the streets of Ranchi were recorded in the height class of 10–20 m (canopy strata), while in Delhi majority of individuals (50.95%) were recorded in the height class of 5–10 m (understorey strata) ( Fig. 7 ).  The emergent strata (>20 m height) at Ranchi were occupied by the 08 individuals of only two species (E. camaldulensis  and Delonix regia  (Bojer ex Hook.) Raf.), while the canopy layer was dominated by the individuals (1236) of the majority of tree species (70 spp.) including M. indica  and Acacia auriculiformis  A.Cunn. ex Benth. On the other hand, the street trees of Delhi were comparatively young without any individuals in the emergent layer and only a few individuals (67) in the canopy layer of 24 different plant species including Neltuma juliflora  (Sw.) Raf., while the majority of the individuals (1079) in the understorey layer in Delhi was dominated by 57 different plant species including N. juliflora, Pongamia pinnata  (L.) Pierre, and Putranjiva roxburghii  Wall. Tree composition at different strata helps to understand the changes in understorey plant communities such as response to light, regeneration, growth, species coexistence, and habitat [81 ]. Besides, this study illustrates clear differences in street tree density (the number of trees per hectare of street) between the two cities. At the same time, Delhi has greater tree density (673 ind. ha−1 ) compared to Ranchi city (217 ind. ha−1 ). Alternatively, the density of street trees in different streets of Ranchi ranges from 62 to 612 ind. ha−1  with a mean of 217 ind. ha−1  ± 31 (SE), while in Delhi it ranged from 260 to 1890 ind. ha−1 , with a mean of 630 ind. ha−1  ± 87 (SE) ( Fig. 8 ) . In the streets of Ranchi, M. indica  contributed the highest density (29 ind. ha−1 ),  followed by A. auriculiformis  (16 ind. ha−1 ),  and S. robusta  (14 ind. ha−1 ),  while in Delhi, N. juliflora  (109 ind. ha−1 ) contributed the highest followed by P. pinnata  (83 ind. ha−1 ), P. roxburghi  (63 ind. ha−1 ),  and C. fistula  (57 ind. ha−1 ) ( Table 3  ) . Although the density of street trees in Ranchi is quite less compared to Delhi, it has comparatively higher street tree density than in Minas Gerais, Brazil (167 ind. ha−1 ) [82 ] and Chennai, India (104 ind. ha−1 ) [83 ]. The density of street trees in Delhi is comparable to the tree density in the tropical dry deciduous forest of Central India (520 ind. ha−1 ) [84 ] and protected forests of Gulmarg Wildlife Sanctuary, Jammu and Kashmir (185–810 ind. ha−1 ) [85 ]. The density of tree species varies among cities due to different urban land uses [86 ,87 ], desired benefits of trees, initiatives, management approaches, afforestation, and urban planning [88 ]. The variations in the density of street trees in both the studied cities as the urban planning and afforestation approach in Ranchi are limited to selective species for desired benefits of trees (i.e., ornamentation and shelterbelt) and some vegetation also faces anthropogenic pressure such as lopping, grazing, fuelwood collection, and unauthorized clearance of vegetation for urban sprawl, while in Delhi the allotment and displacement of vegetated areas have been influenced by city development patterns. Although there are more green areas near the city centre, there are differences in the number of parks and gardens throughout Delhi city [89 ]. Although there are significant differences in the tree density in both the cities, the total basal cover of street trees in Ranchi (20.67 m2 ha−1 ) and Delhi (21.70 m2 ha−1 ) were comparable due to the predominance of young and adult individuals (GBH ≥30–90 cm) in Ranchi, while in Delhi it is dominated by pole and young individuals (GBH ≥10–60 cm). However, it is quite less compared to urban forest patches of Puducherry (34.27 m2 ha−1 ) [71 ] and Bengaluru (46.67 m2 ha−1 ) [63 ]. The variations in basal cover at different sites are mainly due to differences in species composition, successional strategies, age of individuals, physicochemical properties of soil, climate, biogeography, and degree of disturbances [90 ]. The major contributors of basal cover at Ranchi were M. indica  (2.86 m2  ha−1 ), E. camaldulensis  (2.38 m2  ha−1 ), and S. robusta  (2.11 m2  ha−1 ), while N. juliflora  (4.92 m2  ha−1 ), P. pinnata  (3.08 m2  ha−1 ), and S.cumini  (1.29 m2  ha−1 ) were the major contributors at Delhi. Significant contrasts in species richness, diversity, density, and basal cover of street trees between Ranchi and Delhi clearly show that local legacy movements, socio-demographic aspirations, and environmental contexts affect the future trajectory of urban forests [91 ]. Based on the research findings, it can be recommended that native tree species like S. robusta  (17.12), Bridelia retusa  (L.) A. Juss. (12.26), Ficus benghalensis  L.rtr (9.41), Syzygium cumini  (L.) Skeels (9.32), and Artocarpus heterophyllus  Lam. (8.63) with the highest IVI values (>8.00) may be planted along streets of Ranchi city for development of UGSs, while along the streets of Delhi, P. pinnata  (34.29), Cassia fistula  L. (20.17), P. roxburghi  (18.03), S. cumini  (10.26), and Holoptelea integrifolia  (Roxb.) (5.01) may be planted as they have the highest IVI values (>5.00). The present study showed maximum species richness in frequency class A˃B > C > D > E in both cities according to Raunkiaer's frequency distribution ( Fig. 4  )  signifying that the plant community at both the cities were heterogeneous. Most of the street trees at Ranchi (80%) and Delhi (49%) had shown low frequency belonging to Raunkiaer's frequency class A, followed by B (16% and (9%), C (12% and 2%), D (2% and 1%), and E (1% and 0%). On the other hand, the percentage of species in various rarity classes at Ranchi had shown a high percentage of very rare species (36.9%), followed by rare species (35.1%), common species (25.2%), and dominant species (1.8%). Whereas, the highest percentage of rare species (54.4%) were documented at Delhi, followed by very rare species (24.6%), common species (14%), and dominant species (7%) (Fig. 5  ). Some of the very rare species documented in Ranchi were Adenanthera pavonina  L., Albizia chinensis  (Osbeck) Merr., and Breynia vitis-idaea  (Burm.f.) C.E.C.Fisch., while Ailanthus excelsa  Roxb., Casuarina equisetifolia  L., and Cryptostegia grandiflora  Roxb. ex R.Br. were some of the very rare species documented in Delhi. The rare species have keystone and functional roles to contribute towards ecosystem recovery and community stability [92 ], therefore the presence of rare species in both the studied cities is likely to reduce perturbations on common species and increase resilience potential to recover any ecological disturbances.  3.3 Alpha (α) and Beta (β) diversity of street trees Alpha (α) diversity of the street trees of the studied cities were determined using various ecological indices as summarized in Table 1.3 . The present study reported a very high species diversity index (H′) in both Ranchi (3.98) and Delhi (3.47) which lies in the range (0.83 to 4.10) reported for various tropical forests of the Indian subcontinent [93 ]; [94 ] but comparatively higher than the other Indian cities including Bilaspur (3.32) [69 ], Puducherry (2.96) [71 ], Chennai (2.79) [79 ], Kamla Nehru Ridge, New Delhi (2.58) [95 ], and Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, New Delhi (2.10) [95 ,96 ] (Table 2 ). On the other hand, the species dominance index (CD) was quite low for both the cities 0.03 (Ranchi) and 0.05 (Delhi) and within the reported range (0.021 to 0.092) of Indian forests [97 ,98 ]. Similarly, Dmg, Dmn, Pielou's evenness, and ENS were higher in Delhi (14.2, 2.37, 0.85, and 54, respectively) compared to Ranchi (8.6, 1.83, 0.84, and 32, respectively) (Table 4  ) . There have been reported variations in various diversity and dominance indices in the street trees in both Indian and global cities due to the development history of cities, cultural variables, urban forestry needs, and local governance [99 ]. Ranchi is a newly developing city (after being declared as the capital city of Jharkhand on 15 November 2000), beyond its main urban centers majority of its land area is surrounded by agricultural land and adjacent villages. The streets and roads passing these semi-developed urban regions have reported high species diversity due to the presence of natural forests in peri-urban areas beyond the municipal boundary that allows easy exchange of species in the urban regions. Moreover, the practice of mimicking and adapting suitable species in residential and agricultural plots in and around the main city for miscellaneous uses by residents and farmers contributes to increased species diversity of the street tree community. New Delhi's Avenue plantation was designed by Lutyens and Herbert Baker; it resembles a garden, providing a soothing greenery to counter Delhi's semi-arid environment [100 ]. Town planners, foresters, and horticulturists selected thirteen evergreen and drought-resistant trees for avenue planting [101 ] including eight common Indian trees, such as S. cumini , Azadirachta indica  A.Juss., Terminalia arjuna  (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight & Arn., Ficus religiosa  L., and Tamarindus indica  L. and one imported species, the African sausage tree, Kigelia africana  (Lam.) Benth. [102 ]. The natural forests of Delhi are highly protected and due to positive management practices of authorities in the last two decades, the green cover of Delhi has increased significantly from 151 sq. km in 2001 to 342 sq. km in 2021, which indicates the improvement in the forest cover from 10.2% in 2001 to 23.06% in 2021 of the total geographical area of Delhi [103 ]. Beta (β) diversity of street trees of Ranchi and Delhi was determined by the Sorensen similarity index (SI), Jaccard similarity index (Cj), and Bray Curtis dissimilarity index as given in Table 1.3 . The similarity of street trees of Ranchi and Delhi is quite low in terms of all the β-diversity indices (SI = 38.75% and dissimilarity = 61.25%; Cj = 0.24 and dissimilarity = 0.76; BCij = 0.61 and similarity = 0.39) ( Table 5  ).  The high variations in the street tree composition in both cities were mainly due to the changes in climatic and edaphic factors, colonial history, pre-existing vegetation, ecological disturbances, cultural drivers, city tiers, governance, and monetary budgets [99 ].  3.4 Population structure and regeneration status of street trees The present study recorded the maximum number of species at the adult stage (GBH: ≥10 cm) in both Ranchi (96 spp.) and Delhi (64 spp.) followed by saplings (41 spp. in Ranchi and 22 spp. in Delhi), and seedlings (18 spp. in Ranchi and 12 spp. in Delhi). The GBH of trees in Ranchi ranged from 10 to 1007 cm with a mean GBH of 88.17 cm ± 1.60 (SE), while in Delhi it ranged from 10 to 323 cm with a mean GBH of 54.40 cm ± 1.13 (SE). In the streets of Ranchi, F. benghalensis  had the highest GBH (1007 cm), while T. arjuna  (323 cm) in Delhi. The highest percentage of individuals in Ranchi (29%) were contributed by young trees (GBH: >30–60 cm), followed by adult (GBH: >60–90 cm) (24%), old (GBH: ˃120 cm) (21%), mature (GBH: >90–120 cm) (14%), and pole (GBH: ≥10–30 cm) (13%), whereas in Delhi dominant individuals were poles (GBH: ≥10–30 cm) (32.7%) followed by young (GBH: >30–60 cm) (31.3%), adult (GBH: >60–90 cm) (21.6%), mature (GBH: >90–120 cm) (9.2%), and old (GBH: ˃120 cm) (5.2%). The population structure of street trees in both the studied cities varies due to different geographic and climatic conditions, species selection, age of trees, and management approaches [74 ]. The predominance of adult trees in Ranchi and poles in Delhi indicates that the street tree community in both the studied cities have a high potential for carbon sequestration for a longer duration [104 ]. Proper management of these street trees can be an economical and ecosystem-based approach to mitigate micro-climatic changes in an urban landscape [105 ]. The study of the overall status of seedling, sapling, and adult trees in a region is used to determine the regeneration potential of existing tree species which gives an idea about the future composition of forest communities [106 ]. Out of the total tree species in Ranchi (96) and Delhi (64), the maximum species have shown no regeneration in Ranchi (62.5%) and Delhi (57.38%), followed by fair regeneration in Ranchi (19.79%) and Delhi (22.95%), good regeneration in Ranchi (17.71%) and Delhi (11.48%), while absence of poor and new regeneration in Ranchi (0.00%). On the other hand, 8.20% of species have shown poor regeneration and 1.64% are new (Balanites roxburghii  Planch.) in the street tree communities of Delhi ( Fig. 6  ) . Among both studied cities, the overall regeneration status is quite concerning as the majority of the street trees had been found only in the adult stage without any seedlings and saplings (no regeneration) (Table 6  ). The species with poor and no regeneration status may disappear from the particular city soon as a result of poor management of urban trees, human interference, and other biotic and edaphic factors [107 ]. It is recommended that re-greening and creating diverse tracts of native trees in urban niches should be increased for positive aspects and protections against environmental degradation [108 ].     4 Conclusions The present study exhibited varied diversity and richness of tree species in two different cities (urban habitats) ranging from 64 to 96 spp. due to geography, anthropogenic disturbances, habitat modification, management strategies, and policy implications. The study also showed that the frequency of occurrences and predominance of very rare species decreased with increasing species richness. The majority of the species at Ranchi (62.50%) and Delhi (57.38%) have shown no regeneration, which is a matter of concern as it indicates that species may disappear soon. The ground vegetation is usually cleared from time to time by the city management to encourage the growth of a specific group of plants, especially the ornamental species may be one of the major causes of the no regeneration of the majority of tree species in both cities. It is recommended that planting a ratio of trees, re-greening, and creating diverse tracts of native trees in urban niches should be adopted to counter artificial urban land. The difference in tree dynamics gives insight into the future prediction of critical ecosystem services, environmental constraints, climate challenges, sustainability, and social investment in public health care. Development of new policies through research and evaluation of environmental conditions, local socio-political history, the bioregional context of urban forestry practices, and future goals is necessary for a sustainable urban landscape with street trees. The study of urban tree dynamics is crucial for the conservation and management of urban biodiversity, sustainability, and various ecosystem services in terms of clean air, aesthetics, and climate control. The present study will enlighten the state of urban tree communities in Indian cities and serve as baseline information to carry out research, innovations, sustainable development, planning, and policy for the conservation and management of urban biodiversity to counter the effects of urbanization, environmental degradation, and climate change. It is suggested that residential areas, commercial complexes, and government premises should own at least 10% of the total land area for development of green spaces with special emphasis on native plant species.
