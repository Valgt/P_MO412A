                  There is no doubt about the importance of plastic in modern society. It has revolutionized our daily lives and several industrial sectors. It is widely present in our lives, from the beginning to the end, due to its practicality, convenience, and safety. Given its importance, it plays an essential role to target the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that sets out the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A critical overview of the role of plastic concerning the SDGs, discussing its pros and cons, is provided in this paper, and a future scenario is tried to be outlined, based on a bibliometric mapping and analysis and the recent literature.

It has revolutionized our daily lives and several industrial sectors. It is widely present in our lives, from the beginning to the end, due to its practicality, convenience, and safety. Given its importance, it plays an essential role to target the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that sets out the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A critical overview of the role of plastic concerning the SDGs, discussing its pros and cons, is provided in this paper, and a future scenario is tried to be outlined, based on a bibliometric mapping and analysis and the recent literature.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Plastic  Sustainable development goals  SDGs  Environmental problems  Bibliometric mapping  Bibliometric analysis    1 Introduction Plastic has evolved along with society. Many of the advances in several sectors are due to plastic. It has revolutionized our daily lives, bringing greater practicality, convenience, and safety to tasks that have now become simple thanks to the application of different types of plastic materials. Plastic is a polymeric material, its technical name, as are rubbers. Synthetic or natural plastics are chemical compounds of high molar mass formed, basically, by long carbon chains (Callister, 2016 ). In addition to having stable chemical bonds, they often have additives in their formulation that further increase their stability, which results in many years (hundreds) for their natural decomposition to occur. Some of their main characteristics are the low cost (Balakrishnan and Sreekala, 2017 ), low density (lightweight (Francis et al., 2017 )), flexibility, durability (Callister, 2016 ), strength, user-friendly design, and fabrication capabilities (Balakrishnan and Sreekala, 2017 ). Recalling the past, even though in old films, it is possible to verify, clearly, the complete change in the population habits, accompanied by the evolution of the materials. In the past, the devices tended to be heavier and more robust, made of, in general, glass, wood, or metals, with a useful life that surpassed generations. The literature demonstrates the increased use of plastics. In China, the use of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) increased dramatically from 1 ​kg/capita in 1978 to 46 ​kg/capita in 2017 (Jiang et al., 2020 ). However, the speed of changing society's habits and the durability of the plastics were quite different. So, the entire benefit of the application of plastic combined with changes in habits began to generate serious problems, such as the increase in waste accumulation. Public policies aimed at controlling the problem were created worldwide, with different levels of engagement, including awareness of the population regarding the consumption and disposal of post-used plastic. Such residues, when inadequately disposed of, cause or aggravate environmental problems, which harm the population's health, being considered socio-environmental problems. Concern for sustainable development is not a recent issue. Its concept arose in 1972 as part of the United Nations Conference (Stockholm) (Mata-Lima et al., 2016 ). The term sustainable development was defined in the document resulting from the Brundtland Commission, entitled Our common future  (“Our common future,” 1987 ), as the capacity of humanity to develop, ensuring present needs, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. So, technology and society must progress together to economic development, without harming the environment. Thus, the three elements forming the pillars of sustainability (or sustainability tripod) are environment, economy, and human development. Sustainable development is only achieved if the three criteria are met and are in balance (Daly, 1991 ). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was discussed in 2015 ​at the Rio+20 Conference, with the participation of world leaders and international non-governmental organizations. It lists rising inequalities, natural resource depletion, environmental degradation, and climate change among the greatest challenges of our time (“SDG 6 Synthesis Report, 2018 on Water and Sanitation Archives | UN-Water,” 2018 ). The member States, since then, have been committed to working tirelessly for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Thus, an action plan containing 17 main goals was established, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), mainly aimed at eradicating poverty (Dias, 2015 ). The SDGs are as follows (“#Envision 2030: 17 goals to transform the world for persons with disabilities | United Nations,” n.d. ): no poverty (SDG1); zero hunger (SDG2); good health and well-being (SDG3); quality education (SDG4); gender equality (SDG5); clean water and sanitation (SDG6); affordable and clean energy (SDG7); decent work and economic growth (SDG8); industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG9); reduced inequality (SDG10); sustainable cities and communities (SDG11); responsible consumption and production (SDG12); climate action (SDG13); life below water (SDG14); life on land (SDG15); peace and justice strong institutions (SDG16); and partnerships to achieve the goal (SDG17). Bibliometric study provides a holistic view of several aspects related to a given subject/area of knowledge. Through the in-depth analysis of the obtained results, it presents the current scenario about the available literature and helps to outline its future. This is an area of the library sciences (Bonilla et al., 2015 ) and has two main approaches: performance analysis and the mapping of scientific production (Noyons et al., 1999 ). The performance analyzes scientific production by analyzing all the data from the publications (authors, affiliations, etc.) from a quantitative point of view, whereas bibliometric mapping analyzes the connections obtained from the data organized in networks (Montalván-Burbano et al., 2020 ). Different areas of knowledge take advantage of it, such as informatics (Goksu, 2020 ), education (Yilmaz et al., 2019 ), sports (Liu and Avello, 2020 ), management of plastic waste (de Sousa, 2021 ), among others, demonstrating the importance of the tool, widely used for eclectic purposes. Thinking about the relevance of plastic and the 17 SDGs to a more sustainable world, the role of plastic in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is discussed in the present work, according to the literature point of view. A bibliometric mapping and analysis were performed, being important to outline a panorama of plastic in the current society and the future scenario.  2 Methods 2.1 Review methodology A Scopus search was conducted to obtain the bibliographic data inputs on December 15, 2020, by using the keywords (“sustainable development goal∗” OR “SDG∗”) AND (“plastic∗” OR “polymer∗”). Reviews and articles were considered (in English). From Scopus, a scopus.csv and a scopus.bib files containing the data were taken, and a bibliometric mapping and analysis using the Bibliometrix (an R-package) and VOSviewer version 1.6.15 software programs were performed. All the h-index values were calculated by Bibliometrix. VOSviewer is a software tool for creating maps based on network data, and for visualizing and exploring them. Institutions (affiliations), co-authors, countries, citation, and keywords are some of the aspects which can be emphasized. A unified approach to both mapping and clustering is used by the software, and it is based on the normalized term co-occurrence matrix and a similarity measure that calculates association strength between terms (van Eck and Waltman, 2019 ). A set of tools for quantitative research in bibliometrics and scientometrics is provided by bibliometrix. It was developed in the statistical computing and graphic R language. It performs bibliometric analysis and data matrices for co-citation, coupling, scientific collaboration analysis, and co-word analysis can be built (“Bibliometrix R Package,” 2016 ).   3 Results 3.1 Bibliometric mapping and analysis The Scopus search for (“sustainable development goal∗” OR “SDG∗”) AND (“plastic∗” OR “polymer∗”) resulted in 207 documents, being 179 articles and 28 reviews, all of them published from 1982. The evolution of publications over the years is shown in Fig. 1  a. The subject area of the publications is presented in Fig. 1 b. Concerning the number of publications over the years, a small number was observed until 2015. From this year on, the year in which the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was discussed at the Rio+20 Conference, a significant increase in the number of publications is observed, demonstrating the timeliness of the subject (Fig. 1 a). Fig. 1 b spotlights the interdisciplinary of the subject, with a greater number of publications in the biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology area. However, this area presents some specific terms similar to “SDG∗” (but with a completely different meaning) that are not related to the 2030 Agenda, so the publications from this area were excluded, resulting in 90 publications. Even knowing that the publications from these areas were removed from the bibliometric mapping and analysis, some publications out of the scope of this work may have remained. So, the number of available publications discussing the role of plastic concerning the SDGs can be even smaller. It is interesting to be noticed that in another search via Scopus using only the terms (“sustainable development goal∗”), 8125 documents were observed (articles and reviews), from 1990 to 2021. When the terms (“plastic∗” OR “polymer∗”) were added, the number of publications found is much smaller, which demonstrates that the literature is still restricted. For analysis using RStudio and VOSviewer software programs, it was analyzed the publications from 2010 to 2020 (from the 90 publications discussed before), resulting in 73 documents analyzed, being 64 articles and 9 reviews. From this point on, the results of the bibliometric mapping and analysis will be presented and discussed. The main information about the data is presented in Table 1  . The results presented in the Table depict that the issue is very recent. However, the available literature is still limited. The number of publications is almost the same as the number of journals, which demonstrates the interdisciplinarity of the subject. Additionally, the vast number of available journals indicates that the subject has great interest to the literature. Some aspects described in Table 1  such as document content, authors, and collaborations will be discussed throughout the present work. To facilitate the discussion of the obtained results, they were separated into the following sections: Sources; authors, affiliations and countries; publications; and keywords. 3.1.1 Sources Fig. 2   presents the most five relevant sources (top 5), according to the number of publications and h-index of each source. Even being the most relevant journals of the area, the number of publications of each journal is not high, since there are a large number of other specialized journals. These journals are peer-reviewed, and the results demonstrate their high quality, as well as the authors' confidence in publishing their works in these journals. Also, they have high values of CiteScore and impact factors, demonstrating their recognition. All the other 62 journals have one publication each. When the relevance of the sources according to the number of citations is analyzed, the scenario seems to be changed (Fig. 3  ). It is important to be mentioned that, in this case, the size of the letters has no meaning. The journals with the highest number of citations are the ones from the environmental science area, being the most relevant the journals Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Journal of Environmental Management, Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management, and Environmental Chemistry Letters. Other relevant journals from different areas are Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering (mechanics and earthquake engineering), Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases (pathology, epidemiology, prevention, treatment, and control of the neglected tropical diseases), and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (biological, physical, and social sciences).  3.1.2 Authors, affiliations, and countries From the 377 authors presented in Table 1 , the ones with the highest impact according to the h-index are García-Gil Á., García-Muñoz R.A., Marugán J., Mcguigan K.G., and Zhang Y., being that they presented an h-index of 2. The authors' studies discuss solar water disinfection (García-Gil et al., 2020a , 2020b ). The network of the authors with at least two publications is shown in Fig. 4  a, showing five clusters. Concerning the affiliations, the 10 most relevant are presented in Fig. 4 b, according to the number of publications. The affiliations with the highest number of publications are Isfahan University of Medical Sciences from Iran and Oxford University Clinical Research Unit from Vietnam with 10 publications each. The scientific production and citation of the countries and connections among them are shown in Fig. 5  . Fig. 5 a provides a general overview through the scale of shades of blue, in which the darkest blue in the chart represents the most productive, and the gray the countries with no publications. The 10 most productive countries are (the total number of publications is presented between parenthesis): China (48), the United Kingdom (35), India (28), Brazil (22), South Korea (22), the USA (21), Canada (17), Japan (17), Germany (15), and Italy (15). Fig. 5 b compares the most productive and the most cited countries, showing that Italy is the most cited country. In Fig. 5 c, the size of the letters and the circles indicate the number of publications (i.e., represent the collaboration of each country in the analyzed scenario), while the thickness of lines represents the percentage of the number of collaborations. Eight clusters are identified, and each one has a different color. The lesser the distances between the countries, the closer the relatedness among them. Lines represent the strongest co-occurrences. The 8 clusters are composed of the following countries: cluster 1 (Algeria, Belgium, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland), cluster 2 (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay), cluster 3 (Australia, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands), cluster 4 (Colombia, Nepal, Philippines, and the United Kingdom), cluster 5 (Ireland, Poland, and Spain), cluster 6 (Bangladesh, Kenya, and the United States), cluster 7 (China and Singapore), and cluster 8 (Indonesia and Malaysia). The results depict the greatest relationship among the clusters 6, 5, and 2. These 31 countries present the greatest total link strength among the 47 countries with at least one publication.  3.1.3 Publications Table 2   presents the 10 most relevant publications (top 10) concerning the total number LCS (local citation score) and the 2 more relevant according to the total number GCS (global citation score). LCS refers to the number of citations of publications in the local data set, i.e., refers to the documents resulted from the Scopus search. The higher the LCS, the more important the publication concerning the SDGs and plastic/polymer. On the other hand, GCS refers to the total number of citations of publications in the Scopus database, but the cited publications may be from different fields than SDGs and plastic/polymer. From the 73 articles and reviews analyzed, the most globally cited one is Sadhukan et al. (Sadhukhan et al., 2018 ), which has gained 41 citations and discusses the use of biomass in a sustainable manner to produce bio-products for a circular green economy. The second position is occupied by Karkey et al. (Karkey et al., 2016 ), which has 36 citations and discusses the fecal contamination in municipal Kathmandu drinking water. Concerning the LCS indicator, among the analyzed publications only 2 present LCS of one, and the others zero. The low number of publications may be due to the small number of publications analyzed, as well as the effective growth in the number of publications be recent (from 2015 on, as aforementioned). In the analyzed research field, Barra and González (Barra and González, 2018 ) is an important publication since it is part of both the top 10 GCS and the top 2 LCS. The authors discuss the sustainable chemistry challenges from a developing country perspective: Education, plastic pollution, and beyond. Ogbiye et al. (Ogbiye et al., 2018 ) analyze the impact of wastes administration and sustainable development in Nigeria, being a case study of Lugbe and Abuja, in northern Nigeria.  3.1.4 Keywords In this section, the authors' keywords from titles and index will be analyzed. The analysis of the keywords is essential to determine the research trend, identify gaps in the discussion on the role of plastic concerning the SDGs, and identify the fields that can be interesting as research areas (Secinaro et al., 2020 ). From the 323 authors' keywords, the most frequent ones are sustainable development goals and SDGs, life cycle assessment, sustainability, green chemistry, marine debris, microplastics, polymers, and waste management, depicting the main concerns related to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 SDGs. Fig. 6  a shows the evolution of the 5 most frequent authors' keywords over the years. Fig. 6 b presents the word cloud of the 50 most frequent authors' keywords present in titles of the analyzed publications. Fig. 6 c presents the co-occurrence of the 50 main index keywords, with the minimum number of occurrence of 2. Fig. 6 d shows the trend topics according to the authors' keywords present in titles of the analyzed publications, with a minimum frequency of 4. As aforementioned, all the keywords presented in Fig. 6  depict the main concerns related to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Concerning the keyword cloud, the word size represents its frequency, demonstrating the tendency of using the keywords SDGs, sustainability, plastic, waste, water, circular economy, among others. The five keywords with the highest frequency are as follows (frequency between parenthesis): water (10), sustainable (9), waste (8), plastic (7), and development (5). It seems that there is a clear relationship between the SDGs and sustainability with concerns related to plastic, waste, and water, i.e., the biggest and strongest words present in the cloud. In Fig. 6 c, the size of the letters and the frames show the number of occurrences, i.e., represent the most popular terms. Lines represent the strongest co-occurrences. Among the analyzed keywords, the difference between the sizes of the letters, frames, and lines is not so significant, which means that all the keywords have a proportional number of occurrences and co-occurrences. It can be observed three clusters, each one with a different color. It is interesting to take notice the keywords present in each cluster. The blue cluster means the words related to social, the green cluster the ones related to environmental, and the red cluster the ones related to the economic aspect, respecting the sustainability tripod. On the other hand, distances between the keywords mean relatedness in terms of co-occurrence links, i.e., closer keywords indicate closer relatedness among them. So, the keywords from the blue cluster are a little far from the keywords of the other clusters, showing a not straight connection. The green and red clusters seem to have a closer connection, especially the keywords sustainable development, environmental protection, plastic, recycling, waste management, marine pollution, and water. Another interesting aspect is the presence of the keyword biomass in the red cluster, which demonstrates the great potential of using biomass for the economy. Additionally, a proximity between the keywords recycling and environmental protection can be observed, showing that plastic recycling is essential to avoid environmental problems which plastic may cause. The green cluster seems to show a great concern regarding water quality (SDG6), which is essential to human health (SDG3) and, therefore, has great connection with the blue cluster (the social aspect of the sustainability tripod). Fig. 6 d represents the search trends based on the authors' keywords present in titles from 2017 to 2020. In 2017, the research topic focused on health (cancer), in 2018 on sustainability, in 2019 on the circular economy, and in 2020 on water, waste, and plastic. The findings show the concern about environmental problems that plastic may cause, especially in terms of water pollution, being a trend in current literature, and are in conformity with the word cloud (Fig. 6 b). To deepen the keywords analysis, cluster analysis was performed. This tool is based on the recurrence of concurrent rate of two keywords, using measurable strategies for disentangling the complex keyword association into a few relative groups (Ding, 2011 ). The conceptual structure map of the keywords according to the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) method is shown in Fig. 7  a. Fig. 7 b shows the dendrogram of hierarchical cluster analysis of the keywords concerning the role of plastic on SDGs. Fig. 7 c depicts the most cited documents in the field. In the MCA method, a two or three-dimensional graph are formed by the compression of large data with multiple variables. The plane distance spotlights the similarity between the keywords, and their importance is indicated by the keywords close to the center point (the attention that these keywords received in recent years) (Xie et al., 2020 ). Narrow themes are near to the edge. According to Fig. 7 a, two clusters can be observed. The red cluster contemplates the keywords from environmental and economic aspects of the sustainability tripod, and the blue one the keywords from the social aspect. As previously observed in Fig. 6 c, environmental and economic aspects of the sustainability tripod seem to have a strongest relatedness, since these keywords are part of the same cluster (red). In the red cluster, the keywords closer to the center point are sustainable development goals, SDGs, sustainability, circular economy, life cycle assessment, marine debris, and plastic, showing that these are trend topics in the current literature. Conversely, waste management is on the edge (and far from the center point), showing that this research area is in the transition to other themes, even being part of the same cluster. The blue cluster is far from the center point of the red cluster, showing that the social aspect of the sustainability tripod seems to have a weak connection with environmental and economic aspects, as earlier observed in the analysis of Fig. 6 c. The dendrogram is a kind of presentation of the keywords clusters according to the thematic similarity. It represents the association between the research areas (Tran et al., 2019 ). Regarding the role of plastic concerning the SDGs, they are divided into two main strands, as previously discussed for cluster analysis. The blue strand is based on the social aspect of the sustainability tripod, whereas the red one is based on the environmental and economic aspects. Two dashed lines were drawn on the dendrogram to facilitate the analysis. The yellow line indicates connection among human, male, female (i.e., the social aspect of the sustainability tripod), microplastics, and sustainable development goals (SDGs) (even being part of different clusters in Fig. 7 a), while the dark gray line indicates the connection among chemistry, green chemistry, circular economy, and sustainability (these research areas have the same height (Tran et al., 2019 )). In this case, the aforementioned areas still have some connection with plastic. In contrast, waste management seems to have no clear connection with any other area, as also demonstrated through the analysis of the conceptual structure map of the keywords (Fig. 7 a). Concerning the literature, the most cited publications are Merli et al. (Merli et al., 2018 ), Masi et al. (Masi et al., 2018 ), van Leeuwen et al. (van Leeuwen et al., 2018 ), Sadhukhan et al. (Sadhukhan et al., 2018 ), and Furley et al. (Furley et al., 2018 ). These publications discuss aspects related to the circular economy and sustainability, and all of them are recent publications (2018–2020) close to the center point of the cluster, showing to be relevant in the recent literature. Regarding the most cited publications of the blue cluster, Biblimetrix did not provide results. However, limiting the results obtained by Scopus with the keywords human, male, and female were observed the most important publications of the cluster (according to Scopus), namely: Karkey et al. (Karkey et al., 2016 ), Furley et al. (Furley et al., 2018 ), van Leeuwen et al. (van Leeuwen et al., 2018 ), Meeks et al. (Meeks et al., 2015 ), and Stoler (Stoler, 2012 ). All of them discuss aspects related to the circular economy, recycling, fecal contamination, composting, relating them to the health and quality of life of the population. It is interesting to be noticed that some publications are relevant for both clusters (Furley et al., 2018 ; van Leeuwen et al., 2018 ). The main SDGs addressed in the Scopus search results are shown in Table 3  . Several publications address the role of plastic with more than one SDG, but no publication discusses the role of plastic with all SDGs. It is important to be noticed the participation and contribution of chemistry, especially green chemistry, in several of the aforementioned publications. From the analyzed documents, in the Scopus, it was observed some keywords such as “SDG3: Good health and well-being”, “SDG6: Clean water and sanitation”, “SD7: Affordable and clean energy”, “SDG9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure”, “SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities”, “SDG12: Responsible consumption and production”, and “SDG13: Climate action”. So, another Scopus search was performed in the same day by using the keywords (“sustainable development goal∗” OR “SDG∗”) AND (“plastic∗” OR “polymer∗”) AND (“SDG3” OR “SDG6” OR “SDG7” OR “SDG9” OR “SDG11” OR “SDG12” OR “SDG13”). The search found 75 documents from 2016 to 2020, 55 articles and 20 reviews, which will be briefly analyzed in the sequence. In this case, the exclusion of the publications from the genetics area was not necessary, since the search keywords were more restricted. However, some publications out of the scope of the present work may have remained, as aforementioned. Among the documents, around 99% of them are from the environmental area, which depicts a real concern. Regarding the journals, the titles are (the number of publications is between parenthesis): Chem (72), Frontiers in Marine Science (1), International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health (1), and Journal of Cleaner Production (1). The country with the highest number of publications is the USA (35), followed by China (32), Singapore (8), and Australia (7). Fig. 8   shows the evolution of the total number of publications and the number of publications containing each keyword mentioned before. The results show a clear trend towards the growth in the number of publications over the period. When analyzing the number of publications containing the different SDGs as keywords, the most evidenced growth of publications is related to the SDG3, SDG7, and SDG9. So, it is supposed to exist a higher connection among these SDGs and polymer, which will be evidenced in Fig. 9  . The result demonstrated a close link between the keyword polymers and the SDG3 (the biggest green circle), SDG7, and SDG9. As mentioned before, it can be observed the straight connection among the SDGs keywords and chemistry/materials area (this connection will be emphasized in the next sections), essential research areas responsible for the creation of new materials/devices used in the solution of environmental problems. Even the search result in the Scopus database not showing a clear connection among some SDGs and polymers/plastics, the material has great relevance in achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda, which will be demonstrated throughout the present study. The in-depth analysis of the keywords present in a group of publications brings very broad information about the subject, such as the evolution of the subject over the years and its future trend. This analysis will be performed in the final topic of this work. In conclusion, the results of the bibliometric mapping and analysis showed the relevance and timeliness of the issue. Plastic presents pros and cons in the achievement of the SDGs. Even though there are large numbers of countries and institutions focused on the research area, the literature presents a gap and a great opportunity for researchers around the world. In the following section, the role of plastic concerning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be discussed, according to the literature point of view.    4 The role of plastic concerning the sustainable development goals Plastic certainly has great relevance in several of the 17 SDGs. However, its use may also cause some problems. Its main pros and cons concerning some of the SDGs are presented in Table 4  , according to the point of view of current literature, and will be briefly addressed from this point on. It is important to keep in mind that the role of plastic concerning the SDGs does not end in the applications mentioned in the present work. The applications cover mainly published academic research and do not adequately cover industry developments, many of which are unpublished (confidential) or are published in trade (industry) magazines. The literature used was based on the results from the Scopus search and the recent literature in general, seeking to deepen the discussion. The discussion of the results present in the Table is divided into subsections, according to the role of plastic regarding each SDG. To avoid repetitions, some subsections discuss the role of plastic concerning more than one SDG. 4.1 SDGs 1, 5, 8, and 10 The plastic industry, whether in manufacturing or recycling, is a major producer of thousands of job opportunities, being essential against extreme poverty (SDG1). Employment also facilitates access to health care (SDG3), gender equality (SDG5) through women's empowerment in society, decent work and economic development (SDG8), and inequalities reduction (SDG10). According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (“Advancing sustainable materials management: 2017 fact sheet - United States Environmental Protection Agency,” 2019 ), “by using waste materials as valuable raw materials, recycling creates jobs, builds more competitive manufacturing industries and significantly contributes to the US economy”. The data from the most recent year available showed that, in 2007, recycling and reuse activities in the US accounted for 757,000 jobs, including recycling of plastic (“Recycling economic information (REI) report - United States Environmental Protection Agency,” 2020 ). In Brazil, the estimate of the National Movement of Waste Pickers of Recyclable Materials (MNCR) is that there are about 800,000 waste pickers in the country, about 70% consisting of females. Waste pickers are responsible for collecting 90% of everything that is recycled today in Brazil (“Quantos catadores existem em atividade no Brasil? — MNCR - Movimento Nacional dos Catadores de Materiais Recicláveis,” 2020 ). According to the 2018 Size & Impact Report (“Jobs in U.S. plastics industry increase according to 2018 size and impact report | Plastics Industry Association,” 2019 ), an annual publication of the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS), the estimated number of jobs from the plastic sector in the US is around 989,000. Employment does not only mean a source of income, but also a way of affirming its identity through individual attributions inserted by it in the accomplishment of the task (Dejours, 1999 ). Besides, it also means social integration, as it enables the relationship among people, social inclusion, and the feeling of belonging to a group (de Medeiros and Macêdo, 2006 ). In the case of waste pickers, literature has shown that, for many workers, it is the only way of guaranteeing survival and inclusion in the excluding market (de Medeiros and Macêdo, 2006 ). Thus, there is no doubt about the importance of recycling in the generation of employment and income. There is still much to be improved in the industry. In the case of waste pickers, very common in underdeveloped or developing countries, the fact of having some kind of income does not necessarily mean social inclusion. They suffer prejudice, have low recognition of the role they play in the economy and the environment, and their activities are generally performed under precarious conditions (de Medeiros and Macêdo, 2006 ). Work cooperatives are configured in organizational structures that can enable social inclusion to them. Thinking about the companies that generate jobs, so that they can truly contribute to the 17 goals, they need to be eco-efficient. Eco-efficiency is a key concept that can help companies become more sustainable. The seven elements for eco-efficiency improvement are (“Measuring eco-efficiency a guide to reporting company performance - World business council for sustainable development,” 2000 ): Reduced material intensity (i); reduced energy intensity (ii); reduced dispersion of toxic substances (iii); enhanced recyclability (iv); maximized use of renewables (v); extended product life (vi); and increased service intensity (vii). Thus, eco-efficiency assumes that the economic and environmental performance of a system is improved and also integrates a set of actions aimed at a cleaner production, according to the key goals (Mata-Lima et al., 2016 ).  4.2 SDG2 Zero hunger and sustainable agriculture (SDG2) help to reduce malnutrition and increase health. According to Sadhukhan et al. (Sadhukhan et al., 2018 ), to enable resource-efficient agriculture to feed the world population that is expected to increase by 34% by 2050, an investment of $83 billion per year in developing countries agriculture is necessary up to 2050. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to promote sustainable agricultural practices, through support for family farming, equitable access to land, technology, and market. Agriculture is essential in food, nutritional, and medicinal terms, help in attaining other SDGs such as SDG1 and SDG3. Moreover, the cultivation of species in family and kitchen gardens is a great opportunity for empowering women and achieving gender equality (SDG5), reducing inequalities (SDG10), and promoting responsible consumption and production (SDG12) (Singh et al., 2020 ). Concerning agriculture, plastic plays an important role both in environmental and economic aspects, helping to increase productivity. Advances in plastic in the sector have been great, combined with technology and research. Some examples are: the use of biodegradable plastics for several purposes (Agarwal, 2020 ; Milani et al., 2017 ): as support for seedlings (protects the roots against possible damage) and in agricultural mulch films (Bandopadhyay et al., 2018 ; Kijchavengkul et al., 2010 ); protective screens for greenhouses and certain types of plantations (protects the plant against the action of wind, rain, and sun, increasing the productivity); the use of plastics in controlled delivery systems (for agrochemicals such as fertilizers for example), including the use of cellulose and cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to encapsulate nutrients used to the slow and controlled release of nutrients, and decrease the environmental impacts caused by traditional fertilization (França et al., 2021 ), and as superabsorbents (keep the soil humidity for longer periods) (Milani et al., 2017 ); and the use of intelligent irrigation systems, as is the case of drip irrigation (using the necessary amount of water), carried out from the implantation of plastic pipes. Plastic has also been commonly used as sorbent materials of toxic elements arising from agrochemicals and heavy metals as a way to decontaminate water and soils (Airoldi, 2008 ; Milani et al., 2017 ), and as a remediator for toxic materials (J. Zhang et al., 2019a ). All examples cited increase productivity, reduce cost by reducing losses, and avoid/reduce ecological damages and/or environmental problems. Also, innovative agronomic practices can improve soil quality and microbial activity (Singh et al., 2020 ). Regarding the use of superabsorbents and intelligent irrigation systems, they have ultimate importance in the reduction of water amount used in agriculture. It is known that agriculture is the greatest water consumer, accounting for nearly 70% of all withdrawals worldwide and up to 90% in some arid countries (“SDG 6 Synthesis Report, 2018 on Water and Sanitation Archives | UN-Water,” 2018 ). Reducing the use of water in agriculture can meaningfully ease the water stress in other important segments. Oppositely, literature points out that mulch films are a key source in the production of plastic microparticles (microplastics - MPs) in the soil (Y. Zhou et al., 2020b ). In the agricultural soils, major causes of MPs pollution include the application of biosolids and compost, wastewater irrigation, mulching film, polymer-based fertilizers and pesticides, and atmospheric deposition, being the fate and dispersion of MPs mainly associated with the soil characteristics, cultivation practices, and diversity of soil biota (Kumar et al., 2020 ). According to Ridzuan et al. (Ridzuan et al., 2020 ), CO2  emissions may increase in crop production, due to the increased use of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as irrigation and farm mechanization. So, to mitigate climate change in agriculture, it is necessary to adopt cleaner processes, such as the use of renewable energy to operate agricultural tools and some types of machinery, replacing the use of fossil-fuel energy and causing minimal impact on the environment (SDGs 11 and 13).  4.3 SDG3 Regarding the SDG3, there is no doubt about the evolution of medicine due to the adoption of plastic devices, such as single-use (disposable) devices in which sterilization is unnecessary, for instance in the case of disposable syringes. Fig. 9  previously depicted the close link between the keyword polymers and the SDG3. There are a large number of applications of different types of plastics found in the daily life of people who have a certain disease and are undergoing treatment, as nebulizers used for lung problems; different types of pens to inject medicine against diabetes, multiple sclerosis, severe allergic reactions, obesity, female infertility; pens to inject anticoagulants; in the medicine packages, among many others. Fig. 10   shows, as an example, an injectable solution applicator pen for immunosuppressive drugs against different types of arthritis, spondylitis, and colitis. During the application, two clicks are heard, the first indicating that the needle was inserted into the skin and the application started, while the second indicates that the application has finished and that the needle has been retracted into the applicator pen. These types of pens have several advantages: protection to the medicine; greater safety and ease in the application; reduction of the possibility of contamination and waste; they are portable, discreet, and convenient for out-of-home applications (especially in the case of insulin); save time; no need for refrigeration depending on the medicine; more accuracy in dosing definition (especially in the case of high-value medicine and that can cause serious adverse reactions). Some other cutting edge applications of polymers in the achievement of SDG3 are in chemiluminescence imaging (Lu et al., 2020 ) and polymeric micelles (J. Tan et al., 2019a ) for tumor therapy; use of polymers in targeted therapeutics such as drug delivery for cancer (nanomedicine) (Fu et al., 2018 ; Liu and Thayumanavan, 2019 ); tissue engineering (Fu et al., 2018 ); prosthesis (Hahladakis et al., 2018 ); among many others. In hospitals, there are several examples of plastic application devices such as syringes, tubes, oropharyngeal cannulas, suction and urinary probes, catheters, blood pouches, packaging of saline solutions, and medicines, among many others, being all of them of equal importance to save lives. In special, during the COVID-19 pandemic confronted nowadays, beyond the known plastic devices commonly used in hospitals, especially in intensive care unit (ICU) for vital and organic support of high complexity, various modalities of monitoring of body functions essential for life are respirators, heart and blood pressure monitors, oximeters, and thermometers; flow meters, controllers and sensors for saline solutions, medicines and food; hemodialysis machines; and other no less important examples such as COVID-19 tests, diapers, and personal protective equipment (PPE), being the role of plastic even more prominent. Still, in alcohols in gel, largely used during the pandemic, a polymer is present as a thickening agent. PPEs, such as face masks, are considered items of mandatory use worldwide, essential to avoid cross-contamination (de Sousa, 2020 ). Still, bodies usually receive at least one layer of protection, being a waterproof bag suitable to prevent leakage of liquids and secretions made of plastic (de Sousa, 2020 ). Nevertheless, unfortunately, large numbers of post-used PPEs are found in waters due to the disposal in inappropriate places (Kalina and Tilley, 2020 ). Also, plastic packages are essential to avoid contamination since they can be cleaned and washed. Concerning SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus which causes COVID-19, Van Doremalen et al. (van Doremalen et al., 2020 ) analyzed its stability on different surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic (PP) and stainless steel, being the viable virus detected up to 72 ​h after application on these surfaces. So that plastic packaging can create a protective barrier on food, and it must be sanitized when arriving at home. Chin et al. (Chin et al., 2020 ) tested the virucidal effects of disinfectants, including the ones often used at homes such as household bleach, hand soap solution, and ethanol (70%). According to the results, no infectious virus could be detected after a 5-min incubation at 22 ​°C, except for a 5-min incubation with hand soap. The packaging sector accounts for about 40% of the consumption of all plastic material produced on the planet (“Plastics - The facts 2019,” 2020 ). Furthermore, the total production of plastics is responsible for 6% of the world's oil consumption (Rivera et al., 2019 ). The most used plastics in packaging production are polyethylenes (low-density - LDPE and high-density - HDPE), PP, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and PS. Unfortunately, most packages are discarded shortly after use, and it is possible to admit that the packaging sector is responsible for the most significant portion of the environmental impact (Magrini et al., 2012 ). In China, for instance, most of the waste plastics come from packaging (Jiang et al., 2020 ). Around 17% of the total consumption is composed of the medical sector, appliances, mechanical engineering, and furniture (“Plastics - The facts 2019,” 2020 ). For instance, many of the disposable masks, aprons, protectors, and disposable syringes are made of PP. However, a negative aspect of plastic was presented by Enbiale et al. (Enbiale et al., 2020 ). According to the authors, several patients presented a dermatology clinic with skin depigmentation after wearing plastic shoes in Ethiopia, called shoe-contact vitiligo. Shoes made of PVC are a cheap option to solve a health problem known as elephantiasis (also known as podoconiosis) which often affects barefooted farmers. The skin depigmentation occurred in areas which had direct contact with the plastic material, in which the symptoms began soon after wearing these shoes. The problem could be caused by heavy metals, and/or specific chemicals such as monobenzylether of hydroquinone (MBH), alkyl phenols, and catechols used in the manufacturing of PVC. Other authors found similar results in India (Bajaj et al., 2010 ; Ghosh, 2010 ). Another fragile point of plastic is the migration of additives during its use, disposal, and recycling. Migration is a diffusion process controlled by kinetic and thermodynamic, being diffusion the mass transfer due to random movement of molecules from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration (Cai et al., 2014 ). Additives are chemical compounds added to plastics to improve their performance, functionality, and aging properties, being examples of additives the plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, acid scavengers, light and heat stabilizers, lubricants, pigments, antistatic agents, slip compounds, and thermal stabilizers (Hahladakis et al., 2018 ). For instance, they are widely used for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their lifetime. The potential of these additives to contaminate soil, air, water, and food is described in literature (Hahladakis et al., 2018 ; Raha et al., 2021 ). Conversely, the migration of additives is not always undesirable. The controlled release of some drugs from their plastic matrix to provide the precise desirable dosage to the patients (Hahladakis et al., 2018 ) is an example. An instance of this application is in the adhesives for pain relief and inflammation and is, therefore, considered another benefit of using plastic for health, i.e., good health and well-being (SDG3). The problem is when the migration is undesirable, such as from a package to food. Literature has a plethora of works dealing with the migration of different polymer types from the plastic product (packages, for instance) to the medium in contact with this product (Cai et al., 2014 ; Dopico-García et al., 2003 ; Fankhauser-Noti and Grob, 2006 ; Goulas et al., 2007 ; Petersen et al., 1997 , 1995 ; Sanches Silva et al., 2007 ; Tawfik and Huyghebaert, 1998 ; Whitt et al., 2016 ; Xu et al., 2010 ), all of them proving the migration. Especially at homes, this kind of migration can be improved by temperature increase of the container, e.g., when preparing food in a microwave oven, since diffusion rate is a function of only temperature, not affected by concentration (Cai et al., 2014 ). Some additives are toxic and, thus, harmful to human health, such as bisphenol A (BPA) that is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (Friques, 2019 ). BPA is a monomer used in the manufacture of epoxy resins for internal food can linings (Goodson et al., 2004 ) and polycarbonate products such as plastic baby bottles, baby bottle liners, and reusable drinking bottles, being its release proven by literature (Friques, 2019 ; Goodson et al., 2004 ; Kubwabo et al., 2009 ). Vandenberg et al. (Vandenberg et al., 2012 ) discuss the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals and, according to them, they can be dangerous to human health even at low doses. Literature has shown that BPA can be transferred through the placenta and be accumulated in the intestine and liver of the fetus of rodents (Javurek et al., 2016 ). Friques (Friques, 2019 ) deeply analyzed the effects of BPA on human health. BPA resembles human estrogen in the form of action, managing to mimic or even block estrogenic effects in the body. Thus, different types of health damage can occur, depending on the levels of contamination, from cancer to development problems in the formation of sexual organs of babies and children, since BPA can be transferred from the mother to the fetus or through breast milk. The critical period of exposure to BPA, which comprises the state of greatest vulnerability, ranges from about 90 days before the preconception of spermatozoa, remains throughout the intrauterine period, and goes until the first two years of the child. Therefore, the use of BPA is not allowed in bottles and sippy cups by the Food and Drugs Administration since 2012 (“Bisphenol A (BPA): Use in food contact application | FDA,” 2018 ). Additionally, not only BPA can be released into food, but also caprolactam, ε-caprolactam, oligomers from different types of plastic, among many others, being that all of them may cause problems to human health.  4.4 SDGs 4 and 11 Ensuring quality education at all stages of life for all (SDG4), environmental education must be an integral part of it. Essential for the citizen to actively fulfill their role in the society, among the aspects addressed by environmental education are the correct management of waste, information on selective collection and recycling, and environmental problems caused or aggravated when the waste is inadequately disposed of in the environment, as the case of plastic. The subject will be addressed in greater depth in the sequence. Environmental education also contributes to the SDG11, obtaining sustainable cities and communities through the correct management of waste. Since plastics can melt when heated and solidify when cooled, they can be recycled. To facilitate the separation, the standard on recyclable plastic ISO 11469:2000 presents the symbology and identification for the recycling of plastic packaging. The symbol used is the global symbol of recycling, represented by a triangle formed by 3 arrows clockwise. Within the recycling symbol, there are some numbers, from 1 to 7, each one specifying a type of plastic material, namely: (1) PET; (2) HDPE; (3) PVC; (4) LDPE; (5) PP; (6) PS; and (7) others. Recycling contributes to the sustainable development, as it conserves natural resources such as oil (a non-renewable source), saves energy and water, and contributes to the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases (Fraga, 2014 ); generates economic development and greater social equity, since many workers have recycling as the main source of income for their families (de Sousa, 2016 ; de Sousa et al., 2017 ); it reduces soil, water, and air pollution; it reduces the production cost; and generates income (SDG1), aside from mitigates the greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the production of virgin raw materials, called CO2 equivalent (CO2e - aggregate of gases contributing to climate change) (“Anuário da reciclagem 2017–2018 - Associação nacional dos catadores e catadoras de materiais recicláveis,” 2019 ). Polymeric residues are considered renewable materials: “While traditional discussions of renewable feedstocks exclude the wastes, they are eminently renewable (they are being renewed whether we like it or not) and are available in much larger quantities than biomass” (Jessop et al., 2008 ). Then, within the possibilities, materials derived from plants and renewable biological sources or recycled should be used (Lenardão et al., 2003 ). Consequently, one of the principles of green chemistry is the incentive of using recycled materials for new applications. However, recycling of plastic is, generally, below the ideal around the globe. In 2018, an overview of plastic recycling worldwide was presented: the country that recycles the most is India (60%), and the one that recycles the least is the US (9%) (“Veolia UK Planet Magazine,” 2018 ). According to Hahladakis et al. (Hahladakis et al., 2018 ), “despite significant worldwide advances in management, treatment and recycling in the last three decades, the largest fraction of plastic waste still possibly ends up in dumpsites or is openly burned, emitting carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2 )". Ribeiro et al. (Ribeiro et al., 2014 ) measured the impacts of recycling on the productive structure of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2008, from the production of 33 cooperatives of waste pickers. The direct and indirect savings provided by plastic recycling were responsible for an amount of approximately R$5.3 million and R$10 million, respectively. 4511 tons of plastic were recycled, accounting for 67.93% of the resources saved. Almost 59,000 barrels of oil were saved. Furthermore, through recycling, public resources were saved concerning the collection and final disposal of waste. The recycling of plastics requires an amount of energy equivalent to about 10–15% of the energy needed for oil refining and resin manufacturing (Magrini et al., 2012 ).  4.5 SDG6 The supply of drinking water for all is at the heart of all the SDGs, since all forms of development are embedded in water resources. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that social development and economic prosperity depend on the sustainable management of freshwater resources and ecosystems, and it highlights the integrated nature of the SDGs (“SDG 6 Synthesis Report, 2018 on Water and Sanitation Archives | UN-Water,” 2018 ). Concerning SDG6, 844 million people use contaminated water sources or require more than 30 ​min to collect water (Aberilla et al., 2020 ). According to the United Nations (“SDG 6 Synthesis Report, 2018 on Water and Sanitation Archives | UN-Water,” 2018 ), in 2015, almost 900 million people had no access to safe drinking water. In this sense, plastic plays an important role in water and sewage treatment plants, being present mainly in equipment and pipes, thus helping to enable SDG6 to be achieved, that is, access to drinking water and sanitation. Plastic acts directly in the various stages of water treatment for the population, such as capture, impoundment, management, and distribution (Magrini et al., 2012 ). It also has great application in soil waterproofing blankets, avoiding the contamination of soil and groundwater. Plastic is also used to decontaminate water (Airoldi, 2008 ; Anirudhan and Radhakrishnan, 2007 ; Chen et al., 2018 ; Milani et al., 2017 ), through the use of selective membranes in water purification, recovery systems (also used in desalination systems), and energy recovery. Thus, plastic used in water treatment actively contributes to population health (SDG3). Some interesting examples are the use of plastic in devices for the application of solar water disinfection (SODIS) to inactivate viruses, bacteria, and protozoa (García-Gil et al., 2020a ); the use of magnetic polymer to remove emerging organic compound such as 1,2-aminoazophenylene (1,2-AAP) from municipal wastewaters (Ha et al., 2020 ); and the production of adsorbent materials from residues (Anirudhan and Radhakrishnan, 2007 ). According to the authors (García-Gil et al., 2020a ), SODIS is a simple, inexpensive, and sustainable household water treatment (HWT) that is appropriate for low-income countries or emergencies. Concerning the 1,2-AAP, it is largely used in antibiotics to treat a variety of bacterial infections; inhibition of copper corrosion; agricultural active contaminant in insecticides, herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides for regulating crop plant growth; among other applications (Ha et al., 2020 ). The formation of carcinogenic heavy metals (CHMs) such as nickel and cadmium are the result of the presence of microsized 1,2-AAP in aquatic environments. According to the authors (Ha et al., 2020 ), magnetite polymer activated carbon (AC) composite is considered a novel class of advanced adsorbent due to its efficient pore distribution, friendly-environmental impact, high surface area, active functional channels, and adsorbates which are easily separated from the adsorption system. Anirudhan and Radhakrishnan (Anirudhan and Radhakrishnan, 2007 ) prepared adsorbent materials from sawdust for the removal of Cr(III) from water and wastewaters, being an interesting example of revaluation of waste for the benefit of the SDG6. Aberilla et al. (Aberilla et al., 2020 ) investigated the life cycle environmental impacts of different water supply options applicable to remote communities of developing countries from Southeast Asia-Pacific such as locally-sourced groundwater, surface water, desalinated seawater, and externally-sourced bottled water. From the analyzed options, the bottled water is the one with the highest impacts, being 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than the local groundwater or surface water main hotspots. Concerning bottled water, the impacts are reduced when bottle recycling is considered. Surface water is environmentally the most sustainable alternative. Regarding desalinization, all the environmental impacts are significantly reduced when solar power is considered. Peletz et al. (Peletz et al., 2019 ) analyzed the use of plastic latrine slabs in the promotion of improved sanitation in rural and low-income settings, as a way to help the achievement of the SDG6. The commercial viability of using these plastic latrine slabs in rural Kenya was analyzed. The results showed that the current household demand for the plastic latrine slabs is very low to support the commercial distribution, and further efforts are required to align the price of plastic latrine slabs with the consumer demand in this setting. This is an essential issue to achieve the SDG3, since many diseases such as diarrhea, helminth infection, and other infectious are linked to poor sanitation, as well as environmental enteric dysfunction and child growth complications (Lin et al., 2013 ; Mara et al., 2010 ; Prüss-Ustün et al., 2014 ; Spears et al., 2013 ). Additionally, an important example is the progressive replacement of conventional materials, such as asbestos, of mineral origin and an adequate set of physicochemical properties, which was widely used in the production of reservoirs and pipes, and which is currently considered a carcinogenic substance by the World Health Organization (WHO). Besides, the exchange of metal pipes for other plastic options such as PVC and PE in urban supply networks results in higher water quality, reducing energy and chemical use, and reducing maintenance costs (Magrini et al., 2012 ).  4.6 SDG7 About obtaining affordable and clean energy (SDG7), plastic also has a great contribution. It is important to remember that all the available electrical and electronic wires are covered with some kind of insulating plastic (Magrini et al., 2012 ). As examples, plastic rotor blade of a wind turbine and thin-film photovoltaic units, where non-silicon semiconductors (metal or organic) are printed on plastic films (Pilz et al., 2010 ); photocatalyst for solar energy conversion (Bae et al., 2016 ), such as polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) (Wang et al., 2019a, b ); organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) (J. Yang et al., 2018a ); low cost and high-security batteries (such as solvent-free polymer electrolytes - SPEs, gel polymer electrolytes - GPEs, composite polymer electrolytes - CPEs, and organic sodium-ion batteries - OSIBs) (Bin et al., 2020 ; Lu et al., 2018 ; Tang et al., 2018 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2019 ; J. Zhou et al., 2020a ); photo-initiated ion transport on the nanoscale to be used in energy conversion, neuron triggering, and biomimetic processes, among other examples (Sanborn et al., 2019 ). Moreover, conductive plastics have been used for the generation and transport of energy. In the case of solar energy, most structures made of plastic require less maintenance compared to other materials (Magrini et al., 2012 ). The use of clean and renewable energy contributes to the environment and population health (SDG3).  4.7 SDG9 Industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG9), mainly in terms of fostering novelty, have advanced in the plastic sector worldwide. Industrial and technological advances are closely related to sustainable development, resulting in the search for processes that require smaller amounts of energy and, consequently, that are cheaper and that have less impact on the environment. Given this, the energy saving in the current world is directly related to the oil economy and lower greenhouse gas emissions (Magrini et al., 2012 ). Environmentally-friendly, green, and sustainable plastics, produced from industrial waste; biomaterials from bacterial polymers (Dura et al., 2020 ); biomass-derived monomers for production of green plastics as sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based polymers such as vegetable oils, lactide, terpenoids, epoxidized natural rubber, etc. (Gandini and Lacerda, 2015 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ); reinforced plastics as nanocomposites that present, among other characteristics, increased lifetime; biodegradable polymers and recycling as possible solutions to the global problem of the final disposal of solid waste, among many other examples. Recycling benefits are also included in this SDG. In this scenario, some authors highlight additive manufacturing as a more sustainable way of producing plastic goods, depending on the application (Awwad et al., 2020 ; Colorado et al., 2020 ; Xie et al., 2019 ). Some examples of the role of polymer in the achievement of the SDG9 are in cutting edge applications such as catalysts (Feng et al., 2020 ; M. Liu et al., 2020a ; Ma et al., 2019 ; Shao et al., 2019 ; Subramanian et al., 2019 ; Z. Zhang et al., 2019b ), semiconductor devices (Jhulki et al., 2020 ), sensors, gases adsorbents (Che and Fang, 2020 ; Z. Wang et al., 2020b ), gases separators such as metal-organic frameworks (Bhatt et al., 2020 ; Lin et al., 2020 ; C. Wang et al., 2020a ), energy storagers (Che and Fang, 2020 ), phase-separated fibers with shape memory (Y. Yang et al., 2018 ), having as an essential ally the chemistry. With the help of chemistry through new polymerization routes, a sequence of monomer units and the placement of functionalities along a polymer chain can be introduced, resulting in polymers with differentiated properties and behaviors capable of assisting in the development of various SDGs. Some examples are the polymerization through molecular machines that build polymers by moving along tracks to the synthesis of sequence-encoded chains with continuous carbon backbones (McTernan et al., 2020 ); ring-opening metathesis polymerization (X. Tan et al., 2019b ); ring expansion polymerization (Niu et al., 2019 ); self-polymerization (Mahmood et al., 2018 ); grapt copolymerization (Anirudhan and Radhakrishnan, 2007 ); molecular design (Jiang, 2020 ); molecular quantum technologies using polymers (Pandya et al., 2020 ); synthesis of ultra-small bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) using porous ion-exchange polymers (Koo et al., 2020 ); reverse depolymerization as chemical recycling (Xiong et al., 2020 ); polymer mechanochemistry which produces functional material for applications such as organic electronics, biological scaffolds, and drug-delivery coatings (Willis-Fox et al., 2018 ); morphology-controlled dynamic polymers, which can be used in several applications such as soft robotics to molecular actuators or morphology-induced information storage to thermomechanical sensing (Y. Yang et al., 2018b ); among many others. According to Elling et al. (Elling et al., 2019 ), “the ability to control the location and number of individual functional groups in a polymer chain opens exciting opportunities for the precise synthesis and manipulation of polymer structures, architectures, assemblies, and properties". Thinking about research and development, there is no way to separate the creation of new and innovative plastic materials and laboratory facilities in general, where the presence of equipment and devices containing plastic materials is massive and extremely important.  4.8 SDG12 Regarding responsible consumption and production (SDG12), this goal is the basis of economy and sustainable development. One of the goals is to reduce food waste, and plastic has acted in an exemplary manner. Plastic packaging protects food, resulting in increased lifetime. The packaging is mainly used for protection, being directly linked with food waste. Protection is not only related to damage during manipulation and transport but also allows lifetime extension as it helps to conserve the physical conditions of the products (Rivera et al., 2019 ). Great are the advances in this direction, the result of research and innovation, as is the case of intelligent packaging (also known as smart or active) (Ghaani et al., 2016 ; Yucel, 2016 ), such as those that control the ripening, spoilage, and quality of fruits, for instance, packaging with antibacterial and antioxidant agents, among others. Plastic packaging also has the great advantage of the possibility of being cleaned or washed because they are waterproof, very useful to prevent contamination and disease transmission, as discussed before. Furthermore, one of the goals refers to the reduction in waste production through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. Thus, the ideal is a reduction in the source (according to 3Rs waste hierarchy which is to reduce, reuse, and recycle (Diggle and Walker, 2020 )), reducing the residue production. As cited by Vesilind and Morgan (Vesilind and Morgan, 2014 ), rejecting plastic bags in supermarkets does not mean a lack of education, but rather demonstrates environmental awareness. As an example, Dube and Nhamo (Dube and Nhamo, 2020 ) discussed the role of tourism concerning the SDGs achievement, presenting an example of how a private nature reserve in the Cape Floral Kingdom (a World Heritage Site) has tried to achieve the SDGs. Among the challenges, the enterprise was committed to eliminating all forms of single-use plastic in all the lodges. Besides, according to Pilz et al. (Pilz et al., 2010 ), “a rough estimation of the possible magnitude of CO2  savings resulting from prevented food losses enabled by plastic packaging for fresh food shows that the CO2  benefit of 10–20% prevented food losses is 4–9 times higher than the CO2  emissions of packaging production".  4.9 SDG13 Regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is part of the action against global climate change (SDG13). This goal is of paramount importance, as the global temperature has increased over the years, causing various environmental problems such as melting glaciers and increasing ocean levels, among many others. In this sense, plastic has a great contribution. Plastics in general have low density, so they reduce fuel consumption in means of transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As aforementioned, recycling also mitigates greenhouse gas emissions (SDG11). According to Pilz et al. (Pilz et al., 2010 ), plastic impacts in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and clean energy by plastics production made of biodegradable polymers derived from renewable resources, and/or plastics made from ethanol. Another important contribution of plastic is in the production of porous CO2  separation membranes for the sequestration of anthropogenic CO2  (Yang et al., 2020 ). Attention has been given to biodiesel because of its potential in replacing conventional fossil-based diesel fuel. Nevertheless, neat biodiesel holds several undesired properties making it inadequate to be used directly as fuel, being necessary the use of additives (Arjanggi and Kansedo, 2020 ). So, the use of plastic waste as additives for biodiesel emerges as a great opportunity. It can be successfully used since its chemical structure is similar to the fatty acid esters, interacting well. Some biodiesel properties are improved by the use of additives from waste plastic such as cold flow properties, oxidation stability, and high NOx emission (Knothe and Van Gerpen, 2005 ). According to Arjanggi and Kansedo (Arjanggi and Kansedo, 2020 ), PS is the most compatible commodity plastic to be dissolved in biodiesel. Consequently, plastic waste used as an additive to biodiesel is considered relevant in the success of some SDGs such as the SDG6, SDG7, SDG9, and SDG11. Also, it is known that recycling generates jobs, which help the achievement of the related SDGs. The emission of greenhouse gases such as CO, CO2 , SO2 , and aromatics from biodiesel is lesser than those of petroleum-diesel (Shahabuddin et al., 2013 ; Tamilselvan et al., 2017 ). However, a negative aspect to be overcome is that biodiesel emits a significantly greater amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx ) compared to fossil-based diesel (Hoekman and Robbins, 2012 ), which may contribute to the acid rain formation. In this sense, another interesting example is the photo-driven direct methanol-to-ethanol conversion with a gallium nitride catalyst under ambient conditions, reported by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019 ). The conversion was achieved with no solvent, ligand, additive, heating, atmosphere, or pressurization, just with light irradiation being, consequently, an application of green chemistry. According to the authors, a direct conversion of methanol-to-ethanol would provide facile access to a renewable starting material for applications as a safer fuel or an intermediate for the synthesis of the most demanded plastic, such as PE.  4.10 SDG14 Concerning life in water (SDG14), quality water is fundamental for people's health (SDG3), and also for the preservation of aquatic fauna and flora. The United Nations Environment Programme has warned about the growing number of health problems associated with environmental degradation, including water pollution. According to the Program (“Exposição à poluição ambiental mata quase 7 milhões de pessoas por ano, alerta PNUMA,” 2016 ), about 7 million people are killed each year due to exposure to environmental pollution. Infections transmitted by contaminated and improper water for consumption kill about 1000 children per day. Water bodies are contaminated by macro and plastic microparticles (microplastics) due mainly to the inadequate disposal of post-consumer plastic. Microplastics are smaller than 5 ​mm (1 ​μm - 5 ​mm) (Masura et al., 2015 ; Sobhani et al., 2020 ), and may be of primary or secondary origin. Those of primary origin are produced on the microparticle scale, such as microspheres used in the hygiene and beauty industry, or pellets used in the polymer industry. Those of secondary origin can be residues inadequately disposed of in the waters and that, due to the inherent material degradation influenced by environmental action, are reduced over time. Microplastics as water polluters are considered a socio-environmental problem, being harmful to human health (SDG3), aquatic fauna, and flora. They can be ingested by aquatic organisms and bioaccumulated along the food chain, reaching the human being (Gualtieri et al., 2005 ; Nelson et al., 1994 ; Zanchet et al., 2018 ). Humans can be exposed to microplastics through ingestion or air inhalation (Wright and Kelly, 2017 ), being their presence confirmed in honey, sugar, seafood, sea salt, tap water, and beer (Cox et al., 2019 ; Kosuth et al., 2018 ; Liebezeit and Liebezeit, 2014 ; Mason et al., 2018 ). By evaluating around 15% of Americans' caloric intake, it was estimated the annual microplastics consumption ranged from 39,000 to 52,000 particles depending on sex and age, increasing to 74,000 and 121,000 when inhalation is also considered (Cox et al., 2019 ). Proving the consumption of microparticles by humans, they were found in faeces (Schwabl et al., 2019 ). Most recently, their presence was detected inside the human placenta for the first time (Ragusa et al., 2021 ). These particles, due to their small size and large surface area, can adsorb and carry various contaminants hazardous to the population health (Blinovskaya et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; W. Wang et al., 2020 ). So, plastic fragments should be classified as harmful materials for their potential toxicological effects (Frias et al., 2020 ). Recently, the presence of organophosphate flame retardants, an additive largely used in plastic, was evidenced in the muscle of fin whales and krills, their main prey (Garcia-Garin et al., 2020 ). This additive may cause adverse effects on human reproduction, fertility disorders, and/or fetal development, and tumors in animals (Bruchajzer et al., 2015 ). Similarly, zebrafish (Danio rerio ) was exposed to PE microplastics (Malafaia et al., 2020 ). Among the effects, microplastics caused lower larval survival rates after egg hatching, as well as induced significant changes in the morphometric parameters of the fish. According to the 2030 Agenda Platform (“Agenda, 2030 - SDG14,” n.d. ), there are 13,000 pieces of plastic in every square kilometer of water. Besides, the simple fact of cutting or tearing a package to consume foods generates microplastics (Sobhani et al., 2020 ). Marine currents can transport microplastics on spatial scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers, spreading them across the surface of the oceans (Hatje et al., 2018 ). Thus, environmental education is essential to inform and raise awareness of the population (SDG4). Conversely, plastic can be a partner when dealing with water quality since it is used to decontaminate water (Airoldi, 2008 ; Milani et al., 2017 ), as aforementioned. As above mentioned, COVID-19 pandemic is contributing to increase water pollution by plastic due to the increase in waste production and its incorrect management. Data analysis of more than 46,000 users of the Mobills app between January and December 2020 showed that delivery spending grew 149% in the last year in Brazil, with the three main delivery apps (Rappi, Ifood and Uber Eats). Comparing December and March, the increase was 187% (Ribeiro, 2021 ). Bearing in mind that most of the packaging delivered per app is expanded PS, plastic film or adhesive tape, materials of difficult recycling, end up becoming rejects with great possibility of being disposed of improperly. According to a balance from the Brazilian Association of Public Cleaning and Special Waste Companies (Abrelpe), the amount and composition of the waste generated in Brazil changed during pandemic. In April 2020, Brazil produced 7.25% less waste compared to the same month of 2019, and the volume of recyclable materials increased between 25 and 30% (Fornari, 2020 ). Also, the literature shows clear concern regarding the increasing number of PPEs found in the waters, resulting from inadequate disposal of (Fadare and Okoffo, 2020 ; Kalina and Tilley, 2020 ; Saliu et al., 2021 ; Selvaranjan et al., 2021 ). Different water bodies end up receiving any residue improperly disposed of (the residues are advected by wind, stormwater, drainage systems, and wastewater (Eriksen et al., 2013 ), reaching rivers, seas, and/or oceans) (Auta et al., 2017 ). In the waters, animals and seabirds may die as a consequence of plastic ingestion. They are attracted by the movement and colors of plastic waste, ingesting them believing it is food (de Sousa, 2020 ). Not long ago, the body of a Magellanic Penguin was found on a beach in the city of São Sebastião, north coast of São Paulo, Brazil. In its stomach, a face mask was found during the necropsy (Fig. 11  ), resulting in the cause of its death (“Necropsia aponta que pinguim encontrado morto no litoral de SP engoliu máscara,” 2020 ). This problematic scenario can be changed from the joint action of an efficient waste management system, government regulations, public awareness, and environmental education, in order to achieve the SDG14.  4.11 SDG15 Concerning terrestrial life (SDG15), sustainably using natural resources in productive chains and community subsistence activities includes encouraging recycling, using technology and research to obtain recycled plastics with lower levels of degradation, aiming at increasing the lifetime of consumer goods. It is known that, from recycling the oil, a non-renewable natural resource is conserved. Other advantages were previously discussed. Last, but not least, green chemistry is considered a great ally for achieving all the SDGs, as aforementioned. According to Tarasova et al. (Tarasova et al., 2015 ), the implementation of green chemistry, the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances is essential to increase the standard of living without a negative impact on the planet. An environmentally responsible manner may help chemical enterprises to offer society goods and services with cleaner technologies. Green chemistry provides solutions to global challenges such as climate change, sustainable agriculture, energy, toxins in the environment, and depletion of natural resources. Fig. 12   presents schematically the contribution of plastic in the achievement of some SDGs, showing some applications. However, the contribution of plastic goes far beyond the applications discussed in the present work.   5 From the current scenario to the future prospects Until this point, it has become clear the active participation of plastic in the success of most SDGs. However, not only pros were found. Regardless of the application of plastic and its contribution to the success of the SDGs, it is important to keep in mind that it has a specific lifetime becoming, later, a residue. Any type of plastic residue needs to be disposed of properly. In this sense, the research and development of materials is a great partner in the development of more resistant materials with a longer lifetime, as well as new recycling processes (routes) and/or recycling processes suitable for each plastic type. 40% of plastic products have a lifetime of less than 1 month, according to estimates (Achilias et al., 2007 ). Both the reduced lifetime and the high amount of plastic used in the current society result in huge challenges such as to solve serious environmental and management problems. As depicted up to here, the main weak point of plastic is its post-consumption because, when inappropriately disposed of in the environment, post-used plastic may cause serious socio-environmental problems that hinder the progress of the SDGs, which have been discussed earlier. According to Borja et al. (Borja et al., 2020 ), plastic pollution is very much the center of attention in terms of the current public discourse, research, and policy action, but it is less clear whether this attention is entirely justified, compared with other existing risks to the ocean and human health. Oppositely, this attention could be used to engage individuals and communities with wider environmental issues that go beyond plastic pollution. About the problem of the post-used plastic, called the plastic waste pandemic (Arjanggi and Kansedo, 2020 ), the subject in the literature is considered recent. A dramatic increase in research on macro-, micro-, and nano-plastics in the oceans has been observed from 2007 (Borja et al., 2020 ). Correspondingly, among all the publications analyzed by bibliometry, it can be observed the concern related to the environment, especially the pollution of waters by plastic, and its relationship to the economy and public health, i.e., the sustainability tripod. Different aspects correlating the success of the SDGs and the use of plastic were discussed in the analyzed publications, having in mind underdeveloped or developing countries such as India, and countries from Asia, Malaysia, and Africa. Possible partners/solutions, according to the authors' keywords, are the circular economy, continuous improvement, investments, use of life cycle assessment (LCA), recycling, among others which will be discussed in the sequence. Regarding the future scenario, the year 2030 is close, the year when the 2030 Agenda is supposed to be achieved. So, it is necessary engagement and an attitude of all the sectors of society, i.e., joint action and collaborative efforts from industry, academia, and government are needed to minimize/avoid the problems. According to Arjanggi and Kansedo (Arjanggi and Kansedo, 2020 ), as many environmental and societal issues arise from plastic pollution, repurposing technologies are paramount to meet the SDGs. For plastic to continue contributing to the development of society and with the success of the SDGs, it is essential to encourage the research and development of new solutions, materials that cause low environmental impact and are sustainable based on LCAs, obtaining new materials from the residues valuation as a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based polymers and, perhaps most importantly, that their consumption is conscious. Encourage actions related to 3Rs, keeping in mind that the main point is to reduce at source whenever possible. In places where there is a selective collection, it is important to seek ways to inform the society and, through knowledge, the citizen can become active and contribute to sustainable development. Circular economy, reverse logistics, and new laws to preserve the environment, such as to avoid single-use plastic should be encouraged. Several laws prohibiting the use of single-use plastic were known around the world (Adam et al., 2020 ; e Silva and de Sousa, 2021 ; Xanthos and Walker, 2017 ). However, due to public health during the COVID-19 pandemic, nowadays many places do not allow, or no longer encourage the use of reusable bags, as well as laws prohibiting the use of single-use plastic such as glasses, cutlery, and plates were recently suspended (de Sousa, 2020 ). The situation has been slowly reversed with the creation of new laws prohibiting the use of these materials, such as restricting the manufacture of straws in England (“Agora é Lei: proibição de plásticos de uso único é sancionada - Câmara Municipal de São Paulo,” 2021 , “Plastic straw ban comes into force in England | The Independent,” 2020 ). New targets will be imposed by the circular economy. New laws will be created aiming at greater responsibility of the producing companies, mainly packaging, as a way to implement reverse logistics (de Sousa, 2020 ). Some examples are the reduction of the production of plastic waste by creating new taxes (“España recurre an un impuesto verde para luchar contra el plástico | Sociedad | EL PAÍS,” 2020 ), and the prohibition of using plastic microparticles in hygiene and beauty products (Diggle and Walker, 2020 ). Government regulations including new long-term targets should be created in favor of the population, in line with academic results (de Sousa, 2020 ). Not to leave the negative points of the use of plastics to future generations: every individual, from children to adults, should understand the adverse effects of plastic use and its consequences (de Sousa, 2021 ), i.e., everyone is responsible for the plastic residue that they produce.  6 Conclusions This work proposed a critical overview of the role of plastic concerning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Based on a bibliometric analysis and mapping, the trend topics concerning the role of plastic to achieve the SDGs was observed, and a discussion was proposed. It is clear the important participation of plastic in modern society, sustainable development, and in the success of the 2030 Agenda. Nevertheless, plastic has not only pros, but some concern cons which may impact the environment, society, and economy, which may negatively impact the success of the 2030 Agenda. When inappropriately disposed of, it may cause socio-environmental problems, being necessary education and a true commitment of all the sectors of the society to solve them. The future scenario was tried to be outlined. Recycling; the circular economy; education; government regulations; joint action and collaborative efforts from industry, academia, and government; research and development of new solutions/materials/recycling routes; and single-use plastic avoiding are examples of relevant issues necessary to minimize/avoid problems which post-used plastic may cause.
