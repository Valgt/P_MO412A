Image 1   Welcome to this first issue of the journal “Groundwater for Sustainable Development”. Many will ask why we need another journal related to groundwater and hydrogeology topics. Groundwater issues are transdisciplinary, interconnecting with many fields. There is growing global freshwater demand to meet global food demand, which is estimated to increase by 70% to feed a projected global population of 9.3 billion people by 2050. Hence, the state and management of freshwater resources is one of the world's most pressing challenges. Groundwater provides the main portion of global freshwater supply and will continue to do so over coming decades, despite trends in (waste)water reuse and desalination. However, such improvements must be done both economically and in an environmentally and socially sustainable way, the topic of which is a key target of this journal. The challenges of providing freshwater to a growing world population through groundwater—including its treatment, where needed, and groundwater pumping through innovative energy-efficient, low energy and renewable energy powered technologies (e.g. solar pumping)—highlights the importance of the nexus between the two basic commodities, water and energy. In addition, a focus of the nexuses of groundwater and energy to environment, food, climate and public health is essential. This is in full agreement with the global challenges outlined in the “Eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)” and 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) put forward in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development formulated by the United Nations in 2015 (see Figure), officially known as “Transforming our World”. All of these goals are, in some way, related to water. The SDGs—formulated as sectoral targets rather than in recognition of nexuses—were introduced in late 2015 to the world as a 17-point plan to end poverty (Goal 1), halt climate change through replacing fossil fuel by renewable energies and shifting to increased energy efficient technologies (Goal 13) and fight injustice and inequality (Goal 10). Access to safe water and sanitation (Goal 6) and affordable energy (Goal 7) are factors aimed at eradicating or reducing poverty (Goal 1) and hunger by enhancing food security (Goal 2) and contributing to good health by providing safe water (Goal 3), gender equality (Goal 5)—addressing the disproportionate disadvantage experienced by women and girls due to sanitation limitations and the time spent fetching water—and peace and justice by eliminating armed conflicts or wars for water (Goal 16). Improving sustainable water and interconnected energy technologies and developments will contribute to improve the use of locally available environmentally-friendly climate-protecting renewable energy sources (Goal 7) and energy-plus or zero-energy buildings and cities (Goal 11), triggering job creation and respective economic growth (Goal 8) and contributing to innovation (Goal 9), all in all protecting life both in aquatic systems (Goal 14) and on land (Goal 15). Quality education (Goal 4) and information (to which this journal also contributes) are thereby crucial. Increasingly, groundwater—which by far exceeds surface water as a source of freshwater and which has the additional benefit that it provides a stable supply through the year—is used for freshwater supply. Nevertheless, the availability of groundwater in sufficient quantity and of good quality is severely impacted by increased water demand for agricultural irrigation, public water supply, industrial production and cooling in electricity generation. Chronic increasing stress on groundwater resources, which can be observed in many regions of the world, has negative implications for sustainable development—in particular for the security of food, water and energy supplies—the importance of which will further increase in the next decades. This journal, “Groundwater for Sustainable Development”, addresses mitigation and adaptation pathways for better assessment and understanding of groundwater systems within transdisciplinary economic, social and environmental contexts and better protection and sustainable management of these critical water resources. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the interdependence between (ground)water and energy (i.e. the water-energy nexus) will increase in future. For example, pumping of groundwater for freshwater production requires energy; consequently, water and energy management must be integrated rather than managed separately, as is the general practice today. However, (ground)water is not only linked to energy. It is integral to all components within the water-energy-food-ecosystem-climate nexus. Hence groundwater development and use must be planned and managed in integration with all these sectors in order to optimize the entire system, to minimize the trade-offs and maximize synergies between the different elements. This is the only way to ensure future sustainable global development, contributing to the challenges of the SDGs described earlier and, in particular, the challenges of providing security of water, energy, and food; protecting ecosystems and climate; and contributing to sustainable economic, social and environmental development. Corresponding to the need to contribute to sustainable development, the journal deals with a wide range of topics related to (ground)water including its interrelations with gender and social aspects, as well as with policy, regulatory, legal and economic aspects. The aim of “Groundwater for Sustainable Development” is therefore to provide a multi- and inter-disciplinary journal linking groundwater resources with human society. Despite the obvious need, such a multidisciplinary journal dedicated to the connection between groundwater related sciences and society does not currently exist.. This journal will provide an international forum for groundwater research oriented to the direct solution of problems of great social and environmental impact, rather than only breakthrough research on physical and chemical groundwater-related issues, as is currently the case. A key objective of the journal “Groundwater for Sustainable Development” is to consolidate results from international research and technical improvements to better understanding groundwater systems, and to improve their management—including energy-efficient and renewable energy based treatment to adjust water quality according to the required drinking or irrigation water quality standards—as the basis for sustainable global economic, social and environmental development. The objectives of this journal are to facilitate:• the creation of a global transdisciplinary forum and platform aimed at improving understanding of groundwater resources and to advocate for their effective, optimized and sustainable management and protection against contamination;  • the improvement of human access to groundwater in adequate quantity and of good quality;  • the meeting of the increasing drinking and irrigation water demand required for food security, thereby contributing to socially and economically sound human development; and  • the exchange of transdisciplinary information and stimulation of scientific research in the fields of groundwater related sciences and social and health sciences required to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.    Principal fields covered by the journal include, but are not limited to:• hydrogeological systems and sustainable groundwater resources management;  • groundwater contamination and protection;  • groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment;  • groundwater quality and food safety;  • epidemiology and public health impacts of groundwater contamination;  • groundwater treatment using energy efficient and renewable energy, in-situ and ex-situ remediation and reuse;  • water-energy-food-ecosystems nexus;  • impacts of climate change on groundwater;  • hydro-economics;  • water policy;  • social aspects of groundwater;  • water and education; and  • implementation of water efficient technologies and water saving measures.    We believe that sharing knowledge and experience on groundwater issues on a worldwide scale and across disciplines through the journal "Groundwater for Sustainable Development" will be an effective strategy to identify and promote cross sectoral connection related to the assessment, development and management of groundwater resources. This is exactly what the international journal of "Groundwater for Sustainable Development" is intending to address. On the global platform, the authors and readers of the journal should enjoy all the benefits of global interdisciplinary collaborative information exchange, facilitated by Information Technology and on-line access to the journal’s content.
