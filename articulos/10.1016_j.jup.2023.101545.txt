                  This paper examines the effect of globalization on progress toward SDG 7, with a particular focus on electricity access, renewable energy consumption, and energy intensity. Data are on 42 African countries over the 2000 – 2015 period. Findings from the fixed-effects model with the Driscoll-Kraay estimator show that overall globalization improves electricity access, while its effect on renewable energy consumption and energy intensity is insignificant. Additional findings show that economic globalization improves electricity access and energy efficiency; social globalization undermines renewable energy consumption while improving energy efficiency; political globalization increases electricity access and renewable energy consumption. Some recommendations are provided.

Beecher This paper examines the effect of globalization on progress toward SDG 7, with a particular focus on electricity access, renewable energy consumption, and energy intensity. Data are on 42 African countries over the 2000 – 2015 period. Findings from the fixed-effects model with the Driscoll-Kraay estimator show that overall globalization improves electricity access, while its effect on renewable energy consumption and energy intensity is insignificant. Additional findings show that economic globalization improves electricity access and energy efficiency; social globalization undermines renewable energy consumption while improving energy efficiency; political globalization increases electricity access and renewable energy consumption. Some recommendations are provided.   Keywords SDG 7  Globalization  Access to electricity  Renewable energy  Energy intensity   Data availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction Although energy consumption has increased approximately by more than twofold, from 224.2 million tons oil equivalent in 1990 to 474.6 million tons oil equivalent in 2020 (BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2020), the energy sector in Africa is still underdeveloped. Though being home to 17% of the world population, the region consumed just 6% of global power in 2018 (International Energy Agency -IEA, 2019 ). Nearly 600 million or 53.3% of Sub-Saharan do not have access to electricity in 2018 (World Bank, 2019) while 80% of the companies in SSA suffered frequent electricity disruption (IEA, 2019 ). Also, the African energy mix is poorly diversified and dominated by fossil fuels. Only 8% of the energy generated in Africa is from renewable sources (UNEP, 2017 ), while only 17% of the population uses clean fuels and technologies for cooking (World Bank, 2021 ). Finally, energy intensity has decreased even though it remains higher than the world's average. Indeed, while energy is intensively used in some countries like Somalia, Liberia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, other countries such as Seychelles, Morocco, and Ghana have significantly improved energy efficiency (World Bank, 2021 ). Overall, energy poverty in Africa is the highest in the world. In this study, energy poverty is defined as the “absence of sufficient choice in accessing adequate, affordable, reliable, high-quality, safe, and environmentally benign energy services to support economic and human development” (Reddy et al., 2000, p.44). More generally in the literature, energy poverty is a measure of the level of access to electricity, use of clean or renewable energy, and the intensity of energy use (Banerjee et al., 2021 ; Nussbaumer et al., 2012; Rademaekers et al., 2016). Energy poverty has enormous consequences on the livelihoods of the populace and consequently their overall wellbeing. Accordingly, a growing number of studies have investigated the ways to alleviate energy poverty in recent times. These include, for example, the role played by economic growth (Halkos and Gkampoura, 2021 ), government spending (Nguyen and Su, 2022 ), financial development and financial inclusion (Nguyen et al., 2021 ; Koomson and Danquah, 2021 ), women empowerment (Opoku et al., 2021 ), religiosity (Ampofo and Mabefam, 2021 ), culture (Chaudhry and Shafiullah, 2021 ), and ethnic diversity (Churchill and Smyth, 2020 ). While there is an emphasis on the positive effect of globalization on human wellbeing (Asongu, 2013 ; Asongu and Nwachukwu, 2017 ), not much attention has been granted to the globalization - energy poverty nexus and this gap motivated our study. Indeed, there are several channels through which globalization could affect energy poverty. On the one hand, Cole (2006)  argues that globalization could reduce energy poverty by allowing the international diffusion of energy innovation and renewable energy technologies. This will help to increase access to electricity while improving energy efficiency, especially in low-income countries. Also, globalization broadens the tax base, allowing the government to raise revenues to invest in the provision of public goods such as electricity. International cooperation and international development assistance programs are other channels through which countries could mobilize more financial resources at the international level to fill the financing gap for public goods such as electricity, drinkable and improved sanitation (Kaffo and Nguea, 2022 ). On the other hand, global integration could have unfavorable effects on human development in developing countries. This view is supported by the unequal exchange theorists (Prebisch, 1944; Emanuel, 1972) who argue that the benefits of globalization are unevenly distributed between developed and developing countries, with the latter generally suffering from negative externalities of liberalization policies. Through globalization, industrialized countries transfer their wasteful economic activities to developing countries. Also, Mishkin (2007)  reports that globalization could lead to financial instability and growth volatility that may reduce the ability of the governments to invest in the infrastructures. This study investigates the effect of globalization on energy poverty with special attention to electricity access, renewable energy consumption and energy efficiency. Data are on a sample of 42 African countries over the 2000–2015 period. In achieving the research objective, the study contributes to the globalization energy poverty debate in three ways. First, it employs a comprehensive measure of globalization to capture other aspects of globalization like international flows of information, ideas, interpersonal relationship, government policies, international cooperation (Dreher et al., 2006; Gygli et al., 2019 ). Secondly, as pointed out by Kaffo and Nguea (2022) , Quinn et al. (2011), Voigt et al. (2015) , and Jaumotte et al. (2013)  globalization is a multifaceted concept and its different dimensions and aspects could have a different impact on the outcome variable. Accordingly, we distinguish between economic, social, and political globalization. While the first dimension refers to the monetary aspect of globalization, the two others refer to non-monetary aspects. Also, we distinguish between the de facto  and de jure  dimensions of globalization, where de jure  measures account for the role of economic policies and the de facto  measures explain the actual flows and activities associated with globalization (Gygli et al., 2019 ). This differentiation helps to explain not just globalization, per se , but also the policies or the institutional environment that underlie the process. This distinction is particularly important in Africa, where most often there is a big gap between policy formulation and implementation (Kose et al., 2009 ). Thus, using disaggregated data of globalization provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding the institutions, policies, and their potential outcomes. Thirdly, unlike previous studies in Africa, we use three majors component of energy poverty which are access to electricity, renewable energy use, and energy efficiency to provide robust evidence of the effect of globalization on energy poverty in Africa. This is consistent with the UN’s (2000)  description of energy poverty as the inability to obtain a materially necessary level of high quality and reliable energy that is affordable, safe, and environmentally friendly. Finally, globalization is indicative of cross-country interrelationships, and therefore, cross-sectional independence cannot be assumed. Accordingly, our estimation techniques account for cross-sectional dependence, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity. Further, we check for the sensitivity of the results using the non-parametric Fully Modified Least Squared (FMOLS) method to account for the potential endogeneity and heterogeneity biases and consequently reduce estimation bias. We structure the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2  explains the theoretical underpinnings and the review of existing studies. Section 3  presents the data, model specification, and estimation procedure. Section 4  reports and discusses the findings and Section 5  concludes the paper and provides policy implications.  2 Literature review 2.1 Theoretical settings Theoretically, globalization opens up an economy to international markets and broadens the tax base, which helps the government to raise revenues to invest in the provision of public goods such as electricity. Also, international cooperation and international development assistance programs are other channels through which countries could mobilize more financial resources to fill the financing gap for public goods (Ahmad and Babar, 2013 ). Furthermore, through technology transfer, globalization can influence the energy mix and energy efficiency (Sadorsky, 2012; Shahbaz et al., 2016 ; Chang and Lee, 2010 ; Gurgul and Lach, 2014 ). For example, Mubarik and Naghavi (2022)  argue that globalization enables firms to intensify their R&D and innovation activities to improve energy efficiency and productivity. Doh et al. (2012)  argue that foreign investors can engage in electricity provision in the host country for both economic and non-economic motivations. Concerning the former, foreign investors can directly acquire shares in power generation companies (Mbalyohere et al., 2017 ), to increase domestic power generation and increase the proportion of people enjoying access to electricity. From the non-monetary perspective, multinational firms usually engage in, for example, power generation, access to water and sanitation activities as a form of social responsibility for their survival and legitimacy (Robbins and Perkins, 2012 ; Garrone et al., 2019 ; Tadadjeu et al., 2020 ). This quest for legitimacy is essential as it determines the likelihood of survival and success of multinational firms in the host countries (Garrone et al., 2019 ; D'Amelio et al., 2016 ). Conversely, globalization increases energy use and energy intensity if it favors energy-intensive technologies transferred from developed countries to developing countries. Economic globalization which enhances the level of technology, increases productivity in energy sources (i.e., energy-saving), and decreases the cost of energy (Kutan et al., 2018 ; Padhan et al., 2020 ). Renewable electricity generation is a relatively technology-intensive process and therefore it can be argued that technological innovation is a prerequisite for the promotion and development of renewable energy (Jebli & Kahia,2020; Dagoumas and Koltsaklis, 2019; Eleftheriadis and Anagnostopoulou, 2015). Globalization has been touted as a key driver of renewable energy development as it enables countries to decrease energy consumption by importing technology into energy consumption and production activities (Padhan et al., 2020 ). It is not surprising therefore that Murshed et al. (2021)  surmise that technological limitations and infrastructural inadequacies limit the prospects of renewable energy adoption in developing countries. The implication is that the influx of FDI, for example, could help to lessen the financial constraints and related barriers to clean energy. Indeed, Ahmad and Babar (2013)  explain that because of energy market globalization, renewable energy adoption is gaining momentum around the world. From the perspective of social globalization, it is also likely that globalization could lead to the transfer of cultural and behavioral norms such that it discourages the use of fossil fuels (Doytch and Narayan, 2016 ). At the same time, inward FDI could be expected to foster the development of the host economy's renewable energy sector by upgrading the poor energy infrastructure (Ji and Zhang, 2019 ). Additionally, the effect of globalization on energy sustainability and efficiency is investigated under the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) and the Porter hypothesis (PH) (Nkengfack et al., 2019 ). The PHH assumes that through globalization policies, multinational firms tend to relocate their energy-intensive and inefficient activities to less developed countries with poor regulatory policies and consequently increase energy intensity. On the other hand, the PH holds that globalization facilitates the transfer of improved technologies, knowledge, and innovation which help poor countries to reduce their energy intensity and improve their environment (Opoku and Boachie, 2019 ; Ulucak, 2021 ). Shahbaz et al. (2018) show that a positive shock in globalization is associated with a reduction in energy demand due to increased investment in technological advancement and consequently improvement in energy efficiency. Ulucak (2021)  have explained that globalization could have both positive and negative effect on energy efficiency, but the overall effect depends on the institutional environment, where strong environmental policies promote the transfer of energy efficient technology and innovations that minimize energy consumption and less restrictive policies produce the negative effect.  2.2 Empirical literature Shahbaz et al. (2017)  investigate the effect of globalization on energy consumption in 25 developed countries in the period 1970–2014 and report that globalization enhances energy consumption. Huang et al. (2020)  find an inverted U-shaped relationship between globalization and energy use in a selected sample of 98 countries. Their findings indicate that globalization increases energy use until a threshold where improvement in globalization reduces energy use. Jin et al. (2022)  employ panel data of 56 industries in 42 countries and find that the promotion of industries' global value chain (GVCs) position has significantly reduced their own energy intensity, while the effect of industries' GVCs participation degree is ambiguous. Huang et al. (2019)  also reported that a rise in the level of globalization contributed to the convergence of energy intensity in the Belt and Road countries during the period 1992–2016. Sun et al. (2021)  in a study of 30 countries find that service trade globalization improves energy efficiency. The findings reveal that the effect is more pronounced in the more developed countries than the less developed countries. Aboagye and Nketiah-Amponsah (2016)  find that trade openness and FDI improve energy efficiency by reducing the energy intensity in a study of SSA countries. Similar results are reported by Bu et al. (2019)  for China, Destek et al. (2022)  for emerging economies, Leal and Marques (2022)  for the top 20 energy consumers, Ozcan et al. (2022)  for the OECD countries, and Samargandi (2019)  for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. On the other hand, Zaidi et al. (2019)  examine the case of APEC countries over the period and find that globalization intensifies energy intensity. Hussain et al. (2020)  studied the five top ASEAN economies and show that globalization and financial development worsened energy intensity. Similarly, Ozcan et al. (2022)  find that globalization contributes to energy consumption of selected OECD countries. Destek et al. (2022) , however find that while economic growth, technological development, and trade globalization increases energy efficiency, financial globalization reduces energy efficiency in emerging economies. Gozgor et al. (2020)  demonstrate that globalization increased renewable energy consumption in 30 OEDC countries over the 1970–2015 period. Murshed et al. (2021)  examine the case of Bangladesh for the period 1972–2015 based on the ARDL estimation technique and find that FDI inflows are positive and significantly related to renewable energy. Similarly, the study of Padhan et al. (2020)  reveals that globalization induces renewable energy adoption. In a country-specific study of Ghana, Ankrah and Lin (2020)  report that FDI and trade are key drivers of renewable energy. Bayar et al. (2021)  investigate the case for EU transition economies through the bootstrap panel Granger causality test from 1995 to 2015 and report differential effects across the region. The causality analysis reveal a unilateral causality from trade globalization to renewable energy in Estonia, Latvia, and Slovenia, and from renewable energy to trade globalization in Croatia and Lithuania. Likewise, Urom et al. (2021)  explore the asymmetric responses of renewable energy (RE) technology to globalization and economic growth shocks across the G7 countries and demonstrate that positive shocks on globalization increase RE in Canada, Germany, the UK, and the US, while both positive and negative globalization shocks promote RE consumption in Italy and Japan but decrease it in France. Likewise, Qamruzzaman and Jianguo (2020)  examined the globalization – renewable energy link for countries at different levels of development and find that globalization had a positive effect on renewable energy consumption for all countries in the long run. In a study of Portugal, however, Leitão (2014) , find bidirectional causality between globalization and renewable energy (based on OLS and GMM techniques). With respect to the third element (access to electricity) of this study, Ahmad and Babar (2013)  in a study of the GCC found that globalization has been critical in promoting power generation and, in particular, renewable electricity sources in the region. In a related study based on 1547 observations composed of pairs of 83 home countries and 15 host countries in SSA, D'Amelio et al. (2016)  report that globalization (FDI) improved access to electricity by local communities. The authors argue that this is in the interest of the MNEs, as it helps to ensure their business activities and to gain legitimacy with the local citizenry. Ankrah and Lin (2020)  show statistical evidence of positive long-run associations between FDI inflows and the volume of renewable electricity produced in Ghana. Opoku et al. (2021) , however, find that FDI enhances access to electricity but reduces renewable energy consumption and energy efficiency in African countries. Kilicarslan (2019 ) reports that incoming FDIs dampen renewable electricity outputs in a panel data analysis concerning Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and Turkey. On the other hand, Rafindadi and Usman (2021)  demonstrate that the relationship between globalization and access to electricity is asymmetric for Brazil. The results based on the NARDL estimator show that an increase in electricity consumption resulting from a 1% increase in globalization is less than how a 1% decrease in globalization reduces electricity consumption. This means that negative shocks have stronger effects.   3 Materials and method 3.1 Data and descriptive analyses We use unbalanced annual data on 42 African countries over the 2000–2015 period. The periodicity and number of countries are limited by data availability. The sample of countries is presented in Table A  in the appendix. In line with the UN SGD7, we use three variables as proxies to energy poverty. They include the proportion of the population with access to electricity, renewable energy consumption, and the energy efficiency measured as the quantity of energy used per unit of output. All these variables are gathered from the World Bank – World Development Indicators. According to Norris (2000)  and Clark's (2000)  definitions, globalization describes the process of creating networks of connections among actors at intra- or multi-continental distances, mediated through a variety of flows including people, information and ideas, capital, and goods. (Gygli et al., 2019 , p.546). Hence, we use the overall index of globalization and its sub-components that are economic, social, and political globalization. According to the same source, economic globalization characterizes long-distance flows of goods, capital, and services as well as information and perceptions that accompany market exchanges. Social globalization expresses the spread of ideas, information, images, and people. Political globalization characterizes the diffusion of government policies (See Gygli et al., 2019 , p.546). We also distinguish between de facto and de jure  aspects of globalization. The de facto  aspect measures actual flows and activities while the de jureaspect refers to policies, resources, conditions, and institutions that, in principle, enable or facilitate actual flows and activities (Gygli et al., 2019 , P549). Data on globalization are from the KOF Swiss Economic Institute. To account for the potential bias of omitted variable, we use GDP per capita as a proxy for economic development, domestic credit to the private sector (% of GDP) as a proxy for financial development, and urban population (% of the total population) as a proxy for population dynamics. All these variables are sources from the World Development Indicators issued by the World Bank. Table 1   reports some descriptive statistics on the variables. Table 2   reports the correlation matrix. Importantly, the correlation coefficients between the independent variables are lower than the rule thumb of 0.8, suggesting that our model is free from the issue of multicollinearity. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between access to electricity and globalization (overall, economic, social, and political globalization) while a negative correlation is found between globalization and the two other dependent variables. This might suggest that globalization enhances access to electricity while reducing renewable energy consumption and energy intensity. Fig. 1   plots the relationship between the overall globalization index and energy. Fig. 1  a reaffirms the positive correlation between economic globalization and access to electricity. As such, the more open countries tend to enjoy the highest proportions of individuals with access to electricity. Additionally, Fig. 1 b and Fig. 1c show a negative relationship between globalization and renewable energy consumption and between globalization and energy intensity1  1 Similar trends are found for the three dimensions of economic globalization. So we did not report these figures for space consideration. They can be provided upon request.  . These Figures suggest that globalization may reduce renewable energy consumption while improving energy efficiency. However, these presumptions need to be empirically investigated.  3.2 Model specification Based on the empirical studies of Opoku et al. (2021) , Gozgor et al. (2020)  and Bilgili et al. (2017) , the proposed model for the relationship between energy poverty and globalization is expressed as follows:(1) E = f ( g l o b , g d p c , f i n d e v , u r b a n  )       Where E  is our dependent variable, measured by three proxies: access to energy measured as the percentage of the population with access to electricity, energy sustainability measured as renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption) and energy efficiency measured as the intensity level of primary energy (MJ/$2011 PPP GDP). glob  stands for the globalization indicators, gdpc  is the gross domestic product per capita; findev  is the financial development measured as domestic credit to the private sector (% of GDP); urban is the urban population (% of the total population). Taking the model in the log-form allows controlling for heteroscedasticity. Therefore, the log-linear form of our model is written as follows:(2) ln  E i t   = τ 0  + τ 1  l n g l o b  i t   + τ 2   ln  g d p c i t   + τ 3  l n f i n d e v  i t   + τ 4  l n u r b a n  i t   + ε i t       Where ln is the natural logarithm, τs  are the long-run elasticities, ε is the error term, i  and t stand for the countries and the period. Globalization is the variable of interest. Its effect on the dependent variables is a priori  unknown. Globalization could influence access to electricity, renewable energy, and energy intensity as it allows technology transfer, the diffusion of government policies, and the worldwide dissemination of ideas, information, and (good) practices. We presume that globalization increases access to electricity as it facilitates the inflow of foreign capital through FDI and Multinational enterprises' participation in the provision of electricity (D'Amelio et al., 2016 ). Globalization increases renewable energy consumption and improves energy efficiency when it facilities the import of clean technologies. In contrast, globalization will lower renewable energy consumption and energy efficiency if countries specialize in the production of energy-intensive goods. The increase in the scale of production will raise the use of fossil energy and worsen energy productivity (Cole, 2006 ). Thus, the net effect of globalization therefore depends on whether the scale, technique, or composition effect dominates. Economic growth measures the ability of governments to invest in the provision of public goods, including energy production and distribution. Accordingly, World Development Indicators (WDI) statistics show that the electrification rate is 100% in high-income countries, compared to 93% in middle-income countries and 40% in low-income countries. In addition, high-income countries enjoy high shares for renewable energy and lower energy intensity as compared to developing countries. Furthermore, high incomes increase the ability to invest in renewable energy technologies and technologies that will reduce energy intensity. Thus, the expected sign of τ2  is positive for electricity access and renewable energy and negative for energy intensity. Financial development facilitates the mobilization and allocation of savings among different productive investments. Thus, a developed financial sector can support investment in the development and adoption of renewable energy, finance research, and development and reduce energy intensity (Baloch et al., 2021 ). Similarly, Inglesi-Lotz (2019)  shows that financial development stimulates energy-related innovation and reduces energy intensity. Hence, the expected sign of the coefficient of τ3  is positive for electricity access and renewable energy and negative for energy intensity. Many studies have examined the effect of urbanization on energy consumption (Salim and Shafiei 2014 ; Wang, 2014 ; Sadorsky, 2014 ; Mrabet et al., 2019 ). Indeed, urbanization increases energy consumption due to increased demand for transportation, the extension of telecommunication infrastructure, as well as the demand for housing. Furthermore, urbanization is usually accompanied by industrialization, which encourages the transition from agricultural-based activities to energy-intensive manufacturing activities. However, the emergence of an urban middle class may increase the demand for amenities, leading to increased investment in electricity generation and distribution, thus increasing the size of the population with access to electricity. On the other hand, the effect of urbanization on renewable energy and energy efficiency is somewhat unclear. Indeed, urbanization can increase energy intensity if it promotes energy-intensive economic activities, especially in industrial production, transportation infrastructure, and construction activities (Bilgili et al., 2017 ; Sheng et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, urbanization can reduce energy efficiency by exploiting economies of scale for urban public infrastructure through the decrease in private car use, travel distances, power transmission, and distribution losses of electricity supply, thus reducing energy consumption (Poumanyvong and Kaneko, 2010 ). Thus τ4  is expected to be positive for access to electricity and can be either positive or negative for renewable energy and energy intensity.  3.3 Estimation procedure Our procedure is implemented in five steps. In the first, we test for the cross-sectional dependence. As argued by Baltagi et al. (2012) , panel data analysis is plagued by the issue of cross-sectional dependence due to the increasing interdependences among the countries. Failing to account for this issue may significantly bias the estimates leading to spurious regressions. To check for the cross-sectional dependence, we use the general cross-sectional dependence test proposed by Pesaran (2004)  and the Bias-corrected scaled LM elaborated by Baltagi et al. (2012) . Both tests are robust to cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. Further, we determine the order of integration of the variables using the cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test. Unlike the first-generation tests such as IPS, LLC tests, the CADF test accounts for cross-sectional dependence. The CADF test also applies both for balanced and unbalanced panels. In the third step, we check for the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables. To this end, we use Kao's residual cointegration test (Kao, 1999 ). This test is robust to heterogeneity. Finally, the fixed-effect with Driscoll-Kraay standard-errors technique is used to estimate the long-run parameters. This technique is less sensitive to outlier estimates and provides results that are robust to heteroscedasticity and serial autocorrelation of errors. Also, the D-K estimates are free from cross-sectional dependence. Also, the panel fixed-effect with the D-K estimator is suitable for both balanced and non-balanced panels. The representative model is expressed as follows:(3) Y i t   = X  i t  ′  β + ε i t       Where Y  is the dependent variable, X  is a vector of independent variables, β  is the vector of parameters, ε  is the error-term. i  and t  are the N cross-sections and T periods, respectively. The D-K estimator is thus computed as follows:(4) β ˆ  = ( X ′  X  )  − 1   X ′  Y     (5) V a r ( β ˆ  )  = ( X ′  X  )  − 1   S T  ˆ  ( X ′  X  )  − 1   X ′  Y     Where S T  ˆ     include the assumptions about the heteroscedasticity, serial correlation and cross-sectional dependence.   4 Results and discussion This section reports and discusses the findings of the study. The presentation starts with the Pesaran CD and the Bias-corrected scaled LM cross-sectional dependence tests. The results reported in Table 3   reject the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence at a 1% significance level. The results of the panel unit root test reveal that all the variables are not integrated at level but when they are differentiated in the first order. Since all the variables are I(1), we can implement the panel cointegration test to check for the existence of a long-run relationship among the variables. Table 4   reports the results of Kao's residual cointegration test for our specification. We can reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration. As such, we can conclude on the existence of a long-run relationship between energy poverty (i.e. access to electricity, renewable energy consumption, and energy intensity), economic growth, financial development, urbanization, and globalization. We can thus estimate the long–run coefficients. In Table 5  , we present the effect of globalization on energy poverty variables. The specifications are estimated through the fixed-effect with Discroll & Kraay standard error technique to overcome the issue of cross-sectional dependence, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity. The results suggest that globalization significantly increases access to electricity (column 1) while its effect on renewable energy consumption and energy efficiency is negative and positive, respectively, but not statistically significant (columns 2 & 3, respectively). More specifically, the share of the total population with access to electricity increases by 0.699% when the globalization index goes up by 1%. This result aligns with studies that find that globalization increases access to social services (D’Amelio et al., 2016 ; Tadadjeu et al., 2020 ). Indeed, D’Amelio et al. (2016)  find that globalization through its FDI and multinational enterprises component significantly increases access to electricity for local communities in SSA. Similarly, Tadadjeu et al. (2020)  find that openness policies, through FDI and trade, increase the provision of public goods such as water and sanitation in Africa. This result suggests that foreign investors could invest in electricity provision for economic and non-economic reasons as argued by Doh et al. (2012) . In contrast, globalization has an insignificant effect on renewable energy consumption and energy intensity. This result is counterintuitive because by facilitating the transfer of clean technologies, globalization is expected to increase renewable energy consumption (Gozgor et al., 2020 ) while reducing industrial energy consumption and improving energy efficiency. However, one plausible explanation is that renewable energy technologies remain costly for developing countries. As a result, foreign capital is mostly directed towards non-renewable energy. Concerning the control variables, the results in Table 5  indicate that economic growth has a positive and significant impact on access to electricity while improving energy efficiency. Indeed, a 1% increase in GDP per capita increases access to electricity by 0.423% while reducing energy intensity by 0.732%. This result indicates that the more developed a country is, the more it can finance the cost of heavy investments in developing infrastructure. On the other hand, the positive effect of economic growth on energy efficiency is explained by the fact that growth stimulates less energy-intensive production processes. This result can be explained by the structural change in the productive sectors. Indeed, the production structure of the African continent is dominated by low-energy intensive activities. Industrial production (as % of GDP) declined significantly by 18% between 2000 and 2015 (World Bank, 2021 ), which may have contributed to the improvement in energy productivity. Unexpectedly, economic growth significantly reduces renewable energy consumption. This result can be explained by the fact that, despite its ecological benefit, renewable energy technologies remain relatively inaccessible for most developing countries. Financial development increases access to electricity and energy intensity and significantly reduces renewable energy consumption. Thus, the financial sector allows for the financing of investments in electricity infrastructure, which in turn, increases the number of people connected to the electricity grid. On the other hand, a developed financial sector increases energy intensity. By allocating credit, the financial sector encourages economic activities and upsurges energy demand in private businesses over time (Sadorsky, 2011 ). Also, Murshed et al. (2021)  noted that financial sector improvement significantly increases energy intensity through its effect on the national economic activities. This result is at odds with Baloch et al. (2021)  who show that a developed financial sector increases energy innovation, which reduces energy intensity and consequently GHG emissions in OECD countries. We also observe that a growing urban population increases access to electricity, reduces renewable energy consumption, and reduces energy intensity. 4.1 Robustness analyses We begin the robustness analysis by disaggregating globalization into its main dimensions, namely economic globalization, social globalization, and political globalization. The results in Table 7    suggest that economic globalization increases access to electricity and improves energy efficiency while its effect on renewable energy consumption is insignificant (columns 1, 4, and 7, respectively). More specifically, increased economic globalization is associated with increasing the proportion of the population with access to electricity by 0.131% and a reduction in energy intensity by 0.101%. This result suggests that economic and financial integration will enable African countries to mobilize resources to invest in electricity infrastructure, thus increasing the proportion of individuals enjoying access to electricity. Furthermore, the positive effect of economic globalization on energy efficiency is explained by the FDI component of economic integration. As noted by Aluko et al. (2021) , foreign investors generally have superior technologies to compete in the local market. These improved technologies significantly reduce energy consumption (Salim et al., 2017 ) and mitigate environmental degradation (Aluko et al., 2021 ). Hence, the technique and composition effects of economic globalization on energy use outweigh its scale effect. Social globalization does not have a significant effect on access to electricity (column 2). However, it significantly decreases renewable energy consumption and energy intensity (columns 5 and 8, respectively). Finally, political globalization - which refers to the diffusion of government policies - significantly increases access to electricity, the adoption of renewable energy, and improves energy efficiency. Of the three sub-indexes of globalization, the political dimension plays a dominant role in the simultaneous achievement of the goals of increasing access to electricity, renewable energy consumption, and improving energy efficiency (or reducing energy intensity). This can be explained by the fact that political globalization is more related international cooperation and the way governments implement international commitments on renewable energy consumption. Also, the reduction of energy intensity is principally influenced by policies that promote countries’ image as supporting the implementation and achievement of the SDGs. Further, the estimations in Tables 5 and 6  are replicated using the fully modified least squares (FMOLS) technique developed by Pedroni (1998). The estimates from the FMOLS are free from serial correlation, heterogeneity, and endogeneity of the regressors. The results reported in Table 7  show slight dissimilarities with the baseline findings. Except for social globalization, whose effect on access to electricity is insignificant, the other measures of globalization have positive and statistically significant coefficients. Also, political globalization increases renewable energy adoption while the effect of overall globalization on the other dimensions are negative and statistically significant. Finally, political globalization enhances energy efficiency and this result is in line with the findings in Table 6  while the effect of overall, economic, and social globalization on energy intensity is not statistically significant. Lastly, we distinguish between the flows of activities and the policies and rules that in principle enhance globalization. In line with Jaumotte et al. (2013) , the effects of de jure  and de facto  aspects of overall globalization on the outcome variables are estimated. The results reported in Table 8   show that both the de jure  and de facto  aspects of overall globalization increase access to electricity. However, the effect is stronger for de jure  measure, indicating that policies and rules that promote actual flows and activities of globalization matter more to the access to electricity than actual flows of activities. This result underscores the role of good institutions in the delivery of public goods. Hence, improving the institutional framework will enable African countries to leverage the positive effects of globalization on household access to electricity. Moreover, de jure  and de facto  globalization do not have a significant effect on renewable energy adoption and energy intensity. Turning to the aspects of globalization, the results in Table 8  show that de jure  economic, social and political globalization are relevant for access to electricity as their coefficient are all positive and statistically significant (Panel A). Hence, policies to promote trade and financial globalization are expected to exert a positive effect on electrification in Africa. Still, in Panel A, the de jure  social globalization significantly reduces renewable energy consumption. Further, the result in Panel B shows that de facto  social globalization reduces renewable energy and energy efficiency while de facto  political globalization increases electricity access and renewable energy consumption. These findings indicate that the effect of policies and conditions that enable globalization differ from the effect of actual international flows flow and activities. The findings establish that de jure  globalization matters the most in explaining changes in electricity access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency in Africa. However, a direct comparison of our results with extant studies is difficult as they did not account for the dimensions and aspects of globalization on energy poverty.   5 Conclusion and policy implications The study investigated the effect of globalization on energy poverty, with particular focus on access to electricity, renewable energy consumption, and energy efficiency. Data are for a sample of 42 African countries over the period 2000–2015. The results based on a fixed-effects model with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors show that globalization increases the share of the total population with access to electricity while its effect on renewable energy consumption and energy intensity is statistically insignificant. When segregating the overall globalization index into its main dimension, findings show that economic and political globalization improve access to electricity. However, social globalization reduces renewable energy while political globalization increases it. Also, both economic and social globalization improve energy efficiency. Finally, de jure  globalization explains more the changes in electricity access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency than de facto  globalization. These findings have some implications in order to alleviate energy poverty in African countries. Firstly, governments should develop policies to deepen the pace of globalization to make renewable energy more attractive to foreign investors. Despite Africa having the richest solar resources in the world, only 5 GW of solar PV are installed, which is less than 1% of the global capacity installed (IEA, 2019 ). Obviously, with the large reduction in cost of renewable energy generation, in particular, the costs for electricity from utility-scale Solar photovoltaic, the findings of the study should provide more impetus toward renewables adoption. Policies to enhance economic globalization through trade and FDI should be encouraged to help attract more investment in renewable energy and improve energy efficiency. Political globalization, governments should harmonize energy policies, regulate cross-border power trading and control the transfer of old and energy-inefficient technologies. Additionally, social globalization policies should help to create more awareness of the detrimental effects of using unclean energy sources. Awareness programs (audio and visual) will create a collective consciousness of the need to use energy sustainably and efficiently. In addition, increased spending on energy-oriented R&D will stimulate energy innovation and reduce energy intensity. The financial sector should also support energy-innovation technologies through credits at discounted rates. Also, governments should set mandatory levels of renewable energy in the energy mix of large companies. This also suggests that strong linkages to regional programmes and initiatives should be encouraged to enhance the benefits of globalization. Initiatives like the harmonized certification system to improve the skills of clean energy professionals in the ECOWAS region that is being piloted by Ghana and Senegal are in the right direction and should be appropriately harnessed. This will give a big leap or boost to solar energy adoption. Other initiatives on the continent, including the Africa Clean Energy Corridor and the West Africa Clean Corridor targeted at promoting renewable energy and regional power market, respectively should be closely monitored to ensure their success (See detailed discussion in IRENA, 2019 ) Finally, the findings of the study show that serious attention needs to be given to the issues discussed in the paper if significant progress is to be achieved. This is because the SSA population is expected to grow the most in the next two decades and economic growth prospects are forecast to be high in the same period which suggests that energy demand will be the greatest for the region compared to other regions of the world. Accordingly, achieving the SDGs associated with access to electricity, renewable energy, and energy efficiency should define the policy space on the continent. Future studies could disaggregate the different dimensions of globalization (eg., interpersonal, informational, and cultural globalization) to identify their specific effects on progress toward the SDG7.
