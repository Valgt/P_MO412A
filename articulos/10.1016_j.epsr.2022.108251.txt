                  Taking into consideration of substantial role of energy system and sustainable development goals (SDGs) in modern society, it is critical to analyse current situation and forthcoming renewable energy development strategies under the impact of COVID-19. For this purpose, this paper provides significant new insights to assess effective approaches, opportunities, challenges and future potential capabilities for the development of energy systems and SDGs under on-going pandemic and in case of a future global crisis. The digital energy systems with Industry 4.0 (I4.0), which provide noteworthy solutions such as enhancing energy efficiency policy, providing clean, secure and efficient energy and achieving SDG targets, has been discussed and evaluated. Integration of the smart grid (SG) architecture with blockchain-Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies is also offered. Alongside the various discussions, short-term, mid-term and long-term plans have been suggested in determining the well-defined renewable energy development and SDGs targets, struggling with climate change, transition to a more sustainable energy future and reaching global net-zero emissions. To achieve SDGs and provide more strong and sustainable energy systems under the continuing pandemic and in case of potential risk of forthcoming global crisis, this paper reveals significant perceptions that inform politicians and legislators in performing successful policy decisions.

Fig 44   Table 1 Identification of bottlenecks for RESs development.  Table 1   Bottlenecks Description and challenges   Economic and financial aspects • Economic and financial barriers comprise the approach to attain funds and conditions that arise due to the actions of a group of specific people that make slow the RETs implementation.  • The RETs have high initial costs compared to maintenance and fuel costs, but the high initial price does not permit end-users to adopt these technologies. Lack of financial sources for renewable energy projects (REPs) with a long payback period with no access to credit funds, loans unavailability and higher financial sources for conventional energy generation sources have slowed down their adoption [26 , 27 ].     Lack of social awareness • The adoption of the RETs for power generation has faced severe resistance [28] . This is due to the non-existence of awareness about the advantages of modern RETs and doubts about REPs feasibility [29 , 30 ].  • The preferences to adopt conventional fuels and lower cooperation from illiterate end-users to adopt distributed energy resources based electrical power generation resist the implementation of modern REPs.  • The population living in remote locations do not accept solar and wind-based generation due to less recognition and limited learning rate.  • The funding for RE-based projects includes elected persons and stakeholders in that region with less interest in the RETs [31] .     High capital or commodity cost • High capital or commodity costs have affected the production and investment prices of biofuels, solar PV modules and wind turbines around the world [32] .  • Renewable developers and manufacturers are influenced by rising commodity prices [32] .  • More distributed generation (DG) units can be integrated into the power systems in favour of the drop costs of the RESs such as solar PV and wind [33] .     Administrative, market and institutional barriers • Policy alone is not sufficient for the RETs development without an effective market and administrative system.  • Numerous policymakers have no awareness about the benefits of sustainable and clean energy resources.  • The ability of organisations should be improved to observe and resolve issues according to developing countries. The lack of coordination and cooperation among different authorising institutions results in a delay in the development of the REPs [34] .  • Institutional obstacles such as insurance companies and active banks for the REPs also made slow their implementation. In addition to this, an insufficient number of industries related to renewable energy based generation cause failure in the completion of these projects.  • There is no proper communication between end-users and retailers due to the left number of industries [35] . There is also no competition in market due to the fewer suppliers.  • The conflicts arising among different industries reduced the market size and quality of products used in the REPs [36] .     Social, cultural, and behavioural aspects • The shifting of end-users from conventional fuels to RESs has faced the public's resistance due to a lack of social acceptance and insufficient public awareness about the benefits of clean energy and a sustainable environment. This is primarily due to illiteracy and uncertainty is among users about the feasibility of REPs.  • People give preferences to fossil fuels due to lower developments in renewable technologies, less local support, and a lack of information [37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ].  • The variation in consumption patterns among different nature end-users in different seasons is a major challenge to integrate renewable energy in the existing power grid [41] .  • The adoption of demand response programs due to flexible demand intervals is also a big issue to adopt renewable energy based generation [31 , 42 ].     Policy, political and regulatory barriers • The REPs require proper policy formulation and political regulatory structures. Numerous legislative and political, constraints limit regional struggles in the REP implementation [43] . The transparent decision at all levels for implementing REPs is mandatory for several stakeholders involved.  • There are no consistent and detailed policies for the RETs implementation that cause a delay in clearance and public consent about these projects.  • Government officials’ corruption and political conflicts limit the proper execution of the REPs. The random changes in government and policies cause uncertainties among stakeholders due to variations in people's priorities for the RETs.     Geographical and environmental barriers • The natural conditions, land disruption and geographical place in an area constitute barriers for the development of the RESs [26 , 36 ].     Geographical climate conditions • Specific factors related to the location such as latitude, air quality and cloudy conditions have an influence on the efficiency of the solar PV system [26 , 36 ].  • The wind blowing speed and air density affect the performance of the wind power plants [26 , 36 ].     Renewable energy availability • Wind speed for wind power, sunny days for solar PV, water accessibility for hydro energy and biomass availability for bioenergy vary from location to location. Hence, the availability of RESs is of great importance for the development of RETs [26 , 36 ].     Land-use requirements • Land use policy can be a challenge to achieve a 100% renewable energy system [44 , 45 ].  • The criteria of the renewable energy system on land are crucial due to its major effect on the locations and investments [44 , 45 ].  • Land use requirements of solar PV and wind power plants are larger relative to fossil fuel or nuclear plants [44 , 45 ].     Lack of awareness and professional skills • Citizens living in remote locations relative to the developed areas are comparatively low familiar with the benefits of the RESs and RETs.  • Investments in the RETs require higher technical skills compared to conventional technologies [26 , 36 ].  • Adequate skilled personnel are required to provide the installation and management of the RETs [26 , 36 ].

Taking into consideration of substantial role of energy system and sustainable development goals (SDGs) in modern society, it is critical to analyse current situation and forthcoming renewable energy development strategies under the impact of COVID-19. For this purpose, this paper provides significant new insights to assess effective approaches, opportunities, challenges and future potential capabilities for the development of energy systems and SDGs under on-going pandemic and in case of a future global crisis. The digital energy systems with Industry 4.0 (I4.0), which provide noteworthy solutions such as enhancing energy efficiency policy, providing clean, secure and efficient energy and achieving SDG targets, has been discussed and evaluated. Integration of the smart grid (SG) architecture with blockchain-Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies is also offered. Alongside the various discussions, short-term, mid-term and long-term plans have been suggested in determining the well-defined renewable energy development and SDGs targets, struggling with climate change, transition to a more sustainable energy future and reaching global net-zero emissions. To achieve SDGs and provide more strong and sustainable energy systems under the continuing pandemic and in case of potential risk of forthcoming global crisis, this paper reveals significant perceptions that inform politicians and legislators in performing successful policy decisions.

To prevent the rapid increase of virus infection, lockdown at various levels results in closure of business, gross domestic product (GDP) decline and economic uncertainties [2] . The change in living style and economic variations during the on-going pandemic cause a significant reduction in worldwide electricity demand and affect the renewable energy sources (RESs) projects deployment. According to the international energy agency (IEA), the global energy demand has been reduced by 6% by the end of 2020 compared to 2019. The reduction in energy demand creates a reversing impact on electrical power systems compared to increasing electrical demand in past years [3] . The COVID-19 crisis has affected the renewable energy sector greatly. The decline in economic activities causes concerns among renewable energy developers due to less financial investments from the market and government sectors [4 , 5 ]. The reduction in global demand and transfer of government investments interests to prevent COVID-19 has postponed greatly renewable energy-related developments [6] . The closure of several wind power plants has a severe impact on renewable power development. On the other hand, the negative implications for solar energy development have been observed due to significant electrical demand reduction in the pandemic time frame. Several employers working in solar energy-related projects are greatly suffered as a result of these variations. The USA-based Morgan Stanley Company has planned to decrease solar projects to 28% and 17% in the 3rd  and 4th  quarters of 2020, respectively [7] . The unavailability of the supply chain causes disturbance in the completion of the worldwide on-going solar based projects. The coal-based power plants are shifted to gas-fired plants in Europe with the reduction of oil prices. The shifting of renewable-based projects toward fuel-level energy-based projects has created severe environmental concerns. The global renewable capacity has increased up to 2537 GW at the end of 2019 according to the international renewable energy agency (IRENA). Besides, according to the global wind energy council (GWEC), 70% of wind power installed in the USA, UK, China, and India in 2019 has been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The on-going installations are cancelled because accessories cannot be shipped from the manufacturers to other regions where projects are going on [8] . The extensive economic losses have arisen because the COVID-19 crisis harms renewable energy development. The consideration of renewables can achieve effective resolutions in the post-COVID-19 era. The usage of renewable energy technologies (RETs) can create jobs for unemployed people. The renewable sector has provided 11 million jobs in 2018, which can be expanded by the effective implementation of renewable-based projects to 84 million by 2050. The ending of US coal power can be replaced by renewable in the post-pandemic. The decentralized and remote control ability of renewable plays a vital role in disaster happenings like COVID-19 [9] . Many uncertainties that occurred during COVID-19 can be dealt with properly designing procedures and renewables based projects that minimize the financial and investments risks issues. According to the previous studies, researchers and academicians have determined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy from many aspects, but lacking a detailed evaluation of the overall pandemic influences on the recent status and progress on RETs, sustainable development goals (SDGs), blockchain technology, Internet of Things (IoT) technology, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), smart grid (SG), digitalization of energy systems, energy efficiency and climate change. The idea of the SG is represented as a modern view of the traditional grid system to achieve and an effectual fusion of green technology along with the RETs. The combination of the SGs with these applications provides new solutions to the issues of energy supply in the future. A study reported in [10]  has utilized custard sticks provided by the Taiwan government to analyse electricity consumption variations during the COVID-19. The Taiwan government has adopted some COVID-19 preventions and financial measures to assist renewable energy-based projects investors and on-going projects and to achieve a nuclear-free country and the target of electricity generation of about 20% with renewables by 2025. The authors in [11]  have explored the impact of COVID-19 on electrical demand, renewable energy sharing, solar energy projects and financial issues of power companies in India. It has been observed that in the first quarter of 2020, about 720 MW and 188 MW of solar and wind projects are initiated, which are about 70% less than the previous four quarters. Moreover, the commissioning of renewable-based projects in 2020 has been postponed in India. The pandemic has disrupted on-going and operational solar projects with lockdown restrictions. Furthermore, it has been explored that the Malaysian government has taken an initiative to control pollution during the COVID-19 era by implementing the law at the national level [12] . It has been examined that a significant improvement in renewable-based solar generation has been observed by controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution. Werth et al. [13]  have discussed the COVID-19 impact on the electrical sector in 16 European countries. Several indices and government COVID-19 infections tracers were used to compare generation transmission and distribution with load variations. It has been investigated that power generation is greatly influenced due to significant load variations during the restriction period of 2020. The analysis has been performed by making comparisons with previous years. A considerable reduction in generation via coal, nuclear, oil, and fossil fuels have been observed in Europe. However, no significant reductions in intermittent energy based generations like solar and wind have been sensed even in the critical durations. Besides, the energy transformations between European countries have been investigated that indicate both imports and exports of energy. Substantial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, some opportunities, and challenges on current and future sustainable energy strategies have been investigated in [3] . Gebreslassie [14]  investigates key challenges and opportunities and offers policy directions to deal with paragoned health and economic crisis and to provide reliable electricity. Elavarasan et al. [15]  propose as a guide to canalize the post-COVID-19 pandemic scenarios into the sustainable pathway and to carry out the SDGs. The impacts of the COVID-19 on energy consumption, renewable energy development, climate impacts and fluctuation of the energy market have been discussed and analysed [16] . Furthermore, the SGs development has resulted in many changes in the structure of the recent power grid. The new technologies, devices, RESs and electric vehicles (EVs) increase the requirements for data transactions and decentralized energy management (DEM) since the secure and economic transactions are achieved by the decentralized networks. Therefore, integration of blockchain technology in the SGs provides significant solutions for these modifications, an encouraging option to increase the share of renewable energy and supporting smart cities development [17–19] . Blockchain technology can be utilized as a tool to maintain transactions in the SGs, which are implemented with smart agreements and networks [17] . Hasankhani at al. [18]  present a comprehensive review to recognize all potential applications of blockchain technology in the SGs. Bhushan et al. [19]  have surveyed the state-of-the-art blockchain technology to find the answers to the security problems of smart cities. A proper blockchain structure based on peer to peer (P2P) energy trading between the microgrid (MGs) and SGs is suggested and discussed to develop a stochastic framework under uncertainty conditions in [20] . P2P energy trading is considered a powerful method for increasing the use of distributed energy resource utilization that provides networked MGs located in society to trade energy flexibly with each other [21] . In this paper, effective approaches, opportunities, challenges and forthcoming potential capabilities and significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been analysed for renewable energy development and the SDGs in detail. The literature investigations indicate that, until now, only a few researchers have addressed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy system, the SDGs and the environment. Hence, this study is purposes of completing the research gap in this area. To adequately handle the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the development of energy systems and the SDGs, micro-plans, intermediate-plans and macro-plans have been identified in providing the well-defined renewable energy targets, struggling climate change and on the move more sustainable energy future. The main focuses of this paper are outlined as:• The influences of digitalization on energy efficiency are discussed and addressed in detail.  • To combat and get control of the on-going pandemic and the potential risk of a future global crisis, the transition to digital energy systems, which fulfils significant solutions, has been discussed.  • Implementation and suggestions of the SDGs are presented and discussed during COVID-19 in wake of the COVID-19 era.  • With promoting distributed energy systems (DESs), short-term, mid-term and long-term goals are defined to reach global net-zero emissions.  • Industry 4.0 (I4.0) concepts are handled to manage growth towards the achievement of the SDG targets especially concerning the industrial sector.  • Applications of blockchain network in the SGs is classified and identified in various industries.  • Recent status and the future of the RETs have been addressed in detail.  • The positive and negative environmental impacts of the COVID-19 on renewable energy development are investigated and analysed.  • Potential impacts such as cyber resilience, climate resilience, flexibility, fuel security and adequacy for providing a secure supply of electrical systems are discussed and addressed.  • Integration, modernization and digitalization of energy systems to the smart grids are overviewed and offered.  • The bottlenecks and challenges for the deployment of the RETs are also described and identified.    The remainder of this paper is outlined as: Section 2  evaluates the current status and future prospects of renewable and non-renewable resources. Section 3  provides the importance of digitalization on energy systems and energy efficiency. In Section 4 , the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and the other factors in achieving SDG level is discussed. Section 5  highlights Environmental impacts, positive and negative impacts of the pandemic. In Section 6 , future directions of the RETs in wake of the COVID-19 era are handled. Section 7  provides several results, discussions and solutions. Section 8  finalizes this paper and ensures limitations and future directions.  2 The recent status and progress on RETs before and after pandemic: opportunities, bottlenecks, challenges and policy implications In this section, several opportunities, challenges and policy implications have been analysed and discussed for the recent status and progress on all renewable and non-renewable energy sources, separately before and after the pandemic. Fig. 1   summarises the DESs and non-RESs in detail. It is not feasible to depend on quickly depleting global warming contributors with non-RESs for long-term policy plans. Also, in recent years, the huge growth in renewable power capacity owing to their lowering cost and eco-friendly nature has attracted the attention of academicians and researchers concerning renewable energy-based distributed systems. Renewable power installations have created an essential part of economic stimulus packages during and post of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the COVID-19 crisis, renewable power generation proceeds with an increase in 2020 [22] . The RESs are the energy resources that most strong to COVID-19 [23] . Compared with coal, nuclear, gas and oil energy demand, the RES has been the least affected type during the COVID-19. Renewable electricity can be generated by different renewable technologies such as wind energy, hydro energy, solar energy photovoltaic (PV), concentrating solar power, geothermal energy, ocean wave energy and bioenergy as seen from Fig. 1  [24 , 25 ]. Various key obstacles for the development of renewable energy are real and perceived barriers that do not permit the deployment of the RETs. The description and identification of bottlenecks for RESs development are given in Table 1  . The serious variations of the growth rate of electricity production have not occurred even though the renewable industry has come up against serious disruptions of supply chains as a result of the lockdown and quarantine measures during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, hydropower (a relative 70.8%), bioenergy (a relative 64.1%), solar PV (a relative 27.8%) and wind (a relative 1.7%) have decreased as depicted in Fig. 2   (Source data used in Fig. 2 [46–50] ). Electricity demand is anticipated to rise by 4.5% in 2021, promoted by rebounding economic activity and rapidly increasing in leading emerging economies such as China as shown in Fig 3  a. In the United States, energy demand is expected to rise by about 2%, increased by colder temperatures and economic stimulus throughout the early months of 2021. The greatest consumers in the European Union such as Spain, Germany, Italy and France are expected to keep below 2019 levels with a rise of nearly 3% in 2021 failing to exactly compose for reductions of 4% to 6% in 2020 [24] . Record growing renewables driven by wind and solar PV, which in 2020 increased by 12% and 23%, respectively, merged with a reduction in electricity demand around the world, but nuclear power and fossil fuel-fired plants are in a hard spot in 2020 (See Fig. 3 b). Demand from non-RESs declined by over 3%. It can be seen in Fig. 3 b that coal was the tightest strike among all sources of electricity in 2020, down 440TWh (Source data used in Fig. 3 [51] ). Italy, Belgium and Austria have met well over record-high hourly portions of variable renewable energy (VRE) in contrast to last year, achieving nearly 63%, 67% and 70% instantaneous VRE, respectively (see Fig. 4  ). However, Germany had also a new record low in consequence of declining demand. Inversely, California and Texas have experience of VRE shares similar to last year (see Fig. 4 e and 4 f). These states experienced further hourly VRE shares before lockdown measures, demonstrating that in some cases variability as a result of climate change had more powerful impacts than reductions in electricity demand owing to COVID-19 (Source data used in Fig. 4 [52] ). 2.1 Hydrogen based energy Nowadays, hydrogen-based fuel cells have increased remarkably in research and practical implementations due to increasing power demand, the high investment cost of fossil fuel power plants rapid depletion of fossil fuels, environmental problems and the health public [53 , 54 ]. Therefore, hydrogen, the fuel of the future, is a large industry with a long history as part of the energy system. In the future, the entire cycle from generation to use can be foreseen to be entirely CO2 -free with generating hydrogen from the RES. As depicted in Fig. 5  , hydrogen is a very versatile fuel that can be generated via many different technological routes and from many different energy sources, consisting of fossil fuels, biomass and RES. Hydrogen can be transported over long distances and stored for long periods in practice. In addition to the traditional demand sectors, hydrogen has new applications as a clean fuel with the potential to provide GHG emissions savings in many sectors. Road transport (using in fuel cell EVs), power generation, domestic heat and industrial high-temperature heat have become sources of large hydrogen demand [55–57] . The chemical sector is also affected by the COVID-19 crisis, generating unpredictability over short-term expectations of future demands. Compared to 2019, methanol (7%) and ammonia (5%) producers estimated a decrease in demand in 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak has a strong impact on iron steel production (direct reduced iron-DRI), which is another large source of hydrogen demand [56] . As shown in Fig. 6  , hydrogen is very attractive for a wide variety of applications [57] . New solutions have to be found for generating carbon-neutral and, therefore, sustainable fuels to prevent climate change as a result of the global increase in CO2  emissions. Hydrogen can be transported in gas grids, cached, and re-electrified in gas turbines, fuel cell power plants, or combined cycles. As depicted in Fig. 7  , hydrogen demand has grown more than threefold since 1975, keep going to increase (Source data used in Fig. 7 [58] ).  2.2 Geothermal energy Geothermal energy is heat extracted within the sub-surface of the earth. According to its characteristics, geothermal energy can be utilized for many applications such as electric energy generation, ground source heat pumps, bathing and swimming, space heating, greenhouse and open ground heating, industrial process heating, aquaculture ponds and raceway heating and agricultural drying. However, for electricity generation, water or steams at high temperatures are required that is generally located close to tectonically active regions [59 , 60 ]. Three main technologies including dry steam, flash and binary plants are generally in use to produce electricity from geothermal reservoirs. Geothermal energy is a renewable and sustainable source of electricity and is environmentally friendly. Geothermal energy applications are not affected by weather conditions unlike solar energy and wind energy [24] . Geothermal power plants are not economical since the system efficiency of geothermal power plants is generally lower than the conventional thermal power plants [61] . The economic potential of geothermal heat and energy production can be evaluated in three steps as the theoretical potential; the technical potential and the economic potential [62]  (see Fig. 8  ). In 2019, geothermal capacity additions around the world became nearly 0.8 GW. As observed in Fig. 9  , the largest contributors were Turkey, Kenya and Indonesia, contributing for three-quarters of the additions. These three countries are anticipated to keep on with directing growth over 2020–2021. However, in different other countries, the COVID-19 crisis has given rise to delays in the development of policies owing to obstacles in strategic decisions required for projects to continue, and disconnection of the supply chain for machinery and materials around the world (Source data used in Fig. 9 [52] ).  2.3 Bio-energy Restrictions on human and industrial activities caused by the COVID-19 outbreak have resulted in unprecedented effects such as transportation, energy access, income and unemployment [63 , 64 ]. The recent lockdowns caused by COVID-19 have an impact on the transition towards clean cooking fuels. In particular, the financial situation of the rural areas is already bad and may not be able to meet the expense of and access clean cooking fuels during the restrictions. The household air pollution as a result of the use of polluting fuels intensifies their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases and therefore may boost the risk and severity of the COVID-19 infection [65] . Biomass is considered an alternative to fossil fuel resources and can provide multiple products and energy. Biorefineries enable the effective conversion of biomass into a wide variety of bioproducts and fuels as well as bioenergy. Biomass also can be considered a resource for sustainable economic development [66] . As shown in Fig. 10  , recent advances allow lower costs of processing more utilization of sustainable biomass and increased efficiency. Bioenergy can be taken into consideration as the most promising alternative for fossil energy with the potential to decrease GHG emissions. The flowchart of the evolutionary trajectories of biomass resources and associated with the GHG mitigation potentials are given in Fig. 11  [67] . In the total global bioenergy demand in 2050, solid bioenergy is almost 60%, liquid biofuels are around 30% and biogases is 10% as seen in Fig. 12   (Source data used in Fig. 12  and Fig. 13  [41] ). In the electricity sector in 2050, solid bioenergy demand is forecasted around 35 Exajoule (EJ). In the industry sector in 2050, solid bioenergy demand is estimated at almost 20 EJ. It is utilised to fulfil high-temperature heat requirements that cannot be simply electrified such as cement and paper production [68] . In the net-zero emission scenario, it is expected that higher than 60% of the 100 EJ of bioenergy supply in 2050 around the world acquires with sustainable waste streams comprising agriculture residues, forestry industry residues and organic municipal waste (see Fig. 13 ) [68] . It is estimated that the usage of conventional energy crops expands marginally between 2020 and 2030 but then drops to lower than 3 EJ by 2050 with the moving to advanced ethanol, biokerosene and advanced biodiesel, and the integration with carbon capture and storage [68] .  2.4 Solar energy Energy from the sun can be utilized in three main ways as solar thermal, PV energy and passive heat. Solar energy is one of the most common and significant types of RES. Solar energy can be gathered by the PV panels installed at power stations, on rooftops, in building walls and in parking lots [69] . The cost of solar PV cells has diminished steadily since the first solar cells have been manufactured with the fast development of PV cell technologies, advancements in power electronics and an increase in manufacturing scale [70 , 71 ]. Commercial PV modules are made of different PV cell technologies such as copper indium diesel, mono-crystalline, amorphous silicon and multi-crystalline (see Fig. 14  ). Moreover, the performance comparison of major types of PV panels is evaluated in detail in Table 2  [72] . Selecting a quality solar panel can be a very difficult task from the hundreds of different models and manufacturers. Different types of solar panels perform duties for different needs and purposes. In this review paper, a detailed description of the different types of solar panels can be found in Table 2 . On the other hand, the best solar panel manufacturers are listed in Table 3   according to quality, reliability, warranty and maximum efficiency [73] . Table 4   summarizes major types of PV panels with their appearance and equivalent circuit for each PV cell technology. The circuit model of PV cell technologies is classified based on calculating the accuracy of the model with the root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE (NRMSE). Authors in [74 , 75 ] have studied maximum power point error (MPPE), RMSE and NRMSE in detail. It can be observed in Table 4  that mono-crystalline and multi-crystalline are made of similar materials, therefore their optimal PV models are the same [76–78] . Among all the RES, solar PV generation can be evaluated as a technology breakthrough for energy generation due to its easily accessible and moderate lower cost [79] . In contrast to ocean wave energy and wind energy, the solar PV energy conversion system (PECS) does not include a mechanical energy conversion system, as shown in Fig. 15  . Solar cells generate direct current (DC) electricity from the sun's rays, which can be used to power devices or to recharge batteries [80 , 81 ]. The prices of solar PV modules increased from July 2020 to April 2021 owing to supply chain issues and rising commodity prices as shown in Fig. 16  . The value of several essential input materials also has risen for PV panel manufacturing, substantially. The prices of PV-grade glass raised by 50%, primarily because of the increasing demand for bifacial modules and the lateness of the modernisation of excessive-cost production lines. The prices of steel and copper also increased 40% from September 2020 to March 2021, raised by quick economic healing in China and other developing economies (Source data used in Fig. 16 [52] ). Having halted in 2018, solar PV capacity additions rise again by about 14% in 2019, achieving a record of 110 GW of recently installed capacity around the world. The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in construction delays and powerless than expected investment, necessitating revise capacity addition projections down by above15% for 2020. Actual and forecast values for solar PV capacity in China, United States, Europe, India and Brazil is observed and analysed in Fig. 17  [82] . In the United States, the yearly expansion in solar PV capacity over 13 GW in 2019 is the second-highest recorded until today as a result of the growing economic attraction of both residential PV systems and utility-scale projects. Besides, the annual increase is seen decelerating in 2020 as the impacts of the COVID-19 declined the prospects of distributed PV. In 2021, the growth of the distributed PV rebounds in the residential segment as consumers hurry to receive the benefit of the solar investment tax credit. For the second year in a row in 2019, deployment of annual PV lessened by 32% to 30 GW in China (Source data used in Fig. 17 [82] ). In Europe, compared with only 10 GW installed in 2018, solar PV additions almost doubled the previous year and achieved 17 GW in 2019. However, solar PV additions are put down to decrease in 2020 due to several trends:i) Unpredictability relating to strategy transitions,  ii) Extremely high growth in 2019,  iii) The economic influence of Covid-19 crisis on the business,  iv) Lockdown caused construction lateness.    In India, PV deployment is expected to lessen by 23% in 2020 compared to 2019, with the largest decline forecasted in distributed PV installations. However, in 2021, a rebound is anticipated with capacity additions passing 2019 levels. On the other hand, the PV market in Brazil increased more in 2019 than last year thanks to distributed installations. Merchant projects and government auctions support the growth of utility-scale in Brazil. Capacity promoted by auctions is forecasted to account for 45% of the increase in 2020 and 2021 [82] .  2.5 Wind energy The wind is produced by atmospheric pressure differences, which are driven by solar power [24] . Wind energy is a prominent source of environmental-friendly energy and has been one of the fastest-growing RES in the modern energy supply system in recent days [83 , 84 ]. The decrease in the growth rate of solar PV energy is also important in absolute value compared to the growth rate of wind energy. The renewable energy sectors have met supply chain disruption during the COVID-19 outbreak. The supply chain of wind energy is globally deployed [46 , 47 ]. A wind turbine can be classified according to the rotor diameter, the axis of rotation, the power capacity of turbines and power rating as depicted in Fig. 18  . The rotation of the axis of wind turbines can be classified into two categories, vertical axis wind turbines and horizontal axis wind turbines [85] . The individual size and the power rating of wind turbines have also increased dramatically. Developments of power electronics and emerging sizes of rotor diameter for the wind turbines between 1980 and 2020 are illustrated in Fig. 19  [86] . In addition to this, it has been estimated that the next generation of turbine technology could likely have about 20 MW with a 275 m rotor diameter by 2030. A typical configuration of a wind energy conversion system connected to electric grids is shown in Fig. 20  . The main components of the wind energy conversion system from wind to the utility grid are the rotor with the turbine blades, a gearbox, an electric generator, and power electronics converters. The input of a wind energy conversion system is the wind, which is transformed into mechanical energy by using the turbine. Afterwards, the turbine drives a generator, which is controlled by power electronic converters. The power electronic converters enable quite different roles in the wind energy conversion systems and various powers rating coverage's systems. An electrical energy conversion stage provides that the output currents are in phase with electric grid voltages [70] . The biggest suppliers of wind turbines with the size of rotor diameter, global market share and capacity are summarized in Table 5  . The companies from Europe, China and the United States have dominated the market shares. Globally wind capacity additions achieved nearly 114 GW in 2020 and nearly doubled 2019 growth as shown in Fig. 21  . (Source data used in Fig. 21 [52] ). The wind market in 2021is forecasted to be 30% weaker compared to last year even though still notably passing 2019 additions. It is anticipated that onshore and offshore growth is slightly lower in 2022. Having achieved a record of 10% in 2019, the offshore share of total wind lessened in 2020, but is expected to reach a record-breaking with 12% in 2021–2022 [52] .  2.6 Hydro energy Hydroelectric generation system (HGS) is a remarkably important source of renewable electricity, with a portion of 16%–17% of the total electricity generation in the world. The HGS are also one of the most developed RETs in many countries worldwide [87] . With the fast development of renewable resources, there is an increasing interest in utilizing hydroelectric energy systems as great candidates for smoothing the output of the RES since they have high ramp rates and may keep in view being “storage” devices with power shifting capabilities [88] . Furthermore, the use of hydro energy is important to reduce greenhouse carbon emissions. However, the development of HGS is mainly dependent on the economic and financial feasibility, which have to be assessed by cost forecasts before starting construction [89 , 90 ]. The HGS is a kind of typical electromechanical system that transforms hydropower energy into electricity. The process of energy conversion of the HGS and energy transmission is illustrated in Fig. 22  [91] . Hydro energy plants can be primarily classified into four functional categories: run-of-river hydropower, storage hydropower, pumped storage plants and offshore hydropower. Hydropower generation, which depends mainly on flow patterns, is susceptible to excessive climatic and hydrological events. The flows of the extreme river can overburden storage facilities and inundate small plants or endanger operations. On the other hand, long drought can notably decrease hydropower generation. A recent example shown in Fig. 23   is a hydroelectric generation in Turkey during a hard drought in 2020–2021. Hydropower capacity factors are 30%-lower than the monthly averages between December 2020 and February 2021, with historically low rainfall in the second half of 2020 (Source data used in Fig. 23 , Fig. 24 and Fig. 25   [92] ). With hydropower plants ageing to the major construction wave of the 1960s to the 1980s in numerous advanced economies, nearly 40% of plants around the world are at least 40 years old. As observed in Fig. 24 , however, regional dissimilarities are substantial with China having the youngest fleets and North America having the oldest fleets. Major renovation investments are needed to modernize and enhance their performance and flexibility. Investing in modernisation and digitalization and modernizing major equipment such as turbines and generators can outstandingly improve plant flexibility [92] . Annual hydropower capacity factors change notably across hydro fleets around the world, with nearly all traditional projects falling within the 25–80% range. The capacity factor of a plant is regulated by hydrological conditions; several plant-level variables with the inclusion of type run-of-river, reservoir or pumped storage, outage of planned or unplanned, requirements of minimum ecological flow and circumstances of market and policy. Annual averages run of river, reservoir and pumped storage for various countries are observed and analysed for one day in 2019 (see Fig. 25 ). As with many run-of-river plants, hydropower plants projected for baseload generation have one of the highest capacity factors, while peak generation installations can have capacity factors of nearly 10–15% [92] .  2.7 Ocean wave energy The energy obtained with ocean waves a source of renewable energy bares tremendous potential and the related technologies have continuously been enhanced during the last years [93] . The ocean waves are an important RES that can ensure significantly the electrical power supply for countries with coasts facing the sea [94] . Wave energy converters (WECs) are used to take hold of the energy from ocean waves and transform it into useful electrical energy using electrical generators. The electricity generation from WECs mainly varies synchronously with the wave movement. As shown in Fig. 26  , there are various ways to categorize WECs. The ocean wave energy conversion is based on the working principle of the primary conversion system and the secondary conversion system (the power take-off-(PTO) system) [95] . The ocean wave is transformed to electrical energy via primary and secondary conversions. Fig. 27   shows the ocean wave to the electrical conversion process. The primary conversion is a mechanical energy conversion system that consists of various methods like direct and indirect harnessing. The secondary conversion is electrical energy conversion which consists of the generators [96] . Many technologies have been accomplished and prototyped to harness the energy of ocean waves based on different PTO systems in different countries all around the world. Full-scale sea trials of WECs are summarized in Table 6   based on the oscillating water column, overtopping, attenuator hydraulic system and direct drive of wave energy conversion. These categories are presented and classified with related to the testing location, rated power, control strategies and conversion systems [93] . Globally total of 23.3 MW of wave energy and 36.3 MW of tidal stream has been delivered cumulatively since 2010 as depicted in Fig. 28  a and 29  b. No projects have been postponed as with the tidal sector during the COVID-19 crisis and the wave energy devices essentially anticipated in 2020 will be commissioned in 2021 (Source data used in Fig. 28 [97] ). The cost of energy will decrease significantly with deploying more wave and tidal capacity. As observed in Fig. 29 , the strategic energy transition (SET) plan targets are implemented to cost reduction curves of tidal and wave to identify essential deployment. The cost reductions of ocean energy will be the same as wind and other RETs (Source data used in Fig. 29 [119] ).  2.8 The impact of the high commodity, energy and shipping prices on the RESs Energy prices and high commodities result in substantial uncertainties for renewable manufacturers and developers. Higher prices have caused the reducing equipment purchases in the first quarter of 2021 due to announcing fewer orders by the numerous manufacturers. Higher prices have also affected the margins of wind and solar PV equipment manufacturers. Increasing commodities, the prices of energy and shipping have led to raising the cost of producing and transporting biofuels, solar PV modules and wind turbines around the world. However, the costs of wind and solar PV keep lower than fossil fuel sources considering increasing costs and contract prices. As depicted in Fig. 30  , the investment costs of onshore wind and utility-scale solar PV has been forecasted nearly 25% higher compared to commodity prices in 2019. Higher costs of wind plants and solar PV have induced distinct challenges for manufacturers and developers (Source data used in Fig. 30 [120] ). It is estimated that some costs reductions for solar PV and wind will be removed if commodity costs keep higher until 2022. In order to establish the same amount of capacity, the rising prices would need about USD 100 billion of extra investment [121] . Increasing coal and natural gas prices have resulted in electricity prices around the world. As shown in Fig. 31  , from January to October 2021, average electricity prices are higher compared to values declared in 2019 and 2020 in Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and Spain [121] . Considering higher historic equipment prices and high energy and commodity prices, higher coal and natural gas prices have boosted the competitiveness of solar PV and wind. Governments have performed no crucial changes in their plans or postponed auctions to provide the proceed deployment of the RESs (Source data used in Fig. 31 [121] ).   3 Digitalization of energy systems and energy efficiency Digitalization delineates foremost to promotion volumes of data, the expanding application of information and communications technology (ICT) across the economy, more connectivity between humans, devices and machines and rapid progress in advanced analytics. The digitalisation of energy systems introduces technologies and provides new sources of detailed data that contributes to revenue streams and new business models and introduces technologies. With the pandemic, digitalization changes the global power and energy system with deep influences on both energy demand and supply. While the COVID-19 crisis has created dramatic impacts on the world economy, people and business activities, digitization fulfils significant solutions for many companies to comply and get control of the current situation [122–125] . The impact of digitalization on the demand side is complicated. Digitalization recommends a holistic, system-wide perspective of energy efficiency is required, including both demand-side flexibility and traditional end-use efficiency. Although digital devices potentially come up with large developments in energy efficiency for the industry sectors, buildings and transport, the widespread presence of more devices and servers to house the data result in large net increases in energy use unless the energy is controlled carefully. However, the crucial challenges for governments or policymakers are to conduct it in a way that increases the benefits for the energy system and decreases negative impacts. As delineated in Fig. 32  , digital technologies increase end-use efficiency and system efficiency by preventing investments in energy infrastructure, enhance the integration of renewables and reinforce energy security [122–125] . Distributed energy resources such as solar PVs, building-level energy storage, smart EV charging, smart demand response and energy efficiency become gradually more critical. Therefore, digitalization energy provisions have great potential to modify and develop energy efficiency policies with ensuring better information and a much clearer vision on distributed energy resources. New policy design options can be facilitated to grant markets for energy efficiency with utilizing at a much greater scale. Digitalised power systems can make use of demand-side flexibility to provide electricity with the lowest emissions, the lowest cost, at the right time and in the right place while maintaining users comfort. Digital energy efficiency policies are categorised as i) smart meters, ii) targets, plans and framework legislation, iii) buildings, iv) transport and v) demand response. On the other hand, the digital transformation of energy efficiency strategy performs a primary role in the transition to net-zero CO2  emissions. Global energy demand is estimated at around 8% in 2050 lower compared to today, but providing an economy twice as large with 2 billion more people. The role of digitalization will be critical with the expanding the scope and scale of energy efficiency via electrification, fuel switching and behavioural change because energy efficiency is one of the major actions needed to reach climate targets [122–125] . Historical energy intensity data, in accord with historical economic data, are beneficial to estimate trends in the years directly following the crisis despite the fact that energy intensity is not possible to be a well-founded indicator of energy efficiency progress during the pandemic crisis. As depicted in Fig. 33  , energy efficiency investment dropped by around 9% in 2020 and estimating the slow rate of energy intensity enhancement will maintain into 2021. Energy intensity data and historical GDP recommend that great drops in the GDP incline to be pursued by drops in the forthcoming energy intensity improvement rate like those occurring in 2020. While the global GDP was growing at over 5% per year in 2006 and 2007, drop to 3% in 2008 then to zero in 2009 (Source data used in Fig. 33 [123] ). The drops in the GDP and variations in the energy intensity show that economic depressions can suppress energy intensity developments on the other side of the intimate period of the economic downturn [122–125] .  4 Impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the SDGs A sustainable environment is the basic need of today's globe and human well-being. The 17 SDGs related to poverty, environment, and resources were approved by 193 countries summit in 2015 to develop the economy, environment, and society in the upcoming 15 years [126] . The SDGs acquire the collective efforts of governments, social groups and special agencies with the up-gradation of scientific technologies and tools [127] . There are many studies related to SDGs development in some regions and particular fields, but it needs significant improvements [128] . 4.1 The SDGs implementation during COVID-19 Several of the SDGs are not adequately implemented as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Less developed countries have been highly affected by the COVID-19 in all aspects of social and economic development [129] . China, South Africa, Brazil, India, and the organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD) regions are also affected by COVID-19, but they pay more attention to the SDGs. In these countries, limited infrastructure growth performed reforms in health and social sectors [15 , 130 ]. According to the SDG development report [128] , the SDG index is high for Western Europe North America, which is included in OECD countries, but its value is relatively low in less developed regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. Brazil, Russia, China, South Africa, and India have a median SDG index value, but China has the highest value. Electricity demand has been decreased by 30% on average due to lockdown on a monthly basis in most of the regions. The reductions in demand increase electricity generation from renewables and low carbon resources compared to other generating sources. In 2020, the low carbon sources generation share was observed to expand about 40% of the record level compared to coal-fired units. Renewables such as wind and solar provide a 9% greater share in generation in 2020, two times as compared to 2015. A decrease of 7% and 10% in gas-fired and coal-fired generations is observed in 2020 due to the pandemic crisis [131] . The CO2 emissions rise greatly due to the use of low-carbon sources which should be around 4% yearly basis to 2030 to reach SDGs. In the fulfilling SDG context, in 2000–2040, the carbon intensity of electricity generation in various regions and share of electricity generation share by sources are visualized in Fig. 34  . Low-carbon and renewables share is a significant measure of clean energy transition progress in the energy sector. Therefore, a deep energy sector transformation is required to align with the SDGs such as expanding energy access, limiting CO2 emissions and reducing air pollution. It can be observed in Fig. 34  that 37% of electricity generation is obtained by low-carbon technologies in 2019. The obtained electricity generation by coal decreases affectingly to 16.5% in 2030 and 6% in 2040. After a 1% fall in 2018, in 2019, the carbon intensity of electricity generation dropped a further 2.5% to an approximated 463 gCO2/kWh as depicted in Fig. 34 b. Nevertheless, the fall in the average carbon intensity of electricity generation should speed up to 5.6% per year to attain the SDGs level of nearly 240 gCO2/kWh by 2030 (Source data used in Fig. 34  [132 , 133 ]).  4.2 Suggestions to acquire SDGs in wake of the COVID-19 era The COVID-19 crisis offers opportunities, motivations and challenges to attain SDGs. For underdeveloped countries, if social crises arise due to the pandemic are not handled through appropriate policy, it may increase unemployment, discrimination, and inequality [134] . It is vital to propose some solutions related to demand side management and optimal energy handling for integrated energy systems [31 , 135 ]. That is why it is mandatory to focus and adjust a path for the SDGs implementation in wake of the COVID-19 era. The SDGs and suggestions are summarized to achieve these goals in the post of the pandemic as shown in Fig. 35  .   5 Environmental impact of the COVID-19: renewable energy and climate change The COVID-19 crisis has suspended the whole globe, so there have been significant alterations in economic and environmental conditions. In the short term, factories, roads, and office buildings get empty. However, in the long term, COVID-19 implications are considerably uncertain [136] . The pandemic has greatly affected worldwide economics, with widespread lockdowns and restrictions remaining even when lockdown limitations have been relaxed. Gatherings, travelling, meetings, and conferences have been greatly limited. The great news is that GHG emissions and local air pollutants reduce with lessening electrical energy demand. Fig. 36   visualizes the declining energy utilization and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions during COVID-19. It can be observed that the largest decrease in energy utilization can be seen for jet fuel and gasoline of about 50% and 30%, respectively. However, the usage of natural gas is decreased by 20% in residential and commercial areas. In general, electrical demand has lessened by 10%. The commercial and industrial sector is influenced by lockdown, but the consumption in the residential sector has increased as a result of staying people at home. Furthermore, the total decrement of about 15% in CO2 emissions has been owing to the largest reductions in jet fuel and gasoline. The local air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO2 ) and particulate matter (PM) are reduced to 12% and 1%, respectively. On the other hand, the reduction in traffic accidents has also been observed during lockdown limitations. The EVs sales are declined by 43% in 2020. The new residential rooftop, solar, and storage installation have also been decreased. That is why renewable developments have been slowed. Overall, clean energy jobs are reduced by 600,000 by the end of April 2020 (Source data used in Fig. 36 [137] ). COVID-19 lockdown restrictions have produced a dramatic change in the environment because the demand for oil and other dirty fuels has been limited with the closure of industries and transportation systems. The pollution has lessened to 30% in Spain and the USA. Delhi, the most polluted city in India, has observed 40 to 50% improvement only after four days of lockdown restrictions. Brazil shows a reduction of CO2  levels from 30 to 48%. Moreover, it has been explored that 91% of the world population lives where air quality exceeds allowable limits. WHO provides the data in 2016 that the worldwide deaths have exceeded 8%, especially in Asia, Europe, and Africa, because of bad air quality [138] . The outcomes of the pandemic provide the importance of clean energy resources and renewable energy sector developments. It has been investigated that a significant decrease in concentrations of NO2  and PM has been observed in the major Chinese cities during the lockdown. In other regions of the world like Europe, there is a significant improvement in air quality. The researches on the impact of COVID-19 show that existing energy schemes are under pressure. There is an opportunity for renewable-based energy, so industries can expand their business to supply sustainable energy to homes and health facilities [139 , 140 ]. The share of renewable energy can be increased to handle the on-going pandemic [14] . The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on renewable energy development in terms of both positive and negative aspects are outlined in Fig. 37  [16] . The electrical power system also has consequential impacts on the environment. A large amount of GHG is generated due to the production of fossil fuels. The COVID-19 has intensified the quality of air by decreasing carbon emissions. In addition, Fig. 38   shows more the positive impact of the COVID-19 on the environment. In 2018, about 27% of the GHG were emitted from the electricity sector, according to the USA environmental protection agency [141] . In addition to this, electricity generation is also responsible for the generation of air pollutants. That is why changes in electrical demand have contributed significantly to air quality alterations. Tokazhanov et al. [142]  have been examined that global CO2  emission is reduced by 6% approximately in the first quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19. The duration and severity of the pandemic are positively related to the reductions of gaseous emissions has been evaluated in [143] . In 2020 full-year, emission reduction is predicted to be about 2.6Gt (−8%) compared to the previous observations of 0.4Gt in 2009. Furthermore, the emissions of major air pollutants are significantly reduced during the pandemic. The average concentration of atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) is 26% lower as compared to past years in the UK. Also, reducing these significant pollutants is declined to about 50% in major cities of the UK like Cardiff and London [144] . The concentration of PM2.5 is reduced by 25–30% as compared to 2019 and 2018 in China [145] . However, momentary gaseous emissions lessening can only be an apparent phenomenon, just like, in 2010, CO2  emission return to normal by 1.6Gt soon after the ending of the economic emergency. During a pandemic, the primary concern of authorities is drawn to health issues without considering climatic impacts. The planned environmental agreements and well-recognized policies might also be disregard during the COVID-19 [146] . It is unrealistic to moderate climatic effects and cleans energy transition by reducing only human goings-on [147] .  6 Future of the RETs in wake of the COVID-19 era The economic recessions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are extensive, with a reverse impact on the development of the RETs. However, adopting renewables and intelligent reactions can conduct considerable solutions and great opportunities during the post-COVID-19 era. The recent reduction in oil prices and the unpredictability of revenues on the investment of fossil fuel have resulted in renewable energy businesses being evenstronger [148] . The impact of gas and oil prices reduction on the RESs can make it more difficult and different especially by region and the type of renewables in the post-COVID-19 era. On the other hand, industries can be resuscitated by rearing up the RETs and providing several new works for unemployed people. Employment has created with 11 million jobs worldwide in 2018 in the renewable and sustainable energy sectors and it is estimated in all fields of renewables by 2050 that expand to more than 84 million jobs [148 , 149 ]. Three styles including micro-plans, intermediate-plans and macro-plans from the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic with an insight into the future can be addressed. Micro-plans attempt to take lessons from past mistakes in renewable energy management and project a modern and right program for conditions like COVID-19. An effort is performed to decide a certain strategy to escalate the efficiency of methods and programs to lessen the cost of new technologies in renewable energy sectors in intermediate-plans. In this area, employees and experts are developed and machine learning and artificial intelligence are utilized to digitalize energy-related processes. In macro-plans, incentive policies are constituted to provide people's interest in these technologies and advantageous investment plans for renewable energy sectors. Developing artificial intelligence and providing people's workplaces and homes with smart and digital can be effective. Furthermore, investing in renewable technologies to maximum use of the workforce and taking into account the renewable energy sector can provide remarkable solutions considering the COVID-19 crisis [150] .  7 Results, discussion and solutions The RESs have promoted the development of sustainable development and the global economy. However, renewable energy industries and sustainable development have been influenced badly in nearly all the countries in the world. The following strategic discussions and solutions can be addressed to recover in wake of the COVID-19 crisis. 7.1 Move to digital energy systems Digitalization is crucial to transition to the decentralization of the energy system. To meet global issue and the SDG targets and to restrict climate change, energy systems globally has changed progressively as decentralised low carbon generation or renewable resources such as associating with digital or “smart” technologies and connecting with new types of loads including EVs, storage and heat pumps [151] . These transformations influence the development, regulation and management of forthcoming energy systems and ask how they will promote a socially equitable, supportable, net-zero transition. The energy systems can evolve sustainability, productivity, reliability and accessibility through digitalization. The main drivers of the digital energy system are data, connectivity and analytics. As depicted in Fig. 39  , the combination of smart meters and sensors as well as the improvement of recent methods and strategies for managing remote control of energy generation and consumption can help proceed to modern and digital energy systems. Different major sectors are utilized from the digital energy systems. The electricity generation network with data analytics and connectivity for the power sector can help decrease the cost of power generation, operation and management as well as increasing energy efficiency and decreasing fuel consumption. Residential and commercial buildings can also benefit from the digital energy system. The usage of smart meters and control systems can provide observe, control and decrease energy consumption. Furthermore, the deployment of digital solutions can enhance a reduction in energy consumption for transportation. Automation, sharing, connectivity and electrification can restate mobility and are likely to have an effect on the energy demand. On the other hand, for industrial applications, digitalization can develop industrial process controls and increase energy efficiency measures to decrease energy consumption. The growth and usage of digital manufacturing and 3D printing can also promote substantial materials and energy demand savings [152] .  7.2 Nex-generation distributed and low carbon energy system Policymakers enterprise to transition with regarding a sustainable and low-carbon energy sector, with the growing concern over climate change. Conventionally, various types of energy systems are planned and operated individually, negation possible synergies. Multiple energy systems (MESs) or DESs can utilize synergies among various energy sectors to make the best of overall efficiency. The MESs can compromise RESs and decline carbon emissions more economically than in systems where each energy sector is designed and exploited individually. The profit of carbon emission reduction provided by MES or DES arises not only from the additional flexibility in compromising RESs but also from the cascade usage of energy to prevent waste. That's why; DESs withdraw more and more awareness and have been evolving quickly in recent years in many countries. Academics, industries, politicians and governments pin considerable hope on the DESs as a crucial enabler of the decline in carbon emissions and the combination of the RESs. Many countries have set aggressive emission reduction targets [153–155] . Governments or policymakers have been required to achieve reliable step‐by‐step programs to attain their net-zero goals, establishing reliance among citizens, industry, investors and other countries. Providing net-zero emission is an enormous mission with population growth and an increasing economy. They must provision long‐term policy frameworks to authorise all branches of government and stakeholders to design for change and simplify a tidy transition. As shown in Fig. 40  , in the net-zero emissions, governments or politicians keep going on by setting unambiguous long‐term goals, achieving that these are exactly promoted by short‐term targets and strategy measures that expressly show the pathway. They identify each country's individual beginning conditions to assist the evolvement of technologies and new infrastructure [156] . The foreseen trends in CO2 emissions can be a result of changes in the mix of fuels, technologies and the amount of energy used. As depicted in Fig. 41  , the globally total energy supply increases by only over 30% between 2020 and 2050. Without a stipulated annual average decrease of 2.2% in energy intensity, the total energy supply will be nearly 85% higher in 2050 (Source data used in Fig. 41 [156] ).  7.3 Achieving the SDGs with industry 4.0 I4.0 can be utilized to diminish issues and achieve solutions for providing our way of life with sustainable products and services. I4.0 is dependent on the digitization of industries and has increased the expectation for substantial developments in productivity, customer satisfaction and quality. The fundamental aim of I4.0 is to enhance the efficiency and answerableness of the manufacturing system. The technology achieves a substantial role in economic development, sustainable social and environmental through I4.0. I4.0 makes it possible to provide a high level of process integration and promoting development in organisational performance on economic, environmental and social dimensions [157 , 158 ]. On the economic side, I4.0 conduces violently on promoting increased customer satisfaction, value creation, product customisation and manufacturing flexibility. On the environmental side, the real-time information collected from different value chain partners provides that the companies assign efficiently their manufacturing resources, such as water, products, materials and energy. On the social side, I4.0 provides plentiful opportunities for employees to acquire advanced technologies, thus increasing morale and motivation. The innovation and technological progress eventuate in transformations interchanging from the single sphere to communities and all supply chains. Cutting-edge technologies inserted in I4.0 concepts can manage growth towards the accomplishment of the SDG targets particularly concerning the industrial sector. The uptrend of new digital industrial technology called I4.0 is a transformation that is included by nine fundamental technology advances as shown in Fig. 42  . Workpieces, sensors, information technology systems and machines are joined with the value chain beyond a single enterprise [159 , 160 ].  7.4 Providing a secure supply of electricity Governments and regulators are required to proceed to renovate the legitimate and organizing requirements on all stakeholders to supply that electricity security is preserved opposing these changes while the electricity system keeps going to develop as a result of the energy transition and emerging trends such as cyber threats, fuel security and climate change. Flexible electricity systems can handle damage and loss as a result of climate impacts. As shown in Fig. 43  , in this paper, the climate resilience of electricity systems has been considered with inverse impacts of climate change. A certain conceptual structure for the climate resilience of the electricity system can provide policymakers better determine climate resilience as a part of electricity security. It describes the crucial side of the climate resilience of electricity systems like robustness, skilfulness and recovery (Source data used in Fig. 43 [161] ). The electricity system is becoming progressively substantial to the operation of modern economies since it is crucial to a scale of critical services such as banking, healthcare and transportation. Thus, a secure supply of electricity is of the greatest importance. Threats to electricity security have developed associated with the functioning of the power system. New frameworks are required to passage to higher shares of the VRE, expand interconnected devices and deal with the variation pattern of extreme weather conditions to provide that power systems maintain security [162 , 163 ]. Digitalization provides many advantages for clean energy transitions and electricity systems. The rapid growth of grid tied the RESs and devices is increasing the potential cyber-attacks surface at the same time, while expanded connectivity and automation along the system is increasing risks to cybersecurity [161] . Cybersecurity has been a vital attention area for utilities for decades because of roles acted by them as suppliers of essential services and operators of critical infrastructure systems. Cyber-attacks with their considerable aim being to induce extensive infrastructure failures have the potential to disrupt the power grid of a country. Modern smart grid systems are seriously reliant on the ICT and this dependency brings with them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The cyberattack issues have expanded in recent years leading to major damage to power systems. Therefore, cyber detection, protection and control techniques are becoming crucial to determine and rectify any such cyber attacks for a stable and reliable operation in smart grid systems [164–167] . On the other hand, rapid growth in the VRE lends a hand to lessen traditional fuel security concerns, but it requires a fast rise of flexibility in the power systems. The trends and potential impacts of the electricity system are discussed and addressed based on diverse aspects of electricity security in Table 7  [161] .  7.5 Integration of the smart grid with blockchain technology The SGs with achieving a self-managing feature is different from traditional grids to ensure more reliable grids. The SGs combine IoT, advanced ICT and smart algorithms that conduct demand-side energy (DSE) requirements in real-time [168 , 169 ]. The SG includes various components such as energy sensors, static var compensators (SVC), energy management system (EMS), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and smart relays. The SG can handle various issues of traditional grids such as unidirectional power flow, in-efficient energy metering, constant tariff with consumption variation. The SG with utilizing the RESs plays a crucial role in our society to generate clean electricity. Sustainable RESs are used to fulfil the increasing demand for electricity. However, the RESs are resting on weather conditions and add complexity to normal grid operations [170 , 171 ]. Data collected from the SG are required to facilitate solar panels and wind farms, to provide energy onto the grid and optimize its use and satisfy persistently changing energy demands. Utility grids are dependent on manual switching and complex power distribution schemes to provide power flowing to their customers. Any disturbance such as storms, sudden changes in electricity demand and bad weather can result in outages. The distribution intelligence of the SG can withstand these outages and energy fluctuations by automatically determining the problem in redirecting and restoring power delivery [172] . On the other hand, other smart building technologies can be expanded to interact with the SG to accomplish demand flexibility and energy efficiency along with ensuring valuable grid services and fulfilling resident requirements for healthy indoor environments and comfortable. Some of these SG technologies comprise tunable phase change materials and dynamic building envelopes [173] . The usage of blockchain technology in the SG can provide several benefits to recent future energy systems. The primary advantage of utilizing blockchain is to provide a decentralized commerce substructure. Other important advantages of combining the SG with blockchain technology are to achieve the security system, decentralizes trust, present more robust resilience, increase capacity of the energy system, ensure high scalability, minimal bureaucracy and better transparency. Fig. 44   describes a conceptual structure of the integration of the SG with a blockchain platform and the other areas of applications [168 , 174-177 ]. Blockchain technology is offered as a viable solution to meet a lot of SG requirements, taking account of data transactions and decentralized energy resources. The integration of a blockchain network into the SG achieves the community to manage transactions in the system in an agreement way [16 , 17 ]. Besides, the development of blockchain technology in SG influences environmental issues from two different perspectives. Firstly, the development of blockchain technology expands the RESs, which reduce the amount of carbon emission. Secondly, the mining operation of blockchain increases enormous energy consumption in academia, society and business. On the other hand, a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach based on the SGs can promote the RESs and ensure economic usefulnesses for both the consumers and the prosumers. However, the rapid growth of blockchain and the encouraging aspect of P2P-based SGs need a cautious study and the right structure design. Moreover, the P2P energy trading between the renewable energy-based consumers and prosumers is fulfilled by the blockchain based EMS. EVs also attend blockchain platform based P2P energy trading, which utilizes the smart agreement, simultaneously. Implementation of blockchain technology in the SGs can be classified into various areas, consisting of the smart agreements and demand response, cybersecurity, EVs, the IoT, the DEM, P2P the energy trading, the testbeds and the environmental issues [17 , 18 , 178 , 179 ].   8 Conclusion, limitations and future directions In this paper, modernization and digitalization of the energy systems based on viable prospective technologies are offered to control the pandemic, promote the SDGs, provide renewable energy development and prevent a possible future global crisis. Several challenges, opportunities and implementation of the policies have been discussed and analysed for renewable and non-renewable energy resources during, before, and post COVID-19. The results show that the pandemic has conducted opportunities, motivations and challenges to promote sustainable energy transitions, to achieve the SDGs, to design a high energy-efficiency and net-zero carbon future. The main findings and investigations are finalized as follows:• Modernization and digitalization of energy systems provide improvements in energy efficiency, integrates variable renewables and increases cost savings of energy systems.  • It has been explored and observed that the RESs generation sector is least affected compared to generation from coal, gas, nuclear energy and oil during the pandemic.  • The prices of the PV modules and wind energy-related accessories were boosted due to supply chain issues.  • Generation from chemical sources and geothermal energy has shown a decline in developments owing to the delay in policy implications caused by the COVID-19 crisis.  • The dramatic impacts on the environment have been overviewed and observed as a result of the closure of industries worldwide resulting from the pandemic.  • The SG engineering, which is a renovated electrical grid that utilizes analogue or digital ICT, is offered to provide the use of widespread energy resources.  • The role of I4.0 and digital technologies has been discussed to achieve the SDGs and to enhance energy efficiency.  • Descriptions of the integration of the SG with blockchain and enabled with IoT and P2P energy trading are also offered.  • The SDGs implementation is not attained properly under threat of the pandemic.  • The impacts of the pandemic and other factors on renewable energy development and the SDGs are identified and investigated.  • Secure supply of electricity systems is also analysed and discussed in terms of cyber resilience, climate resilience, flexibility, fuel security and adequacy.  • Bottlenecks have been assessed for development of the RETs.    The outcome of this study is to promote the researchers, academicians, professionals, planners and operators to recognise the contributions of the technologies in controlling the pandemic and further, to promote the application of these technologies in the near future. Besides, this study achieves valuable perceptions that can be utilized in various future studies. Future directions, suggestions and solutions are also given as:• With the promotion of new renewable generation resources and production technologies having a well-planned production process, higher perspectives of contributing policies and legal frameworks aimed for global net-zero emissions will be achieved.  • Short-term, mid-term and long-term policy goals promoting investment in the RETs and SDGs bring a potentially higher return and more advantageous in enhancing the socio-economic conditions during on-going pandemic and in case of a possible future crisis.  • Governments or politicians can increase investment and production duty credits and incentives to comply with the development of clean energy projects in the post-pandemic.  • A wide variety of building energy efficiency enhancement measures can be taken.  • Drone technology can also be utilized to assist the transportation of goods or basic requirements with the appropriate network of communication between the public as well as using it primarily in the military and other applications [180 , 181 ].  • Robotics technologies can provide appreciable assistance in the healthcare system with encouraging solutions to keep human interaction to a minimum [180 , 181 ].
