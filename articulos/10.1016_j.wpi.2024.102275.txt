                  Biotechnology, the fifth technological wave preceding the sixth wave of Sustainability, is crucial for achieving the 2023 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in biodiverse Brazil. This review uses composite indicators to compare Brazil with the USA across static and temporal evolutions. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4 and 5 were assessed using patents from 2000 to 2019. Patents from 2000 to 2019 reveal a TRL gap at 4–5 in Brazil, skewed towards academic articles (TRL3), indicating lag behind the USA at TRL5. Brazil's patent growth rate surpasses the USA's by eightfold. Specialization between Brazilian academia and the nation converges. The revealed technological advantage and the distance between academies and between countries are nearing unification. Brazil focuses on SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) but must intensify efforts on SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG13 (Climate Action), SDG14 (Life below Water), and SDG15 (Life on Land). The USA concentrates its technologies in SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being). USA's modern biotech navigates the fifth wave, while Brazil's traditional biotech must modernize, focusing on SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG17 (Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development), requiring government policies for mid-range TRLs.

Biotechnology, the fifth technological wave preceding the sixth wave of Sustainability, is crucial for achieving the 2023 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in biodiverse Brazil. This review uses composite indicators to compare Brazil with the USA across static and temporal evolutions. Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4 and 5 were assessed using patents from 2000 to 2019. Patents from 2000 to 2019 reveal a TRL gap at 4–5 in Brazil, skewed towards academic articles (TRL3), indicating lag behind the USA at TRL5. Brazil's patent growth rate surpasses the USA's by eightfold. Specialization between Brazilian academia and the nation converges. The revealed technological advantage and the distance between academies and between countries are nearing unification. Brazil focuses on SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) but must intensify efforts on SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG13 (Climate Action), SDG14 (Life below Water), and SDG15 (Life on Land). The USA concentrates its technologies in SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being). USA's modern biotech navigates the fifth wave, while Brazil's traditional biotech must modernize, focusing on SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG17 (Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development), requiring government policies for mid-range TRLs.

It is essential to introduce technologies from the sixth technological wave in fields such as environmental and industrial policy, bioeconomy, and circular economy [3 ]. Biotechnology utilizes biological systems, organisms, and their derivatives to innovate and sustainably tackle socio-economic and environmental challenges. This multidisciplinary field encompasses primarily molecular biology, chemistry, microbiology, and informatics, with applications across various industries [4 ]. The sustainability vision of bioeconomy solutions enhances the capacity to expedite progress towards achieving the SDGs, which face threats from the impacts of the climate crisis, conflicts, a weakened global economy, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [5 ,6 ]. For SDG1 (No Poverty) and SDG2 (Zero Hunger), biotechnology develops tailor-designed (transgenic) crop plants, including virus-resistant, drought-tolerant, and nutrient-enhanced crops, as well as food safety biosensors. These innovations boost farm income by increasing productivity, reducing production costs, and fostering climate-resilient crops. Consequently, they enable more stable farm incomes, contributing to food security, circular economy, and social inclusion [7–11 ]. Under SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being), biotechnology facilitates the development of medicines, faster detection and diagnosis of illnesses, therapies, vaccines, and personalized precision medicine [10 ,11 ]. Regarding SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), biotechnology selects and produces microorganisms and plants for water treatment, sanitation, and water quality monitoring [12 ,13 ]. Under SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), the production of biofuels and microorganisms for renewable energy, generated by bioprocesses such as fermentation and bioconversion, is linked to a sustainable economy with poverty reduction (SDG1), agricultural development (SDG2), organic waste bioconversion into energy (SDG12), economic growth (SDG8), climate change policy, environmental protection, and the reduction of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions (SDG13) [14 ]. An example is biohydrogen generation (SDG7), which is inherently related to circular economy (SDG12) by recycling industrial waste biomass through biotechnological routes, contributing to carbon capture and impacting climatic conditions (SDG13) [10 ,11 ,15 ]. In SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), the consequences of crops with higher yields and fewer inputs (SDG2), the prevention and treatment of work-related diseases (SDG3), the creation of new innovative companies, startups, and the strengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises (SDG9), as well as the promotion of circular economy (SDG12), are felt [9,15 ] Under SDG9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), biotechnology stimulates the production of strategic bioproducts, biorefineries, and associated production chains within a circular industry, among other initiatives [10 ,14 ,16–21 ]. In SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), biotechnology adds value to waste by producing biomaterials, functional foods (SDG2), sustainable cosmetics (SDG3), among others. An option is the circular bioeconomy, which is pivotal for achieving SDG1, 2, 7, 12, 13, and 17 [5 ]. For SDG13 (Climate Action), bioproducts reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop new climate-resistant crops (SDG1), and facilitate carbon capture by microorganisms and plants [10 ]. For instance, Escherichia coli  produces the dimers cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane) and putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) for nylon synthesis, via polymerization with dicarboxylic acids, replacing the use of adipic acid derived from fossil fuels that generate large quantities of greenhouse gas (N2 O), thus reducing the impact on climate change [17–22 ]. Genetically modified microalgae, such as Chlorella vulgaris  and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , enhance CO2  fixation compared to wild types and reduce CO2  emissions, contributing to achieving net zero emissions [23 ,24 ]. For both SDG14 (Life below Water) and SDG15 (Life on Land) [05], biotechnology is utilized in biodiversity conservation, ecosystem restoration, soil and water bioremediation, reduction of soil erosion, and improvement of fish health and production, among other applications [10 ,13 ]. For instance, microalgae are employed for environmental disinfection, bioremediation, and wastewater treatment (SDG6 and SDG14), as land biostimulants (SDG15), and for high-quality food (SDG2), biofuels (SDG7), and bioplastics (SDG12) [25 ]. Fungi are used for soil, sludges, and water bioremediation (offering high efficiency, low cost, good adaptability, and ecological friendliness), as well as for antibiotics, biological control agents, enzymes, alcoholic beverages, organic acids, food, and feed, thereby impacting SDG2, 3, 6, 12, 14, and 15 [12 ,26 ,27 ]. SDG17 (Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development) is increasingly approaching its goals due to modern biotechnology's requirement for increasingly complex scientific and technological solutions, necessitating strong governmental policies and alliances with all stakeholders, such as public-private partnerships, national, and international collaborations [5 ]. Traditional biotechnology, with its origins in ancient civilizations, involves fermentation for producing beverages and food, as well as refining selective breeding [28 ]. Modern biotech has evolved from advanced molecular and genetic engineering techniques [29 ,30 ], resulting in benefits such as the production of insulin and recombinant vaccines [31–33 ]. It has also introduced essential diagnostic and therapeutic methods, including the revolutionary CRISPR gene-editing system [11 ,34 ], which has significantly impacted healthcare, agriculture, gene therapy, and more. Consequently, modern biotechnology plays a pivotal role in achieving the SDGs, leading to favorable and synergistic environmental and social impacts [35 ,36 ]. Modern biotechnology requires significant investments in labs and workforce training, which can be costly and inaccessible to many countries [37 ]. These investments are crucial for advancing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) [38 ], making progress accessible to society. Patents are a tool to assess TRL and offer insights into trends, opportunities, and constraints [39 ]. Intermediate TRL levels indicate potential innovations and can be gauged through indexed scientific articles (TRL3), academic patents (TRL4), and national patents (TRL4-5) [40 ]. Globally and in Brazil, patenting is increasing, with Brazil at the 26th position in 2021 [41–43 ]. The USA, ranked 2nd, serves as a technology benchmark with a strong focus on tech exports and consistent utilization of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). United States Patent and Trademark Office issued academic biotech patents exhibited exponential growth from 1966 to 1995 [44 ]. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development conducted a 2006 study mapping biotechnology patents and their Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) in PCT patent applications. The USA led with 40% of the patents, while Brazil contributed less than 0.5% [37 ]. The authors conducted a brief search in the European Patent Office worldwide database [45 ] for the period from 2000 to 2019. They identified a total of 105,493 biotechnological patent families with export potential (filed in the country of origin and in at least one other country), and USA emerged as the world leader with 56,120 patent families (53%), while Brazil ranked 17th with only 10,011 patent families (9.5%). Makhoba and Pouris [46 ] studied BRICS' biotechnology and noted that Brazil's RTA compared to the rest of the world significantly increased from 2001 to 2015, rising from 0.016 to approximately 0.1. An analysis of biotechnology protection in Brazil, using data from the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property (2007–2016), revealed a predominant focus on health technologies (SDG3) in patents, with minimal contributions to agriculture (SDG2) and the environment (SDG12) [10 ]. Lavarello (2016) [47 ] explored corporate knowledge in industrial biotechnology, emphasizing the tension between technological diversification and convergence. The study noted partial convergence in enzyme technology, biopolymers, and food industries. A distinct dynamic differentiation process emerged in the health industry from 2000. Leading biotechnology firms displayed a strong innovation propensity. Both Brazil and the USA are committed to biotechnology development and have recent national regulations: Brazil in 2007 [48 ] and the USA in 2019 [49 ]. Brazil is rich in biodiversity, with 116,000 animal and 46,000 plant species, especially in the Amazon region [50 ], while the USA's biodiversity suffered depletion during the industrial revolution due to wood demand for steam energy. Both countries also have regulations pertaining to TRL4, which govern patenting and commercialization by public academic organizations: the USA's 1980 Bayh-Dole Act [51 ] and Brazil's 2004 Innovation Law [52 ]. Are Brazil and the USA already navigating the 5th technological wave with modern biotechnology, and are they ready for the 6th wave of Sustainability? In which SDGs do Brazil and the USA have a technological advantage in biotechnology? What is the potential for patent specialization? Compared to the USA as a benchmark in biotechnology, which Brazilian fields should be prioritized to meet the Agenda 2030 SDG goals? Do these fields rely on Brazil's biodiversity or modern biotechnology? Composite indicators based in patents are ideal for comparing biotechnology in Brazil with the benchmark USA. They help identify trends and specific issues, particularly when individual indicator magnitudes differ significantly [53 ] and have been used to study issues related to SDGs, e.g. SDG2 [40 ], SDG8 [54 ], and SDG9 [55–58 ]. This paper analyzes the growth, specialization, and technological advantages of Brazil's biotechnology, using the USA as a benchmark—a global leader in biotechnology. It assesses opportunities for Brazil to align with international demands and contribute to the 2030 Agenda. The primary aim is to evaluate whether Brazil, compared to the USA, is already in the 5th technological wave of biotechnology and ready to experience the 6th wave of Sustainability. This evaluation aims to uncover constraints and opportunities that can facilitate the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the 2023 Agenda. The analysis covers both static and temporal contexts, enabling the identification of competitive fields and emerging biotechnology trends. It encompasses three primary comparisons: 1) The academic sectors of Brazil and the USA, 2) The Brazilian academic sector versus the entire nation, and 3) The academic sectors of Brazil and the USA relative to their respective countries. For this purpose, an initial brief analysis of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) positioning is conducted based on articles, academic patents, and non-academic patents. This is followed by an assessment of the percentage contribution of patents from each biotechnological field within academic sectors and their respective countries. Subsequently, the growth rates of biotechnologies within each sector are calculated, along with their temporal tendencies, using patents and three ratios: patents per Total Population, patents per Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and patents per High-Technology Exports. The growth rates of biotechnological fields in the Brazilian academy are detailed, and the biotechnological specialization of patents is analyzed, along with their temporal evolutions within each sector. Next, the sectors are compared using revealed technological advantages and distances. Finally, the most competitive biotechnological fields for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are described, and gaps are identified.  2 Methods Biotechnology, as an emerging research area of the 5th technological wave, only recently received adequate International Patent Classifications (IPC). This implies that retrieving older biotechnology patent applications was challenging. More than a decade ago, Luca Falciola [59 ] highlighted the difficulties of searching for biotechnology information. The search process relied on complex criteria that could be hard to identify, select, and efficiently combine. It was primarily based on phrase searching and limited to indexed information and IPC main/advanced codes. To address this issue, around the same time, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the European Union's Eurostat, and the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office proposed comprehensive IPC classifications. These classifications were utilized in this paper to enhance IPC selection strategies.• The 8th edition of the IPC, which defined specific biotechnological fields by the World Intellectual Property Organization [60 ];  • IPCs provided by the European Union's Eurostat for the biotechnology sector [61 ,62 ];  • The biotechnology subdomains 13 and 15 within of Area III – Chemistry as defined by the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office [63 ];  • The top 100 IPCs resulting from a search using the keyword < biotechnolog*> in the worldwide database of the European Patent Office via Questel Orbit (comprising almost 100 countries and translated to English) [45 ].    These four strategies were searched considering IPCs of at least the third level to ensure the reliability of patent composite indicators and a significant number of variables [64 ], yielding four IPCs lists that were combined, comprehending 146 IPCs related to biotechnology. Initially, duplicates were removed, followed by the exclusion of IPCs that, while indirectly related to biotechnology, fell outside the specific biotechnology focus of this work. Then, IPCs with very low total numbers of patents in Brazil or in the USA were excluded since applying calculations would not be feasible.− Exclusions in Brazil: processes for modifying phenotypes of new plants (A01H003), and peptides having up to 20 amino acids in a fully defined sequence (C07K005, C07K017), hybrid peptides (C07K019), bacteriophage compositions (C12N007).  − Exclusions in the USA: Preparation of compounds like carotenes (C12P023), processes involving microorganisms of different genera in the same process, simultaneously (C12P039), and processes using enzymes or microorganisms to separate optical isomers from a racemic mixture (C12P041).    After this cleaning process, 19 relevant IPC groups remained (A61K038, A61K039, C02F003, C07K001, C07K007, C07K014, C07K016, C12M001, C12N001, C12N005, C12N009, C12N011, C12N015, C12P001, C12P007, C12P019, C12P021, C12Q001, and C12R001). Then, data imputation was carried out by assigning a value of 0.1 for the years in which the number of patents in the remaining biotechnological fields was zero. The number of FAMPAT patent families [65 ] within each IPC was retrieved from the Questel Orbit database in November 2021 and updated in March 2022. In this text, the term "patent" will be used interchangeably with "documents of patent families". The patent survey covered the last 20 available years (2000-19), accounting for the 18-month confidentiality period after the priority date. These two decades were divided into three equal periods for temporal analysis. To mitigate anomalies, the average patent count from four biennia (2000-01, 2006-07, 2012-13, and 2018-19) was used. To avoid specificities of national patent offices, such as Brazilian patenting encountering bottlenecks like extended examination periods and annual fee issues [66 ], evidenced by only less than a quarter of Brazilian biotechnological patents mapped here being granted, while in the USA it is around half, the search overlooked patent legal status, thus obtaining all biotech potentials in both countries. Patents filed with regional offices, like European Patent Office and through PCT, were used as indicators of prior export intent. The search considered only patents filed by country residents based on the assignee's country at the earliest priority date. For Brazil and the USA, data on academic patents and total country patents were collected, resulting in four distinct datasets categorized by assignees.UBR: Patents from academic organizations in Brazil, according to the National Register of Higher Education Courses and Institutions of the Brazilian Ministry of Education [67 ];  UUS: Patents from academic organizations in the USA, according to the Times Higher Education College Rankings 2019 [68 ];  TBR: Patents filed by residents in Brazil;  TUS: Patents filed by residents in the USA.    After data cleaning, the total number of patents retrieved were as follows: 3,330 Brazilian academic patents (UBR); 5,549 Brazilian patents (TBR); 103,687 USA academic patents (UUS); and 407,401 USA patents (TUS). For each dataset, the percentage contribution of each biotechnological field was determined, aiming to identify areas with concentrated patents. Additionally, this information was used to calculate composite indicators. To ensure the reliability of the results and prevent distortions caused by mathematical formulas, multiple composite indicators were calculated where possible, thereby reinforcing the interpretations [54 ].• Within the same dataset: Annual percentages, Concentration (Herfindahl–Hirschman Index - HH), Specialization (CV), Diversification (DIV), Inequality (GINI) including Lorentz curves, and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for examining temporal trends.  • Comparison between two datasets: Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) and Technological Distance (DIS).    Initially, within each dataset, the percentage contribution of each technological field was calculated to identify those where patents were concentrated. Then, composite indicators were calculated using the following equations, as described in the literature [40 ]. The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index Concentration (HH) within the same dataset was obtained by adding the squared percentages of each technologic field (Equation (1) ). The use of power two emphasizes the shares of each technologic field: greater participation increases HH and vice versa.Equation 1 H H = ∑ i n  ( N i  N  )  2      Equation 2 C V ( H H  )  = σ μ      Equation 3 DIV = 1 H H   n      Equation 4 C A G R ( t 0  , t n   )  = 100 { ( P t n   P t 0    )  1 ( t n  − t 0   )    − 1  }      Equation 5 R T A  i , j 1  j 2     = P i , j 1    ∑ P j 1     P i , j 2    ∑ P j 2          Equation 6 D I S  i , j 1  j 2     = P i , j 1    ∑ P j 1     − P i , j 2    ∑ P j 2         where H H    is the Herfindahl–Hirschman Concentration Index, i    are the technologic fields(i = 1 , … , n   ), N i     is the number of patents in a given technologic field i   , ∑ i n  N i     is the sum of the number of patents in each food technology field, C V    is the Technologic Specialization, σ    is the H H    standard deviation, μ    is the H H    average, DIV    is the Technologic Diversification, t 0     is the start time, t n     is the end time, P t 0      is the number of patents at the start time, P t n      is the number of patents at the end time t n    , R T A    is the Revealed Technologic Advantage, D I S    is the Distance of Technologic Specialization, j    is the dataset (j    = UBR, UUS, TBR, TUS), and P 1 , j      is the percentage of patents in the set of data j    in the technologic field i   . Technological Specialization (CV) was calculated using the coefficient of variation of HH, which represents the ratio between the standard deviation of HH and its average value. CV is expressed as a percentage (Equation (2) ). A higher CV indicates greater technological specialization. The indicator DIV was calculated by dividing the inverse of the HH of each dataset by the total number of biotechnological fields (Equation (3) ). Its behavior should be opposite to specialization. The level of inequality in the distribution of patents among the 19 technological fields was assessed using the Gini coefficient, calculated from Lorentz curves. To plot the Lorentz curves, the percentage of patents in each technological field was arranged in ascending order within the same dataset. A Gini coefficient equal to zero corresponds to an equal distribution of patents across all technological fields, while a Gini coefficient equal to one would signify that all patents are concentrated in only one technological field. Section 3.4  compares Brazil with the USA using these four similar indicators: specialization, concentration, inequality, and diversification. To observe temporal trends (Section 3.2 ), the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) was calculated within the same dataset (Equation (4) ). To calculate CAGR, we initially divided the number of patents at the final time tn  by their value at the initial time to . The result was raised to the exponent of one divided by the number of years between tn  and to . Then, the value obtained was subtracted by 1. The final value was multiplied by 100 to obtain the result in percentage. The CAGR calculation was applied to the total number of patents in each dataset and to three ratios between the patents and three output indicators of the respective country. These indicators were obtained from the World Bank Development Indicators in April 2022 and included the total population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in current US dollars, and high-technology exports in current US dollars. High-technology exports were not available for 2000, 2001, and 2006 and were calculated only for the two final periods, considering the values of 2006 and 2007 as equal (Table A  of supplementary material). The CAGR calculation was also applied to each of the Brazilian academic biotechnological fields to identify those with the highest growth rates (section 3.3 ). The relative positioning of Brazil and the benchmark USA in biotechnology (Section 3.5 ) was evaluated using RTA and DIS. For RTA, the ratio between the percentages of two sets of data for each of the technological fields was calculated (Equation (5) ). The RTA is greater than 1 when the dataset in the minuend has a comparative advantage and is less than 1 when the dataset in the subtrahend has a comparative disadvantage. The overall RTA for each comparison was calculated by summing the RTAs for each technological field. DIS was calculated for each of the technological fields as the absolute difference between the patent percentages of two datasets (Equation (6) ). The sum of the DIS of each technological field gives the overall DIS of the comparison. DIS values are equal to or greater than 0%. If the DIS is closer to zero, there is closer proximity in technological degree. The greater the DIS, the greater the technological distance. The RTA and DIS calculations can potentially lead to erroneous conclusions due to their mathematical formulas being ratios and differences, respectively [40 ]. Therefore, graphs of log RTA versus DIS were generated and presented in section 3.5.2 . Additionally, for a quick comparison of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), non-academic patents (TRL5), academic patents (TRL4), and indexed articles for TRL3 were used and presented in section 3.1 . The number of articles indexed in the Scopus database between 2000 and 2019 for Brazil and the USA was obtained in October 2023 by searching the Web of Science - Principal Collection (Clarivate Analytics) in the Category “Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology”, resulting in 12,834 Brazilian articles and 129,122 USA articles retrieved. All calculations were conducted using Excel spreadsheets prepared by the authors, which were also utilized to generate the figures.  3 Results and discussion 3.1 Positioning of each biotechnological field within academic sectors and their countries Table 1   presents a comparison of biotechnological readiness levels between Brazil and the benchmark USA. The metric for each TRL in Brazil was divided by the corresponding metric in the USA. Table 1  shows that the Brazilian percentage concerning the USA is 9.9% for articles (TRL3), and it drops to 3.2% for academic patents (TRL4), highlighting that the Brazilian academia should be more engaged in patenting. The relationship between country patents drops even further to 1.4% (TRL4-5), revealing a distinct gap in Brazil. When comparing the percentages by normalizing them with respective countries population, the percentage decreases as TRL increases, confirming the need for Brazil to accelerate its biotechnological development to align with its other output indicators. When comparing articles (TRL3) with total patents (TRL4-5), this highlights even more the significant gap, with TRL4-5 falling sevenfold compared to TRL3. Thus, Brazil lags behind the USA in biotechnological readiness. This discrepancy suggests non-academic patents are underrepresented, indicating a systemic bias in the Brazilian TRL4-5 gap, as previously observed in food technology (SDG2) [40 ]. Additionally, Brazilian articles outnumber country patents by over two-fold, while in the USA, articles are less than one third of the patents. This confirms that Brazil's biotechnologies are at a lower TRL compared to the USA, where they have already reached TRL5, reinforcing the USA's suitability as a benchmark for analyzing biotechnology innovation potential. Therefore, based on this result, the focus of this article is justified by delving into the aspects of Brazil's biotechnology to understand what is happening in Brazil regarding biotechnological maturity levels TRL4 and TRL5. This aims to identify aspects that can be accelerated to support the SDGs in achieving the Agenda 2023. The export intention of Brazil is very low, with patents filed on average in 1.7 countries, of which only 3% are filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) or in the European Community (EC). In contrast, those of the USA are in 6.8 countries, with 22% through the PCT or in the EC, demonstrating that US biotechnology is clearly geared towards export. Table 2   shows the percentage distributions of patents for each biotechnological field within each dataset from 2000 to 2019 (number and more details in Table B of supplementary material). In both Brazil and the USA, across both academic and national patents, there is a predominant focus on mutation or genetic engineering, which serves as a fundamental tool relevant to all SDGs. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that Brazil exhibits a higher percentage of patents related to microorganismś indexing, likely due to its rich biodiversity. In contrast, the USA demonstrates a greater emphasis on high-tech fields, particularly those crucial for various biotechnological applications associated with SDG3, such as medicinal preparations containing antigens, antibodies, and peptides. Additionally, the USA also shows higher percentages in biotechnological fields related to measuring or testing processes involving enzymes, nucleic acids, or microorganisms, which have relevance across several SDGs. To further enhance the investigation, it is essential to comprehend the temporal evolution of biotechnological development growth.  3.2 Growth rate of biotechnologies within each sector Table 3   displays the compound annual growth rates of patents and their ratios within each of the four sectors, calculated using Equation (4)  and in-house Excel programming (also refer to Figures A and B in the supplementary material). Considering only patents' CAGR from 2000 to 2019, it is evident that both Brazil's academic sector and the country as a whole show growth rates about eight times higher than the USA. The CAGR per population ratio follows a similar pattern, with the USA (TUS) displaying a negative value. When considering GDP, Brazil's growth rates are positive, whereas the USA's are negative. This discrepancy is primarily due to the USA experiencing an increase in GDP in 2018 and 2019, while Brazil's GDP decreased. In general, academic sectors tend to grow slightly faster than their countries. When analyzing the three intermediary periods for patents and their patents/population ratio, USA's CAGR is consistently lower than Brazil's (Table 3 , and Figs. A and B in the supplementary material ). Notably, there is a substantial increase in the CAGR for Brazil's academic sector (UBR) during T2, possibly due to the enactment of the Brazilian Innovation Law in 2004 [52 ] and the Brazilian Biotechnology Development Policy in 2007 [48 ], which likely prompted more patent applications. Both policies regulate patenting and commercialization by public academic organizations, and in Brazil, about 90% of academic patents originate from public organizations [69 ], indicating the effectiveness of Brazilian policies in promoting the biotechnological academic sector. The TBR data displays declining CAGR, but the most recent period maintains relatively high growth. Conversely, the USA's growth rates stabilize. In terms of the GDP ratio, Brazil shows growth in the last period, whereas the USA maintains stability. These variations are primarily driven by the opposite trends in their respective GDPs in the recent period. The CAGR ratio of patents to high-tech exports decreases from T2 to T3, indicating that biotechnology is not a major contributor to these exports. This underscores the importance of identifying the most competitive biotech fields for each country to accelerate progress towards the SDGs. While patents filed by Brazil's academic sector have shown a general growth rate of 8.9% from 2000 to 2019, it is important to pinpoint the biotechnology fields with the highest growth rates.  3.3 Growth rates of biotechnological fields in brazilian academy The CAGR of each biotech field was calculated, using Equation (4)  and Excel, and plotted against the logarithm of its total patents in Fig. 1  , categorizing biotechnologies according to their portfolio sizes and growth rates, in order to identify biotechnological fields where the Brazilian academy is more active and competitive in supporting the SDGs. The graphical analysis of Brazilian academic CAGR for each biotech field does not show a linear relationship, and outliers are rare. In other words, high-growth fields do not necessarily have more patents. The primary field is microorganisms' indexing, characterized by a high growth rate and a substantial patent count, as noted in Table 2 . Microorganisms' compositions, though not yet in the top percentage of patents, display a promising growth rate, indicating future significance. Conversely, mutation and genetic engineering, while present in the top patent percentage, exhibit a relatively modest CAGR compared to other fields. Importantly, all these fields contribute to the attainment of all SDGs. The fields related to oxygen-containing organic compounds, peptides or proteins, and ligases & proenzymes also exhibit notable growth rates and may gain significance in the future, particularly in the contexts of food (SDG2), energy (SDG7), and the environment (SDG12). Their competitiveness will depend on sustaining high RTA and DIS values. High CAGR fields are fundamental biotech areas linked to multiple SDGs, particularly SDG3. Meanwhile, biotechnologies for environmental treatment, impacting SDGs 2, 6, and 15, show slower growth and fewer patents.  3.4 Biotechnological specialization The comparison of biotechnology between Brazil and the USA, using the four similar indicators covering a 20-year period, can be seen in Table 4  : specialization (Equation (2) ), concentration (Equation (1) ), Gini inequality (Figure C in the supplementary material), and diversification (Equation (3) ). As anticipated, specialization, concentration, inequality exhibited consistent trends and behaviors, while diversification displayed contrasting patterns, reinforcing the credibility of our findings. The USA exhibits lower specialization compared to Brazil, as the latter distributes patents more evenly across various biotechnological fields. In Brazil, the academic sector demonstrates higher specialization than the country as a whole, highlighting a focused development in specific fields. The temporal evolution of specialization, concentration, inequality, and diversification, as represented by four biennial indicators, can be observed in Fig. 2   to identify potential convergences or divergences (also refer to Table C in the supplementary material). Temporal convergence is observed between Brazil and its academic sector. The academy tends to increase diversification, while the country tends to increase specialization. This convergence may indicate a shared intent for earlier exportation as they collaborate to adopt and industrialize developed biotechnologies, aligning with the Agenda 2023. Alternatively, it could reflect Brazil following the path of its benchmark country, the USA, where specialization convergence occurred in the 2012-13 biennium, followed by a slight hint of divergence recently. This offers hope for bridging the Brazilian TRL4-5 gap. The temporal trends indicate that both countries exhibit nearly parallel patterns over time, which are also observed in concentration and inequality for both the USA's academic sector and its country. This is characterized by a relatively stable distribution among biotechnological fields from 2000 to 2019, with minimal changes. To assess Brazilian biotechnology's position relative to the benchmark USA in addressing SDG themes and interpret temporal trends, it is crucial to evaluate RTA and DIS, identifying the most competitive biotechnological fields in each sector.  3.5 Biotechnology relative positioning This section explores how biotechnologies in Brazil compare to the benchmark USA. 3.5.1 Revealed technological advantages and distances Relative positions were assessed between academic sectors (UBR versus UUS) and academic sectors compared to their countries (UBR versus TBR), with a benchmark provided by UUS versus TUS. The calculations of RTA (Equation (5) ) and DIS (Equation (6) ) are presented in Table 5   and Table D in the supplementary material. In the twenty-year period, RTA and DIS between academies are approximately three to four times higher for Brazil. RTA values between academies and their respective countries are nearly equal, indicating no substantial differences, while DIS is inferior to RTA. Fig. 3   displays the temporal evolution in RTA and DIS (refer to Table D in the supplementary material). The time evolution of RTA and DIS in the academy comparison initially displayed stability but increased significantly in the last biennium due to greater technological advantage and distance of the Brazilian academy from the USA's. In the comparisons between academies and their respective countries, RTA and DIS had distinct 20-year trends. RTA values were similar, near unity, indicating the absence of biotechnological advantages. However, DIS showed a temporal convergence, with the USA's DIS decreasing and Brazil's DIS increasing, ultimately converging to values near unity in the last biennium. This evolution clarifies the overall perspective presented in Table 5 , where values are averages over 20 years and thus deviate from unity. The DIS convergence between each country and its respective academy occurred around 2015-16, with values just below unity. This was due to an increasing DIS trend in Brazil and a decreasing trend in the USA. Since the USA serves as the selected benchmark, it appears that there is already a similar DIS pattern between the academies and their respective countries. However, it remains to be determined whether these patterns will persist or diverge in the future. It is vital to identify key biotechnological fields that determine diverse biotechnology profiles, thereby pinpointing critical areas for competitiveness, as well as diagnosing bottlenecks and opportunities to enhance sustainable development.  3.5.2 Competitive biotechnological fields To identify the most competitive fields with the highest potential in each comparison, a logarithmic plot of RTA against DIS was created, separating each sector into distinct quadrants. Fig. 4   visually compares UBR and UUS, UBR and TBR, and UUS and TUS over the twenty-year period from 2000 to 2019 (further details in Figure D of the supplementary material). In this graph, the most relevant biotech fields are discernible by their distance from the vertical axis (representing larger DIS) and the horizontal axis (indicating RTA significantly deviating from unity). The DIS values (horizontal axis) differ significantly in the three comparisons. UBR versus UUS (Fig. 4 A) spans a range of about thirteen, whereas in the other two (Fig. 4 B and C), the DIS range is around one. This aligns with the previously observed patterns in Fig. 3  and Table 5 , where comparisons between academies and their respective countries exhibit considerably lower RTA and DIS values compared to academy-to-academy comparisons, emphasizing the presence of specific highly competitive academic fields. The fields providing biotechnological advantage to the USA's academy over the Brazilian academy (Fig. 4 A) and its country (Fig. 4 C) are primarily related to SDG 3, including medicinal preparations containing peptides, peptides with over 20 amino acids, and immunoglobulins. Additionally, they encompass fundamental procedures applicable across all SDGs, such as measuring or testing processes involving enzymes, nucleic acids, or microorganisms, along with cell and tissue cultivation and maintenance. These fields, marked by high patent percentages (Table 2 ), exhibit robust growth at CAGR rates of 12%–15% within the Brazilian academy (Fig. 1 ), indicating their potential significance in the coming decade. The field of microorganisms' indexing holds relevance across all SDGs. In a comparison between the Brazilian academy and the USA academy, as well as with Brazil itself, the Brazilian academy enjoys a technological advantage in this field. This advantage is driven by access to biodiversity, significant research and development efforts, and notable growth rates. However, concerns persist regarding the absence of Brazilian companies in this field. Notably, the microorganisms' indexing field is absent in the comparison between the USA's academy and the country, aligning with expectations due to historical biodiversity loss in the USA during the industrial revolution. The UBR academy has an advantage over the USA's academy in the field of preparing oxygen-containing organic compounds (Fig. 4 A), particularly in relation to fermentation processes, which have established global significance for SDG2 and SDG7. In contrast, the USA primarily focuses on bioreactors relevant to SDG9, while the Brazilian academy has more patents related to novel biotechnologies, involving industrial waste substrates, new microorganisms, and process optimization, essential for SDG7 and SDG12. This could be attributed to the field's relatively low-tech nature, where Brazil already excels as a country, with new academic biotechnologies contributing incrementally. However, it is worth noting that this field is rapidly growing (CAGR 20.6%) and holds a significant number of patents (Fig. 1  and Table D of supplementary material), suggesting promising potential. In two SDG-essential fields, Brazilian academy holds an edge over the USA's academy: microorganisms' compositions and processes for preparing compounds using microorganisms or enzymes. However, this advantage disappears in the comparison with the USA. These fields play a crucial role in developing new products and processes, and are discussed in the next section. USA's academy has an advantage over Brazil's academy in SDG3-related fields, including immunoglobulins and cell culture maintenance. This advantage may stem from significant investments by US companies in health-related projects, such as immunology and cell culture, which align with SDG17. The USA's well-equipped laboratories and easier access to funding for large research projects and patent filings contribute to their advantage. In Brazil, these fields exhibit CAGR rates of 11.8%–13.6% (Fig. 1 ) due to increased production of diagnostic kits for infectious diseases, viral vaccine production, bioactive research, and a focus on tropical diseases, all within the realm of SDG3. Mutation or genetic engineering, significant for multiple SDGs, favors the Brazilian academy over the country (Fig. 4 B) with a 11.5% CAGR in UBR. However, in the comparison with the USA's academy (Fig. 4 C), this advantage is less pronounced, potentially due to limited uptake of new developments by Brazilian companies. These data highlight the need for increased biotechnological development in Brazil, particularly in the fields of medicinal preparations containing peptides, and measuring or testing processes involving enzymes, nucleic acids, or microorganisms, in comparison to the benchmark USA. The absence of biotech fields in the USA quadrant of the comparison with its academy (Fig. 4 C) demonstrates a strong alignment between them. They share similar advantages and have small biotechnological distances, confirming the USA as a suitable benchmark for this analysis. Additionally, fields that exhibit substantial growth rates in Brazilian academia (Fig. 1 ) and were not evident in Fig. 4  due to their small RTA and DIS values should be closely monitored. These fields may continue to outpace the UUS, TBR, and TUS, potentially becoming significant players in the near future.  3.5.3 Description of competitive biotechnologies In Brazil, the most competitive biotechnological fields primarily rely on traditional biotechnology, which holds relevance across all Sustainable Development Goals. Practical applications in biotechnological processes and product development are significant for a broader spectrum of SDGs and sustainable development initiatives. For instance, the extensively utilized bacterial species Escherichia coli  has various technological applications, such as addressing environmental contamination (SDG12) and supporting innovations like microbial fuel cells (SDG7). Brazil's prominence in microorganism indexing can be attributed to its abundant biodiversity. Throughout our research, microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, along with their derivatives such as enzymes, peptides, and antibiotics, played pivotal roles in numerous processes and product developments. Their applications spanned various areas, including culture media formulation and microbial fermentation procedures, which were predominantly observed in Brazil. While the implementation of genetic engineering was more prevalent in the USA, Brazil also employed some biotechnologies like genetically modified yeast for biodiesel, ethanol, and biosurfactant production, demonstrating relevance to SDG7 and related goals. Brazil's focus on microbial fermentation processes includes the utilization of primary raw materials such as glucose and plant biomass, primarily for biofuel production. This encompasses the production of first and second-generation ethanol derived from sugars, residual pulp industry biomass, lignocellulosic substrates, and by-products from eucalyptus processing. Additionally, the use of enzymes derived from orange and castor bean residues contributes to SDG2 and SDG12. For SDG3, Brazilian microbial processes involve the biosynthesis of nanoparticles, which also hold relevance to other SDGs. Brazilian excipients used in pharmaceutical product formulations gained prominence in drug preparation, specifically peptides and antibodies. Peptides found applications in antibiotic production, treatment for conditions such as obesity and diabetes, enhanced insulin sensitivity, microbial infection management, pharmaceutical composition formulation, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-allergy applications. Additionally, antibodies served as effective neutralizing agents against the human immunodeficiency virus and in developing the anti-HIV vaccine. In Brazil, the field of measuring and testing processes involving enzymes, nucleic acids, or microorganisms had the most patent families, with a primary emphasis on modern molecular biology. It mainly included diagnostic devices using the CRISPR system, genetic recombination, nucleic acid analysis, sequencing, and applications for diseases like cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and schizophrenia (pertinent to SDG2 and SDG3). In Brazil, however, there are clear gaps in modern biotechnology in processes for modifying phenotypes of new plants, small or medium peptides, hybrids, and bacteriophage compositions. The USA employs modern tools of molecular biology in greater quantity than Brazil, developing technologies specifically focused on challenges of SDG3. For example, methods for high-resolution analysis of nucleic acids to detect sequence variation, detection of target nucleic acid sequences by PTO cleavage and extension assay, performing spatial profiling of biological molecules, and comprehensive and high sensitivity detection of pathogens and drug resistance markers. The Crispr effector system is widely used for diagnostics. The United States possesses more advanced biotechnologies focused extensively on the healthcare sector (SDG3). These include therapeutic compositions such as frataxin, lactoferrin, and mitochondrial energy-generating enzymes, drug formulation methods aimed at increasing the affinity of crystalline microparticle surfaces for active agents, genetic therapies, methods for cell reprogramming, modification of the immunomodulatory effects of cells, preparation of multipotent stem cells, and methods for preparing vaccines using hybrid cells. Additionally, there are hybrid polypeptides with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutics utilizing bispecific anti-HLA class II invariant chain x anti-pathogen antibodies, including single-domain antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor-alpha and against intracellular antigens in general. In the USA, patent gaps exist in certain fields of traditional biotechnology such as the preparation of compounds like carotenes, processes involving microorganisms of different genera simultaneously in the same process, or using enzymes or microorganisms to separate optical isomers from a racemic mixture. This study examined biotechnological developments in the pre-pandemic COVID-19 years. A documented decrease in intellectual property filings during the pandemic varies significantly by global regions and technological fields [70 ]. The future impact on biotechnologies for the 2023 Agenda remains to be seen …    4 Conclusion Brazil's biotech evaluation compared to the USA, encompassing both academic and national sectors, reveals a bottleneck within the non-academic sector. This is evident as the academic sector dominates patenting, accounting for 59% in Brazil compared to only 3% in the USA. It is clear that the middle TRLs represent a Brazilian bottleneck that needs to be overcome with appropriate governmental policies. Biotechnologies in the USA are evidently developed for exportation purposes. Brazil exhibits consistent growth in biotech patents across various fields, facilitated by its rich biodiversity, particularly in the Amazon region. In terms of temporal evolution, it is evident that in Brazil, policies such as the Innovation Law and Biotechnology Development Policy have stimulated exponential growth in both academia and non-academic sectors, driving Brazil towards the fifth technologic wave. On the other hand, growth rates in the USA are comparatively slower and tends to stabilize over time. Biotechnological specialization favors the USA, while Brazil's academia diversifies, and the country specializes, potentially signaling export intentions. Parallelism between academic sectors reflects similar SDG development levels, with the USA showcasing advanced technological readiness. RTA and DIS favor Brazil's academia over the USA's. Over time, RTA and DIS in comparisons with respective countries tend to converge, highlighting similarities between Brazil and the USA. Several thriving biotech fields in Brazil's academia, particularly microorganism indexing, fermentation processes, peptides, proteins, ligases, and proenzymes, hold potential for advancing Agenda 2030. They are distributed across various SDGs, particularly SDG3 and 7, with less emphasis on SDG2, 6, 13, 14, and 15. However, in Brazil, there are technological gaps in terms of patent appropriation, such as modifying phenotypes of new plants and processes involving long or hybrid peptides, which indicate that the country has not deeply immersed itself in the fifth technological wave of biotechnology. This raises concerns about the feasibility of the sixth wave of sustainability, which may be a weak wave with focus on low-value-added technologies related to traditional biotechnology. The urgent need to accelerate the integration of modern biotechnology is evident, requiring concrete actions in infrastructure and human resource development to modernize industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG9). This can be achieved through global partnerships for sustainable development (SDG17). The challenge of limited partnership strategies between the productive sector for academic knowledge utilization is not unique to Brazil; it is observed in various low and middles-income countries, such as agri-food biotechnology in Mexico [71 ], an upper middle income country like Brazil. Implementing cross-border policies may be required to address this bottleneck. In the USA, technologies applied to the healthcare sector have clearly stood out (SDG3). However, the biopharmaceutical industry, despite its high efficiency, often does not align with global SDG challenges such as poverty reduction, climate change mitigation, and ecosystem and biodiversity protection [72 ]. Therefore, it requires specific government policies. The USA appears to have already transitioned through the fifth wave of biotechnology and seems poised to embark on the current sixth wave of sustainability. Here, given the lower biodiversity of the USA compared to Brazil, partnerships for sustainable development (SDG17) would also be fruitful. To align biotechnology with Agenda 2030, it is essential to establish modern biotech ecosystems in Brazil focusing on agriculture, environmental remediation, personalized preventive medicine, and sustainable energy. This requires strong government policies to support intermediate TRLs. Brazil should develop globally connected biotechnology parks that foster investment and partnerships, with a stronger and broader emphasis on SDGs 2, 6, 13, 14, and 15. This entails establishing sustainable development partnerships (SDG17) and enhancing bioindustry and infrastructure (SDG9), necessitating collaboration with non-academic stakeholders to create public-private partnerships.
