                  The purpose of this study is to address the criticism that corporate environmental activities to meet the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) are simply greenwashing. To this end, we clarify whether and why corporate environmental activities are effective in achieving SDGs from the stakeholder management perspective. Using data on Vietnamese companies, we first empirically clarify the influence of stakeholder pressure on a company's environmental management control system (EMCS) implementation as a comprehensive approach to environmental activities and maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs. Second, we examine the influence of EMCS implementation on environmental performance with or without proactive attitudes. The main findings are as follows. Companies implementing EMCSs normally improve their environmental performance, and pressure from final consumers and the government is a precondition for this accomplishment. However, if these companies incorporate the SDGs into their business targets, they can actually improve their environmental performance somewhat further, and government pressure plays an important role in this additional accomplishment. Therefore, corporate environmental activities to meet the SDGs work better than existing activities in Vietnam, refuting the criticism of greenwashing. Importantly, the Vietnamese government as a powerful stakeholder has proactively promoted domestic structural change to achieve the SDGs and has enacted many policies to encourage companies to be proactive in their environmental activities.

The purpose of this study is to address the criticism that corporate environmental activities to meet the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) are simply greenwashing. To this end, we clarify whether and why corporate environmental activities are effective in achieving SDGs from the stakeholder management perspective. Using data on Vietnamese companies, we first empirically clarify the influence of stakeholder pressure on a company's environmental management control system (EMCS) implementation as a comprehensive approach to environmental activities and maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs. Second, we examine the influence of EMCS implementation on environmental performance with or without proactive attitudes. The main findings are as follows. Companies implementing EMCSs normally improve their environmental performance, and pressure from final consumers and the government is a precondition for this accomplishment. However, if these companies incorporate the SDGs into their business targets, they can actually improve their environmental performance somewhat further, and government pressure plays an important role in this additional accomplishment. Therefore, corporate environmental activities to meet the SDGs work better than existing activities in Vietnam, refuting the criticism of greenwashing. Importantly, the Vietnamese government as a powerful stakeholder has proactively promoted domestic structural change to achieve the SDGs and has enacted many policies to encourage companies to be proactive in their environmental activities.   Keywords Environmental management control system  Environmental performance  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Stakeholder management    1 Introduction In 2015, the United Nations unanimously adopted an agenda for sustainable development known as the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a set of 17 goals with 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. The objective of the SDGs is“to end poverty and hunger everywhere; to combat inequalities within and among countries; to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies; to protect human rights and promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and to ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources” (United Nations, 2015 , p.3).   The SDGs are political goals for which governments of both developed and developing countries have primary responsibility, although achieving them requires all stakeholders' engagement and collaboration (Kroll, 2015 ). One background to this is that the hitherto self-regulatory initiatives such as the United Nations Global Compact were not effective owing to the lack of monitoring mechanisms and the absence of specific targets (Macellari et al., 2021 ). Hence, because the SDGs call for a strong political commitment, each government adopts its own SDG policies, taking into account its national context (Kim, 2018 ). At the same time, companies that have particular strengths, including specific skills and resources for innovation, are expected to play a primary role in achieving the SDGs (Rendtorff, 2020 ; Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). This is obvious from the fact that companies’ engagement in the SDGs is a priority issue for government SDG policies (Kim, 2018 ). In response to such expectations, many companies around the world have embraced the SDGs (Rendtorff, 2020 ). Indeed, many companies display their social and environmental sustainability activities (hereafter, sustainability activities) with the logos and icons of the SDGs in their sustainability reports and integrated reports. This is reasonable when many companies consider their sustainability activities to be an essential requirement for their survival and growth, and many companies had implemented such activities even before the SDGs (Nishitani, 2009 ; Sharif and Rashid, 2014 ). However, if a company's sustainability activities to meet the SDGs are the same as existing activities conducted in the name of SDGs, they are simply greenwashing (or “SDG washing”). In short, these activities may be just “cosmetic gestures and re-labelling, without serious modification of their activities” (Crabtree and Gasper, 2020 , p.173). This could happen because it is widely believed that a company's motivation for disclosing sustainability activities to the public is to gain legitimacy, and if so, the rhetoric of such disclosures may differ from the underlying reality (Nishitani et al., 2017b ; Sundin and Brown, 2017 ). Indeed, recent critical literature on greenwashing and impression management in sustainability reporting supports this view (e.g., Macellari et al., 2021 ; Michelon et al., 2015 ; Talbot and Boiral, 2018 ; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). In particular, van der Waal and Thijssens (2020)  criticize such practices in the SDG context. Companies pursuing the SDGs are expected to change practices and adapt (D'Souza et al., 2019 ). Thus, although companies are currently expected to implement sustainability activities more proactively than ever to achieve the SDGs, there may be a discrepancy between the expected and actual activities, which raises the possibility of greenwashing. However, because relatively few studies have addressed corporate sustainability activities to meet the SDGs,1  1 For example, a search for “sustainable development goals” and “companies” in the Web of Science Core Collection database yielded only 355 journal article hits on June 11, 2021.   this issue has been largely unexamined in the academic literature. For a company to implement its sustainability activities proactively and eventually contribute to the SDGs, sustainability has to be linked to its main business (Hörisch et al., 2014 ). For that reason, stakeholder management, which is a prerequisite for linking them, is expected to address the abovementioned discrepancy (Goel, 2019 ). Stakeholder management urges companies to consider the impact of their activities on their stakeholders from the strategic perspective, and/or to take account of the expectations of their stakeholders from the ethical (legitimating) perspective (Fassin, 2012 ). Stakeholder management is about managing stakeholders' interests, based on stakeholder theory, which is a managerial concept of organizational strategy and ethics (Freeman, 1984 ; Freeman and Philips, 2002; Madsen and Ulhøi, 2001 ). In stakeholder theory, we consider that ‘‘[a company's] success is dependent on how well it manages the relationship with [stakeholders] that can affect the realization of its purpose’’ (Freeman and Philips, 2002, p.333). Because different stakeholders have different views about how a company should conduct its activities, there will be negotiations with various stakeholders (Reverte, 2009 ). Whereas the conventional stakeholder theory considers all stakeholders to be equally important, a different view of stakeholder theory recognizes that powerful stakeholders are more important than others (Reverte, 2009 ). That is, the greater the power of stakeholders, the greater the importance of adapting to stakeholder interests (Gray et al., 1995 ; Roberts, 1992 ). According to this view, a company's survival and growth are the result of meeting the interests of its (more) powerful stakeholders (Madsen and Ulhøi, 2001 ). Thus, if a company considers that its activities improve sustainability performance and allow the company to manage its powerful stakeholders strategically and/or ethically, a positive triadic relationship between stakeholder power, sustainability activities, and performance is expected (Roberts, 1992 ). Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to challenge the claim that corporate sustainability, especially environmental, activities to meet the SDGs are simply greenwashing. To this end, we clarify whether and why corporate environmental activities to meet the SDGs are effective in achieving SDGs from the stakeholder management perspective. Because 50 % or more of the SDG targets are directly linked to the environment, this study specifically focuses on the environmental management control system (EMCS) to represent environmental activities rather than sustainability activities in general (Omisore, 2018 ). An EMCS is a form of management control system (MCS) that considers environmental aspects. The idea of an MCS as a control mechanism or system has been part of management accounting for decades (Malmi and Brown, 2008 ). An EMCS is thus a mechanism designed for desirable organizational activities, especially their environmental aspects. Although environmental management systems (EMSs) have often been employed as a measure of environmental activities in previous studies, the focus of recent studies has shifted from EMSs to EMCSs as a more advanced and comprehensive approach (Guenther et al., 2016 ; Kokubu et al., 2019 ). Using data on Vietnamese companies, we empirically clarify not only the influences of stakeholder pressure on a company's EMCS implementation and maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs but also the influence of EMCS implementation on environmental performance with or without a proactive company attitude. Thus, the novel point of this study regarding the relationship between stakeholder management and environmental performance (through EMCS implementation) is that we clarify how stakeholder power influences environmental performance over and above normal efforts to accomplish the SDGs. We consider that the focus on Vietnam is appropriate, because efforts from both developed and developing countries are intrinsically necessary to achieve the SDGs, and Vietnam actively seeks to fulfill its responsibility as one of the Next Eleven.2  2 The Next Eleven are 11 countries (Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, and Vietnam) that have high potential to be the world's largest economies in the 21st century following the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa).   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2  discusses a research framework for this study with a literature review and develops our hypotheses after briefly explaining EMCSs. In Section 3 , we provide an overview of the SDGs in Vietnam as contextual information, introduce the regression models, and give details of the data and variables used. Section 4  presents the estimation results, and Section 5  presents the discussion and conclusion.  2 Research framework This section discusses the theoretical perspective of stakeholder management of corporate sustainability activities with a literature review and develops our hypotheses regarding environmental activities (implementation of EMCSs) to meet the SDGs after briefly explaining EMCSs. 2.1 Theoretical perspective on stakeholder management There is an ongoing debate over whether a company's sustainability activities are social responsibilities or economic (or strategic). The former is interpreted as an effort to gain legitimacy (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ), while the latter is a means to increase profits as conventional economics assumes (Fisher, 2019 ). Researchers have tried to clarify what sustainability activities really are, drawing on various academic theories in line with their own academic interests. However, because no environmental, social, or economic interest can be sacrificed to achieve sustainable development, the choice of sustainability or economics does not matter intrinsically. That is, social responsibility and economics are not in diametric opposition but are two sides of the same coin in a company's sustainability activities. In this situation, stakeholder theory is useful for analyzing such multifaceted activities3  3 However, when applying stakeholder theory, we should also consider the criticism by Donaldson and Preston (1995)  that “the concepts [of] stakeholder, stakeholder model, stakeholder management, and stakeholder theory are explained and used by various authors in very different ways and supported (or critiqued) with diverse and often contradictory evidence and arguments” (p. 66).   because stakeholder management is a prerequisite for linking sustainability and a company's main business. Based on a literature review, Freeman and Phillips (2002)  suggest that stakeholder theory fits well not only with strategic management and ethics but also with law, economics, and organizational theory, and these disciplines should not be mutually exclusive. Stakeholder theory is “a set of propositions that suggest that managers of [companies] have obligations to some group of stakeholders” (Freeman, 2015 , p.1). Because there are several streams of stakeholder theory depending on “a diverse range of evidence and contradictory arguments” (Mainardes et al., 2011 , p. 237), stakeholder theory is best considered as a genre of stakeholder theories rather than as a specific theory, as Freeman (1994)  and Freeman and Phillips (2002)  suggest. The (core) concept of a stakeholder is “any group or individual who can affect, or is affected by, the achievement of a [company's] purpose” (Freeman, 1984 , p.46), and major company stakeholders generally include shareholders and investors, customers, final consumers, employees, community, government, suppliers, and competitors (Carroll, 2004 ; Freeman, 1994 ). Of course, there are many other stakeholders, such as the media and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Interestingly, Carroll (2004)  also regards the natural environment as a major stakeholder in companies. Although this stakeholder-oriented approach is often juxtaposed with the shareholder-oriented approach (Freeman, 2015 ), we should keep in mind that shareholders are also stakeholders. The focus of stakeholder theory is managerial decision-making with the mind-set that companies should manage and satisfy the interests of diverse stakeholders. This view is derived from the notion that the realization of a company's purpose, including corporate sustainability and social and environmental sustainability, depends on its relationships with stakeholders (Fisher, 2019 ; Freeman, 1984 ; Friedman and Miles, 2002 ; Freeman and Philips, 2002; Patel et al., 2016 ). This is based on the understanding that different stakeholders have different interests regarding a company's activities (Dare et al., 2014 ). For that reason, stakeholder management is expected to ensure that as many stakeholder groups as possible are heading in the same direction. In the conventional view, because all stakeholders are equally important (Freeman and McVea, 2001 ), companies are required to treat all stakeholders equally by balancing the trade-offs between stakeholders, in their own interests (Patel et al., 2016 ; Phillips et al., 2003 ). This implies that it is essentially important for a company to satisfy powerful stakeholders' interests alongside those of its regular stakeholders (Belyaeva, 2015 ). Madsen and Ulhøi (2001)  suggest that an interactive process of negotiation and compromise with powerful stakeholders will provide a new temporary balance of conflicting interests between stakeholders, implying that the repetition of such temporary balancing will constitute a constant balance. Thus, the focus of the conventional view is to satisfy the interests of a broader group of stakeholders rather than of specific stakeholder(s) (Patel et al., 2016 ). This is reasonable from the perspective that if a stakeholder's interests are satisfied at the expense of other stakeholders, the other stakeholders will withdraw their support (Freeman, 2007 ). Following this conventional view, most analyses take a single stakeholder perspective (Patel et al., 2016 ). However, the idea that all stakeholders are equally important would impede the further development of stakeholder theory (Freeman and McVea, 2001 ). Indeed, many studies have found that it was not always the case that all stakeholders were equally important, implying that (only) powerful stakeholders' support is actually necessary for a company's survival and growth (e.g., Madsen and Ulhøi, 2001 ; Pérez et al., 2020 ; Tang and Tang, 2012 ). Powerful stakeholders are those that can control critical resources (Magness, 2006 ; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978 ; Ullmann, 1985 ). Clarkson (1995)  classifies stakeholders into primary and secondary stakeholders, defining the former as “one without whose continuing participation the [company] cannot survive as a going concern” (p. 106) and the latter as “[those] who influence or affect, or are influenced or affected by, the [company], but they are not engaged in transactions with the [company] and are not essential for its survival” (p. 107), which clearly implies the possibility of primary stakeholders being more powerful than secondary stakeholders. However, because stakeholder power depends on the mutual relationship with the company and/or other stakeholders, the power, if anything, is relative and not absolute (Eesley and Lenox, 2006 ; Tang and Tang, 2012 ). Henriques and Sadorsky (1999)  find that a perception gap concerning the relative importance of different stakeholders between more and less environmentally conscious companies supports this view. Thus, the magnitude of this relative power could determine the power relationship (Tang and Tang, 2012 ). This relative power could be based on a stakeholder's absolute power, legitimacy, and urgency (Magrizos et al., 2021 ; Mitchell et al., 1997 ). Of these, absolute power is the most important (Parent and Deephouse, 2007 ), and it can be divided into coercive (i.e., physical means), utilitarian (i.e., material and financial means), and normative (i.e., symbolic means) (Mitchell et al., 1997 ). It is likely that this absolute power is not equally distributed among stakeholders (Fassin, 2012 ). From this perspective, stakeholder theory should focus on the (socially and economically) powerful stakeholders. The idea that all stakeholders are equally important can be explained by other theories such as legitimacy theory, which considers stakeholders as a whole (Reverte, 2009 ). Thus, the greater the power of stakeholders, the greater the importance of adapting to stakeholder interests (Gray et al., 1995 ; Roberts, 1992 ). At the same time, the less powerful stakeholders can rely on the more powerful stakeholders to represent their interests (Fassin, 2012 ; van Rees et al., 2019 ). Otherwise, they could influence a company by mobilizing public opinion against its activities (Pérez et al., 2020 ). Thus, companies are expected to respond to their more powerful stakeholders by satisfying their interests regardless of the strategic or ethical (legitimating) purpose. However, not all stakeholders always have an interest in sustainability, meaning that the influence of different stakeholders (or a company's perception of the influence of stakeholders) on sustainability will differ (Plaza–Úbeda et al., 2009 ). Accordingly, if the powerful stakeholders have an interest in sustainability, stakeholder power could be positively related to the company's sustainability activities and accordingly its sustainability performance (Ullmann, 1985 ).  2.2 Who are the powerful stakeholders? Many studies have analyzed the influence of stakeholder power on a company's sustainability activities and performance. To develop the hypotheses, we review some key studies to identify the powerful stakeholders that potentially influence corporate sustainability activities to meet the SDGs. Bremmers et al. (2007)  focus on the difference between primary and secondary stakeholders, finding that primary stakeholders such as the government and customers are more influential than secondary stakeholders such as environmental organizations on a company's implementation of EMSs in the Dutch agrifood sector. Studer et al. (2008)  interview several stakeholders, finding that the influence of the government is fundamentally important in encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Hong Kong to improve their environmental performance. Nishitani (2009)  analyzes internationally certified EMSs and finds that the stronger pressure of foreign customers and long-term shareholders positively influences the adoption of ISO 14001 in Japanese manufacturing companies. Haddock–Fraser and Tourelle (2010)  focus on final consumers as a specific stakeholder and find that companies closer to the final consumers are more active in implementing environmental activities, disclosing environmental information particularly related to climate change. Tang and Tang (2012)  investigate the explicit power difference between stakeholders and a company, concluding that the power differences between the government, competitors, and the media influence Chinese SMEs’ environmental performance. Haque and Islam (2015)  examine the corporate climate change accountability in Australia and find that institutional investors and the government are recognized as the most powerful stakeholders. Bose et al. (2018)  target the banking industry in Bangladesh, finding that the level of green banking disclosures is positively influenced by regulatory guidance. Rashid et al. (2020)  analyze the influence of chief executive officer (CEO) power on sustainability disclosures in Bangladeshi companies and find that although CEO power decreases disclosures, this negative relationship is weakened by the influence of international buyers. Yunus et al. (2020)  focus on the perceived pressure from stakeholders on a company's decision to adopt carbon management strategies in Australia, concluding that the government, the media, and creditors are influential stakeholders. From this literature review, we have identified the influence of stakeholder power on a company's sustainability activities and performance to some extent, which supports the view that sustainability activities and performance are regarded as efforts to satisfy stakeholder interests strategically and/or ethically. However, the (more) powerful stakeholders vary widely across the studies, supporting the view that stakeholders basically have their own interests in corporate sustainability activities and performance. Therefore, if a company's sustainability activities were regarded as efforts to satisfy powerful stakeholders, the company would implement them proactively. Following this line of argument, because sustainability activities to meet the SDGs are advanced forms of existing sustainability activities, these previous findings are also expected to apply to the SDG context. Although there is a lack of studies addressing corporate sustainability activities to meet the SDGs, studies with a similar focus would support this view. Pizzi et al. (2021) , Rosati and Faria (2019a , 2019b) , Silva (2021)  and van der Waal and Thijssens (2020)  found that a company's SDG reporting practices were motivated by several factors, including legitimacy (i.e., all stakeholders) and institutional (i.e., the government) factors. That is, if a company's activities to meet the SDGs were regarded as efforts to satisfy powerful stakeholders, the company would implement their sustainability activities to meet the SDGs proactively. However, this literature review shows that the identification of more powerful stakeholders depends on the context. Thus, because a literature review alone cannot identify the more powerful stakeholder(s) that influence a company's sustainability activities, including those to meet the SDGs, it is necessary to do so empirically. In addition, although some studies have analyzed the direct relationship between stakeholder power and a company's sustainability performance, it is reasonable to consider that stakeholder power indirectly influences sustainability performance via activities, because it is unreliable for companies to improve their sustainability performance without implementing activities for this purpose. Indeed, previous studies support this view. Nishitani et al. (2012)  find that companies implementing the EMSs are more likely to reduce environmental burdens. Zhou et al. (2017)  find that companies combining material flow cost accounting and the circular economy concept reduce environmental burdens, conserve resources and energy, and improve their economic performance. Therefore, a positive triadic (not dyadic) relationship between stakeholder power, sustainability activities, and performance, i.e., stakeholder power → sustainability activities → sustainability performance, is expected.4  4 “→” means “positively lead(s) to”.   However, when identifying the contribution of this triadic relationship to the SDGs more precisely, we should also pay attention to the perception gap of powerful stakeholders between companies with or without a proactive attitude toward the SDGs, following the findings of Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) . This gap would ultimately affect a company's sustainability performance. That is, if sustainability activities to meet the SDGs are actually a more advanced approach, companies with a proactive attitude toward them are expected to improve sustainability performance more than others. Nishitani et al. (2016)  find that although companies implementing EMSs are more likely to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, those additionally implementing green supply chain management as a more advanced activity are likely to reduce them further. Their finding suggests the possibility that companies with a proactive attitude toward the SDGs are more likely to improve their sustainability performance further by implementing sustainability activities, i.e., stakeholder power → sustainability activities with a proactive company attitude toward the SDGs → further sustainability performance. In other words, we ultimately expect stakeholder power to influence additional efforts to exceed normal sustainability performance, whereby companies are expected to implement sustainability activities more proactively than ever to achieve the SDGs. However, we could not find studies of the relationship between stakeholder power and such additional efforts beyond the normal accomplishment of sustainability performance, as reflected in the studies reviewed above. Conversely, if there is no difference in sustainability performance between companies with or without a proactive attitude toward the SDGs, the sustainability activities to meet the SDGs can be regarded as greenwashing. From this discussion, it is possible to derive a hypothesis regarding corporate sustainability activities to meet the SDGs from the stakeholder management perspective. As noted, we focus on environmental activities, more specifically on EMCSs, rather than on sustainability activities in general. Before developing our hypotheses, we briefly explain EMCSs.  2.3 EMCSs An EMCS is a mechanism designed to guide desirable organizational activities, especially in their environmental aspects. Thus, we can say that companies implement various environmental activities by such mechanisms. An EMCS is rooted in an MCS. An MCS is a procedure and system that use information to maintain or alter patterns in organizational activities (Henri, 2006 ; Simons, 1987 ). The most frequently used MCS frameworks are Simons’ (1995)  “lever of control” and Merchant and Van der Stede’s (2011)  “object of control” (Guenther et al., 2016 ). Whereas Simons (1995)  emphasizes the strategic and formal aspects of MCSs, Merchant and Van der Stede (2011)  highlight the more comprehensive aspects (Guenther et al., 2016 ; Moilanen, 2012 ), and classify management control into categories of results (outcomes), action (behavior), personnel, and cultural controls. The former two are regarded as formal controls, and the latter two as informal or softer controls (Guenther et al., 2016 ; Moilanen, 2012 ). Therefore, an MCS is designed to support an organizational strategy or an organization's best interests (depending on the context). Because the concept of EMCSs originating in MCSs is new and underdeveloped, there is still a lack of uniform terminology (Guenther et al., 2016 ; Pondeville et al., 2013 ). Adapting Simons’ (1995)  framework, Pondeville et al. (2013)  define an EMCS as “a package of formal, information-based routines and procedures that managers use to maintain or alter patterns in organizational activities, specifically concerning the environmental aspects of organizational performance” (p.318). However, Pondeville et al. (2013)  also stress that it is necessary to consider not only the formal aspects but also the informal aspects. By contrast, Guenther et al. (2016)  argue that “the concept of […] EMCS provides a promising approach for integrating presently fragmented lines of inquiry concerning the internal drivers and managerial processes that may foster [companies'] environmental performance” (p.147). They draw on a comprehensive literature review of MCSs to suggest that EMCSs facilitate the effective integration of environmental issues into the development and implementation of strategy, aligning corporate decision-making and employee actions with environmental objectives and improving the identification of emerging threats and opportunities. This possibility is supported to some extent by scholars such as Norris and O'Dwyer (2004) , Rötzel et al. (2019) , and Sundin and Brown (2017) , who find that EMCSs can function as expected. Because these studies also suggest the importance of informal controls in addition to formal controls, more comprehensive EMCSs have an advantage over those with formal controls alone. As Guenther et al. (2016)  expect, an EMCS (as a hub for desirable organizational activities, especially the environmental aspects) may ultimately improve environmental performance while improving financial performance by translating environmental objectives into corporate activities. Although the number of studies that analyze the relationship between EMCSs and environmental performance is very limited, some show the existence of such relationships. Kokubu et al. (2019)  analyze the relationship between the implementation of EMCSs based on Merchant and Van der Stede’s (2011)  framework and environmental performance in Thai companies, and find that EMCSs improve resource efficiency and pollution reduction. Kokubu et al. (2019)  interpret four controls in Merchant and Van der Stede’s (2011)  EMCS framework as follows. The results controls have both financial and nonfinancial objectives, and they are used to define expected results and to monitor and evaluate employees' performance. Action controls ensure that the employees act in their organization's best interest. Personnel controls are applied to foster individual motivations, and cultural controls define expected norms and values. Because Kokubu et al. (2019)  also support comprehensive EMCSs, here we adopt Merchant and Van der Stede’s (2011)  framework, following Kokubu et al. (2019) .  2.4 Hypothesis development Based on the abovementioned arguments, we test the following four hypotheses.H1 Companies facing strong pressure from powerful stakeholders are more likely to implement EMCSs.  H2 Companies facing strong pressure from powerful stakeholders are more likely to have a proactive attitude toward the SDGs.  H3 Companies implementing EMCSs are more likely to improve their environmental performance.  H4 Companies with a more proactive attitude toward the SDGs are likely to improve their environmental performance more than others by implementing EMCSs.     3 Research design We first provide an overview of the SDGs in Vietnam as contextual information, and then introduce the research design. 3.1 SDGs in vietnam Vietnam proactively engaged with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the precursor of the SDGs, by implementing the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy approved by the Prime Minister in Document No. 2685/VPCP-QHQT in 2002 and Document No. 1649/CP-QHQT in 2003. This strategy helped to form the Vietnam Development Goals, which localized MDGs. They were based on the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for the periods 2006–2010 and 2011–2015 (Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2015a ). Until September 2015, this strategy yielded limited achievements in only three of the eight MDGs: MDG1, eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; MDG2, achieve universal primary education; and MDG3, promote gender equality and empower women (Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2015b ). Vietnam continued to face challenges on other issues such as inequality in the distribution of economic gains, chronic deprivation amongst ethnic minorities, and especially natural disasters and extreme climate events as well as the inappropriate use and exploitation of natural resources (United Nations Vietnam, 2016 ). To address these challenges, the Vietnamese government and the UN collaborated to create One Strategic Plan (OSP) to integrate the SDGs into the 2011–2020 Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS) and the 2016–2020 SEDP. The OSP focuses on four areas, shaped by the central themes of the SDGs—people, the planet, prosperity, and peace—along with nine related outcomes (United Nations Vietnam, 2017 ). In the coming years, the SDGs will be fully and further integrated into Vietnam's 2021–2030 SEDS and 2021–2025 SEDP (Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2018 ). With the support of the United Nations Development Programme, V ietnam successfully created the National Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda on SDGs (SDGs NAP). SDGs NAP proposes 17 Vietnamese SDGs (VSDGs) with 115 targets, compared with the 169 targets of the SDGs, although there are similarities and differences between the VSDG and SDG targets (Vietnamese Government Office, 2017 ). The VSDGs were approved by the Prime Minister in Decision No. 622/QD-TTg, dated May 10, 2017, and required engagement by various levels of government, ministries, sectors, localities, institutions, social organizations, the public, and other stakeholders to ensure the successful implementation of the SDGs by 2030. Overall, Vietnam has created a comprehensive legal framework to encourage the achievement of the VSDGs and SDGs, which included a SEDS for 2011–2020, a Decision on Approval of the NAP on Green Growth in Vietnam for 2014–2020, a Resolution on the five-year SEDP for 2016–2020, and a NAP for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda on SDGs. In addition, a Sustainable Development Support Fund was established to mobilize funding from the state budget, business investments, the private sector, local communities, and external resources including official development assistance, foreign direct investment (FDI), and other resources to ensure the implementation of the SDGs. However, the decrease in FDI and expansion of public debt in Vietnam (Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2015b ) present challenges to the achievement of the VSDGs. Moreover, Vietnam has developed a framework for monitoring the achievement of the SDGs. Among 186 indicators stated in the Law on Statistics of November 23, 2015 (No. 89/2015/QH13), there are 39 indicators to evaluate the implementation of the SDGs in Vietnam. Reviewing 230 SDG indicators, Nguyen (2017)  shows that 124 indicators are feasible, while 106 indicators are not feasible for reasons including the lack of a suitable basis, methodology, or inapplicability to the Vietnamese context. Reporting on the SDG process is considered to be a key element in their successful implementation. The General Statistics Office of Vietnam developed a Sustainable Development Statistical Information System for the public to engage in the monitoring process as a key mission in 2017–2020. In 2020, Vietnam proposed a Sustainable Development Statistical Information System for ASEAN that was approved by all ASEAN members. In October 2020, the ASEAN SDG Indicators Baseline Report and Online Database Portal were launched.5  5 https://asean.org/asean-launches-sdg-indicators-baseline-report-online-database-sdg-indicators  [accessed December 29, 2020].   Under these circumstances, Vietnamese companies embraced the SDGs; according to our questionnaire survey introduced in Section 3.2, 75.2 % of companies have incorporated or plan to incorporate the SDGs into their business targets (see the mean of “incorporation of the SDGs into business targets” in Table 1  ). It is expected that these government policies will play an important role in encouraging companies to implement sustainability activities to meet the SDGs. If we focus only on such institutional pressure, an approach based on institutional theory is an appropriate method of analysis. However, even if we consider the institutional pressure, we should analyze them from a broader perspective (including institutional pressure), because it is widely known that stakeholder (as well as government) management is key to the success of corporate sustainability activities (Goel, 2019 ).  3.2 Data The cross-sectional data used to test our hypotheses were taken from a questionnaire survey of 153 Vietnamese companies without missing values conducted in 2017. The questionnaire survey was part of the research program Policy Design and Evaluation to Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns in Asian Region,  conducted by the authors. The survey was administered to 1564 Vietnamese companies excluding those in the financial industry (i.e., the agriculture, forestry & fishing, mining, oil & gas, construction & real estate, information & communication, manufacturing, transportation, utilities, services, health care, wholesale & retail trade, consumer products, materials, or other industries) listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE), Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX), or Unlisted Public Company Market (UPCoM) during the period October 2017 to December 2017, and yielded 190 valid responses (12 %). The numbers of responses from companies listed on each stock market were 45 (13 %) from those on HOSE, 34 (10 %) on HNX, and 111 (13 %) on UPCoM (with the response rate of each stock market in parentheses). The numbers by industry were two (6 %) from agriculture, forestry & fishing companies, 12 (20 %) from mining, oil & gas, 11 (4 %) from construction & real estate, one (2 %) from information & communication, 121 (24 %) from manufacturing, two (2 %) from transportation, 35 (60 %) from utilities, and six (3 %) from services industries (with the response rate of each industry in parentheses). Companies were asked about their environmental activities (including those comprising EMCSs), environmental performance, current business operations, company characteristics, stakeholders, recognition of the SDGs, and similar topics.  3.3 Variables The descriptive statistics of the dependent and independent variables are shown in Table 1  and are defined in the following subsections. 3.3.1 Environmental performance • CO2  emissions  • Resource efficiency  • Energy consumption  • Waste produced  • Hazardous waste produced  • Water use  • Pollution emissions    The proxies for environmental performance are CO2  emissions, resource efficiency, energy consumption, waste produced, hazardous waste produced, water use, and pollution emissions. Each of these proxies is measured on a five-point Likert scale ranging from (5) “much better” to (1) “much worse” in response to the following question (we cut the relevant question out of the questionnaire (the same applies to other variables)).N) In comparison with average companies in your industry, how would you evaluate the performance of your company over the past three years in terms of the following indicators?1. Total CO2  and CO2  equivalent emissions  2. Resource efficiency  3. Total energy consumption  4. Total amount of waste produced  5. Total amount of hazardous waste produced  6. Total water use  7. Reduction of pollution (air, water, or land)       We consider that using these answers from the questionnaire survey as proxies for environmental performance is a second-best solution when objective data are unavailable.  3.3.2 EMCS implementation • EMCSs    The proxy for EMCS implementation is having an EMCS based on Merchant and Van der Stede’s (2011)  framework. This proxy uses the average of the constructed factor scores obtained from an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using the score on a five-point Likert scale ranging from (5) “strongly agree” to (1) “strongly disagree” in response to the following questions.H) Please rate the extent to which the following statements describe your company's response to environmental values and norms over the past three years.1. Traditions, values, and norms play a major role in our company's response to environmental management.  2. Our mission statement clearly communicates the company's core environmental values (i.e., the company's philosophy) to our workforce.  3. Senior managers communicate the company's core environmental values to our workforce.  4. Our workforce is aware of the company's core environmental values.  5. Our company relies on a code of business conduct (e.g., compliance guidelines) for environmental management to define appropriate behavior for our workforce.     I) Please describe the extent to which the statements below characterize your company's recruiting and development processes over the past three years.1. Our employees are carefully selected according to how well they suit our company's environmental values and norms.  2. Much effort has been put into establishing the most suitable recruitment process for environmental jobs.  3. Workforce training and development in environmental issues are regarded as very important.  4. Environmental goal achievement is regarded as an important condition for promotion.     J) What characterizes the relationship between superiors and subordinates (e.g., general managers or business unit leaders) who also have management functions for addressing environmental management in your company over the past three years?1. Superiors monitor and evaluate the necessary steps regarding their subordinates' achievement of environmental performance goals.  2. Superiors define the most important work steps for routine environmental tasks.  3. Superiors provide subordinates with information on the most important steps regarding the achievement of environmental performance goals.  4. Policy and procedure manuals define the fundamental course of environmental activities.  5. Subordinates discuss the necessary work steps for achieving their environmental targets with their superiors.     K) Please describe how the statements below characterize the relationship between superiors and subordinates (e.g., general managers or business unit leaders) concerning environmental management in your company over the past three years.1. Specific environmental performance goals are established for subordinates.  2. Subordinates' achievement of environmental performance goals is controlled by their respective superiors.  3. Potential deviations from environmental performance goals must be explained by the subordinates responsible.  4. Subordinates receive feedback from their superiors concerning the extent to which they achieved their environmental performance goals.       We use principal component analysis with promax rotation to extract all factors with eigenvalues >1, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin values > 0.5, communality values > 0.5, factor loadings >0.5, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients >0.7 in EFA. With these criteria, three factors were extracted. Table 2   summarizes the results for these items. Factor 1 consists of questions K3, K2, K4, J1, J5, K1, J2, J4, and J3, and captures the characteristics of action and results controls. Factor 2 consists of questions H2, H3, H1, H4, and H5, and captures the characteristics of cultural controls. Factor 3 consists of questions I1, I2, and I4, and captures the characteristics of personnel controls. The validity and reliability of the constructs were confirmed by a confirmatory factor analysis.  3.3.3 Proactive attitude toward the SDGs • Incorporation of the SDGs into business targets    The proxy for a company having proactive attitudes toward the SDGs is the incorporation of the SDGs into business targets. This proxy is measured by a dummy variable equal to 1 if the response to the following question is (1) Yes, and 0 otherwise, (0) No. S) Please indicate your agreement with the following statements relevant to the SDGs.2. Our company has incorporated or plans to incorporate the SDGs into business targets.        3.3.4 Stakeholders • Community  • Buyers  • Final consumers  • Employees  • Government  • Shareholders and investors    The proxies for stakeholders are community, buyers, final consumers, employees, the government, and shareholders and investors. These proxies represent the most important stakeholders in Vietnamese companies’ environmental activities. First, the most important stakeholders were selected by rankings in response to the following question.F2) Please choose the most important stakeholder in environmental management for your company from the list below.1. Community  2. Buyers  3. Final consumers  4. Suppliers  5. Audit committees  6. Banks  7. Shareholders/investors  8. Employees  9. Labor unions  10. NGOs  11. Industrial associations  12. The government  13. International organizations  14. The media, and  15.

The government        3.3.5 Instrumental variable • Senior management commitment to environmental activities    The instrumental variable that potentially influences EMCS implementation but does not directly influence environmental performance is senior management commitment to environmental activities. The instrumental variable is used for regressions to avoid endogeneity bias if the proxy for EMCS implementation is endogenous. Senior management commitment is like a prerequisite framework for environmental improvement (Govindarajulu and Daily, 2004 ). Thus, senior management commitment to environmental activities is expected to encourage a company to implement EMCS proactively. By contrast, it is unlikely that senior management commitment directly improves environmental performance. This instrumental variable is measured by responses to the following question on a five-point Likert scale ranging from (5) “strongly agree” to (1) “strongly disagree.”L) Please rate the extent to which the following statements describe your environmental decision-making processes over the past three years.1. Senior management is involved in environmental management.        3.3.6 Control variables • Company size  • Return on assets (ROA)  • Domestic market orientation  • Market competitiveness  • Manufacturing industry    The control variables that may influence companies' EMCS implementation and performance as well as their relative power in relation to stakeholders are company size, ROA, domestic market orientation, competitiveness in the market, and being in the manufacturing industry. Company size controls for the influence of size, measured by the logarithm of total assets. ROA controls for profitability, measured by net profit divided by total assets.6  6 The maximum value of ROA is 38.344. Although the sample with this value seems to be an outlier, the estimation results with and without this sample do not change.   Domestic market orientation controls for market type, measured by a dummy variable equal to 1 if a company's primary market is Vietnam and 0 otherwise (any other region or country). Competitiveness in the market is measured by a dummy variable equal to 1 if a company's market is competitive and 0 otherwise (monopoly or oligopoly). Manufacturing industry (which accounts for more than half of the sample) controls for industry-specific influence, measured by a dummy variable equal to 1 if a company belongs to the manufacturing industry and 0 otherwise (the agriculture, forestry & fishing, mining, oil & gas, construction & real estate, information & communication, manufacturing, transportation, utilities, or services industries). Regarding domestic market orientation, market competitiveness, and manufacturing industry, finer classifications seem preferable. However, in this case, the number of observations would decrease greatly in the estimations with discrete dependent variables.   3.4 Regression model This study employs ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the influence of stakeholder pressure on a company's EMCS implementation (treated as a continuous dependent variable), and a probit model to estimate the influence of stakeholder pressure on maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs (treated as a binomial dependent variable). In addition, we employ an ordered probit model to estimate the influence of a company's EMCS implementation on its environmental performance (treated as an ordinal dependent variable) with or without a proactive attitude toward the SDGs. However, in the analysis of the influence of EMCS implementation on environmental performance, an ordered probit estimation captures the reverse causality whereby companies that improve their performance are more likely to implement an EMCS if it is endogenous. Therefore, it is necessary to test whether EMCS implementation is endogenous. For this purpose, an endogeneity test was conducted as part of a conditional mixed process with a different two-stage least-squares approach using senior management commitment to environmental activities as an instrumental variable (Roodman, 2011 ). According to the result of the endogeneity test, because EMCS implementation is exogenous (not shown in the tables), an ordered probit estimation is the appropriate approach. We estimate the following regressions individually. First, the influence of stakeholder pressure on EMCS implementation is estimated as:(1) E M C S = α 0  + α 1  S t a k e h o l d e r s + α 2  S e n                + α 3  C o n t + ε ,    where E M C S    is EMCS implementation, S t a k e h o l d e r s    is stakeholders, S e n    is senior management commitment to environmental activities, C o n t    is the control variables, α 0 − 3      are the estimation parameters, and ε    is the error term. Second, the influence of stakeholder pressure on maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs is estimated as:(2) S D G s ∗  = β 0  + β 1  S t a k e h o l d e r s + β 2  S e n + β 3  C o n t + u ,  S D G s = 1  i f  S D G s ∗  > 0   0   O t h e r w i s e        where S D G s ∗     is a latent variable for S D G s   ; S D G s    is the incorporation of the SDGs into business targets, β 0 − 3      are the estimation parameters, and u    is the error term. Third, the influence of a company's EMCS implementation on its environmental performance is estimated as:(3) E n v p ∗  = γ 0  + γ 1  E M C S + γ 2  S t a k e h o l d e r s                + γ 3  C o n t + θ ,    E n v p = 1  i f  E n v p ∗  ≤ μ 1    2  i f  μ 1  < E n v p ∗  ≤ μ 2    ⋮     5  i f  E n v p ∗  > μ 5      ,    where E n v p ∗     is a latent variable for E n v p   ; E n v p    is environmental performance, γ 0 − 3      are the estimation parameters, θ    is the error term, and μ    is the threshold parameter to determine E n v p   . Finally, the influence of a company's EMCS implementation with a proactive attitude toward the SDGs is estimated as:(4) E n v p ∗  = δ 0  + δ 1  E M C S + δ 2  E M C S × S D G s + δ 3  S D G s + δ 4  S t a k e h o l d e r s + δ 5  C o n t + ρ ,     E n v p = 1  i f  E n v p ∗  ≤ μ 1    2  i f  μ 1  < E n v p ∗  ≤ μ 2    ⋮     5  i f  E n v p ∗  > μ 5      ,    where δ 0 − 5      are the estimation parameters, and ρ    is the error term.  3.5 Database To create the aforementioned variables, company size and ROA were obtained from the Bloomberg database, and other data were obtained from the questionnaire survey.   4 Estimation results Table 3   summarizes the estimation results for the influence of stakeholder pressure on a company's EMCS implementation and maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs. In Model (1), the effects of final consumers and the government are significant and positive. This suggests that companies facing strong pressure from final consumers and the government are more likely to implement an EMCS. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported, and it is clear that the stakeholders with the most influence over a company's EMCS implementation are final consumers and the government. In Model (2), the effect of employees is significant and negative, and that of government is significant and positive. This suggests that companies facing weak pressure from employees and strong pressure from the government are more likely to incorporate the SDGs into their business targets. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is supported, and it is shown that the stakeholder with the strongest (positive) influence over a company's proactive attitude toward the SDGs is the government. In addition, in Models (1) and (2), senior management commitment is significant and positive, suggesting that companies with senior managers who pursue environmental activities proactively are more likely to implement an EMCS and to incorporate the SDGs into their business targets. The estimation results of control variables are not discussed for the sake of brevity (the same applies to Tables 4 and 5   ). Table 4  summarizes the estimation results for the influence of a company's EMCS implementation on its environmental performance. In Models (1)–(7), the EMCS effect is significant and positive. This suggests that companies with EMCSs are more likely to improve environmental performance in terms of CO2  emissions, resource efficiency, energy consumption, waste produced, hazardous waste produced, water use, and pollution emissions. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is strongly supported. In addition, the effects of shareholders and investors are significant and positive in Model (6), suggesting that pressure from shareholders and investors has an exceptionally positive influence on environmental performance, in terms of water use via a path other than the EMCS implementation. Table 5  summarizes the estimation results for the influence of a company's EMCS implementation on its environmental performances with a proactive attitude toward the SDGs. All models in the table also include the variable of incorporation of the SDGs into business targets, and the interaction term between this variable and an EMCS implementation. For this reason, the coefficient for EMCS implementation indicates its influence for companies that do not incorporate the SDGs into business targets, the coefficient of incorporation of the SDGs into business targets indicates its influence via paths other than an EMCS implementation, and the coefficient of the interaction term indicates a difference between the degree of influence of implementation for companies that incorporate the SDGs into business targets and those that do not. The EMCS implementation coefficient is significant and positive in Models (1)–(7), except for Models (2) and (4). This suggests that even if companies do not incorporate the SDGs into business targets, they are more likely to improve their environmental performance in terms of CO2  emissions, energy consumption, hazardous waste produced, water use, and pollution emissions by implementing an EMCS. The interaction term between the EMCS implementation and incorporation of the SDGs into business targets variables is significant and positive in Models (2) and (4). This suggests that companies that incorporate the SDGs into business targets are more likely to improve their environmental performance, at least in terms of resource efficiency and waste produced, than those that do not by implementing an EMCS. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 is at least partially supported. By contrast, there is no evidence that companies that incorporate the SDGs into business targets are less likely to improve their environmental performance than those that do not by implementing an EMCS. Incorporation of the SDGs into business targets is significant and positive in Models (3)–(7). This suggests that companies that incorporate the SDGs into business targets are more likely to improve their environmental performance in terms of energy consumption, waste produced, hazardous waste produced, water use, and pollution emissions through means other than implementing EMCSs. However, because the influence of environmental activities of incorporating SDGs into business targets is already captured by its interaction term with EMCSs, the influence of this incorporation may capture specific company characteristics relating to the SDGs rather than that of other environmental sustainability activities. These estimation results indicate that companies with EMCSs normally improve their environmental performance, and pressure from final consumers and the government is a precondition for accomplishing this. However, if these companies incorporate the SDGs into their business targets, they can improve their environmental performance somewhat further, and pressure from the government plays an important role in this.  5 Discussion and conclusion The purpose of this study was to address the criticism that corporate environmental activities to meet the SDGs are simply greenwashing. To this end, using data on Vietnamese companies, we empirically clarify not only the influences of stakeholder pressure on a company's EMCS implementation and maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs but also the influence of EMCS implementation on environmental performance with or without a proactive attitude. The main findings are as follows. First, companies facing strong pressure from final consumers and the government are more likely to implement EMCSs. Thus, the stakeholders with the most power over Vietnamese companies' implementation of EMCS are final consumers and the government. This implies that they regard implementing EMCSs (or several environmental activities in the EMCS mechanism) as an effort to satisfy stakeholder interests in a strategic and ethical manner, which is consistent with previous studies of stakeholder management. On the one hand, EMCS implementation depends on a cost–benefit relationship, whereby companies can increase sales by showing consideration for the environment (Nishitani, 2011 ). Thus, it is reasonable for companies as profit-making organizations to adapt to final consumers' interests. For example, final consumers may put greater emphasis on a company's sustainability activities and performance to guide their purchase decisions (Wagner et al., 2009 ). Note that the final consumers are not always Vietnamese domestic consumers because the supply chain is globally dispersed, even if the primary market of many companies is Vietnam. In this sense, an EMCS is regarded as a tool of green supply-chain management (although discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this study). On the other hand, EMCS implementation is viewed as an activity to gain legitimacy. Thus, companies can gain legitimacy for long-term survival by satisfying final consumer and government interests (Haddock–Fraser and Tourelle, 2010 ). For example, if a company cannot satisfy final consumers, they may face a boycott (Handelman and Arnold, 1999 ). Moreover, not only business-to-consumer companies but also business-to-business companies need to satisfy final consumers’ interests, because they will influence any company through the supply chain. It is also possible that word-of-mouth reports from a final consumer might have an impact on the support that others give to the target company (Handelman and Arnold, 1999 ). Furthermore, the Vietnamese government has promulgated multiple policies on the environment, such as the National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change, and our finding supports the view that these policies indeed encourage companies to implement EMCSs. In this sense, legitimacy refers to “popular approval of government and governors, or at least acceptance of their right to rule; its effect is an increased likelihood of compliance with governmental rules and regulations” (Levi and Sacks, 2009 , p. 313). Otherwise, companies implement EMCSs to avoid future government intervention (Carroll and Shabana, 2010 ). In addition to pressure from final consumers and the government, senior management commitment to environmental activities is essential for companies to implement EMCSs (and incorporate the SDGs into their business as well). Even if companies face strong pressure from final consumers and the government, they may not implement EMCSs when senior management has little interest in environmental issues. Second, companies facing strong pressure from the government are more likely to have a more proactive attitude toward the SDGs. This suggests that the stakeholder with the most influence on the proactive attitude toward the SDGs in Vietnamese companies is the government. This can also be interpreted from the legitimacy perspective, and some possible viewpoints strengthen this interpretation. This finding supports the view that because the Vietnamese government has promulgated several SDG policies such as the OSP, SEDS, and SDG NAP in addition to the abovementioned environmental policies (see Section 3.1 ), these policies encourage companies to take a proactive attitude toward the SDGs (or incorporate the idea of the SDGs into their businesses). Another view is that because the concept of the SDGs is relatively new, government efforts may be initially required to spread them. This is consistent with another finding from our study, namely that companies facing strong pressure from employees are less likely to have a proactive attitude toward the SDGs; this implies that because the SDGs are still little known at the individual (employee) level in Vietnam, employees do not have a strong interest in them in the first place. Third, companies implementing EMCSs are more likely to improve their environmental performance in terms of CO2  emissions, resource efficiency, energy consumption, waste produced, hazardous waste produced, water use, and pollution emissions. That is, a company's EMCS improves its environmental performance as expected. These findings provide a new contribution to the limited number of studies regarding the role of EMCSs as a more advanced and comprehensive approach to improving environmental performance. Because final consumers and the government are the most influential stakeholders in EMCSs, this finding can also be interpreted to indicate that the stakeholder power of final consumers and the government indirectly influences environmental performance. Therefore, the interest of final consumers and the government would ultimately be in a company's environmental performance. Finally, if companies incorporate the SDGs into their business targets, they are more likely to improve their environmental performance, at least in terms of resource efficiency and waste produced, than those that do not by implementing EMCSs. Thus, corporate environmental activities to meet the SDGs actually work better than existing activities to achieve these goals in Vietnam. This limited additional influence might (at a glance) result from using the 2017 data for the analyses—that is, just the second year since the SDGs were launched—and this may be too early for Vietnamese companies to have gained adequate knowledge to put the SDGs into actual practice (van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ). Although this issue is a limitation of our study, the value of the finding remains valid for the early years of the SDGs. Because final consumers and the government are influential stakeholders in EMCSs, and the government influences the incorporation of the SDGs into business targets, the stakeholder power of the government is crucial in improving environmental performance. Given that the Vietnamese government has promulgated policies to achieve the SDGs, these policies will encourage companies to implement environmental activities proactively. However, it does not mean that the stakeholder power of government alone is sufficient; the stakeholder power of final consumers (and senior management commitment) also fundamentally influences environmental performance through EMCS implementation. This supports the view that our stakeholder theory approach is more appropriate to analyze a company's sustainability (environmental) activities to meet the SDGs than other approaches, such as the institutional theory and conventional stakeholder theory approaches. If a company's environmental performance is determined only by the cost–benefit relationship without policy restrictions, the level of environmental performance will be limited. This means that if the cost of further performance improvement exceeds the benefit, companies will cease applying EMCSs even if the improvement is practically feasible and socially expected. This is the limitation of EMCSs and performance (in Vietnamese companies) based on the cost–benefit relationship, especially when these companies are expected to conduct environmental activities more proactively than ever to achieve the SDGs. Accordingly, our findings indicate the possibility that the stakeholder power of government prevents companies making decisions based on the cost–benefit relationship alone, which suggests that the stakeholder power of the government plays a vital role in the environmental performance improvement. Otherwise, this view can also be expressed in the statement that decisions based on the cost–benefit relationship subject to the SDG policies and environmental performance will be improved by the new equilibrium point. Our findings thus support the view that corporate sustainability (environmental) activities to meet the SDGs (i.e., additional efforts to exceed normal sustainability performance) are more effective than existing activities in achieving these goals in Vietnam. Although we had some concerns about the potential greenwashing of these activities, they turned out to be unfounded, at least in the context of EMCS implementation in Vietnamese companies. With the proviso that pressure from government plays a key role in this additional accomplishment, we can refute the criticism that corporate environmental activities to meet the SDGs are simply greenwashing, or SDG washing. Indeed, the Vietnamese government as a more powerful stakeholder has adopted policies to achieve the SDGs that encourage companies to implement environmental activities proactively. In conclusion, the findings of this study provide some important policy implications for the SDGs, especially for developing countries such as Vietnam. When seeking a balance between the environment and the economy, a policy mix encouraging companies to take a voluntary approach is usually preferable (Arimura et al., 2008 ). However, our findings suggest that the voluntary approach alone is insufficient to reach the level of environmental improvement required to achieve the SDGs, and the SDG policies of the Vietnamese government compensate for this insufficiency. Therefore, government intervention to provide companies with motivation beyond economic incentives is also necessary, at least in the current SDG context, although this is not to negate the importance of the voluntary approach. Because this perspective is not consistent with the conventional view that government intervention to improve the environment is ineffective in Asian developing countries (Agamuthu et al., 2007 ; Ngoc and Schnitzer, 2009 ), the SDGs as political goals for which governments have primary responsibility could serve as a trigger for the government to reorganize environmental policies more effectively. This approach may be applicable to other (developing) countries with similarities in culture, economy, and politics. The study has some limitations that derive from the data collection using a questionnaire survey, such as the use of subjective measures and the potential of common method bias. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that a triadic positive relationship is influenced by the data collection to some extent. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of a questionnaire survey is an appropriate second-best solution in a situation in which it is very difficult to obtain objective company data, especially for developing countries (Nishitani et al., 2017a ). Another limitation is that the SDG variable is measured by only one question in the survey, which might lead to characterization of only partial features of corporate SDG involvement. However, this bias is unlikely to be strong in a context in which corporate SDG involvement is not mature. Furthermore, although an EFA provides procedures for determining an appropriate number of factors and the pattern of factor loadings (Fabrigar et al., 1999 ), the factors to measure EMCSs obtained from the EFA can intrinsically have multiple interpretations attributable to the items forming factors (Marjanen et al., 2016). Therefore, we adopted factors and interpret them following the accounting literature including Kokubu et al. (2019) , Latan et al. (2018) , and Pondeville et al. (2013) . However, because there is no general agreement on how to measure EMCS variables, there are also different variations and interpretations. Other proposed constructs should be discussed more explicitly from the perspective of the factor analysis, although this would be beyond the scope of a single paper. We hope that future research will explore this issue. Thus, despite some limitations, we hope that our study will encourage further research on corporate sustainability activities to achieve the SDGs.
