                  Modeling potential changes in flooding from urbanization enhances urban risk perception and supports decision-makers in preventative actions of high-risk areas. This study proposes a coupled multi-model framework for projecting the distribution and severity of urban floods and tests for Shenzhen City in China under multi-scenarios. The results show that the coupled multi-model framework has a high accuracy level at 78%. In Shenzhen, the flood-prone areas are more frequently found in the west and less frequently in the east, while the valley regions in the southeast are vulnerable to deep waterlogging. The growth rate of the inundated region slows down as the inundation depth rises after rainfall intensity exceeds that of the 20-year event. The projected results show that the flooding area and waterlogging disaster intensity (WDI) in each watershed in 2035 would be larger those in 2015. In the basins of Chi'ao Reservoir, Ejing Reservoir, and Guangming Farm in the Maozhou River midstream watersheds, the risk of the flood area expanding would be greater than the risk of the flood deepening. The findings provide a spatial reference for flood control and strategic urban drainage design and facilitate the achievement of sustainable development goal 11.5 (SDG11.5) in Shenzhen and other regions.

This study proposes a coupled multi-model framework for projecting the distribution and severity of urban floods and tests for Shenzhen City in China under multi-scenarios. The results show that the coupled multi-model framework has a high accuracy level at 78%. In Shenzhen, the flood-prone areas are more frequently found in the west and less frequently in the east, while the valley regions in the southeast are vulnerable to deep waterlogging. The growth rate of the inundated region slows down as the inundation depth rises after rainfall intensity exceeds that of the 20-year event. The projected results show that the flooding area and waterlogging disaster intensity (WDI) in each watershed in 2035 would be larger those in 2015. In the basins of Chi'ao Reservoir, Ejing Reservoir, and Guangming Farm in the Maozhou River midstream watersheds, the risk of the flood area expanding would be greater than the risk of the flood deepening. The findings provide a spatial reference for flood control and strategic urban drainage design and facilitate the achievement of sustainable development goal 11.5 (SDG11.5) in Shenzhen and other regions.

It has generated a lot of concern as a significant urban issue (Du et al., 2015 ; Rangari et al., 2021 ). Studies of urban flooding have focused on the factors that contribute to flooding and the evaluation of flood intensity (Roy et al., 2021 ), because an analysis of the main causes of the flooding process is required to drive policy recommendations (Zheng et al., 2016 , Sang and Yang, 2017 ). The increasing severity of urban flooding is primarily attributed to urbanization, which affects the natural hydrological cycle, and to climate change, which energizes the meteorological system (Hu et al., 2021 ; Sohn et al., 2021 ). There is growing evidence that land-use changes disturb natural water cycle systems (Du et al., 2015 ; Zheng et al., 2016 ), global warming intensifying extreme rainstorms (Woodruff et al., 2013 ; Rangari et al., 2021 ), ineffective construction of urban drainage systems (Kitsikoudis et al., 2021 ; Roy et al., 2021 ), and poorly constructed flood prevention infrastructure (Rubinato et al., 2019 ) identified as factors contributing to urban flooding. Among these factors, land-use change, which directly affects runoff infiltration and changes surface runoff production, sinks, and flows by changing the subsurface, is one of the most critical stressors in urban floods (Zheng et al., 2016 ; Hu et al., 2021 ). Based on land use, the urban flood process has been simulated to provide a spatial reference for flood mitigation and strategic urban planning (Poelmans et al., 2010 ; Wu and Zhang, 2017 ). Land use-based flooding simulations dynamically display flood extent and depth with a high degree of visualization and simulation accuracy (Walega and Salata, 2019 , Busico et al., 2020 ). Hu et al. (2021)  modeled urban hydrological processes using nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationships for different land uses, and demonstrated that a land use-based hydrological simulation outperforms previous results based on permeable and impermeable surfaces. Most land use-based hydrological simulation studies have considered historical urban floods as research objects for examining the response of hydrological processes to land-use changes and for generalizing the spatial characteristics of urban flooding (Yira et al., 2016 ; Hounkpè et al., 2019 ), while few projections of the spatial characteristics of future urban floods have been undertaken (Wu et al., 2017 ). However, projecting the threat of urban floods is urgently required to improve urban risk perception, facilitate a scientific basis for infrastructure construction, and minimize the damage caused by urban flooding (Lo et al., 2015 , Wu et al., 2017 , Kim and Newman, 2020 ), although the framework remains unclear. Accurate urban flood projection is crucial if the sustainable development goal (SDG) 11.5 are to be achieved (https://sdgs.un.org/goals ). Sustainable development goal 11.5 aims to substantially reduce deaths and economic losses from disasters, particularly floods, by 2030. In this study, based on the mechanisms of land-use effect on hydrological processes, a coupled multi-model framework for waterlogging projection was constructed to project urban waterlogging under multiple rainfall intensity scenarios at the watershed scale. In the rainy season from April to September, Shenzhen experiences frequent high-intensity precipitation and is subject to regular localized flooding; thus, urban flood projections are needed. Modeling the potential changes in flooding because of urbanization in the coming decades, particularly in highly urbanized areas such as Shenzhen City, will not only enable decision-makers to take preventative action in local high-risk areas but will enable such measures in other similar regions. This study attempted to determine the following: 1) the flood patterns in Shenzhen under different rainfall intensities, 2) waterlogging in Shenzhen in 2035, and 3) the accuracy and feasibility of the coupled multi-model framework for waterlogging projection based on the above results. These findings will serve as a spatial reference for integrated urban watershed management, which contributes to the control of urban flooding and the achievement of SGD 11.5.  2 Materials 2.1 Study area Shenzhen (113°46′–114°37′E, 22°24′–22°52′N) is a special economic zone in China and is one of the central cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area. In 2020, Shenzhen had a resident population of 13.44 million and a gross domestic product (GDP) of 221.92 billion yuan, with a 100% urbanization rate (http://tjj.sz.gov.cn/nj2020/nianjian.html?2020 ). Shenzhen is located in the south of Guangdong Province (Fig. 1  ) on the east coast of the Pearl River Estuary. It is dominated by low mountains and terraced hills, with coastal plains to the west. Shenzhen has a subtropical monsoon climate, with an average annual rainfall of 1933.3 mm. It is prone to localized flooding, short thunderstorms, and gales during the rainy season from April to September, causing considerable economic loss, severe damage and impacting extensive areas. For example, on May 11, 2014, Shenzhen was hit by a 50-year rainstorm (average daily rainfall of 218.6 mm), which resulted in 20 waterlogged areas, 10 secondary disasters and >2000 flooded cars (Meteorological Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality, 2015 ). Shenzhen Municipality issued the Shenzhen Sustainable Development Plan (2017–2030)  (Development Research Center of Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, 2017 ) to break through the bottlenecks of urban development, such as heavy pressure on resources and the environment. In so doing, it aims to further improve social governance capacity to provide a replicable development experience for modern global cities. The Shenzhen Sustainable Development Assessment Report (2016–2021)  (http://www.urbansdg.org.cn/szsdg.html ), released by a team from Shenzhen University, reported that Shenzhen's sustainable development status is at a medium-to-high level. To attain a higher level, urban drainage and stormwater runoff management were proposed by the government in the sustainable development plan (Development Research Center of Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, 2017 ). Moreover, owing to its high urbanization and flood risk, the study of urban flood in Shenzhen is considered representative. Fig. 1  shows the 57 secondary watersheds in Shenzhen.  2.2 Data sources Table 1   lists the data sources used in this study. A digital elevation model (DEM) was used to extract the hydrological analysis units of Shenzhen. The drivers of land-use change that were considered in the land-use simulation and prediction required collecting the following categories of data: DEM, land-use change survey data, soil type, GDP, population, transportation point-of-interest (POI) data in the Gaode Map POIs dataset and settlement and road data in the 1:1 million National Basic Geographic Information Resources. Under China's territorial spatial planning system, ecological land is strictly protected, thus restraining urban expansion. In the simulation, the ecological red line and basic ecological control line were used as restricted areas for land-use transformation. The predicted land use, DEM modified by building census data and soil data were used for urban flood prediction. The accuracy of the prediction results was tested with the flooding point in the rainstorm event on May 11, 2014 in Shenzhen (5–11 rainstorm event).   3 Methods 3.1 The framework for waterlogging projection To determine the impact of land use on hydrological processes, urban flooding under multiple rainfall intensity scenarios at the watershed scale was simulated based on projected land use in 2035 (Fig. 2  ). In this study, land use was projected using the future land use simulation (FLUS) model and waterlog volume under multiple precipitation intensities was projected using the soil conservation service (SCS) hydrological model. The urban flood distribution was simulated using the ArcGIS 3D analysis tool, which was implemented in Python using the isovolume flooding algorithm and dichotomous approximation method. Based on the urban flood depth, affected area, and watershed area, urban flood severity was assessed using two indices: average depth of the waterlogging area in the basin (ADWAB) and waterlogging disaster intensity (WDI).  3.2 Urban flood simulation 3.2.1 The SCS model The SCS model (Walega et al., 2020 ), storm water management model (SWMM) (Johannessen et al., 2019 ), hydrological predictions for the environment (HYPE) model (Tefs et al., 2021 ), the MIKE système hydrologique européen (MIKE SHE) model (Rujner et al., 2018 ), and other hydrological and hydrodynamic models were developed to simulate urban hydrological processes after heavy rainfall. The SCS is a watershed flood model developed by the USDA Soil and Water Conservation Service. It has the advantages of a clear mechanism, few model input parameters, and a high accuracy of simulated results (Shi et al., 2009 ; Chung et al., 2010 ; Walega et al., 2020 ). The SCS model has been widely used to manage soil and water conservation, urban hydrological problems, and waterlogging (Suribabu and Bhaskar, 2015 , Walega and Salata, 2019 ). The SCS model is based on the water balance principle and has two basic assumptions (Tyagi et al., 2008 ), which can be expressed as:(1) P = I a  + F + Q    (2) Q P − I a    = F S     (3) I a  = λS    where P  is the precipitation (mm), I a   is the initial extraction value (mm), F is the cumulative infiltration except I a  , Q  is the direct runoff (mm), S  is the potential maximum storage of runoff (mm), and λ is the initial abstraction ratio. In previous experimental studies, I a   was usually set to 0.2S  (Shi et al., 2009 ). Combining Eqs. (1), (2), and (3) , the equation for Q is:(4) Q = P − 0.2 S   2  P + 0.8 S    P > I a    0  P ≤ I a         (5) S = 25400 CN  − 254    where Q  is the runoff depth (mm) and CN  is the runoff curve number. The runoff curve number (CN ) is a unitless parameter that reflects the influence of human activity on runoff. Land-use survey data were intersected with soil data to obtain land-use data on different soils. The CN  values for land use on different soils are constants given by Shi et al. (2001) .  3.2.2 Water accumulation volume calculation The study area was divided into 1499 catchment areas based on a digital elevation model (DEM) to simulate the distribution of urban floods. According to the Outdoor Drainage Design Standard (GB50014–2021), the return period for rainwater drains in general areas of Shenzhen is one year. Therefore, by assuming that the drainage network in Shenzhen has a uniform spatial distribution and consistent drainage capacity, the maximum drainage rate was 48.96 mm hour−1  (rainfall intensity in the one-year event). Considering the flow production and drainage, the waterlogging volume in each catchment was calculated as follows:(6) W = Q − V   / 1000 ∗ A    where W  is the waterlogging volume (m3 ), V  is the drainage volume (mm), and A  is the catchment area (m2 ).  3.2.3 Simulation of the flooded area The maximum rainfall in one hour represents the rate of surface water storage under heavy rainfall and is a common indicator in flood risk assessments (Dunkerley, 2021 ). To investigate the changes in urban flooding with rainfall intensity, flooding in Shenzhen was simulated under five rainfall intensity scenarios, with rainfall recurrence periods of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 years. In a one -hour rainfall duration, the rainfall intensities for the 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 periods are 68.52, 76.92, 84.36, 93.12, and 99.48 mm hour−1 , respectively (http://weather.sz.gov.cn/zhuanti/guifanxingwenjianchaxun/201711/W020171109413396644529.pdf ). Owing to the high urbanization rate in Shenzhen City, the surface runoff direction and water ponding depth were significantly disturbed. A modified Shenzhen DEM was obtained by overlaying the house heights from the building census dataset to consider the influence of buildings on the production, sinks, and flows of surface runoff. Based on the modified DEM and waterlogging volume in each catchment area, the distribution of urban floods under heavy rainfall was simulated using the ArcGIS 3D analysis tool, which was realized in Python by the isovolume flooding algorithm and dichotomous approximation method. For comparability, the flooding in Shenzhen was classified as Level I (0.01–0.50 m), Level II (0.51–1.00 m), Level III (1.01–2.00 m), Level IV (2.01–3.00 m), and Level V (>3.00 m). The 5–11 rainstorm event, which is recorded as a 50-year heavy rainfall with time closest to 2015, resulted in a widespread flooding disaster recorded by 34 meteorological stations in Shenzhen, according to the Shenzhen Climate Bulletin 2014 ( Meteorological Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality,  2015 ) . For accuracy verification, urban flooding under a 50-year heavy rainfall in 2015 was simulated based on 2015 land use. Referring to Song et al. (2019b) , the simulation accuracy in this study was derived from a comparison of the 2015 simulated urban flooding under a 50-year heavy rainfall with the actual flooding points in the 5–11 rainstorm event.   3.3 Urban flood assessment 3.3.1 Urban flood severity in each scenario For the safety and convenience of residents, the depth and area of flooding are usually assessed separately in urban flood risk studies (Song et al., 2019a ). Some basins may be affected over a wide area but have a shallow inundation, whereas others are affected over a small area but have a large depth of inundation. The area and depth must be integrated to assess and compare the risk of flooding across all watersheds within the study area. Therefore, to investigate flood severity in each watershed under different rainfall intensities, the ADWAB, an indicator based on the extent and depth of flooding, was proposed for this study. This was calculated as follows:(7) ADWAB ij  = W ij  Sw ij      where ADWAB i   is the average flood depth of the i  watershed under the j  scenario, W ij   is the waterlogging volume of the i  watershed under the j  scenario, and Sw ij   is the flood extent of the i  watershed under the j  scenario. The ADWAB results were classified as Level I (0.01–0.50 m), Level II (0.51–1.00 m), Level III (1.01–1.51 m), Level IV (1.51–2.00 m), and Level V (> 2.00 m).  3.3.2 Urban flood severity in each watershed The total ponded water volume indicates the drainage pressure and determines the design and improvement requirements for the drainage network in each watershed (Song et al., 2019b ). However, the total ponded water volume varies with the watershed area, because watersheds differ in their catchment and infiltration areas. The WDI was proposed in this study to measure the annual flood pressure per unit area in each watershed. The WDI considers rainfall frequency, rainfall volume, flooding depth, flooded area, and watershed extent. The total ponded water volume within 100 years was divided by the watershed area and 100 years to obtain the WDI for each watershed. The formula is as follows:(8) WDI i  = ∑ j = n   W ij  × 100 / j    100 S i    × 10 3     where WDI i   is the annual waterlogging depth in the i  watershed, j is the rainfall recurrence period, n  defaults to 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100, W ij   is the ponded water volume in the n  watershed when the rainfall recurrence period is j, and S i   is the area of the i  watershed. The WDI results were classified as Level I (0.01–1.00 mm), Level II (1.01–3.00 mm), Level III (3.01–5.00 mm), Level IV (5.01–8.00 mm), and Level V (> 8.00 mm).   3.4 Projection of land use and urban flooding 3.4.1 The FLUS model Based on land use patterns, processes, and driving mechanisms, many classical models for land use simulation and projection have been developed, including the FLUS model (Liu et al., 2017 ), cellular automata (CA)-Markov model (Arora et al., 2021 ), logistic-CA model (Domingo et al., 2021 ), conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent (CLUE-S) model (Peng et al., 2020 ), and system dynamics (SD) models (Li et al., 2021 ). The FLUS model is a Markov chain (MC) - artificial neural network (ANN) - CA model (Liang et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2021 ). MC is a stochastic model that predicts a pixel's state at time t  by analyzing its previous state at time t  − 1 and is used to project land-use demand in the FLUS (Wu et al., 2021a ). Back-propagation (BP) -ANN is integrated to train nonlinear relationships between historical land use and driving factors and is used to evaluate the probability of occurrence of different land-use types in each cell (Liu et al., 2021 ). Based on these results, the FLUS model introduces a self-adaptive inertia and competition mechanism into the CA model to simulate and project land-use changes (Liu et al., 2017 ). Future flood models are generally generated based on future land-use scenarios(Janizadeh et al., 2021 ). The FLUS model simulates multi-scale land uses under natural conditions and planning policies in a top-down and bottom-up bi-directional approach (Liu et al., 2022 ). Because of its high accuracy, simple parameters, and operability, the FLUS model has been applied to urban flood prediction practice(Lin et al., 2020 ; Lin et al., 2022 ), where the land use predicted by the FLUS model is used to provide parameters for future rainwater catchments and infiltration for flood prediction.  3.4.2 Land use projection Future land use demand was analyzed using MC based on land use in 2010 and 2015. Considering the Technical Guidelines for the Evaluation of Resources and Environmental Carrying Capacity and Territorial Spatial Development Suitability  (Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China, 2020 ) and the high urbanization rate characteristics in Shenzhen, the natural environment and socioeconomic indicators shown in Table 2   were selected to evaluate the natural conditions and development potential of each cell. The probability of occurrence of different land-use types in each cell was obtained using BP-ANN to determine the functional points of ecological protection, agricultural production, and urban construction on a cell-by-cell basis. The control boundaries and protection lines for territorial development, such as the “three lines and one unit” ecological zone control scheme in Shenzhen, impose rigid constraints on the urban expansion (Han et al., 2021 ). To follow the ecological space protection policy in Shenzhen, a binarized ecological red line layer was inserted into the CA model as a restricted development area. The neighborhood weight in the CA model reflects the interactions between different land use types within the neighborhood (Li and Ye, 2005 , Liang et al., 2018 ). Neighborhood weight ranges from 0 to 1, with a value closer to 1 indicating greater expansion intensity. Considering the basic ecological control line management policy in Shenzhen, the neighborhood weight of construction land in the control region was set to 0.7 (Table 3  ). Kappa coefficients were used to compare the simulated land use in 2015 with the actual land use in 2015 to verify the simulation accuracy of the FLUS model.  3.4.3 Future urban flood projection Urban flooding is influenced by land use and land cover (Hu et al., 2021 ; Sohn et al., 2021 ). The projected land use in 2035 was intersected with soil data to obtain land use for different soils in 2035. Then, CN  values were assigned to land use on different soils in 2035 according to the parameters given by Shi et al. (2001) . The ADWAB and WDI of Shenzhen in 2035 were calculated based on the potential flooding pattern in 2035 simulated by the SCS hydrological model and the isovolume flooding algorithm in Python using the ArcGIS 3D analysis tool.    4 Results 4.1 Urban flood simulation and assessment in 2015 4.1.1 Urban flood simulation in 2015 The actual flooding points in the 5–11 rainstorm event were overlaid with the simulated flooding layers under the 50-year rainfall scenario in 2015. The observed flooding point locations were used for accuracy verification. If the actual flooding point was within the simulated flooded area, the validation result of the point was considered as match, otherwise it was mismatch. The SCS model and isovolume flooding algorithm are found to be comparable, with a 73% match in inundation points (Fig. 3  ). The flooded area in Shenzhen City gradually increases with rainfall intensity (Fig. 4  ), with more flooding in the west and less flooding in the east. As the rainfall intensity increases, a new flooded area developes at the edge of the original area and the water depth in the original flooded area increased. In each rainfall scenario, the higher the flooding level, the smaller flooding area. The percentage of the area classifies as Level I gradually decreased as rainfall intensified, whereas the opposite is true for the other levels. The flooded area increases from 18.35 km2  under the 15A scenario to 32.62 km2  under the 15B scenario, but it increases by 5.62 km2  from the 15D scenario to the 15E scenario. This shows that the rate of increase in the flooded area decreases as the rainfall intensified.  4.1.2 Urban flood assessment in 2015 Watersheds locates in the central and southeastern parts of Shenzhen had higher ADWAB (Fig. 4 ). Under the 15A scenario, severe inundation is observed in the watersheds of the Chi'ao Reservoir, Tongluojing Reservoir, Reserve of Luotian Reservoir, Honghualing Reservoir, Xili Reservoir, and Kuichong River, with the ADWAB reaching Level V. As the rainfall intensity increases, the ADWAB tends to increase in each watershed. Under the 15E scenario, the ADWAB of Luzui Basin in Nan'ao, Luowutian Reservoir, Dashanbei Reservoir, Jingdu in the Shenzhen River upstream, and the Jingxin Reservoir and Buji River watersheds reach Level V. Interestingly, the ADWAB in the Tongluojing Reservoir decreases with increasing rainfall intensity. The ADWAB levels in Shangyang in the Pingshan River downstream and Kuichong River watershed first increase and then decline after the rainfall intensity reached the level of a 50-year event. In the WDI results, the number of watersheds at levels I, II, III, IV, and V are 15, 14, 18, 6, and 2, respectively. The WDI is higher in the watersheds in the central and southwestern parts of Shenzhen, with the highest WDI values of 10.32 and 8.06 mm in the Xili Reservoir and Xinzhou River, respectively.   4.2 Urban flood projection in 2035 4.2.1 Land use projection in 2035 The simulated land use in 2015 is mostly consistent with actual land use, with a kappa coefficient of 89%. The FLUS model parameters used in this study are considered feasible for land use simulation in Shenzhen. By 2035, the areas of farmland, construction land, woodland, and wetland increase (Fig. 5  ). The area of construction land changes significantly, increasing by 83.13 km2  between 2015 and 2035. The rate of change in woodland and wetland areas is approximately 1%. The area of orchard, woodland, grassland, water, and bare land reduce, declining to 55.29 km2  for orchards. >67% of the bare land is converted to other land-use types.  4.2.2 Projected urban floods in 2035 In 2035, the flooded areas are 19.00, 33.45, 43.79, 54.54, and 60.04 km2  under scenarios 35A, 35B, 35C, 35D, and 35E, respectively (Fig. 6  ). With an increase in rainfall intensity, the area of urban flooding increases, while the rate of increase gradually slows. From 35A to 35B, the flooded area increases by 14.45 km2 , while the flooded area increases by 5.5 km2  from 35D to 35E. Among the rainfall scenarios, Level I account for the largest part of the affected area. With an increase in rainfall intensity, the percentage cover of Level I areas decreases, whereas the percentage cover of the other four levels increases. All watersheds experience flooding except for the Meilin Reservoir and Songzikeng Reservoir watersheds (Fig. 6 ). The inundation area under each rainfall scenario is widely dispersed, and its distribution is roughly consistent with that of 2015 (Fig. 4 ). The western part of Shenzhen is affected more than the eastern part.  4.2.3 Urban flood assessment in 2035 Watersheds in central Shenzhen have the largest ADWAB values. Under the 35A scenario, 64.91% of the watersheds has ADWAB values within 1 m. The largest ADWAB occurs in Chi'ao Reservoir with a value of 3.27 m. Under the 35C and 35D scenarios, the ADWAB value in the Luzui Basin in Nan'ao exceeds 4 m but is reduced to 3.8 m under the 35E scenario. The ADWAB levels of the Tongluojing Reservoir and Kuichong River watershed decrease with increasing rainfall intensity. The ADWAB level in the Shangyang in the Pingshan River downstream first increases and then decreases after the rainfall intensity reached the level of a 20-year event. The WDI values are larger in the western and northeastern parts of Shenzhen. The WDI values in the southeastern mountains are mostly within 1 mm and were less affected by flooding. Most WDI values are within 8 mm (Fig. 6 ), and only the Xili Reservoir and Xinzhou River watersheds have maximum WDI values of 11.21 and 8.11 mm.   4.3 Comparison of flooding between 2015 and 2035 With increasing rainfall intensity, the flooding area in Shenzhen in both 2015 and 2035 display an increasing trend (Fig. 7  ). Under each rainfall scenario, the flooded area in 2035 is larger than that in 2015. As a result of land-use restructuring, a larger flooded area would be likely to occur in Shenzhen in 2035. The flooded areas in the Level I class in 2015 and 2035 are almost equal, but the areas of the other levels in 2035 are larger than in 2015. Under different rainfall scenarios, urban flooding in 2035 is more severe than that in 2015 (Fig. 8  ). Interestingly, in the 20-year event scenario there are watersheds with an ADWAB in 2035 lower than that in 2015, including the watersheds of the Chigao Reservoir, Ejing Reservoir, and Guangming Farm in the midstream area of the Maozhou River. This is because the ADWAB is calculated based on waterlogging volume and the area of the watershed affected by flooding. As the intensity of rainfall increased, the ADWAB decreases when the rate of increase in the area affected by flooding exceeded the rate of increase in the waterlogging volume. Overall, the WDI in 2035 is slightly higher than that in 2015. The difference between the WDI in 2015 and 2035 is within 0.1 mm in 31 watersheds (54.4% of the total watersheds). However, in a few watersheds there is a significant increase in WDI values, such as the Guangming Farm in the midstream of the Maozhou River watershed (from 2.37 to 3.36 mm) and the Dashanbei Reservoir watershed (from 2.17 to 3.12 mm).   5 Discussion 5.1 The coupled multi-model framework for waterlog projection To achieve operational urban flood simulation and prediction using simple parameters, the framework integrates FLUS and SCS models. Under the framework, areas of urban flooding occurrence were visualized when cities experience different rainfall intensities. A modified DEM was used to quantify the effects of urban topography on urban rainwater catchment and flood generation processes. The DEM was modified based on buildings heights from the building census dataset, considering the alteration of precipitation, catchment and infiltration by urban buildings. In order to incorporate the effects of both natural dissipation and built drainage on the process of urban flood formation in the model, infiltration rate parameters were set according to land use and artificial facility drainage parameters were set through pipe network discharge. Additionally, the infiltration parameter values for different land-use types took into account the variations in the quantity and rate of precipitation infiltration brought on by urban impervious surfaces. Previous researches have incorporated the FLUS model for experiments on the possibility of flood occurrence (Lin et al., 2020 ; Lin et al., 2022 ), which demonstrate the good performance of the FLUS model in flood prediction. These studies offer a research pathway for predicting urban flooding in the future using the future land use projected by FLUS. Based on these research pathways, the coupled multi-model framework developed in this study integrates the entire water cycle of rainfall, catchment and infiltration to simulate and predict urban flooding. In comparison to likelihood prediction studies, this study improves the prediction of inundation by predicting flood depth and area, which is more instructive for practical flood protection initiatives.  5.2 Urban flooding in Shenzhen Flooding is an increasingly serious urban natural calamity that threatens both the development of the social economy and the safety of city dwellers. Urban flooding in Shenzhen was anticipated in 2035 under five scenarios of rainfall intensity based on the SCS and FLUS models.Urban flood risk increased with rainfall intensity (Motta et al., 2021 ), while the rate of increase in the affected area gradually decreased (Fig. 7 ). High vegetation cover increases the infiltration rate in the mountainous area of southeast Shenzhen (Wu and Zhang, 2017 ). In this region, surface runoff has a tendency to flow along the hillside and accumulate in the valley areas, causing large volumes of waterlogging (Wang et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the little section of southeast Shenzhen that experiences floods with waterlogging severe in depth is situated in valleys (Fig. 4 ). As a result, the watersheds in southeast Shenzhen have low WDI values but high ADWAB values. In contrast, the WDI is high in the central and western Shenzhen watersheds (Fig. 4 ). Urban planning, construction discontinuity and other factors have caused an uneven ground surface and water collection in the form of small but deep waterlogged areas in low-lying land in the older developed regions with a high building density, such as Futian, Luohu, and Longhua districts (Song et al., 2019a ). In particular, the ADWAB in the watersheds of Tongluojing Reservoir, Kuichong River, and Shangyang in the Pingshan River downstream do not rise with increasing precipitation intensity. The flooded area within these three watersheds occurs in the flat land, so with increasing rainfall intensity, the area of flooding increased at a faster rate than its depth. By integrating MC and BP-ANN, the CA model in the FLUS model was used to forecast land use in Shenzhen for 2035. The expansion of construction land in Shenzhen during 2015–2035 further replaced natural surfaces with impervious surfaces (Fig. 5 ). The increase in the area of impervious surface results in a reduction in rainwater infiltration and an increase in the waterlogging volume, exacerbating the urban flood risk (Shao et al., 2019 ). Flood risk assessment is thus the focus of current flood researches and usually assesses the area and depth of flooding (Wang et al., 2019 ). Taking into account the extent and depth of urban floods, we proposed the ADWAB to measure the flooding damage in each watershed under different rainfall intensities and proposed the WDI to quantify the annual flooding damage in each watershed. The ADWAB in 2035 is greater than the value in 2015, except for the Chi'ao Reservoir, Ejing Reservoir, and Guangming Farm in the Maozhou River Midstream watersheds, so the flooded area in these three watersheds increased at a faster rate than its depth in from 2015 to 2035. The flooded area increased in each watershed under all rainfall scenarios by 2035, and the WDI values in each watershed were greater than those in 2015, confirming that flooding in Shenzhen will become more severe.  5.3 Adaptation in the urban flood cycle Climate change increases the frequency of extreme precipitation (Cho et al., 2016 ; Lewis et al., 2019 ). To address the challenges of urban flooding in urban development under climate change, city authorities and residents should improve their adaptive and coping capacity in the urban flooding cycle (before, during, and after urban flooding) (Motta et al., 2021 ; Zhu et al., 2021 ). Scientific and systematic drainage system design and the provision of green spaces are considered effective measures to both prevent and cope with floods (Wu et al., 2021b ). Many countries have developed urban design programs to control urban flood risk by increasing urban resilience (Ding et al., 2019 ). Since 2015, the concept of a “sponge city” has been implemented in 30 pilot cities in China, including Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai. During high-intensity precipitation, natural wetlands and rivers in “sponge cities” infiltrate, retain, and accumulate surface water in green spaces, effectively reducing water peaks and mitigating flood disasters (Sun et al., 2021 ). In a rapidly urbanizing immigrant city, such as Shenzhen, resource allocation should be matched with urban expansion in marginalized areas to improve post-flood urban resilience (Song et al., 2019a ).  5.4 Uncertainties The FLUS model predicts urban land use based on existing environmental conditions and the predicted results do not reflect the impact of future climate change. Meanwhile, according to the Shenzhen Territorial Spatial Master Plan (2020–2035) (http://www.sz.gov.cn/attachment/0/794/794784/8858880.pdf ), the future development of urban surface space is dominated by urban renewal. Urban waterlogging will alter in diverse ways as a result of changes in the height and density of surface buildings as well as the reconfiguration of the urban subsurface drainage system brought on by urban regeneration. But this difference is difficult to quantify in the land-use projection. In addition, Shenzhen Municipality has executed the Implementation plan for the promotion of sponge city construction in Shenzhen  and the Plan for flood (tide) and waterlogging prevention and control in Shenzhen (2021–2035) ; these flood prevention policies will mitigate urban waterlogging, which is difficult to quantify in urban flood projecting. Relying on the DEM to mimic urban confluence processes, DEM data resolution and mapping errors may introduce uncertainty into urban flood simulation and prediction results. The increased runoff from outside the study area into the study area has not been calculated in the SCS model. Moreover, the framework provides a multi-scenario waterlogging analysis assuming a region under the evenly rainfall intensity, but urbanization, geography, and regional climate rainfall is not distributed evenly throughout space due to in reality. Despite these uncertainties, this coupled multi-model framework improves the projection of urban flooding to identify the extent and depth of future urban waterlogging. In future studies, the experiments will be repeated using different hydrological and land-use simulation models and the cross-comparison of these models will be carried out to improve this analysis framework, and attempts will be made to conduct urban flood simulations and predictions for other cities in China and around the world. The coupled multi-model analysis framework for waterlog projection will offer a spatial reference for strategic urban flood control planning, in order to reduce the number of deaths (SDG 11.5.1) and economic losses (SDG 11.5.2) caused by urban flooding.   6 Conclusions This study constructed an urban flood simulation model by integrating the SCS hydrological model and ArcGIS 3D analysis tool realized in Python using the isovolume flooding algorithm and the dichotomous approximation method. Then the spatial pattern of urban flooding in 2035 was simulated based on the FLUS model simulation of land use in 2035. The main findings follow.(1) Except for the Meilin Reservoir and Songzikeng Reservoir, all watersheds will experience sporadic waterlogging by 2035. Flood-prone areas will tend to be more prevalent in the west and fewer prevalent in the east. The central and western Shenzhen will suffer extensive flooding, while the valley areas in southeastern Shenzhen will be susceptible to deep waterlogging with small area.  (2) With the rainfall intensity increases, the inundation areas will expand. When the rainfall intensity exceeds that of a 20-year event, the rate of the flooded area expansion will slow down and the inundation depth will increase. Under each rainfall intensity scenario, the higher the level of inundation, the smaller the area under water.  (3) The flooded area and WDI value of each watershed in 2035 will be larger than those in 2015. In the watersheds of the Chi'ao Reservoir, Ejing Reservoir, and Guangming Farm in the Maozhou River Midstream, where the ADWAB values in 2035 will be smaller than those in 2015, preventing the flooding area expansion is a critical concern.
